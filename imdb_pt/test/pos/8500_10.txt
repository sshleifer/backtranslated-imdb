This kind of show should not happen on television. This is the kind of nervousness usually reserved for independent films. This is what only HBO should do. The fact is that Denis Leary has managed to reach one of the best television programs of all time, easily joining the ranks of THE SOPRANOS, OZ, ED, etc. Kudos, the ABC gang for showing that NYPD Blue was not a fluke. Mr. Leary and his class for creating a truly unique visual experience. My only complaint is that the show is not long enough ... one hour would be better, but I can not wait for the next episode!
