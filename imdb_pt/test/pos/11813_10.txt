The Cure is a fantastic film about a boy with AIDS. I cried about 4 times watching this movie and it's so sad. I can not promise that everyone will cry watching this, but it will make you want to. Very emotional and very sad, The Cure is a must-see movie. It shows the meaning of friendship and love and is an extremely good movie. At first, I did not think it would be so good and I wondered why my mother always cried watching. But now I know it's an awesome movie that's so original and it's so close to real-life situations, unlike most other movies it does not make sense. Words can not describe the greatness of The Cure, you just have to see it.
