Yes, you can look at the Babette party as a kind of slap in puritanical Christianity, but it's much more than that. The superficial story of how a talented Parisian cook flees from Paris after one of her middle-class revolutions and finds herself on the ground in Jutland in northern Denmark is simply the fat that allows the development of a deeper story. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist, one of the small army of people who are driven out of pillars to post over the centuries by foolish politicians, greedy and arrogant politicians who kill beauty for profit, something politics always does. the Arts, which simply institutionalize creativity for propaganda purposes. <br /> <br /> Babette is on her last steps when she arrives in the small village where two virgin sisters reside, seeing her diminished flock of devotees to her late father pastor. They live on cod and black bread porridge. <br /> <br /> Babette shows these simple and pious people that God is with pleasure and sensuality as well as with mental and behavioral purity. It also shows them how such mental purity can lead to the control of aberrations, something we all know today in the neo-authoritarian government that would limit our personal freedoms because they are in some way a crime against the state, or as they would say, mankind. <br /> <br /> Babette prepares a French dinner to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the late Reverend. The daughters and their flock think that it is the devil among them and swear not to notice the food or the drink. <br /> <br /> It is at this time, in the preparation of the meal, paid for the prizes of Babette in a French lottery, which I begin to tear. It is a poignancy brought in comparison to the daily vulgarity and falsehood that floods our consciousness from morning to night through the media and the power traffickers who maneuver to gain advantage over all of us here in the dark. <br /> <br /> The simple sophistication of the art of Babette spits in the face of all pretense in our modern society, and it hurts to see it work so well in this splendid movie. It is, along with Fanny och Alexander (Bergman), my favorite movie of all time, but I can only watch it from time to time because, like a rare bottle of wine served with Blinis and fresh oysters, this is something that should not be exceeded. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie that should be in the library of all movie lovers.
