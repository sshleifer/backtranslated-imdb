"Nobi" or "Fires On the Plain" is a film that is so excellent on so many levels that few good things can be said about it. My only regret is that I could not see this movie from 1959 any earlier. Being a film purist, I usually look at films for their artistic merits based on dialogue, acting, photography and even efforts to stay true to the period in terms of fantasy. Ultimately, I want to know if the film is "true" enough to reveal the human condition to make me think without being overwhelmed by what the director wants me to think. <br /> <br /> "Fires on the Plain" is a great film because it produces a portrait full of realistic human reactions to the fires of a major historical catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is a condemnation of war on every level - as any good war movie should be. The war is horrible, bloody, destructive. He is also a killer in the psyche. However, what is critical about "Fires on the Plain" is his unprepared look at Japanese soldiers. This shows them slowly collapsing under the weight of the superior American firepower and the inability of their nation to wage a war it creates. A fatalistic code encouraging death before surrender is at the heart of this madness. I was astonished to see such an honest and brutal view of the bitter fruits of Japan's military misery only fourteen years after the end. of what the Japanese call the "Great Pacific War." Ichikawa, reveals what the Germans call the "life of war", the situation of the common soldier. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is interesting, as Japan is still struggling to accept war fanaticism. , his subjugation of conquered peoples, the racism of his war against the Chinese, and war crimes which included the cannibalism of soldiers and officers practiced not only against each other but against allied POWs. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa produces a blatant depiction of the victimization of soldiers by a confluence of poor political decisions and cultural pressures. This rigorous examination is cleverly done portraying the condemned soldiers as human beings who exhibit at various times fear, brilliantly laconic humor, dialogue enriched by their scarcity, and a plot whose complexity is denied by the dark and wild scenery. The portrait of Ichikawa is an irregular and painful tapestry of defeated men. Tuberous Tamura, interpreted as a kind and gentle soul by Eiji Funakoshi, is a good soldier who can not abandon his humanity, though he is as frightened and lost as his companions. Before leaving for a hospital that will reject him as too healthy, Tamura receives a hand grenade from a superior who, recognizing the despair of his situation, advises Tamura to kill himself. <br /> <br /> Why is Tamura desperately ill? A military unit unable to be delivered was not ordered to surrender at the beginning of the film. Ichikawa makes it clear that the war is over and everyone is just waiting to die. As Tamura leaves his unit for his hopeless quest for physical and spiritual salvation, he sees his nonsensical companions digging an anti-air shelter. They appear as corpses lifting their eyes from the collective grave itself. <br /> <br /> Later, we see the overloaded hospital medical staff, abandoning dying patients to an all-consuming American barrage of artillery. Pathetic patients, who crawl from their huts in a vain attempt to survive, appear to be pathetic creatures and streamers crawling from an omnipotent force. You know they will not survive. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa makes it clear that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one who has lost his honor by abandoning his humanity and his companions. As Tamura staggers through the jungles of Leyte, we find the nobles, the dying, and the exploiters. Cannibalism raises its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat each other rather than surrender to American corned beef. When men speak of surrender, the propaganda of how Americans kill prisoners is nullified by a Soldier world that reveals that the approaching Americans feed and care for prisoners of war because, unlike the Japanese, they respect the brave soldiers who are forced to give up <br /> <br /> It is the Japanese who intend to die fighting for the emperor long after the resistance has lost all meaning. Those willing to fight to the death will be killed. It is the calculation of war. After firing on a killer and cannibal companion, to whom he had previously offered his own body as food, the careless surrender of the fatalist Tamura also seems to be an intentional form of suicide. His death is a solitary image. Ichikawa was trying to tell us about the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live but is still trapped by the suicidal cultural codes of his nation? <br /> <br /> If someone watches this movie carefully, he or she will see that absolutism and fanaticism are the enemy. Americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people willing to employ this technology in the form of inexorable military power - a lesson that has transformed postwar Japanese society. Ichikawa's film is not so shallow that it indicates America. Ichikawa points to the sedimentary layers of Japan's destructive policies that created the war and then continued it when all was lost. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa does not mention that nuclear weapons have fallen on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He does not need. The slow-motion destruction of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines reveals the seeds of the immolation of Japan.
