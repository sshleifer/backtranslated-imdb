Okay, Ghoulies 4 is kind of bad. And it does not even have ghoulies in it. And the acting is bad. The plot is stupid. But I forgot to mention how funny this movie is. It's so exaggerated and so ridiculous that it's too much fun not to like. There are only two villains in the movie, and they do not seem to really be related to the Ghoulies in the other movie. But they are very funny. And funny, that Jonathon Graves returns for this. If you saw the first one, he was a character in that. In my opinion, this is better than the first. There are some classic scenes and some classic lines, one that is in a grocery store. "Attention K-Mart buyers!" Check this out if you like bad movies. It's so bad, it's good. And did I mention Barbara Alyn Woods is hot?
