I went to see this movie not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised by the team of Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. It was a fast movie and the hour and a half passed quickly. This certainly will not win any Oscars, but it was a change of pace for Mr. De Niro. He's good at comedy. Overall I enjoyed it.
