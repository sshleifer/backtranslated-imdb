Like others who commented across the web ... I am a pilot of 130 in the Coast Guard. That said, and being the skeptic that I am, I've been waiting for the over-the-top cheese factors. There were some cheeses, but not all, not much ... and the film was very accurate. <br /> <br /> I watched the trailer again today. After seeing the movie yesterday, I realized that the trailer gives the impression that the movie is nothing more than a rescue after rescue action scenes. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The film is more character / story than action. The internal struggles with which Costner and Kutcher are dealing ... Kutcher's is more revealed than the Costner film. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a little love story ... there is no surprise. But most of the time, the film tells the story of two lives that come together and, after a while, help each other heal old wounds. <br /> <br /> As it seems, Costner and, as much as I try not to like him, Kutcher really works very well together and complement each other very well in the film. <br /> <br /> As critics have stated, you've seen all this before .. Top Gun, Officer and a Lords, etc. But what movie has not been redone a million times? <br /> <br /> I remember only one word being spoken ... and I can not remember any other language. <br /> <br /> The movie has more than 2 hours and for some it may take a while until the end. <br /> <br /> You will laugh, you may cry, but I can honestly say: it was worth the $ 4 I paid. <br /> <br /> Hope you like the movie.
