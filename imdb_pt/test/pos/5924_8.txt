1 watched 10/10/2009 - 8 of 10 (Dir - Billy Wilder): Spectacular rendition of the famous Lindbergh flight by James Stewart as Lindbergh and Director Billy Wilder. There really is not much background embedded in this story, but that's okay, because Wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from Lindbergh's perspective, since he used his book as the basis of the film. This initial movie about flying has to be one of the best about the act itself as well. Stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you an idea of ​​what Lindbergh did on this solo 33-hour Atlantic flight. And he made the entire flight without sleep the night before - which is incredible! There is a little story about how he bought the plane and got the funding, and some flashbacks about his life during the flight, but the movie is mostly about flying. The story is also beautifully made and photographed and it is a joy to watch, despite the age. I appreciate the fact that they did not play much fluff and just let the story count. Well done everywhere. This is a classic movie that must be seen by everyone.
