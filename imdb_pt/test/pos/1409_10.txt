It's a shame that this series has not been remastered and produced on video by Warner or some other professional cinema. <br /> <br /> Copies of most episodes are available, but are generally of low quality, being copies of copies of copies. <br /> <br /> From what I understand, 92 episodes were produced during its execution, but only 15 are noted here. <br /> <br /> Some of the writers of the series, like Richard Matheson, went on to become notable authors. <br /> <br /> Excellent series, well written, well staged and well produced. <br /> <br /> Michael Weldon, <br /> <br /> Udon Thani, Thailand
