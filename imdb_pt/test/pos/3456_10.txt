This is an incredible piece of drama and powerful that hits you. I found the film great and familiarizing myself with the deficiency of two main characters, this was represented in a great performance by Michael and Rory. Whether the story is based on a true story, I feel that the story was trying to convey to the public a message that, as a whole, the general public should respect and feel the needs of people with disabilities and should have the same opportunity as any another. human. Overall, this movie came to my soul and I also felt touched by the actors and the director sending creativity. The whole picture is that some actors take beyond their character the play and show only part of the character that is believable to the audience but I feel that these two theses certainly made a great use as talented talents to portray a drama masterpiece . Certainly not to be missed!
