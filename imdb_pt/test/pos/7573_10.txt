The finale of Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters was the best movie I've ever seen. The person in the story I most liked had to be Cassie played by Emily Osment. Just because of her energy and how she speaks her mind. For example, when Anna calls from town, Cassie wants to respond and she says, "Hi? Anna, guess what? Great dad was lost, but now he's back and he's not a good man!" I loved all the Sarah Plain movies and highs for my rating I think Sarah Plain and Tall was # 3. Skylark was number 2. The end of the winter was the 1st! If I could live in any family of the past I would have to be the Witting family. I think there are so many good parts in this movie that I can not name them all. I think they chose the best and most perfect actors to play all these people in the movie, so if you want to watch a movie from the past, I would highly recommend the end of Sarah Plain and Tall Winters.
