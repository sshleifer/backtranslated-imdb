Tim Burton is, in essence, an expressionist filmmaker, disinterested in character dimensions and obsessed by Gothic, incessantly opting for style over substance throughout his career. However, with his style being so poignantly endearing, I, like many viewers, forgive all the innumerable flaws that can be found in many of his films and become engrossed in art films that are essentially a hundred million dollars. <br /> <It's almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic, emotionally engaging spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise, especially when franchise audiences are 15-year-old half-idiots. Batman Returns should have been as commercial as its predecessor, guaranteeing box office raffles and (really, very expensive) excitement, being fun without ever truly enveloping your audience. If this had been the result, then Tim Burton would certainly have been forced to direct a third installment. Instead, Burton offers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase "out there." <br /> <br /> From the melancholy opening in which a high society couple plays a prison type bassinette containing their deformed newborn baby. on a river, of course Batman Returns, is no picnic at Buckingham Palace. Cut to thirty-three years later, during a political speech by thieves' business mogul Max Shreck (sinisterly portrayed by Christopher Walken), the Red Triangle Circus Gang attacks Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returning to the role) makes his first appearance by sporting a new logo, eventually saving the day. Shreck is soon abducted by the circus gang and sent to endorse the baby's political return, now a fully grown penguin man (Danny DeVito in horribly perfect makeup), whose motives for return are suspect only to Batman. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Shreck tries to turn off his nosy and clumsy assistant Selina Kyle (played perfectly by Michelle Pfeiffer who frankly deserves more recognition for her acting) who turns into the deliciously sexy and psychotic Catwoman in search of revenge and ports. For some inexplicable reason, a mortal revenge against the Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is bleak. The production design is breathtaking, delivering a Gotham City with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. Danny Elfman's score supports the film brilliantly, ranging from invigorating to tragic. The tone and direction of the entire film itself is intensely meditative, filmed as a sad nightmare, Burton's direction obscures what is just a diabolical script with a plot almost wholly irrelevant and at the same time perfect for Burton's visual style of making movies. And as Burton's action sequences fight for joy, the real excitement lies in the directional choices that show the fall of each of their main characters, the death of the Penguins, the Catwoman's mental state, and the lonely fate of Bruce Wayne . <br /> <br /> Warner The brothers hated this, while the critical and public reaction was mixed. After all, they wanted a sequel to Batman, not a strange and rather ghastly horror movie, in which a deformed psychopathic orphan tries to kidnap and drown a group of babies, vomiting all the time, which can only be described as green mucus . The producer wanted a public-friendly appeal, something for the McDonald's clan to promote their cheerful meals, not a movie of irredeemable characters, including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats that wake her up unconsciousness chewing on his cold, bloody fingers. <br /> <br /> It's easy to understand the massive deception that followed the release of Batman Returns. The movie never looked like a Batman blockbuster. It is questionable whether Burton actually knew who Batman really was or whether he cared for the character as much as cared about the film fitting into his usual haunting art direction themes and misunderstood lonely characters who rarely conform to corporate standards and expectations. That's why Burton failed to create a great Batman movie. He did however; create a nostalgic and dazzling piece of cinema that remains one of my personal and nostalgic favorites. <br /> <br /> This may not be a great Batman movie. But it's a great Tim Burton movie.
