I saw this movie at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. As I worked in the wine business, I was eager to see this documentary and I was not disappointed. Supposedly over 500 hours of footage, the good news is that Nossiter will be releasing not just a theatrical cut, but a ten-part, ten-hour series of the DVD movie next Christmas (ThinkFilm is distributing). The bad news is he's still a clumsy little bugger. When it was shown in Cannes, it was close to three hours long. For Toronto, he cut about half an hour, but still recorded in 135 minutes. Now, for me, that's fine. I love wine and I love hearing about the controversies that are happening in my business. We do not want much. <br /> <br /> Nossiter flies through the world, from Brazil to France, from California to Italy, through Argentina, talking to winemakers and public relations people, consultants and critics about the state of the wine world. . The theme that emerges is that globalization and the undue influence of wine critic Robert Parker are forcing a kind of sameness on wine. Smaller local producers are being bought by large conglomerates (American and local), or are being pressured by market forces to change their wines to please Parker's palate, which dictates the taste of most Americans (and the world). Markets. <br /> <br /> It's a tricky subject, and I can understand why Nossiter wants to let his affairs talk. There is Robert Mondavi, patriarch of the Napa wine industry, and his sons Tim and Michael, whose efforts to buy land in Languedoc have faced opposition from local vignettes and government officials. There is Aim√© Guibert, founder and wine producer of Daumas Gassac, an iconoclast opponent of Mondavi's plans and crossed by wines expressing local terror. There is Robert Parker himself, expressing some discomfort with his influence while refusing to stop writing about the wines he favors. There is "flying winemaker" Michel Rolland, consultant to dozens of wineries around the world, advising them to make Parker-friendly wines. There are many other fascinating personalities in this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you are a wine lover, you will want to look for the ten part series as well as the theatrical version of this movie. But even if you do not like wine, the film is an interesting example of how the forces of globalization are changing many of the oldest and most established traditions in the world. The effects on local cultures and economies can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> (8/10)
