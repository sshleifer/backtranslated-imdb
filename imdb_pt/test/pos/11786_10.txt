I just want to say that I was thrilled to find these comments on the show. I've tried online surveys to get information on the show in the past with no luck. I loved the show. I have difficulty motivating myself to exercise, but this show made it fun. As another reviewer mentioned, it was not as complicated as the routines these days. It was an ideal workout that did the job! I would give everything to be able to buy a copy of just one workout. I remember many of the movements, but not nearly everything. Someone, please try to get it back on the air and also make it available on DVD. It's so good to know that I was not the only one who loved this show! Thank you for making my day!
