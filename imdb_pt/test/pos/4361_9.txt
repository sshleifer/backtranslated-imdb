I had the opportunity to see this last night at a local film festival. Herzog introduced the film and made an hour of questions and answers. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliantly made "documentary"; Herzog later explained that he does not consider his films to be true documentaries, since facts sometimes camouflage the truth. Instead, he writes some scenes and improvises some to introduce a new element that may have been lost if he followed the original sketch of the story. <br /> <br /> Little Dieter, unlike Timothy Treadwell, is a real person you fall for. in love with; you feel for him, feel the anguish he feels. You admire the sense of humor and joy for the life he exhibited here 30 years after being taken into captivity by the Viet Cong. You are disappointed to learn that Dieter passed away recently. <br /> <br /> Like most Herzog films, the image is unbelievably beautiful, with a wonderful choice of background music. Especially a battle scene drawn from archives of the Vietnam War, but that fits into Dieter's plot. <br /> <br /> The core of the movie makes Dieter return to the infernal jungle where he was a prisoner of war and staged his journey with some villagers. Annoying for us to watch, I can not imagine what he felt when he was arrested again. <br /> <br /> One of the best films to describe and discuss the Vietnam War nightmare. It should serve as a lesson for all of us.
