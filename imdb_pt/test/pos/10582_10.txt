All right, let me explain ... Haggard is probably one of the funniest and most useless movies you've ever seen. It has a mix of a single plot about a guy having problems with girls and everything coming back to him mixed with countless funny scenes that will keep him laughing throughout the movie basically if you saw Jackass or the CKY series, you I know what to expect in the mood considering that most people have those movies. Overall ... I just had to give it a 10/10 because it's one of my all time favorite movies. <br /> <br /> ~ F0rs4k3n <br /> <br /> (P.S.) Haggard Rules!
