Movie noir meets anime ... brilliant! This was one of the highlights of Animatrix's amazingly inventive short films. This was one of my favorites, if not my favorite (I also loved World Record). This is basically a reference to those classic movie noir and 40's movie stories, except that it is lively and involves the Matrix. But by being excited, it is able to take the camera's extreme angles, the detective's lifestyle, the shadows and everything that is filmed noir to a whole new level. The Femme Fatale? Trinity. The detective in this story seems to be living in the 1940s in his mind but stuck in a modern world, and everything becomes too much for him when his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents when a mysterious black woman walks into his office. My note: 9/10
