Turns out I got the last 45 minutes of the movie, late at night, about 8 years ago. That wild and funny 45 minutes. I was absolutely knocked out by chase-out at the end that happens at night, inside an old hotel that is being demolished with a demolition ball .... Unbelievable. I remember vaguely from Stacy Keach, stealing a police car, pretending to be a cop and strong setting some drunks .... Wino to Keach "Hey, why did you hasslin us? ... Keach" It's my job. " They do not make them any more so. Great movie. The golden70's ... I hope he'll see the light of day as a DVD along with other lost treasures ... Hickey and Boggs being one of those.
