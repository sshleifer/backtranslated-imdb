This movie is a funny private detective story as if they were not made more. It's all there: Tom Conway is the soft detective named The Falcon, Goldie Locke (who is in a name) is his clumsy helper, Louisa Braganza is the damsel in danger and of course there is the maiden maiden, the teacher with the secret formula, the villain who wants the formula, and the police inspector standing behind the Falcon. There's a murder, and the Falcon gets involved. The setting is nightclubs, expensive hotel rooms, a luxury train, the suburbs and beautiful cars. Go see this little gem when you see spend on the afternoon TV!
