Five Fingers of Death: Although Shaw's earlier martial arts epics had shown the influence of the American cowboy genre, none of them had paid much homage to him like this, especially at the scene of the showdown. And although the Shaw Bros. movies had borrowed from the Japanese chambara genre (swordfight) before, none had done so successfully as this. I suppose part of this has to do with the fact that the director originated in Korea, thus bringing a non-Chinese perspective to such loans, which certainly raises some interesting questions about culture; but in any case, this film presented real innovations in technology and technique in action films from Hong Kong. For the first time in Hong Kong, the camera received access to the whole set, which meant photos from many different angles, such as the photo from a low angle showing the ceiling of a room (the original American innovation of which usually credited to John Ford ), or the high-angle long plane that allowed the viewing of a large area in the ground, or the frontal tracking shot. <br /> <br /> It is true that this was not the first melee movie real melee fighting film - it remains "Chinese Boxer" by Wang Yu; but on a commercial level, Shaw Bros. was right to choose 'Five Fingers' as his first major release for the West because, one might say, it was the 'least Chinese' of his action films, that is, the least dependent on purely Chinese theatrical traditions. Although this did not make any impression on American critics of the time (who universally destroyed the picture), it was not lost on the American public, especially among African Americans, whose culture has always been - by necessity - an eclectic patchwork of borrowed elements and innovation. In 'Five Fingers' they had the opportunity to discover the core of the story, the young serious forced to make the extra effort to overcome social barriers and treachery to have their merit recognized. This seems to be a universal question to Modernity, but each culture has its own way of expressing and resolving it; "Five Fingers" introduced it in a way that many Americans could relate to as well as Chinese. <br /> <br /> So the movie is now only of historical value? Certainly not. On the one hand, this issue has not gone away. Second, some of the innovations leave most of the film looking like today, as in the first release. In addition, the action is well staged and the presentations, although a little overwritten, are crisp. The film is a bit long, but the story covers a lot of ground. And there are wonderful pieces throughout the game, such as the confrontation in the hall, the fight on the way to the competition, the strange double finale. <br /> <br /> definitely looks better on a theater screen, but still impressive for viewing at home: recommended.
