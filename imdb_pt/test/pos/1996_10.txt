This film is the most impressive Turkish movie I have ever seen. Probably "Okul" is the first Turkish horror film. I must say I was excited to watch the movie because of some reasons, the first reason is that the story is impressive, I mean at the end of the movie you noticed all the details about the film, this makes the film attractive and another reason is that no Turk made such a film before. This shows that the Turkish film improves over time. Although the first trial to make a horror movie, was really successful. I advise all of you not to miss this movie ...
