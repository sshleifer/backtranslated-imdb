Again I must play something of contrarian. Most of Ab Tak Chappan's comments were extremely positive. Mine is positive, but only slightly. A 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a "C" grade of me. <br /> <br /> It seems that many of the accolades are rooted in two factors: One, that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood movie, and two, who is trying to do things differently. <br /> <br /> The first point I could not care less about. I'm not looking for realism in the movies so I do not make a bigger score for a movie that shows a story and characters closer to how I believe the real world is - I'm a big fan of surrealism, fantasy, absurdism and so on. though I do not detest realistic films just because they are realistic. <br /> <br /> For the second point, I agree that it is praiseworthy to try to do things differently. However, I do not think "originality" versus formulaicism makes a movie better or worse in itself. A film can be "original" and poor, just as a film can be stereotyped and excellent. What matters is how well the film does what it wants and how pleasant or aesthetically rewarding it is to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Ab Tak Chappan is based on the actual story of a Mumbai police officer named Daya Naik. . Naik was a "dating expert". Dating experts, who could be considered first instants of the real-world "Judge Dredds", are trained to operate as criminals and gang members who pursue, and are basically given a license to kill - effectively serving as a police officer, judge. , jury and executioner in a matter of moments. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar), the dating expert based on Naik. We see him working, interacting with his fellow dating experts and engaging in violence. We see him at home, trying to live a normal life in his less luxurious surroundings. We see him trying to fit a new "commissioner" in the middle of the movie. And we see his strange relationship with a notorious Indian gangster, Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare). <br /> <br /> All this has the potential to make a fabulous and brave movie. I agree that it is good to renounce the musical numbers and novels typical of Bollywood - not every movie needs these things; Ab Tak Chappan's producer, Ram Gopal Varma, is famous for leaving music and novels in the background or from the outside in many films he directed or produced. In addition, Ab Tak Chappan has some good performances - Patekar almost gives a vibe of Death Wish (1974) - it was Charles Bronson. It also has admirable cinematography - the hand material near the beginning of the film was particularly effective, for example. He has a great score that blends yet another Hollywood soundtrack / crime with traditional instruments and modalities of Indian culture. The violence is well done and courageous. <br /> <br /> There is also a decent exploration of subtexts, including the morality of (have) experts in dating, the idea of ​​following orders, and so on. Dating experts are shown largely divorced from ideas of right and wrong. More painfully, the film questions the merit of blindly following the orders. Parallels are drawn between meeting specialists following orders and, say, members of a country's armed forces, and we are shown what corruption situation this can lead to. But director Shimit Amin and his screenwriters have created a story with lots of characters, a lot of expansion, and that moves a bit too slowly. All of these problems may be due to Amin and crew looking at Godfather's films, which Ab Tak Chappan has some similarities (at least superficial), albeit from the perspective of a police officer. We do not know each other very well - these are superficially drawn characters to say the least, except for Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid) on the one hand, Narayan, I did not know who he was until at least halfway through the movie. mentioned several times, but I only got glimpses of him until the scene changed.Then everyone would change clothes when they showed up again and I would have to start all over again finding out who Narayan was. <br /> <br /> Same thing happened with the first commissioner of Agashe. The film was already far from the new commissioner before I could discover the connections. It seems like there are new characters in every scene. We never learned the stories of most of them. While this may have some artistic merit in that dating experts are killing people they do not know (because they are doing this mostly on requests), since we have not learned much about most dating experts, it is difficult to find characters with which to worry about, and this is not exactly an exciting film. <br /> <br /> The main villain is Zameer. But until about half of the film, there is no indication of that. He does not have much more screen time than the other villains who parade through the film, and he is literally "phoning his performance" - he is in another location (Dubai), communicating by phone only for most of the film. We do not see Zameer doing much. To some extent, the film depends on some "twists" that require Zameer not to show several things, but we can see him doing other things, and many of the other villains could have been left out. <br /> <br /> This would have tightened the film a bit, making it more focused and about half an hour shorter, both of which would have benefited its impact. This is not a movie full of action, by any means. For at least the first 45 minutes or so, I found myself admiring Ab Tak Chappan's considerable style, but saying, "Okay, go on with the story already."
