This is a wonderful new movie that is still being shown in theaters in my country. Its director, Calabrian Gianni Amelio, is in my humble vision perhaps the only contemporary Italian director, along with Nanni Moretti, to deserve to be called the great (that is, in addition to the old masters who are still out there and occasionally still producing films) . ). It is one of my biggest regrets that contemporary Italian cinema has been in difficulties since the mid-1970s, mainly because of an extreme lack of funding and the creation of new talent, something that can be transferred to most fields and that makes Italy a of the more static ones. industrialized countries of our time-wise production (both in an industrial and cultural sense) ... unlike, say, China. And that, among other things, is precisely the subject of the latest Amelio film. Few directors can speak to me about the current and true state of my country and the world, as Amelio can, but his paintings also have a precious timelessness and universality. And for those who are already worried about the fact that they can be slow, heavy and dignified - be sure: from those I've seen they certainly are not, at least not if you are accustomed to European quality cinema. <br /> <The basic outline of the plot: Vincenzo Buonavolontà is a technician in an obsolete factory of steelmakers somewhere in Italy, probably in the north. He is played by Sergio Castellitto, one of the most versatile and talented actors in contemporary Italy. When a major Chinese steel company acquires part of the industrial machinery of the Italian mill, Vincenzo, who struggles to make himself understood by the Chinese director who does not speak Italian, tries to tell him that the machine is defective and that his converter needs to be replaced . he is working on custom building himself. He warns that not doing so can have very dangerous consequences. Meanwhile, a young Chinese woman named Liu Hua acts as an interpreter between the two men, but seems to have difficulty finding suitable translations for some of Vincenzo's technical jargon. The Italian ends up losing his patience with her, virtually pushing her aside and asking her to give him the Chinese-Italian dictionary so he can do the translation. <br /> <br /> Despite Vincenzo's warnings, the next morning he finds that the director of the Chinese factory and his staff have returned to their own country without paying attention to their advice on the proper use of the industrial machine. Vincenzo, equipped with his great integrity, leaves for China. And here begins an infinitely fascinating road movie across China, a very current 21st century Odyssey through the Asian Giant. Marco Polo's search of the last days for the secrets of the mysterious nation? Not really. As in all of Amelio's films, the journey itself becomes much more important than whether its final "mission" is realized or not. In fact, the way the point is literally brought home, not without a touch of humor, is a charming and poignant paradox and irony that made my eyes fill with joy as I smiled simultaneously. The spectator reveals in the secret that Vincenzo's trip was completely useless, but he himself does not know, and goes home to a satisfied man, an innocent deceived. At least you think he's happy. More or less. <br /> <br /> The journeys that the characters of Amelio embark unravel and strip them down to the essential human. They are momentarily nameless, status or someone to put a word to them. These themes similar to Theo Angelopoulos are also explored in Lamerica, in fact my favorite movie of Amelio, followed closely by La stella che non c'è in order of personal preference. In the 1994 film, Lamerica, two Italian criminals travel to Albania to "do business". Like Vincenzo, they intend to go there, do what they have to do, and then go home. Instead, one of these two Italians accidentally ends up on a quasi-Homeric journey through this devastated land shortly after the fall of communism. <br /> <br /> But let's go back to La stella che non c'è: once Vincenzo is in China, he predictably discovers that the seemingly "simple" task of delivering the converter to its new owner is anything but direct. The new location of the machinery is almost impossible to determine, unless he embarks on an arduous journey through China. When he encounters Liu Hua, the young interpreter he mistreated working as a librarian, he tries to talk to her, but she reacts in a hostile manner, informing him that because of him, she has lost her job as an interpreter back. In Italy. Played by rookie Ling Tai, Liu Hua soon becomes Virgil for Vincenzo's Dante, when she reluctantly thinks she could do worse than acting as a guide and interpreter for the Italian on her journey (obviously for a consistent sum of money). This young Chinese actress may not have the beauty of Ziyi Zhang, nor the movie star of Gong Li, but her charming, expressive and handsome face overflows with a combination of defiant strength, intelligence, dignity and ironic humor that will hinder her characteristics. Forget when you saw the movie. In addition, she and Castellitto have a wonderful emotional chemistry as co-stars. <br /> <br /> Amelio weaves dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realistic and humorous all at once while maintaining a warm heart. ability to explore the fleeting essence of humanity in everyday, everyday circumstances. A natural documentary hides what is really a meticulously crafted tapestry of faces and places, a vision that can also incorporate a breathtaking beauty film. The photograph here is functional, but beautiful, as befits a film about the displaced in an industrial and emotional desert. The attentive eye of Amelio is adult, disillusioned, but also never cynical or misanthropic. . The magisterial camera angles also give Vincenzo a sense of alienation in the eyes of the Chinese, bringing home a sense of cultural objectivity and impartiality that is very rare in films about a "familiar" West exploring a "non-familiar" . I can not recommend this movie enough.
