This movie had everything I need in a movie: - Women, skateboarding, violence, music by H.I.M and Tony Hawk !!! the art and camera effects in this movie is incredible. The music in this movie is the best I've heard in any other movie. Each track goes so well with their scene. I thought the acting was very good, considering that none of Bams' crews had been on movie scripts before. While the whole concept of the film is the story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend (Glauren), who is sleeping with Hellboy in the back, it is a predictable and age-old story. Their way acted out is very unpredictable, for example: Falcone and the gas tank, Raab himself, Dunn smashing bottles behind the wawa and all the scenes of Don Vito. This movie is a must see!
