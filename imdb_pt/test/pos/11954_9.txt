Comedies from the 80's (especially those with John Cusak) are awesome. Almost all are hillarious and snapshot classics and this movie is no exception. Many greetings to other movies (eg, Godzilla and Jaws) throughout the movie that are so hillarious that you will laugh for hours. Some may complain that the film is a bit cheesy at times, but hey it was the 80's and things were always a bit extravagant. Play a young Demi Moore and a Bob Cat even louder and you'll have a laugh in your fans. If you have not seen this, you better soon !!!!!!
