At the front, if you're tired, the first hour may be slow. The creation of the story has a natural rhythm of leisure, without haste - giving us time to appreciate the type of daily life and the situations in which the main characters are. Once you've reached the climatic segment of history, the turn of events will keep you hooked: how will things happen, what will happen to our precious Fanda (portrayed to the complete and quiet perfection by veteran Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský) , as his wife (beautifully played by Stella Zázvorková) will treat him, what happens to the dear friend of Fanda Ed (played by Stanislav Zindulka - a correspondent helper of Brodský), and Jára the son with a hidden, blind selfish agenda to the kindness of his parents (sigh!) <br /> <br /> Vladimír Michálek sensibly oriented the film with humor sprinkles, preserving the insightful script of Jirí Hubac. Thanks to a clear legend, I was able to note from every 'claim' phrase that Fanda's wife pronounces, there is a hint of 'affection' appearing / buried between the lines - and so the judicious judge noted. Fanda is 76 years old and the warmth of her long-lasting marriage manifests even in her provocative arguments. His playfulness can be contagious. <br /> <br /> This is 'Growing Old Together 101' (at least) beyond the fifties, and lessons learned for sons and daughters do not take parents for granted. It may be necessary to rethink whether taking over the "home of the elderly" is a means to an end, so to speak. The movie is gently screaming for us to live life to the fullest while we can. (Hint: there is joy in staying and watching the final credits unfold). <br /> <br /> We are fortunate enough to be able to see an occasional Czech film. The Sverák ("Kolya") father and son of 2001 "Dark Blue World" was revealing with pathos. It is good to go slowly from time to time and enjoy a foreign gem - its captions, scenery, melodic scores and a human history engaging with elegant presentations. "Autumn Spring" (also known as Babí Léto) is available on DVD. Appreciate!
