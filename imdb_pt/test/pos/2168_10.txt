Black Scorpion is a fun movie about a female superhero who wears leather pants and drives a car that can turn into your Scorpion Mobile armored. She fights the evil Breathtaker and all this is a great recipe for a good time IMHO. I loved the little bit about her having to say "Yo" to get the car computer to take orders! Breathtaker is so mean that he wants to give the whole city to asthma! It's all so exaggerated and it's the beauty of it! The scene in which Black Scorpion "attacks" his partner steals the show. You'll know when you see it. This DVD also has a fun interview with Joan Severance. She is a Black Scorpion doll is a fun DVD. Loved it!
