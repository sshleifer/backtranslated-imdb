It is almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious critique of THREE COLORS: RED without letting people discover some of the ideas that Krysztoff Kieszlowski explored in the two entrances prior to this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think of them, and imagine myself in their world, the more I receive their theme: that we are more connected to each other than we would like to think of ourselves, and all that is needed is a bit of destiny to set some moving events. In BLUE, Juliette Binoche portrayed a bereaved widow whose plan to live her life unconnected with the past led her to find someone unexpected. In WHITE, an act of cruelty breeds an unlikely friendship between two men who will, in all likelihood, conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and to the full circle. And now, at RED, all elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply to the reunion of a young Geneva model and a retired judge who has a habit of meddling in other people's lives. <br /> <br /> This young lady is aptly named: Valentine (a bright Irene Jacob), who has that glow about her and even smiles openly while working the track. Not that she is without some baggage: she has an invisible boyfriend, who also demands to know what she is doing all the time, has a brother who bothers her and rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on her image. to a huge billboard. She attacks a dog while driving and breastfeeds her back to health, but when she takes her to the owner, a retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant), he does not want her. "I do not want anything," he coldly says, and BLUE elements suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man, who also lives in anonymity and apparently free-floating freedom, conducts surveillance on innocent people. This male version of Juliette Binoche's character in the first Valentine shock - she claims she can only feel sorry for him as she walks away in horror, but a chance event has back in place, and this is when it begins to reveal who he is and his great loss. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Kieszlowski is developing a parallel story: the story of a young man, Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit), about to become a judge and who lives on the other side of the world. Valentine's Street - but they still miss each other. Chance is the word. As Valentine win the jackpot in the grocery store history she visits, elements of chance pepper her life and Auguste. He has a girlfriend who also caters people with weather reports. One of them is the old judge. He knows more about her than Auguste, and he never knew her. As God, or Prosper, he is slowly creating a storm that will break the walls of the present state of conformity and bring new meaning to the expression "we meet again." It is this parallelism between the old and the young judge that makes RED so beautiful and transcendent, because time is actually much more fluid than we would like to consider it. There are people we meet in life that if we had been born in similar times, many things would be different. <br /> <br /> This is the case with Valentine and the old judge. I believe there is definitely a strong fraternity of souls uniting them in a strong bond: she is that woman whom he has not met - whether or not - and whether he knows it or not, trying to make amends. Hence, he runs the great risk of revealing his vigilance and becoming a social outcast. But that does not end there. One of the many links between the three films is the character of an old woman walking up to a large garbage container. Where Julie did not see her (and would not have helped her anyway), and Karol, fresh out of her public humiliation, scoffed at her, "Someone is worse off than I am," Valentine helps her. Weakness in need can happen anywhere, and Kieszlowski even applies it here in a minor character. <br /> <br /> Now, RED is much more than a story. Valentine, the old judge, Auguste, even Rita, the dog: these are not characters confined by the narrative. An American version would ruin the idea and market casual encounters and even bring a darned ending. RED is so devoid of a linear and defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have diverted in so many directions have had a crucial element that did not happen in the exact moment and place. The addition to the concept of characters that mirror, despite the deadlines or location, is the theme of sexual betrayal. This is also an important character-defining element in all three films: in BLUE, Julie's husband had a mistress and she also betrayed Olivier when it became clear she was emotionally dead. In WHITE, Dominique makes Karol hear her moan on the phone (which becomes an important device in RED) when she has sex with a man while Brigitte Bardot's CONTEMPT noticeboard notes. In RED, the old judge's tale of love and betrayal is re-enacted. And all this time, the image of Valentine's billboard hangs over them as an omen of what is to come at the same time that Rita, the dog that the boyfriend car beat, has seven puppies, renewed life for the six main actors of this complex trilogy obviously filmed care and love. Why do I say six? You will have to watch the movie and ask yourself.
