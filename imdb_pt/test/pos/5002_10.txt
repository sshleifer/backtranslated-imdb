"Who do you dream of?" Hoot Gibson ... Howdy Doody? I'm talking about * theater *! " [Harry Crystal] <br /> <br /> Nothing beats a great stage show ... nothing! And Harry Crystal lives that belief. A theater actor still waiting for his big break, Harry brings the magic of the live theater to a small town and to Artie Shoemaker (TOM HULCE) ... a young man who has big dreams (but just did not know until he met Harry) . <br /> <br /> With scenes and songs from many of America's classic musicals ... Those Lips, Those Eyes conveys the ups and downs of people who, for 2 hours, lead us to a land of fantasy. , but who manage to keep this magic alive in their hearts all day! <br /> <br /> Like Artie ... once you've seen Those Lips, Those Eyes ... "You're addicted, boy!" [Harry Crystal]
