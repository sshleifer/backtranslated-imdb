Beguiled is one of those films that are seen in the careers of a director and / or actor who ends up playing better than expected. In the same year that Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel collaborated on Dirty Harry, they also worked together on this little psycho-sexual drama set in the Confederate Civil War country. It's almost 180 of what "Harry" had for the public. Here is a movie that is under the radar, and with a low budget for almost no business when compared to what Dirty Harry pulled. It is also a story in which Eastwood is not surrounded in a world full of dangerous men, but women who, despite their first appearances, have darker sides to them. And there's even romance between some of the most difficult and complex scenes. But in this kind of structure to make the film, Siegel, in fact, has a little more freedom to do things with the style of the image that wanders into something more European; I am reminded here and there of Polanski's work in the 60s. Everything works out very well, even with the initial doubt that these two figures of male filmmaking (Eastwood, the obvious, and Siegel, who made his niche in B- noir and low-budget), they can produce material that could be made for a real-life movie. <br /> <br /> It was also captivating and really somber comic here and there to see Eastwood's performance working with these girls. He's doing something a bit subversive in his performance by still having Eastwood's kind of machismo - if there is anything like his movie clich√© - being one step ahead of this little school for young women sometimes and not others. Seeing Eastwood in a performance like this, as in Play Misty for Me (the other 1971 Eastwood play), shows how he can act credibly with great actresses. Particularly, here are the four main female characters, each with varying ages and each with varied attractions for her 'Yankee' man. While Siegel's work directing all actors has its moments in the first half, it is really because the story crosses half the dream sequence (less successful than the director could be) that the really succulent scenes begin to take . Much of this is the best that Siegel drove dramatically, pushing the psychological and emotional edges of scenes where he was not expected. <br /> <br /> It's a difficult movie, all this compliment apart, since he does not paint anyone. as being very respectable - only the character of Hallie, the service slave played by Mae Mercer, is kind of separated from what transpires between the over-curious women and McBurney. Along with this, Eastood here is acting in a role that is and is not what he is usually seen during this period of his true years of training in the movies. He's an anti-hero here, which was his trademark of the westerns and other thrillers he was making at the time. But unlike these films, he is not really in a way that he is "bigger than life," to put it some way, since he is both deserting and womanizing, deceitful and cunning even in his most charming moments and affable If it's not one of your best acting jobs, which is difficult to assemble considering your catalog, it's worth looking for fans who might want to see the other side of it. It's a credit to him, but also to what he clicked on with his collaborations with Siegel, since they both ventured into Hollywood right now.
