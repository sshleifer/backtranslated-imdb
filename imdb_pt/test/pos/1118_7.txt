Walter Matthau can always improve a mediocre movie, and this movie proves it. It turns into a very realistic performance as a small horse trainer and single parent, not the role of sugar coating. <br /> <br /> He can be, by turns, soft-hearted and loving, after iron hands. for his boys, and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training (we see that he does not want his young racehorse to be overloaded and hurt in small runs, but he seems to be willing to risk the horse) he get in the big time). <br /> <br /> This is just one of Matthau's wonderful performances, and one that I highly recommend.
