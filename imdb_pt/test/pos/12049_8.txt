The Shahrukh Khan and Yash Chopra films never disappoint. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic. Dil To Pagal Hai was cool and perfect to watch. Mohabbate√≠na remains one of my favorite movies of all time. And Veer-Zaara was magical. Darr, though not the best, is a romantic thriller that is different from the above-mentioned movies, but definitely worth watching. And SRK, who surprised me with an excellent performance in Baazigar, repeats an act of villain. And this time he gets an experienced Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol to support him. <br /> <br /> Before commenting on the acting, it is not only the acting but the wonderful script that makes it worth watching. It is the writing that complements the great performance. The story is exciting, but the characterization is what stands out. The comedy track goes well. But the film tends to change the romance a lot. The viewer is bound to lose interest and you will make a couple of yawns. But the movie is still good. <br /> <br /> Shahrukh Khan is brilliant in his role of author. Shahrukh Khan is once again understanding and cruel. You're bound to cry in the end. Juhi Chawla is decent. His screams are bound to become annoying after a while. But in the facial expression she is excellent. But her final scene is brilliant (though she was overshadowed by SRK). She has a supporting role that makes her very friendly. Sunny Deol is suitable. His character was very nice, but too perfect. And it gets annoying after a while. He does a good job though. Anupam Kher is really funny, but his role seemed a bit out of place. Tanvi Azmi supports well. <br /> <br /> The songs are nice and come on time. Tu Mere Saamne (You're in front of me) and Likha Hai (written here) are good songs of love. Darwaza Band Kar Lo (Close the Door) is a decent love song as well. The instrumental music is danced to perfection, just like the wedding song Solah Button. The movie may not be perfect, but it's worth your time, especially if your favorite actor is in it.
