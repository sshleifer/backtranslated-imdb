Disney's Buena Vista Pictures features a wonderful, fact-based sports drama directed by actor Bill Paxton. The photograph is superb, but the story sometimes creeps. This film is about 20-year-old amateur golfer Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) and his 1913 US Open competition. What a story; a unique chance for a young man allegedly unable to play alongside the best golfers of the day, including British champions Harry Vardon and Stephen Ray. A storybook ending leaves a lump in the throat. The cast also includes: Peter Firth, Elias Koteas, Marnie McPhail, Robin Wilcox and possibly steal the show is Josh Flitter, who plays Eddie Lowery, the caddy and best friend of Ouimet.
