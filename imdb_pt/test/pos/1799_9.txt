"Valley Girl" launched the career of Nicolas Cage and was an 80's version of "Romeo and Juliet". It is a definite example of a classic teen from the 80s. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have brilliant portraits in this film, but never will top "Fast Times in Ridgemont High" as the late 80s teen movie because if it was not for "Fast Times," then the 1980s generation of teen movies would just be a big blow to the head. That's sure.
