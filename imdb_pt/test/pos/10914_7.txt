Hollywood movies since the 1930s treat homosexuals as lepers. In condemning homosexuality, the film industry reflected only what the repressive society of its time adopted as ideology. For example, in Otto Preminger's 1962 melodrama, "Advise and Consent," direct actor Don Murray was cast as a queer congressman who commits suicide rather than confessing to his alternative lifestyle. Gay movie characters cover a lot of ground from "Counseling and Consent." In the 1997 film "In & Out" (** 1/2 of the total), heterosexual actor Kevin Kline is cast as a homosexual teacher coming out of the closet on her wedding day. While conservative Hollywood formerly stipulated that the queer congress in "Counseling and Consent" had to commit suicide, today's liberal Hollywood dictates that the gay English teacher should be embraced instead of maced. <br /> <br /> Basically, "In & Out" preaches good citizenship in the appearance of a politically correct comedy. Director Frank Oz and set designer Scott Rudnick endorse honesty as the best policy because honesty always guarantees happiness. High school teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline of "The Big Chill") will only be happy after he leaves the closet, as well as his fiancée Emily (Joan Cusack), who has been fat but now thin, will only feel happy when she can abandon her diet. Ultimately, the film holds that heterosexual society will accept gays when homosexuals can act with more honesty and openness about themselves. The gay and cheerful tabloid reporter played by actor Tom Selleck here effectively dramatizes this open-minded comment. <br /> <br /> Rudnick's light script embellishes the real-life incident that occurred at the Oscars when Tom Hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher. In "In & Out", Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a bimbo-styled blonde actor Brad Pitt, wins the Oscar for posing as a fruity infantryman. Drake honors his mentor Howard Brackett during his acceptance speech. Do not be content to stop there, the candid Cameron reveals to a live television audience that Howard is gay! Suspicion, paranoia and horror set in as the media descend on the sleepy town of Green Leaf, Indiana. (When would an unnamed sex offender of the English teacher cause such concern for the media?) Among these reporters Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck of "High Road to China") hides, and he wants to do an exclusive week on Howard. Howard, however, has nothing to do with the witch-hunter media, especially the cranky Peter Malloy. Howard denies Drake's gay accusations to everyone, including his fiancée and his mother. Malloy remains because he smells a spoon. The revelation turned the Green Leaf upside down. High school principal Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart) nervously irritates himself with all media coverage. Halliwell warns Howard that if his marriage was not imminent, he would have to give him a pink ball. Meanwhile, Peter bets on Howard that his marriage to Emily will fall at the last moment and he will be there to record the result on the camera. <br /> <br /> Howard uses audio tapes on macho men. He struggles to reform. But Howard's efforts are futile. Guilt increases within him. And then there's Peter Malloy, who cheats to reveal his homosexuality. Finally, on the altar in the sight of God, Howard explodes. Of course, future bride Emily Montgomery is criticized for Howard's gay confession. Predictably, the school dismisses Howard, but he appears for graduation. Drake also appears and runs into Brackett's defense. Not only did the school take Howard's job, but he also gave the teacher of the year award to someone else. Drake appeals to the director and Howard wins the unanimous support of the community. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in Rudnick's invented script is Howard himself. Rudnick has created a very simple character to be true, either by gray or straight. Howard Brackett looks more like a saint than a sinner. It helps a student enter college and trains the athletic team. How often do you hear about an English teacher being a coach? Everybody in your school loves Howard. It does not have an average bone in your body. Also, Rudnick and Oz ask us to believe that no one else in Green Leaf is gay. Where are Howard's gay friends? Are they too afraid to come to your defense? No, "In & Out" is not strictly aimed at the homosexual public. Oz, whose onscreen credits include funny comedies such as "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" and "House Sitter" as well as Rudnick balances on a politically correct tightrope. "In & Out" is not a gay recruiting film. The filmmakers show no interest in what led Howard or Peter Malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle. Instead, Oz and Rudnick are only interested in reinforcing a premise: is he gay or not? They involve you to engage the community's response to the response. Finally, when Howard admits he's gay, the filmmakers dedicate the rest of the films to show how a conservative city, such as Norman Rockwell, can accept it despite its difference. <br /> <br /> The most shocking scenes in "In & Out" is probably when the tabloid reporter Malloy blocks Howard. Heterosexual faces kissing in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as hilarious as they are fake. Kline and Selleck rub their faces together in what looks more like a frontal collision than a closed-mouth kiss. Nothing like the controversial British film "Priest", 1994, "In & Out" emerges as an engaging yet engaging social advertisement with its "okay-to-be-act" message. If "Ellen" was not the equivalent of TV, "In & Out" would probably be heading to TV as a new sitcom. Watching "In & Out" is not so much about dealing with the issue of gay or straight, but how to be a decent person in the last days of the twentieth century. What makes "In & Out" a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is equal opportunity that cheers and ridicules queers and oxen.
