This movie inspired me to be a better person. In life, you do not know who you are going to come across, and sometimes our prejudice leads us to misjudge a person in the wrong way. I learned to give a person the benefit of the doubt because of this movie. I also learned that hard love can build a stronger person. Now I want to know where to find the movie soundtrack. There are songs on this soundtrack that I've been trying for years. I can comment on the performance for a second. Jamie Fox was excellent. The man has risen to be the actors' actor. Also, Regina King's performance was incredible. If I can get a woman to look at me the way she looked at Ray ... I can only dream. I bought $ 18.00 for this movie and I do not have much money, but I'm willing to see this movie again and again. This movie touched me.
