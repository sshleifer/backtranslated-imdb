I'm lucky to have a good quality copy of my VHS on DVD so I can watch it several times. The characters are so well touched that I can not find fault with any aspect of the cast. OK, so there are some differences from the book, but the old clich√© of love conquering everything is so powerfully portrayed that it makes no difference. The reality of living in the countryside of the early 19th century in England is beautifully contrasted by the changing seasons from biting winter to glorious summer days and this is mirrored in the different characters from Prue's bullying father to Kester's sweeping love . A story that changed my life.
