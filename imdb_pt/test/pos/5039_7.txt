Angels are a bit of an American obsession, but they are often quite boring. They are the messengers of God, and also the angels of the bow are great warriors (Lucifer being the hardest and most handsome until he is cast out of heaven). <br /> <br /> So what happens if you do not believe in anything, let alone angels and you are sent to investigate an angel story, only to find someone with wings and less angelic attitude. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's what America needs, being Puritan is different from being good. Michael is a messenger from the rough, nasty, womanizing sky that will fulfill your desires, and will make you care enough about the world in which you will be touched. <br /> <br /> Funny, but not much, playing, but not overly sentimental, intelligent without being clever ... it's just a good simple little comedy. Watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.
