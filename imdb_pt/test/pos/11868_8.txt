One night, bar owner Randy (Matt Dillon) rescues Jewel (Liv Tyler) from his jealous boyfriend Utah (Andrew Dice Clay). He takes Jewel to his house. But Utah comes back and wants Randy to open the safe at Mc Cool's. Suddenly, one shot - Utah is dead. So ... I'd better stop here to tell the plot. This is like explaining the story of "wild things". What I found so interesting was the fact that the plot (written by Stan Seidel, his first and last work - he died in July last year ...) was told from three perspectives - the three men who fall in love with Jewel. They all see her with different eyes - like John Goodman as the detective, who fondly falls in love with her for being reminded of her dead wife ... <br /> <br /> No wonder the guys fall in love with her . ! Liv Tyler - she's a real gem. She made the big screen shine! She played her part as if she were in a 40-year-old thriller. Sweet - but at the same time she was the cool vamp who walks over the dead body and uses men for her needs. And, of course, Michael Douglas. How could I forget him? Mr. Burmeister, the bingo killer - he was really cool! <br /> <br /> But in the last 10 minutes there was a bit of a slapstick too much for my liking - it weakened the atmosphere. That part began when Paul Reiser (Carlson's cousin, Carl) donned his leather dress for Jewel. The "YMCA" -song did not fit much here ... ... but in all, "A Night at Mc Cool's" is a very cool parody of movie-noir! <br /> <br />
