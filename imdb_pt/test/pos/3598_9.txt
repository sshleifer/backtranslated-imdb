Forget all the people who say it is not as good as the book. And? This is a movie after all. It is a pure joy to watch, made entirely on location in Cephallonia, stunning photography, but with dark and disturbing moments as well. The only problem I have is with the obvious miscastification of Nicolas Cage as Captain Corelli. Also, the film was a very pleasant surprise.
