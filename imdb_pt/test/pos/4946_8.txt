Compared to the competition, soul calibur 3 is a god between games - a true work of art. However, compared to its 128-bit predecessors, the latest in namcos superior slash in up series is more ambitious, its attempts to improve perfection are not successful. <br /> <br /> There are new game modes and settings that I recommend trying to elevate the series to new heights, but they just complicate things. Examples? Well, the character-creation mode is a great idea in theory, but it's actually full of restrictions and not as customizable as found in wwe games for example. The sword-mode chronicles are fun and thought-provoking for a while, but eventually creep and seem like a chore to make money rather than a genuinely fun game. Also, the tale mode of souls, which is basically the arcade mode with little bits of inconsequential story and pieces of QTR style shenmue played really feels slow. <br /> <br /> "OMG !!! YOU do not know what you SaYiNg" is probably what the most zealous of you are thinking, but do not understand it - I do not hate this game - this game is great! There's still this classic game (though some character movements have been unnecessarily altered), absolutely stunning graphics and the epic soundtrack by which games are known. And also on the good side of things are the new characters (particularly zasalamel), who are all cool in their own way (except setsuka-yeah, I know I'm talking about it). <br /> <br /> It's just that compared to the soul calibur 1 and 2 seems like it's trying to be so much more than it really is. That does not mean it's not a classic, it just means that, compared to his own high standards, he's a bit short, despite having more stages of character movement and better graphics than ever before. <br /> <br /> Still, soul calibur 3 cleans the floor with 95% of the games out there - and that counts for something! Oh, and all those who mark this review as "useless" clearly feel hurt because I have insulted their dear Setsuka. Well, listen to fanboy / girl: she's not real! And even if she was, she would not be caught dead with you.
