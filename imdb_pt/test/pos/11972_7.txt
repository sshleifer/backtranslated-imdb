I love dogs, and the most interesting character in this movie is a Golden Retriever. He is smarter, more handsome, and more interesting than any of the human characters. Like many other contributors, I did not read the book, but I doubt doing that would change my view of the movie. It is predictable from the first five minutes onwards. No surprises. Crazy scientists create a loosening monster and a teenage boy and wonder dog collaborate to destroy it. All in all the movie is a dog. But like I said, I love dogs and so I'll give this movie a 7/10 grade. Watch if you come on TV, rent it if you're bored and nothing else catches your eye, but do not buy it unless it's special.
