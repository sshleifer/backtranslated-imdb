I must admit, at first I was worried about Farscape. The opening segment was not very strong and I began to worry about what was to come. However, once he settled in Henson's familiar territory with the ironic sense of humor, the unique and enduring characters, and compelling storyline combined to create an excellent piece of science fiction. The story follows John Crichton (played by Ben Browder), a scientist who developed a spaceship and a theory that depend on the propulsion of the slingshot. However, during his first test, his ship encounters an unknown magnetic field, and it is propelled into an unknown galaxy where he finds himself in the midst of a fight between fugitive prisoners (on Moya's starship) and the Peacemakers (human agents) . . He is literally drawn to the prisoner ship, and after many twists and turns he is united with the prisoners (Ka D'argo, a warrior of Luxom, Pa'U Zhaan, a priestess of Delvian, Rygel XVI, a deposed ruler; and Aeryn Sun, a peacemaker who joined the crew reluctantly). With excellent special effects, moderate make-up and puppets and robots that exceed Henson's standard of perfection; plus a well-written storyline and character-based storyline, FarScape appears to be a fantastically original, creative, and intelligent science fiction series.
