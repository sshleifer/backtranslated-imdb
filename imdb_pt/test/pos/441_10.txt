"French Cancan" is one of my all time favorite movies. It's a great movie. There is color, humor, music. It is a very good portrait of the call Belle Ã‰poque, although Jean Renoir's priorities have always been to show a creation, a fantasie. So the film is not a historical movie. The final sequences in which girls dance can be unforgettable images. It's a movie you should not miss.
