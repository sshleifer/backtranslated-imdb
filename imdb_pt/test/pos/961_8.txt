Who said it had to be believable? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before sitting down to watch this movie. You will enjoy the experience so much more. You'll find yourself forgiving some of the strangest set-ups in the movie, and simply accepting what it is - a great family movie. I appreciated not having to worry about "questionable elements" in a children's movie at least once. That, for me, is worth the price of admission. And manages to maintain integrity without being obvious - older chidlren will enjoy this movie. Quite good mood to keep the adults interested. Very good movie.
