Soft spoilers <br /> <br /> .... and that's 'top ten of all time.' I stumbled into 'Two Hands' by accident (maybe this made it all even more special - no bloated expectations) at IFC one night, and could not believe I had not heard anything about it. Now that Heath Ledger is getting more famous in the US, I'm sure he's more available. At the time, I was telling friends about the movie, and no one could find it anywhere except the occasional IFC exhibition. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the black-comedy / gangster genre it fits well with my other favorites, and everyone in the movie really seems to end up with what they deserve. Bryan Brown is hilarious as the main gangster who does origami with his little son and plays with his henchmen. It is also hilarious the fast-editing destination of a random car thief. Even Heath was very good at it. At the time, I vaguely remembered him from a short Fox series called "Roar." I hope Gregor Jordan makes another success, but as far as I'm concerned, this is the best of them all.
