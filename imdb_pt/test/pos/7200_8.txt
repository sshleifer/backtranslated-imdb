After reading that "At the time of its launch in 2002, its budget of $ 47 million, or FRF 327,000,000, was considered the most expensive French film of all time. However, Astérix et Obélix contre César (1999) had a budget of $ 48 million, or FRF 274,620,000, which supposedly made it the most expensive French film of all time. "I found the reason why I found this film one of the most beautiful and colorful of everything I've ever seen. I loved the scenery, the clothes (especially those of Cleopatra) and the atmosphere of the movie! It is so happy and joyful! I found the jokes clever and hilarious and I have to consider this movie in my favorite comedies of all time! The cast is also excellent, with Monica Bellucci (who is very pretty as Cleopatra) Gérard Depardieu, (great Obelix !! Christian Clavier, Jamel Debbouze (Who I first saw in '' Amélie Poulain '))! <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie even for people who do not know comics of Asterix and Obelix. You will have lots of fun! :) <br /> <br /> "Asterix and Obelix: Cleopatra's Mission" - USA
