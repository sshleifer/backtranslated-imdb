SPOILERS BELOW <br /> <br /> The life of a dog was most notable for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other 1918 film, Shoulder Arms, the silent movie genius focuses on a totally different mood mark. His war comedy specializes in surreal and exaggerated scenarios in which Chaplin demonstrates creativity and mastery unprecedented in composition. When the soldier's bunker is flooded, the water level reaches the right height so that Chaplin can execute his jokes more successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses like a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's increased ingenuity and malice. Of course, when the enemy discovers his trick, the soldier heads straight into the forest. The next chase is a visual marvel: Chaplin not only hides the soldier from the Germans, but also uses the forest to mask the soldier's audience, so that the camouflaged soldier remains unlocked in the middle of the frame, but somehow remains invisible. The whole time we thought our little hero was pulling a fast in the German army; for our joy, the joke is also in us. Rating: 8
