Each paper, even the smallest, was released and acted with bravery. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary Jena Malone never takes a false step. Her two co-stars are just like her in this movie. Ryan Gosling may be the best actor of his generation. Chris Klein does his best to this day. This is a thought and talk film that must be seen by teenagers and young adults. You will think and talk about this movie for days. Highly recommended.
