I saw this movie in the movies when I was 14 and it changed my life. I immediately cut my hair and started to buy all the records from the movie bands. These were some of the seminal bands of L.A. punk rock captured on film at the height of their powers. Bands like Black Flag (pre-Rollins), Circle Jerks, Fear, X and the Germs have few equals in the history of punk music. I can not believe this movie was never released on video or DVD. Great movie for punk rock fans.
