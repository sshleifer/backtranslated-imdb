a great film, with an unclear political message. is filmed in theatrical style, i.c. most of the action takes place inside. the mayor Corea and Diana Ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other. emotions are on the rise since Western tourists and businessmen seem unwilling and unable to indulge in the prefect's Russian-Russian charm, though he makes every effort to understand his point of view. the two opposing worldviews are clearly clear, but the film also shows that human emotions can not be controlled by politics. Its powerful acting and has a high emotional impact for a 50's movie.
