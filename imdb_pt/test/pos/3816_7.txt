This movie interested me enough to watch it several times. The plot has holes, but the protagonists make it work. Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge) does a great job as a 37-year-old woman who sacrificed everything else to become a doctor. She worked years to earn money to go to medical school. She is performing brilliantly in her residence and is about to take her exam and fulfill her dream. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Julia's sister and brother-in-law are murdered and, as the nearest living relative, she is obligated. to take his niece Amanda (Arlen Aguayo-Stewart) to prevent her from becoming a state protection. Amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance. Amanda is so traumatized by the murder of her parents that she was speechless. Needless to say, Julia's 16-hour days get more time taking care of Amanda. Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney, a charming neighbor in his apartment building who works on the life of Julia and Amanda. He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda deal with her suffering. Amanda really begins to warm up for Kevin as the movie progresses, perhaps more so than for her aunt. Julia begins to trust Kevin to take on the burden of caring for Amanda as she tries to deal with the burden of the case and prepare for the council's examination. Kevin is always there when any crisis erupts for Julia. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great. You keep watching to see them together before the end of the movie. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was also good. Arlen was able to broadcast a lot without the benefit of words. The plot had Julia and Amanda gradually warming up. You can watch them working in a relationship as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> We discovered that Julia's sister and brother-in-law (the Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three associates who wanted to share the profits of the robbery. Julia discovers that the Meyers were planning to jump the country under assumed identities. The plot is not clear if the Meyers intended to cross their companions or were crossed. <br /> <br /> In any case, the Meyers are murdered at home by two of their former associates. The killers do not try to extract the location of the Meyers microchip before killing them. The killers search the house and can not find the prize. They leave a living witness to their crime, Amanda. The killers then spend the remainder of the film making awkward attempts to extract the microchip from Julia and Amanda, who have no idea where the prize is located. Eventually, the killers kidnap Amanda in the hope that she will know something about the location of the microchip. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Julia discovers the truth about Kevin. He is a hired investigator to recover the stolen microchip. After some difficult moments in the relationship, they manage to rescue Amanda and dispatch the bad guys. The predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together. <br /> <br /> What struck me about the plot were huge holes. Kevin moves into the same apartment building as Julia and Amanda the day after the Meyers murder. How does he know that the microchip is not yet in the hands of the killers? The assassins leave fingerprints happily at the crime scene, without bothering to hide their identity. The killer who pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by the remnants of red paint from the crime scene in her shoe soles. He was not shown at the scene at the beginning of the movie. There are other weaknesses in this sense, too numerous to mention. <br /> <br /> The film could have been much better if the script had been perfected before filming. Filling the holes in the plot would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort.
