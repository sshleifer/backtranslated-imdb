GoldenEye is a masterpiece. The plot is amazingly portrayed, the characters beautifully animated and the weapons are typed. The plot is so interesting even when you complete each quest, to get more levels you have to beat them on a bigger difficulty. And the multiplayer mode is so tyte. You choose the weapons you want to play with and then you play. Me and the three friends, along with my brother, have always played Goldeneye. If you do not have this game, I suggest you buy it.
