definitely the best game for the N64 ever. I further say that I was very disappointed with tomorrow never dies but the world is not enough promises to be better than the goldeneye (according to the website). I love goldeneye so much that I find something to do every time I game. I invented my own missions to the levels. Multiplayer is the best of all games, and the graphics are amazing so far. The first day I did that, I remember wishing they would come back and turn all the title movies into games. Can you imagine driving that high speed boat live and letting die and make those incredible jumps, or fight the ninjas or fight the jaws of the spy who loved me and gone mad? (I think fighting him in those games would be more fun than in the Aztecs) than chasing after Sanchez on gas trucks or climbing St. Cerils just for his eyes. oh well let me get back to the game at hand. All levels are unique and contribute to fun and entertaining environments. there are many places to hide so you can sneek at people (especially park statue) well this game is not worth renting you really need to buy it today.
