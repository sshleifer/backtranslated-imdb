I remember watching this movie as a kid and I was totally impressed by it, I could not take my eyes off the television. This movie has it all for horror fans! This movie had no funny moments waiting for a pair of liners by stooge (who was my favorite character in the movie) kevin tenney drove this gem and did a wonderful job with a low budget, i thought the end was amazing the only thing that could To stop them was to survive the night they were unstoppable killing machines! the effects made by steve johnson we are excellent I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a love for low budget horror movies because as the old saying goes, they do not do it any more. The sequences were also very good, but not as good as the originals. This is a must have in any horror collection, buy it if you can find it you will not be disappointed
