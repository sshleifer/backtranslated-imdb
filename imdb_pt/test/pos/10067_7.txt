I'm really sad that this movie has received a lot of negative reviews. I think it's a little comedy and very funny. The humor in this movie is warm and innocent and I like it. I also like the character of Madonna and I do not agree that she played alone. She created a character and a nice one. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes were the fight scene over the car that is sinking and where Madonna climbs the fence in an extravagant dress to claim her love. The mood of the film has a slightly synchronous twist and may not be everyone's cup of tea. But it's their problem, not the movie. <br /> <br /> I found this movie healthy and sunny. In fact, the day I first saw it, I was incredibly sad for some reason and this movie brightened my day. And Madonna can act. Just take off your negative thinking glasses.
