This is one of the many technological phobia films that sprouted like mushrooms in the mid-1990s, after the Internet became popular. <br /> <br /> Hollywood movies have always had their way of "embellishing" the events portrayed. make them look better and more attractive. The same thing happens when Hollywood tries to show us a bit of high technology. The result of such attempts varies from being too exaggerated and ridiculous (see Hackers (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), etc.) to be quite realistic (see Sneakers (1992)). <br /> <br /> "The Net" is somewhere between these extremes. By nitpicking, one can end up with a lot of technical inconsistencies, and many cases where things seem to be a lot sexier and graphic than things are in real life (as usually happens in movies). <br /> <br /> However, by simply ignoring these, the viewer ends up with a rather solid and fun movie. The characters and acting are compelling, and the film does a good job at keeping it in its place until the end. The plot is fine (a pretty normal, actually - based on good old paranoid design, but with a high tech tip this time around), and quite convincing (again, when disregarding technical issues). The development of the plot is a bit slow, and occasionally you can anticipate some supposedly surprising twists in the plot. <br /> <br /> The bonus here is the cute Sandra Bullock, who in addition to being cute (something she does very easily, apparently), also portrays a solid act. You can really feel her character - her despair, her emotions. <br /> <br /> On the bottom line, the movie is fun and interesting, rating about 7 out of 10 on my scale. It is worth renting in the video library, or even watching in the movies. Whether or not it is up to you.
