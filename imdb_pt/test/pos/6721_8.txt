** and 1/2 stars out of **** Lifeforce is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, so ridiculous, but at the moment it's strangely appealing and never less silly. Whether it's because of the uninterrupted nudity, the sheer amount of violence and action, it all comes together to create fun 2 hours of movies. <br /> <br /> Spaceshuttle Churchill was sent to investigate Comet Halley when they detected something hidden inside the giant rock coma. A small team, led by Colonel Carlsen (Steve Railsback), was sent to search the area. What they discover includes hundreds of creatures resembling frozen bats and three naked and apparently unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline containers, two males and one female (Mathilda May). They decide to take the three of them back with them, which results in a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> When London receives no response from the crew, another team is sent to find out what is happening. When they enter Churchill, they find the remains of the crew, all dried out beyond recognition. The humanoids are still in perfect condition and take them back to London. After several tests, scientists still do not know what these beings really are. Then, late at night, a security guard in the compound feels compelled to enter the room where the female is being held. He touches her shoulder, and she wakes up, rises and smiles at him in a seductive and perverse way. She approaches him, and starts kissing him, when it becomes clear that she is actually taking her life force, sucking him off with all her energy (the effect is a little tacky). <br /> <br /> She escapes from the complex and begins to leave a trail behind. Another man, Colonel Caine (Peter Firth), is brought in to track her. So men discover that there is a pattern in the life force process. The corpse of the security guard wakes up in 2 hours and takes the life force of a doctor. It seems that every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim. With the help of Churchill's only survivor, Carlsen, they try to track down the girl before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is very good evening entertainment. It has all the elements anyone could look for in a movie like that, lots of nudity, blood / blood and lots of special effects. This is certainly better than a similarly drawn film, Species, largely thanks to a more fascinating ending. <br /> <br /> The performances range from decent to terrible. Faring the worst is easily Steve Railsback, who excels for no end. Much better are Peter Firth, who arrives and convincingly, and the beautiful Mathilda May (she is as beautiful as the French actresses Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner). May goes through virtually the entire paper without wearing clothes, and there were reports that it was difficult for her during filming, so the fact that she is able to go through all the scenes without moving and looking uncomfortable is impressive. There are times when it can be quite scary, being simply seductive. Most of the film gets to work because of it. <br /> <br />
