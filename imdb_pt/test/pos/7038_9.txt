Ahhhh, 1984 .... I was young and stupid, and just developed a taste for those exotic cigarettes while living in a squat on the Moss side of Manchester with the most unbelievable case of cockroach infestation. <br /> <br /> After some of these doobies, this show was ROTFLMAO material - I was an avid fan. Then I would look at the floor (or up, at the walls, or anywhere) and see my own collection of "small armadillos" running. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if it was the chemical. but I remember thinking about the time when the surrealism of the show was fantastic - it was the second favorite thing on TV at the time (# 1 was the season of films by Luis Bunuel being aired on Channel 4). Radical art is still alive! <br /> <br /> Also you have to tune in that theme! .... I swear, I'm never going to drink ....
