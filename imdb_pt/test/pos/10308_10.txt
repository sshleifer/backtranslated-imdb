Regardless of the accuracy of the facts, Bandit Queen is a true story, it's true because the issues they deal with are as true today as they were in 1994. This film is violent, powerful and thought-provoking. The protagonist is a woman. of flesh and blood, whose adversity brought out the best (or worst) of it. Keeping subjectivity aside, there is no doubt that Phoolan's character of an eight-year-old girl, married to her father to pay a debt (pun intended), to a gang leader who becomes leader of the lower caste. , has evolved into a champion in his own right. His portrait is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacre. <br /> <br /> I can understand if the Western public is not able to appreciate this masterpiece, Bandit Queen needs to be 'studied' in the Indian context, and not just verified in stereotypes. I may not be able to sell it in its universal appeal, but it is certainly a must to pay attention to the Indian public, it is a pity that the film had a late release, censored openly in India. Queen Bandit is the story of a woman who fought two adversities in India, being a woman and also a lower caste, her rebellious nature and her inability to simply give in, caused her the most horrible experiences of life, who only came to strengthen it. self-proclaimed goddess. She responded to violence with violence and became the submissive woman that society wanted her to be. Call it divine justice or failure of the judiciary, if she had killed a single person, she would have been hanged, she killed 24 and was revered, respected and glorified. PS # Whoever encountered his "psychotic" character needs to be sodomized at age 8, surrounded by 10 men and naked. So they should be asked: how normal do they feel?
