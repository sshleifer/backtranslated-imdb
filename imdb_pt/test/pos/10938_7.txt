I liked this movie, alright, could be so much better. I was expecting more action than what I have ... which was more of a comedy than anything else. Granted, it was serious in parts and had a good fight scene here and there, mostly it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror at all. Which is hard to do with a vampire movie. A vampire hunter loses his partner and must train another, his sister is going through a difficult breakup, but she is being chased by a vampire of all things. Granted, this vampire is quite nice and not suck blood. So that's all there is except for the plot of another vampire after certain real vampires, so he can gain supreme power. Some of the problems with this movie is that its plot was here and there and the film had a very uneven flow, and that seemed to change the genres a bit too much. One minute of action, the next pure comedy. However, the girls were cute, there was good deed, the comedy was worth a laugh or two and Jackie Chan makes one or two pretty energetic appearances. This movie probably only needed more development in some areas, such as the villain who basically is not really exploited. So for a movie with some good fights and a laugh or two, that's pretty good ... but why was it rated R? I've seen things we did that is PG-13 which is a lot worse than that.
