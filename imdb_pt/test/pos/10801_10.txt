Cinema, at its best is entertainment. If one wants to question every aspect with which he finds room for disagreement, and much of the recorded history is based on contemporary opinions - often biased - then one should leave the cinema because his prejudices will always spoil his pleasure. When I saw a plane flying in a movie from 33 BC, I had fun. The backdrop in "Casablanca" is absurdly false. So, I moan and say the movie could not convince? Fiona, relax and enjoy an excellent performance. Wajda's decision to launch the protagonists as French and Polish was inspired. one of them was immediately aware of which side each of the main characters was representing. There is no need to dwell on the authenticity of wigs. This is a powerful cinema. If there is a political message that is still relevant today - have a dinner - a Château d'Yquem with foie gras; a Puligny Montrachet with the main course; some Polish Vodka ice creams and perhaps a 1961 Château Lafite-Rothschild with beef - and discuss the political aspects of Danton until you fall out of fatigue. Danton certainly agreed?
