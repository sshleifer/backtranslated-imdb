I absolutely love this movie! Evil Dead has nothing in this movie! Night of the Demons 2 and 3 are a total festival, but this is a classic. It's super tacky and the acting is good at best, but what more could you want from an 80's horror movie? Stooge has some of the best one liners that have ever hit the screen in this one. (he's my favorite character) Many people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my favorite is the ending, unfortunately it has nothing to do with the main characters when the old man eats his left over apples for Halloween Witches. pie, and her throat is mutilated from the inside out. The soundtrack is incredible. The scene with Angela's dance is totally chilling, especially after the strobe light comes on, and you can watch her jump from one part of the floor to the next, with each sound of a camera shutter clicking on the song she's playing. The makeup effects in this movie are very sweet; Angela gave me nightmares as a child. If you are the kind of person who demands the perfection of your filming experience, you may want to give this one a pass. But if you're like me, and you really enjoy the whole Halloween house, haunted house with the clich√© of demons, that's definitely a must.
