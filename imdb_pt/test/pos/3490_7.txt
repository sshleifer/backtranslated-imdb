If you like his show, you might be a bit disappointed. This movie has some very funny moments and the laughter is quite constant, but none is memorable or as funny as the show's things. The initial sequence is really really silly and funny, and a great start. Yes! Borat makes an appearance. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan, then watch! If you do not know him or do not like him, do not bother. 6.5 / 10
