A genuinely creepy ghost story, full of chills and sensuality, this movie falls short of what it promises. It's apparently based on an old ghost story, and maybe it relies a bit too much on a simple premise. For most of the way, it's imaginative and genuinely thrilling, but in the end it's almost as if Oshima has just lost interest in him and brought him to a quick end. <br /> <br /> The story is simple - a woman and her younger lover kills her husband so they can get together. But the lack of courage and the return of the ghost condemn them to madness. Its beautifully manipulated, with imaginative scenes, and the lovers' passion is portrayed beautifully. But often the film fails to deliver on its promise, almost as if Oshima loses his courage in the same way as lovers. <br /> <br /> It's a movie worth seeing just to see how Oshima combines his great experience. ability as a filmmaker with a few tricks of exploration films to pull the audience together, but unfortunately is not a true classic in the molds of movies like Onibaba or Woman of the Dunes.
