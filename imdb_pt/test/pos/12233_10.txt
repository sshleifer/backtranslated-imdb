Challen Cates does a wonderful job portraying a conflicted bride, torn between the challenges that await her professionally, the memories of the freedom she thought she would have when she was in college (inspired by a famous author), and the security of her pending marriage with a man . she really does not love. This film is definitely worth seeing - as predictable as it may be, the acting is inspiring and the true chemistry exists between Challen Cates and Malcolm Jamaal Warner.
