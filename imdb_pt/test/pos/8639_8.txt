Wow, what a strange movie. It's a David Lynch movie, so it's no wonder it's weird. <br /> <br /> I challenge anyone to explain everything in this movie. I can not be done. After a few searches after my second screening of this film, I pretty much know the bulk of the story, but at first glance, and without the help of other reviewers or outside help, it's hard to figure things out. So if you're in that boat and you're confused, do not feel bad; this is normal. Let me just say that the key to the movie is the character of Naomi Watts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I find the film fascinating. I love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and I find every character in this movie really different and fun to watch. The camera work is great and the music is creepy, like Lynch's "Blue Velvet." There are also some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. All in all, it's very well marked. Like Lynch's "Twin Peaks" television series, this was a film in which the finale was reunited after Lynch thought the film would be over. -the TV series. When that did not happen, he corrected it at the last minute. This may explain some of the confusions at the end and the lack of explanations about the characters we see in the movie, but who disappear mysteriously. The subject of the story is supposed to be a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does for people, especially those whose dreams of being actors are crushed. <br /> <br /> Both Watts and the other protagonist, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their celebrated lesbians. sex scene However, the two women were chameleons, looking mediocre at times, impressive at other times. <br /> <br /> I liked this second movie better than the first. It is not just a piece of curiosity; is a very intriguing film ..... just do not feel stupid if you can not understand some things.
