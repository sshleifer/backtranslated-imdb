If you love knowledge of vampires and are a fan of gothic horror then you might want to check Soul's Midnight. I did not know much about this movie before I watched it, and I did not expect much, but I found the film to be fun and entertaining. Starring Armand Assante as the vampire leader Simon, Soul separates himself from other low-budget vampire films, weaving the mythology of St. George and the Dragon in a new and fun way. <br /> <br /> I do not know what was the budget for this movie, but I feel that if it was a little more, they could have really hit the blood and the effects. <br /> <br /> If you wake up late and are in the mood to have fun Low budget vampire stream then Soul's Midnight is a good choice.
