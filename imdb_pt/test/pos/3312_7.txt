Although dated, this movie is definitely worth watching. I saw this about eight times as a teenager when it opened and changed my life ... I just had to live in New York. There are great opening scenes of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis singing "The romance is still ... the best of everything ..." rivaling that of West Side Story. There is performance a little affected by the world's first REAL supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry for that, Janice D.), but it's great for the eyes! It also offers a bit of insight into American customs of the late 1950s - our obsession with (and repression of) sex (in the workplace, no less!), Romance and marriage before the women's lib. It represents a time when New York was at its best and a super-bitchy performance of Joan Crawford is just the icing on the cake.
