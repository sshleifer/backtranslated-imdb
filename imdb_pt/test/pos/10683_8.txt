Fans of Gerry Anderson productions will recognize several actors and vehicles from the UFO (which was made after Doppelg채nger) - as well as sound effects from various Anderson series. Excellent music by Barry Gray (mostly unique to this film) enhances the sense of familiarity. For these reasons, I think any fan of Gerry Anderson would find Doppelg채nger worthy of consideration. Judged simply as a movie, it must be said that Doppelg채nger is flawed. It is known that there were major problems during production, and I suspect that is why there is a time-consuming plot line that ends abruptly and seems to have no relevance to the rest of the story. Presumably, time / budget constraints prevented relevancy from arising! <br /> <br /> Distractedly, the special effects range from exceptionally good - better than any movie of the 60s that I know - to disappointingly bad. <br /> <br /> However, even with these flaws, the main story of Doppelg채nger is well told and keeps the viewer (or at least this viewer) involved. The ending may not be what you might expect from Anderson, but at the same time, it's typical of Anderson, and it's certainly appropriate. To find out what I mean, you will have to watch for yourself. :)
