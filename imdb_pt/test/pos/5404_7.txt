This movie does not have the fantastic look that American Beauty or The Ice Storm offered and because it was made after these movies, it also can not be branded as very original: the song, though subtly brilliant, looks a lot like American Beauty. <br /> <br /> The story bears some resemblance to The Ice Storm in particular (as well as Sigourney Weaver). Unintentionally perhaps, the movie seems to try to recreate the success of the two films mentioned above. Sometimes history tends to be a bit more superficial than the larger and more successful "siblings" by having too much going on or failing to deliver the most effective dialogues. Here, writing can not measure with that of American Beauty. But this can be said about most of the films already made, even the best ones, and there is still a lot to enjoy: the tip of the song and (expected, given the cast) effective performances. Worth noting is Emile Hirsch who would shine a few years later in the excellent "Into The Wild". Overall, I can recommend this movie if you like suburban dramas, although it's not the first on a list. of imperdibles, that would be surmounted by: 1 American Beauty 2 The Ice Storm 3 Small Children. <br /> <br /> After seeing and liking them, check out this one.
