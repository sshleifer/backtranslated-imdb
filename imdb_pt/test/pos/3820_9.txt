I caught this show a few times when I was young and was joking, my parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original boundaries and the twilight zone (new and old) could not do. This show used some old ideas and some truly unique ideas. <br /> <br /> I still can not believe that Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright did it. These guys were producers on the sg-1 stargate. The show kept the audience entrenched in history and established a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone. Rod Serling arriving added to the scared, forest coming up brightening the mood. <br /> <br /> The ending, whether good or bad, was made for a frightening moment. You could never predict what would happen. I'm still trying to find the seasons on DVD.
