I love this movie, it's great and so funny, Ben is FIT and I would not mind meeting him on vacation! I rate this movie as 10 because it's gr8 and I hope they never do it because it would never be the same. A little funny is when Andre is looking at the moon, and he screams for Nicole to "go out and look at the moon" that little makes me laugh and never grows old. Another thing is that Nicole seems much older than 14 years ... but she is a gr8 actress. But I need help with something Is not the name of the song played at the end when Nicole and Andre are dancing ??? It really is bothering me because I want 2 not what it is because it's a good song!
