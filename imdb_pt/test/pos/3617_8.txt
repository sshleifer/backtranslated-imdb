I have to admit that I approached this film with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestseller is one of my favorites and anyone who has read will realize that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% accurate. <br /> <br /> All the time, I found myself convinced that the film was unsuccessful and that the plan of the book had been withdrawn in order to make it redundant. The ending, however, is way better than the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards. Still, the positive points (John Toll's magnificent cinematography, Stephen Warbeck's great soundtrack, etc.) that I felt did not make up for my initial negatives (Cage's miscastar, a rather diluted writing). <br /> <br /> But two days later, I was filming again to see Corelli, and although it's not perfect, I have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have hoped for. Cage is really brilliant in a role that even Berniere was concerned was not a totally rounded character: his carefree spirit giving way to broken remorse is in place, and complements the superb double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt perfectly. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber, the Nazi officer trying to reconcile his feelings for his new Italian friends and his innate superiority complex to those around him. And the excellent Greco-Italian supporting cast brought the spectacular world of Berniere's Cepoli, dazzlingly alive. <br /> <br /> By leaving the cinema for the second time, I finally let go of my passion for romance that prevented me from fully appreciating the history of WW2 Cepholonia in cinematic terms. My hat goes to John Madden who, despite the almost-awaited criticism he is receiving from British critics (any director who has had such a great success as Shakespeare in Love behind them is always a target for these mournful fools!), terribly difficult book for the big screen with such heart, verve and humanity (the central virtues of the novel, in fact) that he has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has stabilized. in a few years. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the book, like me, it is difficult, but try not to make the same mistake in your initial visualization. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours, bathe in the glorious atmosphere of the Mediterranean, and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr. Iannis, as if for the first time (pretend you are watching something done from a script original) and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> In fact, you will be eagerly waiting to have your own copy of this delightful movie on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> 8/10
