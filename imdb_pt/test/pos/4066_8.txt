There was a time when 'Buddy Cop' movies dominated the box office. It seemed that all the summer herds of the aspiring Beverly Hills cops were down to the cinemas of our nation. No longer. Lately, the gusher has dried up almost without dripping. The drought slowed slightly recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently fun example of the genre. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not some kind of Dirty Harry by any means. He's just an incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that disrupts the performance of his duties - like, say, a TV cameraman. Mitch deals with the videographer in a socially irresponsible way and therefore falls into the clutches of Chase Renzi, a producer looking for a hook for his "T.V. reality" police show She thinks Mitch is going to give her the 'nerve' boost she needs to be a hit, but she feels that it can be too nasty to bring the whole show alone. Enter Trey Sellars, a police officer-actor who witnessed many Police Story reruns. Of course Mitch and Trey mix like oil and water and lots of fun happens. <br /> <br /> We know that Mitch and Trey should become best friends by the end of the movie. This is how comrade-police films are supposed to work. In fact, it should be said that Showtime rarely strays from time-honored cliches as written by Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash. There is a high-tech McGuffin to kick-start (in this case, an automatic rifle that fires enough to stop the tanks). There is a foreign thug with an accent of undetermined origin. There are persecutions, shootings and explosions. We all know that and we have a pretty good idea how things are going to end. You know what? There is nothing wrong with that. Yes, we know the bases used will be played, but the fun here is the journey, not the destination. Showtime does not strive to be original. Instead, your energies are channeled to your characters and humorous situations. As a result, Showtime does a competent job with the action sequences, but it really shines in his comedy. Robert De Niro is dryly funny as Mitch. In the past, I thought that De Niro was a cold and expressionless actor, given horribly to the robbery, when called to do comedy. Of late, however, he grew in me. He seems to be injecting more humanity into his roles. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Trey. The best way to describe his performance is that Trey is what Murphy would be if Murphy were not so talented and had not reached the big time. Rene Russo has a good time playing in the Chase Renzi engine shark show. She pursues the film chasing high ratings from Nielson with an inspiring determination. In her zeal, she re-calms Mitch's life to make him more friend of the camera. She even calls J. Hooker himself, William Shatner, to show Mitch how to be a "more authentic" cop. Shatner is funny, playing precisely as we expect him to be, tall, oblivious and a little unfriendly. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I was really looking forward to Showtime and was not disappointed. Ten years ago, this movie would have been a guaranteed success. Today he is doing moderate business at best. It's a shame because Showtime is a lot of fun.
