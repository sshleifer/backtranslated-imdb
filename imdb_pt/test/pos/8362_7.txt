Time travel into the past is tenuous, at best, as a topic. In this episode, a man who has thought about the possibility lies in the date and place of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He tries everything he can think of in the little time available for him with predictable results. Of course, he's considered very crazy. He is arrested and eventually sent to the man he is trying to stop. Serling was brilliant enough to let him return to the present, but the present is the same? This is a kind of precursor to "The Time Tunnel," where time travelers, on a weekly basis, were given the same task, surpassing what had already happened. Unfortunately, the implications of the distortion of time and the future always deny the result. Unless you have something like "The Sound of Thunder" by Ray Bradbury.
