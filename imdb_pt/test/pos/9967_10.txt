The Merchant of Venice, by William Shakespeare, deals with a Jewish moneylender and his obligation to extract a pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant Antonio, the loser of a debt. The Jewish lender, of course, is Shylock and he is given such a high performance by Al Pacino that even prominent actors like Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynne Collins disappear into the background. The film is set in 16th century Venice and director Michael Radford relies on the setting, humor and realism to tell his story, rejecting luxurious period costumes or a modern setting with rock music to appeal to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Radford cuts the duration of three hours from the game to two manageable hours and eight minutes and also provides some historical background. In the opening narration, he tells us how the Jews came to England, were subjected to increasing persecution, and finally expelled from England. They were forbidden to own property, could only profit by lending money at interest, and were forced to live in a Venetian "geto," a forerunner of the darkest events to come. In the film, the merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons) spits in Shylock in public, but does not feel ashamed to ask the usurer to lend 3,000 ducats to help his friend and suggested that the lover Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) courted Portia (Lynne Collins) a rich heiress. Although Shylock was insulted by Antonio, he agrees to lend the money without interest for three months, on condition that the loss of the bond entitles him to demand a pound of meat from Antonio's heart. <br /> <br /> The game is basically a drama of hatred and revenge, but like many of Shakespeare's plays, there are also touches of broad comedy. Here, the comedy involves three pairs of lovers: Bassanio and Portia, Gratiano, Bassanio and Nerissa's friend, and Bassanio's other friend Lorenzo, and Jessica, Shylock's daughter. Portia was offered to the person who can choose the right treasure from one of three boxes, made of gold, silver and lead. The Prince of Morocco chooses the gold, the Prince of Aragon the silver and both are disappointed. Bassanio, however, loves her for herself and opens the lead coffin to find the portrait inside. Radford's adaptation conveys a remarkable sense of time and place. Portia's residence in Belmont suggests one of these splendid summer homes with immaculate gardens and art treasures dangling from every room and contrasts well with the dingy look of the city of Shylock with its damp alleys. <br /> <br /> When it is clear that Antonio can not pay the debt, Bassanio returns to Venice, leaving Portia behind. When he arrives, the loan is defaulted and Shylock is demanding his pound of meat. Even when Bassanio, backed by Portia's wealth, often offers repayment value, Shylock intends to take revenge not only for the loss of money, but for a lifetime of outsider status. The duke, who is at the trial, will not intervene when Portia enters as a lawyer to defend Antonio. It is here that the movie reaches its dramatic heights as all parties come to court to reach a final resolution. <br /> <br /> The Merchant of Venice is not only about an unpaid debt, but also about the remoteness of Jews from Christian society and their desire to belong. It has been one of Shakespeare's most controversial pieces and analysts have long debated whether it is an anti-Semitic piece or simply a play on anti-Semitism that reflects the prevailing view of Christian society in Elizabethan England. Although Shylock is definitely a caricature, he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indications that Shakespeare sees his failures as human faults, not as Jewish. The Duke recognizes that he is simply a man who has not adhered to the compassionate language of the Torah. <br /> <br /> In the monologue, "I am a Jew. Do not you have jewish eyes?" Nudge us, do not we bleed? If you tickle us, do not we laugh? If you poison us, do not we die? and if you deceive us, should not we take our revenge? "Shylock shows a universal humanity, expressing the equality of all men.While we are horrified at the phrase he wishes to accomplish, we can feel his pain accumulated over the years.Pacino's performance brings new vigor to the text and his many personality In an interview with the Toronto International Film Festival last September, Radford said of Pacino, "When you work with a brilliant actor, you have a lot of great machine. It's like driving a powerful car. You have to dare do that. "He dared and we are all beneficiaries.
