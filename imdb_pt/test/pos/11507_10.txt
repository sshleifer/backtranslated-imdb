This film by Friðrik Þór, director of Children of Nature, is powerful. It has good music by Sigurrós and good acting. It shows how insanity as a disease can be sad. There are many good jokes, but the humor is gloomy. If that's not a problem then you should see this movie. Note that this is not a comedy but a drama.
