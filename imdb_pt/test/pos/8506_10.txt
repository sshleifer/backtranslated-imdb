I like both this version of DORIAN GRAY and the MGM version. They both add a little girl at the beginning of the story who grows up to have an association with Dorian (this is not in the original book), and that's my only complaint. I especially like Angela Lansbury as Sybil Vane and George Sanders as Harry in the MGM version, but Shane Briant as Dorian in the TV version is much prettier (I think) and much more relentless than Hurd Hatfield in the MGM version: I think Briant is more faithful to Dorian's novel. In the end, this is a very good adaptation of the novel (it even suggests Dorian's connection with men, as well as Wylde, which could not be done in the MGM version).
