Okay, this was not the biggest horror movie I've ever seen in my life. Despite the fact that it's lower budget, it's a pretty decent movie, though. Monsters are unique and believable. Heck, they're kind of scary in the scenes where they show them causing a devastation in this poor family. Although, when you finally get to see the monsters completely, you really think "WTF !, those little things are behind them?!" The only part that really disturbed me was when they * smelled * they killed the kitten! Not the kitten, noooooo, why? Seriously, if you're looking for hardcore violence and gore, this is not the movie for you. Will rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines. If you have small children, I would not recommend watching this with them; would probably give them nightmares about trolls in their room.
