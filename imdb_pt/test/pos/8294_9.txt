The only impression of CHIKAMATUS MONOGATARI I could find was lousy - I almost could not see. Which is a pity, as this is one of Mizoguchi's greatest films. The story - which I believe to have been made before and after by other Japanese directors - is a bit more straightforward than my favorite Mizoguchi films (SANSHO THE BAILIFF and UGETSU MONOGATARI), and is essentially a tale of tragic romance, in this case a novel transgressive that crosses strict limits of class. As always with Mizoguchi, there is an exquisitely expressed challenge tone, and - bad print aside - I was very pleased. As with all Mizoguchi movies, I am eagerly awaiting a restored DVD release - whenever that can happen ...
