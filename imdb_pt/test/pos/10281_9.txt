Superb, unique and beautiful movie. The performance is great, the set-up settings are superb (Paris at its best - but the real Paris, not the famous settings) and the music will also work. A brilliant story, very detailed, which I love very much. <br /> <br /> The best French film I have ever seen (and French cinema is very good)!
