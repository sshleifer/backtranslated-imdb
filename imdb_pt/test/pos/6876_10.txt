when I know that Walter will never embellish another set. I was in my 30s when I first saw this sweet, captivating and blatantly romantic movie. I loved it from the first scene, to the end. habitual daft self; Glenda combined with Walter step by step in criticism, and Richard Benjamin provided the sarcastic voice of reason he does so well. Along the way, there were many actors that we all recognize, making their usual brilliance. There are some lines in the movie that I and the OS have used over the years, but I will not say anything about them here. I'm sure you'll know which two I'm talking about. Just get this movie. Make popcorn, take your squeeze (if it's as mellow as mine, for which I'm grateful), and enjoy this romantic comedy from the 70's. You will not be disappointed. However, I have the feeling that I am preaching to the choir here because anyone who loves Walter will already have it. I am very happy to be on DVD now, finally.
