It's strange how the lesser-known movies sometimes end up among the best you've ever seen. This movie has all the elements of a modern standard thriller, weapons, techno, villains, money, etc., and still stands out from its average Hollywood also ran. I would credit this to two very charismatic people. Christopher Walken has a cool confidence and Lorraine Bracco is one of the sexiest and sexy women I have ever seen on screen. Another important reason why this film stands out is because the setting changes to Jamaica after the beginning. The Jamaican resort is so beautiful that you wish you were there sitting by the pool at night, with a Run'n'Coke. . . I know you do. I'm so glad I saw this movie - it was too good to miss!
