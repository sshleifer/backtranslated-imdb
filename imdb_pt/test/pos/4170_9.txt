My friends and we spent a period of time renting movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good thing that came out of this was this movie, "Take it to Limit". Once the movie started, we could say we were in a real classic. The song is probably made by rural Colorado white boys, but it sounds like rap from the early 1990s. Starring actor Leo Fitzpatrick plays the bad boy so well, especially with a big spine in the entire movie. This movie is based on climbing, and I'm not a climber, but even so I find it hilarious when they have the climber struggling to climb and there's a guy in the background who's basically climbing the cliff. You do not want to miss this movie, you will be able to see the same clips over and over again. You will have surprises at every turn. You will find yourself citing the unforgettable lines. I recommend this movie to anyone. Take snow. Disclaimer: This movie is poorly made, but that's what makes it great.
