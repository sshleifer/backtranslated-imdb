I try to get this movie every time it's on TV, which is fortunately quite often. But I keep forgetting to film it. As it is, I pretty much know the color script, but that does not stop me from crying well, in fact, probably adds to it as I cry knowing what comes next. It's such a beautiful film - well done, well done, good photography. I love it. One of my top ten films.
