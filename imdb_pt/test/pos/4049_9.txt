This is a remake of the classic 80's anime, and this is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna and Priss are back as the Knights Sabers in their hard-suits fighting the robotic boomers. The animation is sharp, the characters are well-developed and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular work, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too cheeky. DVDs also have lots of extras, including reviews, which really increase your understanding and enjoyment of the show. A must-have for any anime fan. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: Burst Angel, Armitage III
