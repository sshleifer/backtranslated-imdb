BONJOUR, MONSIEUR SHLOMI is simply a wonderful film! Writer / Director Shemi Zarhin has created a story unlike any other and has cast it with consistently fine actors which remains a riddle to me that this film has not become a favorite of the public around the world. Shlomi (Oshri Cohen, in a brilliantly understated performance) is a 16 year old boy who takes care of his highly dysfunctional family: his mother (Esti Zakheim) is as unpleasant as ever invented and in a state of bad humor because of her husband having betrayed her, and because she is arrested working double shifts to support her sick father-in-law (Ariek Elias, who as Shlomi's grandfather is a brilliant, funny, wise and loving man who cares deeply about Shlomi); a married sister Ziva (Rotem Abuhab) who periodically moves back to the house because of constant quarrels with her husband, who does not help her care for her twin children; his brother Sasi (Assi Cohen) whose life is high electric guitars, bragging about female conquests, and his mother's favorite son. Shake this mixture and the result is the penultimate dysfunctional family unit. Shlomi cooks gourmet meals for them, makes purchases, cleans house, takes care of errands, bathes and takes care of that grandfather and in general takes a life of submission to a family that sees him as a 'retardado'.Shlomi yearns for a girlfriend and practically failure school due to lack of time dedicated to looking after his family and lack of concentration. By chance, his mathematics teacher Begin (Nisso Keavia) notices his natural mathematical genius in a discarded test, and with the help of the principal (Yigal Nair) the two encourage him to be tested and discover that he is a genius. Dyslexia?) And arrange for him to try out a special school in Haifa. Shlomi's mother will not hear any of this, but between fights with the absent father of Shlomi (Albert Iluz) and clashes with the teacher and director they finally consent to their tests for the school. While Shlomi discovers a girl of his age Rona (Aya Koren) who moved next door and gradually the two intertwine in a physical and intellectual relationship. Always in the background is the support of Shlomi's grandfather, and when the grandfather dies, Shlomi leaves for the journey to live his life, to realize his gifts, to find his happiness. The way the family comes to deal with it is the apex of the film and does not need to be revealed to lose the power of the message. The film is beautifully photographed, the musical score is creatively adorable and the end result is an exaltation of the human spirit. Highly recommended on all levels. In Hebrew with English subtitles.
