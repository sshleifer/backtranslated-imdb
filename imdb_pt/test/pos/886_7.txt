After seeing a preview for this movie at my local mall where there is a stand for the purchase of foreign films, I thought it looked like a lot of fun. Before watching the movie I went to IMDb to see what reviews and comments he received. I was worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings. Despite the hype, I watched the movie and to my surprise I found it unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The story was great (just pay attention) and the characters and their relationships within the movie are amazing. I have not seen such a good combination of main characters in a long time. I really felt for both characters and felt a strong bond. As reading previous posts about this movie not being "epic" enough or lacking in martial arts, I could not disagree more. This movie is what it is, it's not Braveheart and it does not come in the Dragon, but it's still a wonderful movie that does a great job of combining story and action. <br /> <br /> Although Sword on the Moon is not perfect (what movie is it?) is still wonderful and moving. Just wait until the final scene, with music and film together, is breathtaking. I just hope that more people can see this movie to give a fair vote.
