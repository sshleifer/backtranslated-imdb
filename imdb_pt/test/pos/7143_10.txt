Easily one of my favorite dramatic TV movies in many ways, beautiful but sad, moving and thought-provoking, this is an excellent dramatization of a few years in the life of C.S. Lewis and his relationship with Joy Davidman. I found it to be incredibly absorbing with excellent, realistic dialogues and situations. Everything seemed very "real", but there were also "magic" moments that almost leave you breathless with pleasure. Ackland and Bloom as the central characters were excellent as well as the supporting cast. It's one of those dramas that I find difficult to criticize, simply because, for me, there's NOTHING to be criticized, it works so well on so many levels. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
