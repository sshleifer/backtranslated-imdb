Along with virtually all Republic photos ever made, "Murder in Music Hall" seems to have gone unduly into oblivion. A shame because this mysterious suspense item, expertly directed and written, and astute, turns a seductive whodunnit thriller against the backdrop of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the elegant penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the delicious Rockettes - among them Vera Ralston (who in addition to giving an attractive performance of subtlety and vulnerability, provides some impressive numbers of ice skating production), Helen Walker , Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delightful B-movie stars from the 1940s. Tall, blond, handsome William Marshall (usually released in musicals) pursues the killer as the complex and increasingly creepy plot unfolds against chicest scenes you'll see in a noir movie. The ending is as big a surprise as this forgotten and mysterious murder mystery. It is worth restoring and reviving on cable TV, VHS or DVD. Republic sank a heavy budget in this first-rate production, and "Murder in the Music Hall" is as smooth, unnerving, and immensely enjoyable as any of the major studio films of its time. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Pay attention to rhapsodic music composed by the victim shortly before his death. Then, amid the incessant gossiping of the dancers in their dressing rooms, try to locate the hum of that fatal melody. You'll find out who the killer is, just as William Marshall does. So much fun, the kind of movie they really do not do, and what a loss - both to filmgoers and to actors.
