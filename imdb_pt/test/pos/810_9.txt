The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides everything you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot. It's in a cottage on a weekend. As always, all the guests are suspicious and it is up to Poirot to discover the truth. With movies like this, it's always better not to pay too much attention, so I'll stop here. What I loved about 'Hollow' was that it's a mystery the old fashioned way. When Poirot arrives, everyone is around the body, for example. Everyone seems to be to blame. There is that suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story. <br /> <br /> You can expect a wonderful time giving hints about who did and how and why and maybe at the end even be surprised. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you will have a quite pleasant experience. <br /> <br /> The actors are all very good. As a curiosity, Edward Hardwicke played Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes. It's good to see you after a few years. Suchet is amazing as ever and, fortunately, is on screen most of the time. <br /> <br /> I found out who the killer was, but it's still not predictable and it's also very believable. <br /> <br /> So at the conclusion of a great movie and as always a pleasure. <br /> <br />
