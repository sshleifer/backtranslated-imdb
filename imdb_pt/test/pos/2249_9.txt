Being an Israeli Jew of a naturally sarcastic nature, as well as a different and independent movie lover, it always gives me pleasure to see a film that has a view on the holocaust that is sensitive and respectful, while being original and unusual. While I did not read the book? or, by the way, have you heard of her existence before watching the movie? and therefore can not, like some other reviewers, comment on how they compare in comparison, Everything Is Illuminated gave me great pleasure, and I can certainly comment on that. To label Everything is Enlightened, a film about the Holocaust would do great injustice, even if it is undeniably on the Holocaust. So label it as a comedy or a travel movie, although it's about a trip and it's as exceptionally funny as it is moving. Is everything lit up about Jonathan Safran Foer ?? played minimalist perfection by Elijah Wood, in the most dramatic dramatic performance I've ever seen him yet, with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals everything ?? a young American Jew and an obsessive collector of family heirlooms and historical artifacts, who travels to Ukraine on a journey to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. It's also about Alex, his tour guide through Ukraine, and Alex's grandfather. What's fascinating about these characters is that at the beginning of the movie they seem like a comic relief to balance the melancholic nature of Wood's character; but both Alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film and end up being at least as important as Jonathan. In fact, Boris Leskin as the blind grandfather, grumpy and self-declared, turns out to be the best dramatic performance of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the surreal nature of the film and the characters, the beautiful blend of original acoustic music and Russian folk music, sensitive cinematography and the chilling contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history, which made Everything Is Illuminated a powerful and exciting experience for me was that Alex and his grandfather took a very different and original point of view on this painful subject; several excellent films, such as The Gray Zone and Downfall, have already given us the view of the lower-ranking Nazis who are presented as human beings who are not necessarily aware of the moral implications of their actions but are caught up in the reality of war. Everything Is Illuminated presents a rarely seen point of view: Alex's point of view is that of a young man born many years after the war, who sees him as little more than a cold historical fact, horrors of his own people? and maybe your own family too? were able to. The change in Alex's attitude? and that of your grandfather ?? toward Jonathan, toward the Holocaust, and toward the Jewish people in general, makes the film a fascinating and original study in the development of the character. Everything is Illuminated is a fantastic directorial debut for actor Liev Schreiber, and one of the most original and unique films of 2005. It is a highly recommended viewing experience, especially or anyone interested in the holocaust and the Second World War.
