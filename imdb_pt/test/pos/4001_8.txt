Chi-hwa-seong (Painted Fire) chronicles the life of Korean painter Jang Seong-ub in the midst of the changing political landscape of the late nineteenth century in Korea. <br /> <br /> However, the themes of this film center around the process of artistic creation through the fire of the artist's desire and the expectations and demands of his audience and society. <br /> <br /> Jang seong-ub is masterfully played as a complex character that shifts from the innocent emotion of youth to a hardened and tortured alcoholic soul. This characterization mirrors the anxious young artist who finds it increasingly difficult to invoke the spirit of artistic creation within himself without letting the creative fire come out through drinks, erections, and desires. <br /> <br /> Although this character development proceeds In general, gradually through the film, Jang's emotional complexity is still played in a constantly oscillating way, building the end of the films. Curiously, the film's set-up parallels this artist's constantly changing and seemingly wild fire and fire as the scenes alternate seamlessly from one moment to another without any conventional "hint" to the audience that such a change will occur. For example, many scenes would apparently change in the middle of the conversation, picking up at another location and location. <br /> <br /> The visual setting of the film is presented beautifully and also oscillates from an austere (and perhaps somber) black and white scene. to more colorful and lively environments that again parallels Jang's paintings, whether in simple black ink on white paper or with added color. Color rainbows enter the film in spots as the artist observes nature and especially the women who are then reflected in their paintings. The theme of the individual desire of an artist to create versus the expectations and demands of society arises in the film through various points, including class distinctions, government domination over the artist, norms accepted from the artistic elite and the basic desires of the masses. Instead of creating his own completely original works, Jang finds himself mainly recreating works of other artists throughout East Asia. The question then arises whether the recreation itself deserves artistic merit. <br /> <br /> I would like to be more familiar with the political events of the period to understand how they linked to the story - but beyond any comparison with the current role of the Korean government in artistic expression and / or censorship that did not I can comment <br /> <br /> Overall, an extremely well-represented film and cinematography is often breathtaking. A great movie to watch and then ponder over.
