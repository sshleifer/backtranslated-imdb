I must admit, I liked this movie and I do not think it's all misogynist. It could be legend, three ways to look at LiV Tyler. Three different men become obsessed with the same woman, and tell their stories to very different characters: A man (John Goodman) tells his story to a priest (the very funny Richard Jenkins). For Goodmans charcter, the character Liv Tyler is an idealized saint, the second coming of his sisters wife, Theresa. For the character of Paul Riesers (who tells the story to a psychiatrist (a fine, understated performance of the great Reba Mcintire), Liv Tyler's character is simply the subject of (eccentric) sexual fantasy. Finally, Matt Dillons described his side of the story for a despicable man, played by Micheal Douglas.All these obsession narratives are told simultaneously, and all are fun.I will not give.
