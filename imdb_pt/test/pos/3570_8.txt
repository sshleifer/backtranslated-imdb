This film is one to pass the short time, entertainment, but who then could be done in any country, has nothing that identifies "the Colombian." Whoever looks for the themes of supposed Colombian cinema or social and politically correct and what is called "compromising", is better than not going to see this film. Some for drug trafficking, or the fight is no reference neither farmer and worker, nor wing guerrilla and political kidnapping. <br /> <br /> Corrupt police is a person who could be Mexican, Russian, Italian or Chinese, and also the protagonist, an Argentinean photographer, could be Venezuelan, Peruvian or Filipino and the frequent "boludo" in his parliaments could be replaced by another slang word from any other country without the character or story changing. The important thing is that it is a very decently told story with certain images and performances. Its quality is almost of TV movie but of the good ones. That if a movie like this deserves or does not deserve support with public funds a bit is a classic discussion "mamerta".
