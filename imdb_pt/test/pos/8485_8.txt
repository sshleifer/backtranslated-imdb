Let's not shudder here, Taylor Hackford's film undoubtedly has little to do with the biopic, as well as Jamie Foxx's exceptional career performance. Do you remember the year they delivered the special effects Oscar to Terminator 2, unchallenged? They should do the same with the gong for Best Actor this year. <br /> <br /> That Ray Charles's story worth filming is not in dispute. In fact, the many flashbacks of his traumatic childhood are well treated and judiciously used. But for such a unique life, the film seems incredibly stereotyped and familiar. It follows the model of the "history of a defective genius" almost to the letter: difficulties and exploitation, women and drugs, recording fights, band disputes, rehabilitation, yes, yes, yes. And surely there was more humor in your life than we are treated here? <br /> <br /> I appreciate the music of Charles, but where cut-to-length interviews would have kept the story going, Hackford delivers with almost total long interpretations of many songs - in gin, in the recording studio, in movie theaters. concert, infinitum. Narratively, and for the non-devotees, they begin to act as a cinematographic brake. This may sound like a hard trial in a biopic, but with a catalog as extensive as Ray's, we need to sample some of the whole plate. Otherwise, we would buy the albums. <br /> <br /> Intrigued as I was, I looked at the clock more than once. So, for all the brilliance of Foxx, maybe Ray would have been better served as a parody of HBO?
