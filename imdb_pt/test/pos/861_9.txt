Saw the movie at the Hollywood Film Festival in October '04. Mark Robertson had a great chance to write an extremely difficult part for his first movie and was worth it in his cast of Kelly Overton. I had a strong feeling that she came from the theater, so I looked at her here and ... surprised, I'm right. More Hollywood actors should follow their lead, give up the expensive acting lessons and go back to the theater because only with this kind of training will you be prepared for a ride like this. For all the great things I can say about the film and the director (and there are many), I can not stop talking to people about Kelly Overton's masterful acting. We'll see more of your work, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mark and Kelly on a daring movie. Get out in the theaters so I can bring all the people I did want to see the movie as fast as possible!
