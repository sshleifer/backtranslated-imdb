I saw this movie as a child and I look forward to seeing it again. he survived? I do not know the 1980 version entirely as being fluff. I'm sure there are many who do not feel it necessary to preserve these films. It's so unfortunate to find a lost jewel after she's gone. Young people today do not realize the hallucinatory quality and impact on the life of someone a movie seen in early youth can have in adult life. This movie, "The Blue Lagoon" had that effect on me. How many of us wanted to find ourselves in a place away from the fears and chaos of the modern world? This was an idyllic story of a boy and a girl on a tropical island. there are problems to be sure, but in the end they fall in love and have a baby. Life should be so simple and beautiful.
