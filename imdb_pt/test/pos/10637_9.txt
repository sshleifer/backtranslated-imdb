I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2001. La Pianiste reinforces the "Austrian = somber" thesis I am formulating. Isabelle Huppert won a well-deserved Best Actress Award at Cannes for her portrayal of a woman who, in her efforts to achieve the artistic ideal, loses her humanity. Caught by her talent, she suppresses her emotions and her sexuality until they can only be expressed in distorted and terrible ways. When a young student falls in love with her, our hopes increase, but are soon thwarted by the realization that she can not experience love in the way others can. It's too late for her, and the last 30 minutes of the film's anguish are, so to speak, devoid of the beautiful music that took the first 90 minutes. The message seems to be that the music itself is not enough without the life and beauty it is describing.
