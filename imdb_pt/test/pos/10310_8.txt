I think the movie was very good. Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan's subject, performance and music were wonderful. Although the director succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male-dominated culture, he neglected Phoolan's character a little and focused more on the violence she faced.
