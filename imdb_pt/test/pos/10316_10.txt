There are one or two other Shemp-era short films I like best (ie SCRAMBLED BRAINS), but I think you can say - without much argument - that in this particular episode, Shemp gives his greatest comic performance as a puppet after returning This episode hardly ever stops happening: from Professor Shemp Howard's voice lessons with Dee Green, who breaks the glass, to his futile attempts to win the hand of a lady in marriage (this is your bunnies ... you're going to marry me * click *) with the noisy finish, never fails to leave me in stitches. <br /> <br /> I would be remiss not to mention that immortal scene with Miss Hopkins (the always lovely Christine McIntyre). By chance, is she not dressed and passionate in greeting the man she thinks is her Cousin's Basil? Who knows, maybe the real Basil was a "very" distant cousin, which makes it legal in some states (as far as I know). >: -]
