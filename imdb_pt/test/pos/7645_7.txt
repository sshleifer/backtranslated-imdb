This is a peculiar heist / caper movie, which seems predictable at first and then continues to surprise the last scene. The protagonist is a grifter who will work on a small carnival, where he pays to kill the wife of the belly dancer, Divana, and ends up falling in love with herself. She is seductive, complicated and deadly and she continues to disappear and reappears as a kind of magic trick. The other props of the film include his dubious husband / employer (played by the talented Armand Assante), some mafia bosses and the most important to the plot, a suitcase full of money. Just like the old "shell game", the one in which you have to guess which pea is underneath you, you will be guessing who has the money, and like the victims of the hawkers who run these games, you will probably guess wrong . Dagma Dominczyk, as lovely Divana, is a talented artist and a real idiot, whether she's dancing with the huge snake around her shoulders or working on all the unfortunate men in her orbit. Norman Reedus is good as the young crook who is baffled by the indescribable beauty that he was paid to kill. Do not count on him, however, for him turns out to be smarter than anyone gave you credit for. This weird movie is worth a look.
