I honestly did not think at first that this movie would make me laugh like hell and admire the great bloody effects, man, I was wrong! From the beginning to the end, the film showed great bloody effects, accompanied by forgeries of other titles like "Evil Dead" and "Gremlins". This movie can be compared to Peter Jackson's artwork, although this movie is not as bloody as "Braindead", but I hope these guys make another splatter movie.
