I like Armand Assante and the summary of my cable company sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably again. <br /> <br /> The initial part is difficult to follow, but then goes off. I believe the writer did a good job of tying loose ends. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances are not convincing, but maybe it's because I was always expecting some kind of double-cross. In that case, the bad acting would be the insincerity of the characters interacting with each other, so it fits in very well. <br /> <br /> The important thing is that the owner of the carnival (Assante) is laundering money for a local casino. And his lovely snake wife (Dagmara Dominczyk) wants to steal it. She complains to "Archie" (Reedus) how terrible her life is, and how he could help her out of it. <br /> <br /> There are three or four plot twists in the story (which is probably the reason for all these loose ends), and just when you think it solved the mystery, something else will happen. <br /> <br /> My 8/10 score is mainly for the plot. <br /> <br /> I won Do not say anything else - I do not like spoilers, so I do not want to be one, but I believe this movie is worth your time.
