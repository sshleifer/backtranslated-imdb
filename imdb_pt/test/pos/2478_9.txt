The rarely seen Punishment Park, by Peter Watkins, is a brutal and uncompromising political weapon amidst an endless desert landscape. A festival of left-wing anti-authoritarian abuse and no excuses, the adventures at first seem so exaggerated and revolting that they could seem like a distant fantastic dystopian alternative story, which Harry Turtledove would enjoy. But once we dig deeper and really pay attention to the abominable diatribe that comes from those who head the tent court, as well as the rifle guards guarding the bloody affair, our eyes are really open. Suddenly we realize just how prescient Watkins' film production is, and much of that is the kind of neoconservative discourse on young culture and the legality of the divergent thinking of today's politicians. Granted, a lot of what was drivel pouring out, so too, but it really shows us how little has changed, and tells us how, in a way, we are closer to a world where Punishment Parks would be a real and scary operation. <br /> <br /> The main actors in almost every scene are experienced non-actors, mostly chosen for their reckless political views and the desire to put them in front of the cameras. This lends an unprecedented amount of authenticity to the whole experience, for we never, for a second, question the reality of all the chaos. Filmed documentary style with 16mm film, this looks like a bold documentation of some despicable government test project that was rated until found years later. At least it seems to have this story now, perhaps not so much when it was (ill) released. But this gives added weight to all the proceedings and helps draw you into this incredible not-so-alternative universe of torture for doomed dissidents.
