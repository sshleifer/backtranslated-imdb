forget about the over-rated "Batman Begins, this is the final Batman movie you will not want to miss. This movie has it all, and it totally surpasses the first mega hit of 1989. It may not have done as well as the first one at the box office, but this is certainly a much better film, the visuals are incredible, Burton works his magic as he always does in his films once again, the city of Gotham, the hunting place of the Batmans, is an incredible sight to see Tim Burton and screenwriter Daniel Walters go a step further to bring an emotional connection with these characters. The penguin, played with the characters, is a very good story and the two villains are very interesting, much more interesting than the comic books. perfection by Danny Devito, is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge against the world that denied him, too disgusting to watch at times, but he has some of the am most classic lines that a villain could pronounce in a single movie. the other villain is Catwoman, played absolutely brilliantly by Michelle Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives a WOW performance, and completely steals the show until the last and current live action of Batman. it also has a tragic background. her name is Selina Kyle, and she is a very shy and boring secretary to a shrewd business man named Max Shreck, who later kills her by pushing her through a window. somehow, she survives and is "awakened" by cats, and decides right there to become the legendary Catwoman, not before, of course, the incredible sequence in which she completely releases and destroys her entire apartment in one of the most Oscar . performance worth of rage and anger that I have seen in an actress. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton once again wears the cover and the hood as Batman and also as Bruce Wayne and THIS is much darker. there's not much to say here except that Keaton is simply the best actor to play Batman. he just exudes cool, and he has a kind of approach to Clint Eastwood to play Batman, and he's very somber. he does not talk much, and when he does, it sounds really cool and he does not make his voice sound all fake and false. he walks around Gotham as a man possessed by his own inner demons. He's psychologically upset and you know it. in this tour he takes 2 of the most famous villains to grace the world of batman comics. <br /> <br /> I have to say, despite the grandiosity of the action scenes, like the scenes with the coolest Batmobile. ALWAYS running down the street beating thugs on the floor and batman sliding through Gotham, it's the romantic angle between Pfieffer and Keaton that really makes this movie a classic for anyone who wants to see the REAL Batman in action, I classify this as a 10, I'd give more if I could.
