Dragon Ma (Jackie Chan) is back, having rid the seas of the dreaded Pirate Lo. Back on the ground, he is assigned to the police force, where he must clear corruption and crime in a local suburb. Along the way, he is caught up in the fate of several Chinese patriots who seek solidarity and support for their revolutionary cause. The Chinese government Manchu is behind these revolutionaries, and anyone in their path is in trouble, even if they are in the police force. I had high expectations for this movie after I saw Project A. But, sadly, I was a bit disappointed. There is little action compared to the first film. There is only one good fight scene until the grand finale. This fight scene is in the "gangsters place" and it's good, lots of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are played. Jackie Chan and his stunt team do not disappoint anything. The ending is a lot of fun, Jackie Chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world. Really exciting stuff! The only bad thing about the ending is that the fights are very short and forgettable. Conclusion: Many funny moments, good acting and crazy stunts. But not enough fighting for a top rating.
