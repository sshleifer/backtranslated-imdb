Okay, let me start by saying that, overall, I do not really like anime. I have enjoyed some of the more-quoted "classic" series, but I consider the medium as a whole in exactly the same way I do on American television: namely that a good 90-95% of it is total tripe, with the remainder falling from " assertive "to" decent. " This being the case, it's no wonder I do not like the self-deprecating anime parodies out there. I do not understand most of the jokes, and the medium itself reinforces a certain style of humor that does not appeal to me - loud, hyperactive, down, and completely exaggerated. <br /> <br /> So when I started watching this series at the request of a friend, I was prepared for disappointment after the first few episodes. I figured the characters should represent clich√© characters from contours of worn stories, and that their actions should be similarly satirical. I could see where it was coming from, but I did not think it was all so clever - a lot of craziness and fun and crazy occupations, but now we're being ironic about it. "Around the third episode, my opinion changed drastically. It was at this point that the strengths of this series began to manifest. The peculiarities of the order of non-chronological episodes, their sarcastic sense of self-awareness, and , above all, intelligent humor with a well-executed straight man. <br /> <br /> In what I consider to be a rarity in any medium, this show features thoughtful spiri- tual interactions between diametrically opposed characters. vaguely irritated protagonist Kyon provides the perfect effect for Haruhi's main character actions, which are generic exploits of "anime-like." It's a break with the formula and works incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Based on this solid foundation, the series also succeeds with a truly phenomenal level of attention to detail.As said earlier, the episodes go out of chronological order.I considered this a trick in the beginning, but works surprisingly well. The chronological sequence of events makes sense logically, but the aerial order of the episodes follows more closely the traditional structure of the Aristotelian drama. The chosen order does not leave narrative gaps that can not be filled by simple inference (but although it is possible to guess what happened in a "preceding" episode, it still feels compelled to observe exactly how those events unfold), and excellent planning prevents any traces of holes or contradictions. I watched the series a second time immediately after completing it for the first time, and was struck by how well seemingly inconsequential events were tied together. <br /> <br /> The last point is indicative of the extreme attention to detail. in all areas of the series. While the "anime" character design scraps a little, the background art is exquisite, realistically rendered based on actual photographic references. The quality of animation is also excellent in important points. For example, there is a musical presentation at the end of the series in which the characters are shown playing a song - this may seem trivial, but the subconscious effect of watching (movie quality) animation that actually matches the soundtrack is incredible. <br /> In short, I love this series for some reason. By its very nature, it's something I do not usually like, but its execution is so unique and well executed that I can not help it.
