I saw this movie for the first time when I was in eighth grade and I remember that it affected me deeply. I saw it again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in a similar way. This is a great film that personifies the struggle of "principle against pragmatism". Voight's character is the idealist teacher who does not give in to any psycho-racist inclination of the superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. This story also epitomizes the struggle of how older people generally resist change and, more specifically, cultural change. Often at the expense of children. When these battles finally boil, Pat Conroy loses and pragmatism reigns triumphant. Or that? The children he has to leave are better to meet him, more exposed to the "real" world and classical music. The other school teacher gained respect for him and learned a lot about himself. A great movie with a heart-breaking ending. I recommend that anyone who likes the movie read the book, "The Water is Wide" by Pat Conroy. He will stay with you!
