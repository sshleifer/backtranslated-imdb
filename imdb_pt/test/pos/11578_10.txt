I saw 'The Sea Within' today and I loved it. The actors in the film are wonderful (especially Javier Bardem, of course), but I thought Belén Rueda would have a better role. Lola Dueñas, Clara Segura and, especially, Mabel Rivera perform excellent interpretations. And I can not forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist). <br /> <br /> There are two technical aspects that I love very much: the photograph of Aguirresarobe and the score of Amenábar himself. I liked the song 'Negra sombra' by Luz Casal, with music by Carlos Núñez. <br /> <br /> In short, I think the Spanish Academy should choose 'The Sea Within' to compete in the Oscars. I liked other Spanish productions, like Almodóvar's "Bad Education", but the movie of Amenábar is much better than them. 'The Sea Within' deserves all the awards.
