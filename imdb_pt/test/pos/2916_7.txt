I'll start at the beginning saying "I like this movie". It's overwhelming, it's great, it's exciting and it's fun. Sinhue, the doctor, sits before his little stone hut, writing his memoirs. And what a story this is! Taken from a river and raised by an elderly couple who falls in love with him, he becomes a doctor for the poor. He befriends Horemheb, who sees the glory, while Sinhue sees the cure. And both run into the future Pharaoh Anknaten (forgive my spells), which supports an epileptic fit. <br /> <br /> And this pharaoh has another "fault": he believes in a god instead of in a pantheon of gods. At that time, this was totally revolutionary. Sinhue and Horemheb grow. One night, Sinhue sees a woman who makes him lose his senses. He gives up his practice, sells his parents' house and even his tombs just to spend a night with her. He? I will not tell. Meanwhile, Merit, a tavern maid played with sweet simplicity force of Jean Simmons, falls in love with Sinhue. It falls under his spell and under the spell of belief in a god. <br /> <br /> Victor Mature excels perfectly like Horemheb. Edmond Purdom is sincere as Sinhue, the doctor lost (he finds redemption? Stay tuned). Even Bela Darvi, the woman who steals Sinhue's heart is not as bad as everyone has said. The fact that she was Daryl F. Zanuck's lover had nothing to do with the cast-right? Yeah, right ... still, she was not that bad _ I've seen worse. I think she did better in "The Egyptian" than many of today's young actresses did in anything. I've said it before and I'll say it again - I like this movie. I recommend. That makes you think, despite some undecided acting. Have fun with this movie; Worth it.
