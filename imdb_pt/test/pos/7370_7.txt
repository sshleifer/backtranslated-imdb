This movie dethroned Dr. Giggles as the best horror movie I have ever seen. The plot was great, the plot twists were even better and the cast was great. It's hard to believe they've compiled the most unknown people 8 years ago and they would be big names today! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. 4 teens ruin your car in the middle of nowhere. They stumble into this camp and do what everyone else in an accident should do. Build a campfire and tell scary stories. <br /> <br /> 1. "The hook." Great aperture. Anyone in high school heard variations of that story on graduation night. But they do very well in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. "The honeymoon". OK, this was not the best of the 4. It was very good and you get to see some bullshit. Emphisis in the word "some". It's just your basic creature in the history of the forest. <br /> <br /> 3. "People can lick too." This is a cautionary tale about what happens in internet chat rooms across the country. This segment alone should be seen for parents whose children have access to the internet. <br /> <br /> 4. "The medallion." Now this is the best story in the entire movie. A guy on a motorcycle breaks and goes to this girl's house changes. Very good plot twist. <br /> <br /> The main plot, "The Campfire" has the biggest and best turnaround in the entire film. I will not say what it is because I do not want to ruin everything. I've never been so shocked during a movie in my life! <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A + <br /> <br /> Performance: A + <br /> <br /> Writing: A + <br /> Direction: A + /> <br /> Music: A + <br /> <br /> Overall: A + <br /> <br /> I recommend to anyone over 13 years of age, with the exception of "People Can Lamber also ". Any parent whose child has access to the internet needs to watch this with his or her child.
