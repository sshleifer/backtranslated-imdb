I can get very tired of murder mysteries, except for some really great TV shows. Otherwise, there are many of these murder plot themes. I do not like the subject of the two selfish and overly clever young men who kill as an intellectual exercise, I have no interest in Hitchcock who seems to have been associated with it in any way that I do not intend to find out. But do not get me wrong, the subject itself is excellent, the whole movie is so well done and, of course, Sandra Bullock is superlative as always. <br /> <br /> Sandra's character is (as in Miss Congeniality) not rated by the male team with whom she works, despite her obvious abilities, and the boss ignores her ideas, eventually forcing her aside and giving the case to his male partner. Of course Sandra explains what is happening and is almost killed in a very dramatic ending. It is intriguing how the boy who devised the assassination plan can not allow it to be killed by his colleague - he has a conscience of some sort and may perhaps be "saved while the other is a true psychopath." Sandra's hard shell is caused by misery in her past that is poignantly linked to the murder case, and her colleague, realizing that Sandra is solving this case despite being hindered by the dense superior, finally discovers what happened to herself . teens, that she must now face and exorcise and the last scene shows her departure - hopefully anyway - do just that. <br /> <br /> I can see from the few other reviews I had time to read that this movie would appeal to a broad group - those interested in the two spoiled boys passing the time with their terrible philosophical determination to fool the police and get away with the perfect murder, the relationship between them that is portrayed so cleverly, the hideous links to the heroine's past, a police theme, and a few cigarettes and mirrors - as well as Hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> For those who asked why Bullock's character has a troubled past, I think it would be a much less interesting film if she had been just a detective trying to figure out what was going on, with a willing assistant to help and a macho chauvinist boss. Is the connection between the victim of the murder and the detective necessary to show that the detective is getting too involved or, on the other hand, how would she lose the trust of her arrogant boss and thereby lose her life? This is hardly an original theme; in fact, it is generally an extremely annoying subject, as this chauvinist boss brutally tells his frustrated but obviously inspired, agent to get out of the case and leave it to someone who clearly does not have the skills to solve it. it. although the sidekick is. I was getting very worried about the end of what could happen to Sandra's character, since her emotional involvement in the case and special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime took her dangerously to this case alone. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the relationship between Bullock's character and his companion. This happens in an interesting and sometimes very poignant way. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two boys is definitely intriguing, if that's what you were interested in watching. I felt that things were inconspicuous in some ways, or because the filmmakers did not really want to have boy-boy friends, or why we should not think that emotion governed their relationship. The movie deftly makes you wonder which boy is in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity in various stages. <br /> <br /> There is one thing I would like to have been clarified and this is what happens "after the movie ends" when the character of Sandra arrives at the Court .... you need to see the movie to know why she is there. <br /> <br /> Very well represented by all. I certainly can not agree with those who complained against Bullock's acting - she was superb. The part matched very well with her. The story is thrilling, even though mysteries of murder are not their thing and they are not always mine.
