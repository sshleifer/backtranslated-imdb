Now, Throw Momma from the Train was not a great comedy, but it's a lot of fun and makes you laugh. The title may seem a little strange, but the whole movie is not literally about it, although it's about something as sinister as possible. <br /> <br /> Danny De Vito basically wants to kill his authoritarian mother, and move forward a little bit, some random and funny events happen. The premise is pretty funny, and the things that Billy Crystal and Danny De Vito come in are great. Some of the scenes did not seem to fit for me, but that did not make it a bad movie. <br /> <br /> For what it is, a sullen comedy, does well and must be seen once just to say that you have seen.
