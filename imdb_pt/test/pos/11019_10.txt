I've watched this movie over and over and over again - every time it makes me laugh, it makes me think, and it makes me cry. Robin Tuney does an incredible job of playing Marcy (and I'm glad Kate Winslet and that other woman have turned down her part) is just one of those you know no one else could compare. <BR> It's a beautiful love story of these two very different people in bad situations that come together. They are next to each other, no matter what, even if it is in a strange situation and crazy ways. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you now that it's not for everyone - everyone I've shown to him I would say the results are 50/50 - but if you like it, you'll love it and want to share it with others ! 10 stars all the way!
