I found the movie very good for what I was expecting. Although I'm tired, because I'm afraid of injection needles, I kind of expected them when they were coming. So if you do not like needles, blood, human body and some medical fun, put that movie back and rent another. As the other reviewer commented, I was also pleased with the German attempt to make a horror movie. I'm an American who just moved to Germany to stay with a family and saw it on the shelf. I love psychological thrillers, and I would say that this is somewhere along those lines. A character falls into some places and feels misunderstood. When you try to dig your way and find some truth for a situation, things get a bit sticky and others are not so sure that it is on the right track. So throughout the movie, you become alert about who the anatomy is you can catch a glimpse of and who is skirting the next corner.
