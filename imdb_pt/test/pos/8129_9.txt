Dorms and Runners was one of the funniest movies at the 1999 Melbourne Film Festival. From the UK, it is a young group of flatmates and their various relationship dilemmas. Much of the humor is centered around a self-help group of young men, where they undergo various implements as the "rock of truth." They also go on a 'hunter' weekend with hilarious results. Trust me, you'll laugh your teeth.
