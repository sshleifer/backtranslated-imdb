I took a group of young people who were the same age as the protagonists and this attracted all of us. I agree with the other post, the guy Wilson worked an ungrateful script on a major minor character. It's nice to have a movie for a certain age group (too old for PG, too young for R). It also shows how they think and maneuver in high school. You had to love how well Jimmy Buffet did as the legal teacher. He kept us awake adults. The level of questioning authority of the children was kept reasonable. Their motives were specific and not similar to some ADD. rebel. The scenery and the music were beautiful. Overall, if you liked Holes, this is very similar.
