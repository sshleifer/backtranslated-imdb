The best performance of Gary Busey in a very fluid biography. Since he had a musical background, he was able to make his own songs and it really works. It's always nice to see this good actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well. <br /> <br /> An 8 out of 10. Better performance = Gary Busey. Fortunately, Mr. Busey was nominated for an Oscar for that, losing to Jon Voight at COMING HOME. A low budget movie that does not disappoint, with Mr. Holly's GREAT SONGS. I hope this has done a lot of mass. Busey has never been so popular again for several reasons, but fortunately he has a great deal on his resume.
