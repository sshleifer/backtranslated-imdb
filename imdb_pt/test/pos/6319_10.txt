While this movie may not be the next Evil Dead (Hell that knows maybe, it was only released a year ago) It's worth taking a look. Do not expect a $ 10 million movie. because you will be disappointed. Expect to entertain yourself, laugh and enjoy the experience. All in all movies are MUCH better than many, if not all the low budget horror movies out there. I've seen movies that have spent more than 10 or 20 times what this movie cost to make and ended up being 1,000,000 times worse. The effort that has been put into this film weighs heavily on the setbacks it faces for having a limited budget. Movies are meant to entertain, and this movie certainly does it. In fact, this movie may even open new doors for you to watch movies. It's available on Netflix, if not at your local video store. So watch and decide.
