Golden Boy is humor ecchi (bordering the hentai) disguised as "educational moments". The main character, Kintaro, wanders through the most foolish situations involving women ... It's just that he is shy on the surface, but he analyzes everything until he learns something from him. The most striking feature of the series are the circumstances surrounding his "education", which are completely embarrassing but funny at the same time.
