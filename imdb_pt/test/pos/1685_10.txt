Everything about "Choose Connor" was top = drawer, especially the script and the very proficient work done by the director of 21 years, writer, producer Luke Eberl. . . a talented young man from whom to expect great things. All the acting was credible, the dialogue smart, the theme important. I loved it !!! <br /> <br /> I saw the 2007 Woodstock Film Festival where it was shown twice and tremendously outperformed the audience. It's more than just a rip-off movie - this kid learns a difficult and painful lesson about trust, politics and "the system" -how things really work to fit the personal agendas of those in powerful positions. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone with a working brain.
