What an incredible story and what a beautiful movie! The hat goes to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honor√© de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters in such an easy and powerful way. I watched it hypnotized, almost holding its breath as the story unfolded toward its inexorable end. The execution of this film was almost perfect: simple and pure, play with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute and possessive bond between two creatures that are not part of each other's world. Both are capable of affection, but, ironically, it is the most "evolved" who becomes dependent and possessive, unable to accept the freedom of the other. It is one of the most fascinating and intriguing looks of the many forms of love, and an incredible study on how oppressive and destructive human love can be at times. Only a rudimentary mind would associate this history with any kind of bestiality.
