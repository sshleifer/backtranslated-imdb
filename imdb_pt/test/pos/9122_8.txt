There were heist movies before this, and in fact the likes of Rififi were an obvious influence on him - but The Red Circle is more than just another entry into an overpopulated genre and with this film, director Jean-Pierre Melville managed to create something that both thrilled the surface and gave your audience something to think about. Being cool is as important a feature of the modern crime film as guns and gangsters, and Melville delivers it with this mass movie; the tone of the film is also very relaxed and Melville allows most of the film to bubble under the cold outside. The story has several angles, but the central character is Corey - a thief who is released from prison. His release coincides with the escape of the infamous killer Vogel, who slips under the nose of police commander Mattei during a train ride. The first thing Corey does after the release is steal some money from his former boss Rico, and the second thing he does is recruit Vogel and a shooter to help him get a bang. But Rico and the police are hot on the thieves' tails ... <br /> <br /> The film is set up by four excellent central performances. Alain Delon is calm and calculating as the movie's anti-hero, while Gian Maria Volontè looks formidable in his role as a fugitive assassin. François Périer is also good as owner of a dubious club, while the actual performance highlight comes from André Bourvil in his role as police commissioner. The film lasts almost two and a half hours and is not exactly an exciting ride. However, the director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements. The film features crime scenes, such as shootings, but they are kept to a minimum. The first two-thirds of the movie are actually building the suspense scene at the end. Rififi was most famous for his sequence of assaults-a beautifully elaborate scene in which no one speaks a word. The assault on this film is similar, as it is also speechless, and I must say that I preferred the scene in Rififi; but Melville's ability in the direction and the calm and composed way she represents end up doing well. The film boils down to an exciting climax that completes fine. Overall, this may not please all fans of crime films, since the action is more than a little slow; but The Red Circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.
