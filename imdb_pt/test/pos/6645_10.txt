First of all the story is not as simple as many previous critics tend to emphasize, it's actually a very complex story, unlike the other Bergman films that are more geared towards character study. In Skammen we have two main characters, but as we are thrown from the beginning in the middle of a war, we have no idea who is fighting and why, everything is open for any resolution. This creates enormous tension and makes each event meaningful. As the story unfolds, we are introduced to numerous characters, who are transformed into symbols of humanity on both their dark and luminous sides. We have the example of innocent passers-by who try to survive during an absurd war, the cynical doctor who mocks his patients and provides the only bitter humor in the whole film, the perverse opportunists who try to get the best out of an atrocity. event (character of Bjornstrand), the innocent dead children, the nameless figures almost transformed into animals of the boat etc. All of them are somehow seen through the eyes of Jan (von Sydow) and Eva (Ulmann), their characters are more restrained than in other Begrman films (En Passion) and it is precisely because what matters here is history, the way external events have the ability to radically change human nature. <br /> <br /> Bergman made this movie two years after Persona. where the main conclusion expressed by the only word uttered by Liv Ulmann's character is to INGENT, nothing. It is this: the meaning of art and the meaning of life, the latter being nothing more than a piece that includes all the pieces. But what about war? And especially the annihilators of the twentieth century. In Persona, the only real emotion suffered by the character of Ulmann is when she sees a victim of the Vietnam war turning into a human torch. In Skammen, this idea is extended to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. In an unnamed region of an unnamed country (we just assume that it is Sweeden) two factions that speak the same language fight an absurd war. Jan and Eva are two dreamers trapped in the middle, but their dreams are woven into a kind of counterpoint. Jan is at first an idealist, unable to react adequately to the world and subject to the will of his wife. Towards the end, he becomes a radically different personality, capable of unmotivated, obstinate, ruthless murder (watch the suicide carefully on the boat ... the simplicity of the act is distressing). On the other hand, Eva gradually loses contact with reality and, in the end, she is completely impregnated with her own unfulfilled dream. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the whole film conveys your message very effectively. Bergman places the viewer next to the character, placing the camera in the car with the actors or in an extreme close-up behind the actor. Nykvist manages extraordinary camera control, there are some "manual" effects, very good at making everything look "real". The scenes in which the characters are captured by the army seem remarkably documentary. The script is minimalist, but the story is rather complex. In fact, the whole movie is paradoxical, has an intensity in the subject that contrasts with the coldness and lack of emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed. Nothing is melodramatic here, there is no compassion, no hope and no apparent redemption. But as in the dream of Liv Ulmann, in the end, everything is so beautiful that we can not fail to marvel at it ... It was not so horrible, since it was so beautiful!
