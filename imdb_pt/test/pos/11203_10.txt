After the collapse of Yesilcam (Turkey's response to Hollywood) in the mid-1990s, few, but most observant observers could have predicted a recent outbreak in the Turkish film industry, built on the work of former photographer Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Uzak is the director's third feature and forms a kind of trilogy with his previous two images (Kasaba and Clouds of May), following similar themes and techniques. The film meets Mahmoud, a commercial photographer, living alone in a small apartment in Istanbul, visited only occasionally by his rough and married lover. Yusuf, his nephew, left his village home after the closure of a factory and the loss of his job. The younger man stays with Mahmoud as he seeks fruitless work in the city, drinking coffee and nervously observing young women whom he never addresses. <br /> <br /> The title of the film is translated as "Distant", and the film beautifully illustrates all possible connotations of the word; Yusuf's physical distance from his home, Mahmoud's emotional distance from the world around him, and the generational distance between the two men. <br /> <br /> Ceylan's films rarely contain dramatic intensities, allowing full and rich characters to develop from within. well-framed static photos. He serves as director, producer, writer, cinematographer, and co-editor, and launches friends and family in many roles. It can be expected that this confined and isolated approach to filmmaking will lead to films that are difficult to infiltrate and connect with most viewers, making Uzak's undoubted humanity even more impressive. Ceylan is, however, a better kinematic formalist than a playwright, taking the reigns of past masters of cinematic language like Ozu and Tarkovsky. After seeing Uzak, I can think of a few more suited to the task.
