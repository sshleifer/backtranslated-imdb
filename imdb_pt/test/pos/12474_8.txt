After I first saw this, I thought, "Wow, this is the most spectacular film, visually speaking, I've ever seen." Since that time, I have seen some who have outgrown him, but he is still one of the best in this department. I'm just disgusted with the long awaited DVD that was so poorly done, the quality of this transfer hardly better than the VHS tape. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the jungle are filmed in Cameroon, and "exuberant" is the best adjective to describe what you see. Except for the sounds of the jungle, "seeing" is certainly almost everything at the beginning, since there is almost no "audition", no dialogue until Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) becomes friends with Ian Holm and vice versa .... so be ready for that, if you did not watch this movie. Story-wise, all I'm going to say is that this is not the Tarzan that many of us have come to know in the Johnny Weismuller movies ... but that's not a complaint. For those who want action, and do not care about cinematography like me, you just have to go through that period of silent introduction <br /> <br /> In this version of Tarzan, our hero returns to Scotland (his roots) , adapts to that environment (most of the time ... and a little too fast for credibility, frankly) and then returns to the jungle without Jane. This is supposedly more faithful to Tarzan's books, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> The special effects here were made by Rick Baker, one of the best in the business. Sharp DVD or not, this is still an awesome movie to watch and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes.
