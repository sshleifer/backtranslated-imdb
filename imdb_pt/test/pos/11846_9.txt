I love this movie. Lots of laughs. The acting is good and the writing is really sharp. I'd rather see a hundred movies like this than THREE Lord of the Rings repeating and repeating. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget affair and seems to be filmed on DV but it looks good and Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson are great together. Why do you have a minimum of ten lines? I'm not a critic, just an employer. <br /> <br /> I very much doubt that Quentin Tarantino could write such a funny picture without filling it with gratuitous masturbatory violence. This movie should be seen on more screens than just one. I laughed from start to finish. >
