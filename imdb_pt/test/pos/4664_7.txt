Under the safe direction of F. Gary Gray, "Italian Job" never loses control of being cool and fun. Although the material is rewritten and medium, the film itself is masterfully executed and is satisfactorily good. The tone could easily have been much heavier considering the plot of murder revenge, but F. Gary Gray keeps the tone light with good humor, vulgar dialogues and pulsing music. It's a pleasure to see these malicious guys form a great bond and cling to each other through deception and murder, without ever forgetting to have fun. This is 7/10.
