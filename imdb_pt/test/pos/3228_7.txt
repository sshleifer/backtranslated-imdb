Gilmore's girls are about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 years old. Now the daughter is 16 (in the first season) and they live as sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely. <br /> <br /> I like The Gilmore Girls, but I do not know why. His mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and daughter, named Rory (nicknamed Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, are funny and charming in their own way. There are some funny supporting characters, like Luke (Scott Patterson). He and Lorelai, like everyone else, may even love each other, but none of them really act. They have their little moments. There are a few other supporting characters, most of them very funny, and with their touching moments. <br /> <br /> What I like most is to see the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who is becoming an adult. The dialogue between them is quick, sharp, funny and sometimes also touches. The band they have is beautiful. The Gilmore Girls makes you feel good, so give it a try.
