Some people do not like Led Zeppelin, but fortunately, the number of people against the number of people who do not is unbalanced. I am the proud converter of 2 or 3 fans of Led Zeppelin and the only reason I could do this is because of this DVD. <br /> <br /> First, how can anyone listen to "Stairway to Heaven" or "Immigrant Song" without falling in love with Zeppelin is beyond me, but playing the guitar and not like Page ... This is like being Christian and not liking Jesus. My friend was like "Led Zeppelin sucks!" and I was like, "Oh yeah, watch that!" After about 2 minutes watching Page pick "White Summer / Black Mountain Side" he got stuck on the screen and never said anything bad about Zeppelin since then. <br /> <br /> In case you have not followed the performing metaphor I am calling this DVD the Led Zeppelin Bible. Kept high by the followers and used as a converter for the un-washed pagans. Of course there are some missing things like "Over the Hills and Far Away", a good rendition of "Immigrant Song" and I really did not need 2 versions of "Whole Lotta Love", what the hell , I'll take them. <br /> <br /> Because there is nothing but "The Song Remains the Same" to compare this too I gave a 10 and even if there was more to compare also I would still have given a 10.
