I was able to watch this movie in my French class as part of the French culture. I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was very good, but mostly it was fun especially the guy who played Wendy's brother. Also, the plot was very good as well as convincing and also adventurous as well. <br /> <br /> Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he shows how flies reproduce! :) <br /> <br /> My French is not so good, but with the subtitles I might as well know what was going on. <br /> <br /> WATCH IT!
