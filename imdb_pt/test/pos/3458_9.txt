An impressive film that has brought so much about the disability that usually leaves people scared. It showed how minds can be captured by less willing bodies and how difficult it must be to witness things happening to others that are desired for the disabled individual. <br /> <br /> Love, friendship, fear, frustration, joy, humor and so many other things have been so well captured. The 2 main characters were very well interpreted by the 2 physically capable actors and invited their laughter, tears, concern, joy and discouragement. <br /> <br /> I embarked on this film with a mixture of interest and trepidation, worrying that it might be too much of a game for sympathy or just staying on negatives. However, it was a beautifully crafted story of two friends. <br /> <br /> I loved it.
