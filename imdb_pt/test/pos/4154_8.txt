The Golden Gate is the story of the journey of a Sicilian family from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who expects a more fruitful life, convinces his family to leave their homeland in Sicily, to make the arduous journey through the rough seas and to inhabit a land whose rivers are supposed to flow with milk. In short, they believe that, risking everything for the New World, their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. Images of the New World are optimistic, intelligent and highly imaginative. Silver coins rain from the sky on Salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he will be in the New World; carrots and onions twice as large as humans are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health, and milk rivers are flooded and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will produce. All these images are surrealistically intertwined with the characters and help complement the realism that history reveals to the public. The contrast between this image versus the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps to provide hope while they are aboard the ship to the New World. <br /> <br /> The trip to the New World is filmed almost in complete darkness, especially when sea storms roar and almost kill people inside. The shadowy reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey to the New World itself. The Old World is described as indigent and primitive. This is shown when Salvatore comes together to sell the few possessions he has left (donkeys, goats, and rabbits) to get the proper clothing he needs to enter the New World. I found it rather interesting that these people believed that they had to obey a certain dress code to be accepted in the New World; was almost suggesting that people had to fit into a particular stereotype or mold to be recognized as morally appropriate. The most powerful image of the film was when the ship was leaving her homeland and leaving for the New World. This photo shows an overview of a crowd that slowly seems to separate, describing the separation between the Old and the New World. This shot also suggested that people were being pulled out of everything that was once familiar, wanted to divorce their living conditions and were willing to enter a world that was more promising. <br /> <br /> As he later contrasted how the New World looks visually, the Old World looks gloomy and gloomy compared to the bright and misty New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty was never shown through the fog on Ellis Island, but it remained hidden. I think this was an intentional choice of direction that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty advocates: "Give me your poor, your tiredness, your hunger" seemed a joke about what these people had to go through when they reached New world. When they arrived in the Americas, they had to undergo rather humiliating tests (ie de-worming, math, puzzles, etc.) to prove themselves fit for the New World. These tests have completely changed the prospects of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore's mother had the hardest time to conform to the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World demanded was deprecating and rude. Salvatore does not change much beyond his attitude toward what he felt the New World would be compared to what the New World actually seemed to be disappointing to him. This attitude was shared mainly by everyone who traveled with him. His character bows deal more with a cherished dream being much disturbed and a somber reality that had to be accepted. <br /> <br /> The film seems to make a strong comment about preparing to enter a heavenly and civilized society. Cleaning, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Adhering to these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior, and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps this is a commentary on how the United States learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to ensure that these pests did not infest and destroy. Although the rules seemed rigid, they were there to protect and help the people to flourish.
