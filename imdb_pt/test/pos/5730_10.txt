Most of us in high school probably did well without having to take a Physics course - I know not. But after watching this program, I certainly would like to have. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a guide to the 'Holy Grail of Physics' - the quest to unify all the fundamental forces of the universe into a 'main equation' that eluded Einstein during the last years of his life. Brian Green, a professor at Columbia University, presents this hallucinatory theory in a wonderfully simple way and leaves us with even greater appreciation for the universe we live in. <br /> <br /> We start with the tempting possibility. of a "master equation" that could unite and explain everything ... * everything! * in this universe, including the four fundamental forces that we know exist: electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, and gravity. Green takes us on a tour of how our understanding of the universe came into view with the work of Newton, then Einstein, and later, later, for the revolution of physics at the quantum level. <br /> <br /> It is at this point that we are faced with a problem that has plagued physicists for years, and that nobody has been able to solve yet. How can we unify all these forces we know together? We find, as Green constantly points out the whole problem - that the answer to this baffling problem could be in string theory. However, if we want to describe the universe in terms of string theory, there is a very large price to pay. <br /> <br /> It turns out out of the mind to dull mathematical equations of string theory, which, as a consequence, we find that we could be living in a universe filled with not only 3 dimensions that you and I see every day more 1 (for time), but rather that we can actually live in a universe of dimensions. But the mathematics that arises from this theory does not stop there - there is the possibility that there may be parallel universes; some of them right next to you and me! Could we possibly take a theory that would lead to such consequences in earnest? As Green points; we still have to find out completely, but we know that the mathematics that came out of these equations is already showing us that the universe still has much to show us. <br /> <br /> For those of you who fear you will not be able to understand the concepts of this program - do not be afraid. Professor Green does a wonderful job of putting an end to mathematical and harder concepts in physics, and instead focuses more on the * concept * - which, when you get all the mathematics out of it, turns from a monstrous to an incredibly simple and as Green constantly points out, 'elegant' concept. Viewers of this program do not need background in science; the concepts are so simple that even a child can understand them. <br /> <br /> When you finish this program, you will really understand the wonderful and mysterious universe in which we live.
