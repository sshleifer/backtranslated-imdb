I only gave nine stars instead of ten because I do not really approve of pornography. pornography has a useful purpose in society (I can not say I can always think of one) but it probably does. <br /> <br /> Separate personal views, I really thought this movie was pretty funny. I did not buy this movie because it was pornography, I bought it because I'm one of those obsessive 'Alice' watching anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. I own almost every version there is on DVD, so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this. I must admit that I was shocked beyond my expectations, and the whole thing would have been completely offensive had it not been so funny. besides, the music is very good and I like musicals. <br /> <br /> Not everyone can make a good nudist musical. anyone who has seen "The First Nudie Musical" knows what a stinking bomb was. Considering the low budget with which Bill Osco worked, 'Alice' is quite remarkable as a musical (it's better than some musicals made with expensive budgets). <br /> <br /> The film can not totally escape the filth of pornography. I usually watch the XXX version for full shock effect and some of these scenes are scandalous (scandalous because we're talking about Lewis Carroll). I felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene in which 'Alice' (Kristine DeBell) begins to masturbate. it made me feel like a voyeur. and the free lesbian scenes with 'Alice' and the kittens were a little overdone. <br /> <br /> The film has a great sense of humor about everything, however. there's a particularly funny moment during the Queen's orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says "who do I have to F-K to get out of this movie?". Hilarious. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I buy the whole sex is good for you ball your brain out philosophy here, but sex is human, and nothing human makes me angry (I do not know if I really feel like this , but I could not resist saying that) some people think everything should be about sex. Do not know. Geez, just show some responsibility and decorum. This movie definitely earns points for the sex-minded, but I will not force your luck the next time you can really scare someone. I mean, we're dealing with children's literature here.
