Ronald Colman plays a prodigal son. While he is not a bad guy, he is a little flighty and has not done much with his life besides traveling the world and having a good time. Now that his latest venture in Africa has failed, he is on his way home to England. His rich upper-class father plans to play him in the ear, though thanks to Ronald's winning style, he is reluctantly received with open arms. <br /> <br /> At this point there are two women in your life. -showgirl Myrna Loy and rich girl Loretta Young (who is already engaged). How all this will work and Ronald will behave and act as a responsible adult - these are the main themes of this nice little movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie and it certainly will not be change your life, but it sure is a lot of fun and fun. Most of this is due to Ronald Colman's always brilliant acting. Heck, at the height of his career in the 1930s, he could have played REEFER MADNESS or some other coward and still made it fun and enjoyable because of his charming personality. His seemingly effortless style in this movie makes it so easy to like him and it's easy to see why Loretta Young and Myrna Loy are in love with him in the movie! In addition, the writing is very witty and makes it a pleasant romantic comedy.
