I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 in the morning. My brother and I were surfing the channel and we see only the young Russel Crowe. But not the phone playing Russel Crowe we know and almost love in the states. This film, to my surprise, was incredibly creative and hilarious. He stars in a cast of clumsy teenagers with hilarious stories of bizarre sexual experiences, including a cunning salesman, prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you're lucky enough to come across this movie, I highly suggest you get it. I have to say that this movie was incredibly fun and I thank the good people of Australia ...
