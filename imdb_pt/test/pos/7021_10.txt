Dirty Dancing one of my favorite movies. I only watched ABC twice because I did not get a chance to buy it or rent it from Blockbuster. I had no idea that Jennifer Gray was 27 at the time she made the film because she was very convincing in her teens. Compared to some women in Hollywood, she has a very annoying chest, which is why I was so easily mistaken at her age. So, physically and emotionally, Gray comes out playing a teenager very well. I also loved dancing - who would not? In the two times I've watched Dirty Dancing, I still want to look for dance lessons. I also love the soundtrack and recognize some of the songs from when I was eight or nine. I would love to watch it in my theater class, and I will ask my teacher at some point if there is any part of the film that he can use for educational purposes. It's so much better than the things he's done watching us last year. And the ending was absolutely fantastic. This is one of the highlights of the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I'm looking forward to the first day back at school because of Dirty Dancing! Who could ask for a better influence of a movie with that kind of title?
