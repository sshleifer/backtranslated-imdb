A classic movie from the late 1950's. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a sense of the fifties (which I love). The appearance of the contemporary film "Far From Heaven" reflects exactly this type of film (and I suspect that this film may be one of the models). A silly, clear story (hey, it's 1959!), But like a movie - glorious! As a reflection of society, extremely interesting. And as a witness to how Hollywood breaks with the idealistic picture of American sexual customs, fascinating.
