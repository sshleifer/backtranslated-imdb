Wow!! the French are really getting the hang of it. If we look at the first Asterix movie, we see a good story with good actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardeu), but a very bad special effect. In a fantasy story like Asterix Special Effects are really important. Well .. they made it right this time! Look great. I personally think Mission Cleopatra is the best Asterix story ever written. In the movie there is not a moment when you are bored. Go and watch it! One thing! they were not exactly by the script which I think is a bit of pity. For example, in the comics that the Obelix breaks the nose of the Sphinx, immediately all small shopkeepers begin to break the nose of the miniature Sphinx. (very funny to see) .. Well, they didnt put it in the movie, instead, they buried their nose under the Sphinx. Asterix: "They'll never look for it here" (think again). It was funny, but not as good as the original. Another thing I did not like about the movie was their choice for the song. He made the children's film. But never less ... It's a must C! <br /> <br /> Grz Da Jean Holland
