This movie is incredible due to the fact that it showed how good designs really looked like in the 80's, the animators were not lazy as they are today, the cartoon had many details with very few features they have compared to what we have today. more people would ask these cartoons to be retransmitted then maybe all the other 80's cartoons would be shown on television again, so to finish my sentence I would just like to say that this was a drawing that I grew up with and really would like it to be on television again.
