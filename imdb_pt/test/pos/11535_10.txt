I can not for the life of me understand why the rating here for this movie is so low. This was one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen this year. That really touched me. I was anticipating this movie for several months and I thought to myself, there is no way he could possibly live up to the expectations I had for him ... since I built this in my head as much as I did. Well needless to say, not only meet my expectations, but surpassed them. Jordana Brewster and Cameron Diaz were excellent in every way. His acting is excellent from afar. Both were in their element and completely natural to the roles. The sites were absolutely beautiful. Each shot shot was perfectly captured and fit nicely into the mood and atmosphere. I found this film very touching and took it very close to the heart. I would even say that this could be one of my all time favorites. At the very least, I could certainly see it again and again. <br /> <br /> I swear I could not find a flaw in this movie. It's hard to say that about any movie. I highly recommend this. It is touching, it is significant and says a lot about human nature and family. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. Well done by all.
