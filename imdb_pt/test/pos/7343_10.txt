Somehow, somewhere, somewhere .. you have to see this movie. Breathtaking aerials and incredible incredible performances from highly talented actors. Do you think Cirque du Soleil surprises you, wait until you see what these two women do - more importantly, the emotional journey and hardships that Jane (Dreya Weber) faces are universal in theme for many women. A superbly driven film that deals with the complexities of relationships, and hold on tight, until you're ready to let go. This masterpiece will touch women and men. Ned Far (director / writer) and the ridiculously talented Dreya Weber (star / producer) only had the courage to tell, with sincerity and sincerity. This movie will hit big - see how you can - or you will not be "in the loop" when it becomes one of the most talked about movies.
