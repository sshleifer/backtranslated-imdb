Great horror comedy by Michael Davis. I was laughing so hard I almost peed! Great performance by Eric Jungman as the good guy who saves the day and great performance of Jack Black-esquire as performance of Justin Urich. He was simply divine in this movie. This guy deserves to be a big star. In addition, Aimee Brooks was good in the film as well as the girl in danger along with the faces of a killer who remembers Jeepers Creepers. The gore for was given in copious quantities and I loved it. I just hope they release an unclassified version. Great Low Budget Horror Comedy. The dead cat on the hotel sex scene is terribly funny! ***** outside of *****
