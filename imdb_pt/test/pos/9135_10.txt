Jean-Pierre Melville is a director whom I have only recently come to know (I need to see Bob Le Flambeur and Le Samourai again to fully understand them), but in watching Le Cercle Rouge (The Red Circle, supposedly based on a saying in Buddhism) I realized that I was watching as clever and absorbing a crime movie as I had seen in some time. Although his film has dialogue, it is mainly to keep the scenes of the film rolling, adhering to the plot. What kept me alert, even in seemingly mundane scenes / sequences, was the emphasis on character movements, or patterns of behavior. Melville has his story exposed, and he's careful to take his time to tell (this may seem boring to some, but it seems to work, as it puts a little more emphasis on the characters / environments' weight in relation to the plot). . <br /> <br /> However, look at each of the four main actors: Alain Deleon as Corey (just released from prison, planning a new assault), Gian Maria Volonte as Vogel (escaping and escapes from custody by hand ), Yves Montand as Jansen (an elderly professional with many years of experience with weapons, a friend of Vogel) and Andre Bourvil as Mattei (an experienced investigator, who is looking for Vogel, and on the toes with internal affairs). Each of these actors performs their parts with precision, detachment, and each of them has their own kinds of moments that tell the public what their personalities may be as well as criminals and police. The sequence of the robbery gives some hints, for example, how the Vogel cops sit next to a female statue as they pass the aisles, or how Jansen picks up a jar and just smells the content (and what a dream that guy creates). Even Corey's movements involving a photograph of a woman arouse interest. <br /> <br /> As engaging and engaging as history becomes, and no matter how great the skills to make it happen (via the director of photography Henri Decae, the editing and musical score of Eric Demarsan), it is the people on the screen who gain fascination, in how they remain faithful to their natures and ideals. It's not a movie that French fans of the new wave can pass up, and modern-day movie buffs may want to take the 140 minutes to absorb the atmosphere of Melville's work. A soft piece of film that is still one of my all time favorites.
