I've been waiting to see this movie for a long time and I finally have! As soon as I heard the title, I knew that this movie would be my favorite movie and when I saw it, believe me, I was not disappointed! <br /> <br /> This movie had everything dance, love and Patrick Swayze! There was so much about it and it dealt with important issues (which were then, sixties), like abortion. <br /> <br /> The dance in this movie was fantastic, just like the acting was! Swayze was brilliant just like Gray was too! <br /> <br /> Although this movie was absolutely fantastic, you can not say you saw it if you did not see the last scene. It really takes your breath away while the whole choreography of the last dance was done brilliantly, you had to dance at the end of the movie and it would not really surprise me if it influenced people to dance! <br /> <br /> Overall, Dirty Dancing is a movie not to be missed and even though half the actors are in the "Where are they now?" period actors will always have this superb movie in their career!
