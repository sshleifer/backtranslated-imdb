Although I fully agree with the previous comment on Toni Servillo's wonderful performance as Titta Di Girolamo, I would also like to add the beautiful footage and editing that transforms this film into virtually a painting. Young director Paolo Sorrentino had the courage to try different types of camera techniques that reminded me of Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. Both used the same style of MTV footage combined with modern music (alternative / techno) making the movie? Le Consequenze dell'Amore - stands out from other crime / mafia films in its genre. Even though the film may start at a very slow pace almost "sec" compared to the fastest Hollywood productions, it should be enjoyed because of its serenity, marvelous portrayal of characters and splendid finale. Definitely a must see for people who like European / Italian cinema. PS Toni is still acting like this, we need an encore.
