"What Alice Found" was a nice find. As written and directed by A. Dean Bell, this is the combination of a road movie with a cautionary tale as well as a journey of discovery. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie yet, maybe you should stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Alice is a case study of a young woman who wants to escape the unhappy life she leads in a New England town. Her pretext to leave is going to join her best friend, who studies at a university in Miami. Alice is the product of the house of a single mother, who is struggling to survive, in contrast to the life of comfort that her friend seems to inhabit. In flashbacks, we can see Alice's life before going on the road. <br /> <br /> Alice, as her namesake in "Alice in Wonderland," embarks on a journey to the unknown that life has not prepared her for. The roads of America are full of predators in search of the weak and innocent. Alice finds a disaster when her car breaks down the road and a nice southern couple helps him when a strange man approaches in the dark with the excuse that he wants to help her. Sandra and Bill convince her to come in their luxurious RV. on its way to the south. <br /> <br /> Nothing prepared Alice for what this couple ends up being. After all, in her protected life, she did not deal with what Sandra and Bill, their new benefactors do during the nights at rest of the American highways. It is a shock to her to realize that Sandra is no more than a prostitute who acts among the crowd of truck drivers who find themselves in these places. <br /> <br /> Alice, brilliantly played by Emily Grace, is a study of how the young woman awakens to the new reality that she can not escape. In fact, Sandra seems so easy that Alice tries her luck in the world's oldest profession in order to raise some much needed money. <br /> Judith Ivey gives a tremendous performance as Sandra. Mrs. Ivey is perfect as the seemingly normal woman, you do not suspect she's doing the nasty thing with the clients she and Bill meet along the way they travel. Ivey is amazing when he reveals the truth about his life to an accusing Alice. Like her husband, Bill Raymond is good at portraying her as the husband, who is actually a solicitor. <br /> <br /> Under the excellent direction of Mr. Dean Bell, the film is not afraid to go to mainstream movies movies do not dare to go. Congratulations to this director who wrote a plausible story and put together the perfect cast to play it for our benefit.
