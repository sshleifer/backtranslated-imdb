I loved this movie well, I loved the romantic part with the girl and the girl ... Rachel (?) 4Take her name ... I honestly was only interested in those too. I loved them in the movie and I want to see more movies like this. but please, no more sad end where they can not be 2! The story of the trauma was all great. =) I was just in Colby and Rachel. ha ha =) everything about this movie was exciting the kind to keep you glued to your place. because I'm sure it will. Honestly, my only personal wish would be more focused between the couple (Colby and Rachel) and at least a decent end. I hated the ending, a better one might have been more thought, not the fact that I had forced death and Rachel had a child. The end would have killed the movie.
