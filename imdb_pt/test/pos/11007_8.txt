_Saltmen_ is a long movie for the genre, and often the pace is much slower than expected by western audiences. That said, I enjoyed it a lot, both in terms of the interesting subject and the magnificent images that this movie contains. Some of the landscapes are really breathtaking, and there is enough of interest that most should be able to survive the saltimbenses with minimal use of rapid advance. <br /> <br />
