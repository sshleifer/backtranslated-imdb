Last night I saw a PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Oddly enough, it was 137 minutes long - a bit longer than the time listed on IMDb. <br /> <br /> At first, I found myself losing interest in this movie because the rather confusing style of footage really lost me. The context for what was happening was missing and I'm glad I stayed with it. At first, a young couple is married and soon after the marriage, the war erupts in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and aboard a refugee ship heading for India. In a refugee center, you see the lady about to give birth - after which the titles of the film are finally revealed. <br /> <br /> The whole focus of the movie then changes completely - to a young girl who is about to make 9 in Madras, India. You see her at her house and she talks to the camera about her life and family. None of this seems interesting or important and you wonder what is missing - and the lady who was about to give birth? My wife and I debated this and finally imagined that this little girl was actually the girl's daughter in the first part of the movie. Somehow she had been adopted and was talking about her life with her mother and father # 2 - although she did not realize that these people were not her biological parents. Soon after this, parents revealed they were total idiots (one of the complaints I had about the movie), how they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her membership and tell in a way which left the girl emotionally confused and confused. Despite a stupid decision and telling her the hard way, the parents compensated for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother. Seeing the impact this had on the girl and the parents (particularly the foster mother) was awesome to watch and it sure piqued my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has been involved in a long, very long and brutal. civil war with Tamil militants, from time to time, for three decades. The family's decision to look for their mother in Sri Lanka was indeed noble, but also a little silly at times - for they were so risky and almost dead again and again just blindly jumping in the middle of a war! This was all exciting and captivating, but it also left me thinking about the sanity of adoptive parents - first you tell her that she IS NOT your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a ZONE OF WAR !!! Of course, the boy really wanted to meet his biological mother, but that really was idiotic in God's eyes. If it were me, I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid - thus avoiding being in the middle of a war! <br /> <br /> Despite my complaints, the movie was lovely to watch and was very gratifying. Far from being perfect, it certainly hits an emotional home run. Also, while I expected this because I've seen several Indian movies, many westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid music that seems to come out of nowhere - this is standard in most Indian films - including those made in Bollywood. (Bombay) and Tamilwood / Kollywood (Madras).
