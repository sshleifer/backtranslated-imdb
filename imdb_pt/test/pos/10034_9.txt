It's true that "They died with their boots on" gives a highly fictional account of the life and career of George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn), but it is notable, especially with regard to the Battle of Little Big Horn. Because it's not a given that a 1941 movie attempts to portray both the American knight and the native American Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) in a favorable light. I'm almost tempted to say that "Little Big Man," in its unqualified anti-Custer position, seems unbalanced by comparison. Also, should not be fooled by the title of the image? This is not just a movie about the Battle of Little Big Horn, it's a movie about it shows the unreliable West Point cadet, the famous Civil War hero, the Indian fighter and, last but not least, the husband. The film begins with Custer's time at the West Point military academy, where his recalcitrance and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits. During a punitive military exercise, he meets his future wife, Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who, like Custer himself, is from Monroe, Michigan. Custer intends to court her, but the outbreak of the Civil War calls him away. Custer's legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes, the largest of which is dedicated to his involvement with the legendary general of southern cavalry Jeb Stuart during the Battle of Gettysburg. While on leave, he travels to Monroe and Elizabeth courts, which promises his hand in marriage. Immediately after the war, Custer and Elizabeth Bacon are married. With Civil War closed, Custer is downgraded, not given a real command and has to go through the meticulously slow promotion process. the little American professional army. When he begins drinking, his wife intervenes on his behalf with former General Winfield Scott. Custer is given command of the 7th Cavalry of the USA, which he trains to be an elite unit. Neither Custer nor Crazy Horse are willing to fight, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through indigenous lands in clear violation of previous treaties. Custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of the Crazy Horse's cause, but rides to battle to fulfill his duty as a soldier, exposing the conspiracy of moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle. <br /> <br /> "Although with little historical accuracy, it is as good as war movies and Western movies in the 1940s: Both Custer and Crazy Horse are played by great actors, neither the Indians nor the Southern Confederation are denigrated, and the courtship scenes with the beautiful Livvy de Havilland are simply charming.The only disadvantage, and that is why I can not give a full picture of 10, is the tendency of racism in the representation of African-American servants; Elizabeth's maid Callie is the stereotypical, fat, superstitious, and humorous black mother. It's also interesting that the film does not criticize either Custer or Crazy Horse, but the greed of the railroad. pressured Washington politicians with semi-criminal methods to break the guarantees they had given to Native Americans. Only a few years later, the hint that American entrepreneurs might think of doing anything remotely questioned would probably have been taken as an indication that the filmmakers were sympathetic to communism. Needless to say, "they died in their boots" omit the fact that Custer's overly aggressive tactics often border on the reckless, exaggerates much of the importance of his involvement with Stuart, and does not mention the lack of recognition before the Battle of Little Big Horn. However, Custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular feats to point out at the Battles of Brandy Station, Gettysburg, Trevilian Station and others, though his feats of guns were not as decisive for the Civil War as " They died with their boots on "suggests. <br /> <br /> In any case, "They died with their boots on" is a well-made war film with Western elements, three prominent artists (Flynn, Quinn and de Havilland), and offers a positive view of the Native Americans, as well as a negative on big money, which would not be seen in major Hollywood productions in the coming decades. It would deserve a 10 if it were not for the racist minstrelization of African Americans.
