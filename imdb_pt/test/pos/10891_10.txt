GoldenEye 007 is not just the best all-time tie-in game, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter to hit the gaming console market. If you are not aware of the plot of this game that is not a problem, because essential is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995, two years before the game's release. <br /> <br /> This is a game full of techniques and styles that would be imitated in many future games, as well as giving the player a wide variety of difficult goals and challenges. The A.I. is smart (especially in configurations of greater difficulty) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment as well as difficulty for any player. <br /> <br /> The introduction of logical hitpoints on your enemies is a great feature. Even the bosses in this game can be knocked over with a straight shot in the head. It's that kind of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, cover up the henchmen while you walk, or trigger alarms and have to go through big shootouts. Because of this, there are many ways to win the game and unlimited possibilities of how you accomplish your tasks. AKA: You can pick up easy paths or difficult ways to beat levels ... and if you do not have a strategy guide, you'll have to figure out those paths yourself (which, I might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day off ). <br /> <br /> This is one of those games that the more you play, the more you are able to value your contributions to the gaming industry. Each time I play, I notice aspects that have been replicated in many subsequent FPS games. So if you have a Nintendo 64, go ahead and shake this sucker and ask for a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because believe me, as a Bond fan, and a casual player, I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the role of James Bond, or just have an incredible and intense gaming experience. <br /> <br /> (Be sure to look for your brother game, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64, following the same controls and uses of very similar weapons.)
