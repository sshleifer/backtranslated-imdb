A ghost story in a typical Turkish school with good sound and visual effects. Taylan biraderler (taylan brothers) made their first plans on a TV show a few years ago, as far as I know. This was kind of like a Turkish X-Files, they had really cool stories but they had no visual effects. This time it seems they had what they needed and used them well. This movie will make you laugh for sure, and it can also scare you. It has a good plot and some young and brilliant actors in it. If you are a high school student in Turkey, you will find many things about you here. There are many clues in the film about its story and ending, some that you understand right now, some make sense afterwards, the dialogues were written very cleverly. So they make the film one of the best Turkish films made in recent years. Do not forget, this movie is the first of its kind in the Turkish film industry.
