They are just stories, some that we want to happen to us, others we never want to happen to us, all about unfulfilled desires. The locations and bodies are beautiful but after the second story all I could think was "it takes more than just beauty to create a real movie." So, of course, the movie unfolds. The stories are on the move except Sophie Marceau can not communicate her story in this movie. Malkovich throws the story to both of them though. The narration does not link the stories, but it helps Malkovich to provoke some thought. <br /> <br /> I'd say it's worth seeing and the best I've ever seen in Antonioni. Given its age - remarkable!
