This movie was fun, if on the whole board. It follows essentially the comic play of two tomb robbers in 19th century England, who move from the conventional snatch into the traffic of vampires, zombies and dead Roswell. aliens. (I have no idea what the Roswell alien was doing there, nor the producers, I guess.) <br /> <br /> But was it funny? You bet. Even Ron Perlman, who is often the kiss of Direct to DVD Death, was very good in this case as a priest who turns out to be the leader of a rival gang of body hijackers. <br /> <br /> A real joy to watch this hilarious movie and a good example of what you can do when you have no bigger egos than life on both sides of the camera.
