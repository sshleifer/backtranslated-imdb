The late director John Frankenheimer directed his first feature film, The Young Stranger, after beginning to direct live television dramas in New York. This film came in the wake of the success of Rebel Without a Cause in 1955. James MacArthur made his film debut as a troubled teenager with a film-producing father, played by James Daly, who does not establish a sufficient relationship with his father. son. Kim Hunter plays the mother, who tries to bridge the gap between her husband and her son. The film uses the popular juvenile delinquent angle of the time to tell its story. MacArthur gets into trouble at a movie theater with a super-zealous theater manager played by Whit Bissell. MacArthur, meanwhile, has to deal with a police sergeant, James Gregory, who is committed to teaching him a lesson. The material could easily have become exploratory, laughable and sensational, as many others of the period did. However, under the confident direction of Frankenheimer, the film is a sensitive portrait of the dynamics of teenagers and parents. The dialogue is realistic and most scenes remain surprisingly well. Some of the scenes with Bissell, as the theater manager, and Gregory, as the police sergeant, are a bit heavy and dated. The performances are uniformly good, which is necessary for a film of this nature and on this theme to succeed. This is an impressive film debut for both MacArthur and Frankenheimer. *** of 4 stars.
