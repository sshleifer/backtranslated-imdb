Me and my roommate won free tickets for a pre-selection, I think you'd call Atlanta, GA, at Atlantic Station. Walking around I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily exaggerated, etc. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It is not exaggeration, and the film is done in a careful balance so as not to make you shrink or say it is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> It is very well done and does not take itself too seriously. That's the beauty of it. If he tried to take himself seriously, he would have failed miserably, but instead carries with him the humor (some unintentional) and some surprisingly good performances by Ricci. Although Timberlake fails miserably in his role, the film is good enough for you to put it aside. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie, if for no other reason than the fact that it's something different to try.
