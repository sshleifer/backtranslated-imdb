Firstly, this movie has no history. It's obvious there have been a lot of rewrites during the production - sometimes the characters make reference to a timeline that is impossible, and that's probably because the timeline of the whole story was never known to anyone on the set. <br /> <br /> said, the movie is kind of brilliant. Pfeiffer is amazing - and I mean incredible, like Catwoman; it blinds the sensual darkness inherent in the character and the good / bad tendencies. Walken is Walken - but even more unpleasant than normal. Devito is not faithful to the comic book when it comes to penguin, but he is good and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keaton is underestimated as Batman. <br /> <br /> And music and style are pure movie thrills. True, the third act does not work. But the last two scenes are knockouts, and of course Pfeiffer and Keaton should be in a trilogy that was hampered by the darkness of the film. That's too bad, because Pfieffer and Keaton had classic chemistry, and they acted on a third party, Joel, you know who might not have had the chance to destroy Batman by an entire generation of movie fans.
