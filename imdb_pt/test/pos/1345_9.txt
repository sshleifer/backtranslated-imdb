OhMyGAWD !!! The Magic Garden is perhaps one of my most vivid childhood memories of the 1970s. Two hippie puppets with ponytails, Carole and Paula danced on swings, told jokes that made fun of the laughter, wore costumes they found in a giant chest called The Storybox, and argued with a pink squirrel named Sherlock who lived in one. of their trees. They could also strum a guitar and sing a beautiful tune. This was a great childhood show. Very 70's feeling. But that's the problem: they do not do shows like that anymore. Too bad. You could say that these two girls really had gold hearts and they loved kids, they were really sweet. MAGIC GARDEN is one of those shows that if they went out with a box set people would buy it because it's such a low MELLOW to walk down memory lane.
