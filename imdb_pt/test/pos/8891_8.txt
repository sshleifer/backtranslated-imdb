Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has a crazy life: his wife (Kate Mulgrew) stole his book and left him, he has a new romance with a girl named Beth (Kim Greist), he does not know how to start his book and his students your writing class are stranger than most. However, a student (Danny DeVito) is even stranger. He lives with his evil mother (Anne Ramsey) and he can not dare to kill her. Then he goes to Larry for help, making his life go from normal to crazy! <br /> <br /> Stu Silver should have done more! The dialogue, the characters, the whole script is almost perfect! And Danny DeVito proved to me that he's more than a great actor: he's a great director! Your son Matilda's movie is among my favorite family movies and now this is one of my favorite comedies. <br /> <br /> It's a dark comedy, most of the jokes are about murder, but it's very funny! All the actors are doing their full potential, whether they are main characters (Billy Crystal) or just smaller one-bit characters (Olivia Brown). <br /> <br /> If you like comedy (who does not?) you'll enjoy it! 8/10 stars.
