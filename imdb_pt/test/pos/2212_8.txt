I had the opportunity to take this independent film and I was impressed with it, despite the lack of enthusiasm in the plot. The performance was very good for all involved. Amy Madigan played the role of a guilty and tired mother, but well-intentioned and determined to make up for her young daughter's condition. However, in the process she neglected her older sister, who is more interested in playing with her brother with savant syndrome and living in a world of escapism. <br /> <br /> The men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles. Christopher Lloyd, in a very discreet role, shows us why he has so much versatility. He plays a teacher who engages in his profession and literature research, but still lacking a meaningful relationship. He and Madigan connect very well in their scenes together, but both know that nothing more can come of their friendship. His wordless goodbye is nothing short of brilliant, a lesson in acting for aspiring artists. <br /> <br /> And in a small role, Fred Savage is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> You can tell why this movie was based on a play, it's probably very good on stage. On the screen, it's not particularly exciting, but it's very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties.
