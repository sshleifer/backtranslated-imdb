Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he did not want to go to the pub because the villagers do not like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds the glass and says: "In the memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub do the same, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does this in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor. Grace is one of the best roles of Kathy Bates. Meredith Eaton steals almost every scene she's in. Rupert Everett does some of his best work on Unconditional like Dirk. The kiss between Rupert and Meredith led me to another outbreak of hysteria. In this day and age of gay rights being questioned, I think this movie should be seen by everyone. As a gay man in my late 1940s, I have seen people lose everything when a loved one dies. So kudo is for everyone involved in the making of this movie.
