When I was in 7th grade (in 1977), I was invited to read the novel on which this was based as part of my English studies. I remember being very touched by it and excited when a TV version came out a year later. Kristy McNichol was a popular TV actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family. in the TV series "Family". It was clear she had the scope and ability to do that part. I remember her as being a little "tough" sometimes, but most of all she does a good job. She carries the movie well. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle is fantastic as the domestic one who seems to be the only one in the house who seems to really care about her. Barbara Barrie as a slightly scared and slightly neurotic mother is also good, as is the young Robin Lively (who would eventually appear as Lana Milford's black widow in "Twin Peaks") as the sweet little sister who seems to be the focus of her parents . affection. Bruce Davidson is also appropriately attractive as the German title soldier. The best performance, however, belongs to Michael Constantine. It is truly powerful and deserved more recognition than it did back then. The bitterness and coldness he expresses make the scenes in which he seems difficult to watch, but it makes it much easier to understand the silent despair of his rejected daughter. Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations. <br /> <br /> The film differs from the book only in small ways. It's wonderful and inspirational to watch, and I hope it's released again on video or DVD. <br /> <br />
