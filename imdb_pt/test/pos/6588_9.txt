This movie came as a gift - an end-of-the-night offer out of the blue - so different from other reviewers that I had no bias. I found myself glued to my seat as the film slowly dictated its own rhythm, its own unfolding. I was drawn to recognize my deep love and humanity as I desired the "good" to prevail - but also forced to recognize ironically that sometimes I was on the side of the "bad guys". The film is quite beautiful - the word "elegiac" comes to mind, and more than that because the film begins and ends in an elegy. Far from being depressing or confrontational, for me, the film recognizes deep suffering - and then, by its cyclical nature - with births and re-births as well as deaths - the film celebrates the fact that, to cite an Australian poet , is "sometimes joy". Oh, Gods, I feel like I just wrote a love letter for this movie - but there it is. Hola!
