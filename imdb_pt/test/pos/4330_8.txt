This is probably the second best of Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best. <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 reminds me of "West Side Story" with a new twist. Not even the recent movie "Gangs of New York" can compare to a New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3, which is plagued not by two rival gangs - but a big gang. A gang who is willing to do things like cut a person to death with an ax if he transgresses on his set. <br /> <br /> Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is full of violence. Thus, as Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III scores with his soft and romantic moments, as well as his violent moments. Only the scenes of James Bond's love interest would do much better. <br /> <br /> And in addition to his 38, Kersee plays with this new weapon called Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of the Dirty Harry movies when Callahan used his .44 Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry. Wildey's weapon gives a big punch and when Kersey kills her, he does not care if the gun has a big kick. <br /> <br /> And that anti-tank missile that killed the leader of the main gang? Well, that's something. Kersey would not use an anti-tank missile as his regular surveillance weapon ... this is too military for him.
