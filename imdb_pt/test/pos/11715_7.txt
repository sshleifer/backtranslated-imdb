Burt Reynolds stars as a disguised police officer who is after a crime boss. Rachel Ward as the high-priced girl he falls in love with. Burt does well in this role and I think he would have done well in more roles like this. <br /> <br /> Rachel Ward is beautiful and sexy on her part ... good pace and history, but something is missing in the equation .. on a scale of one to ten.
