I've never been a big fan of Oliver Stone, many times because I found his films to be forced, preacher and generally flawed. The two Stone movies I really like are JFK and Talk Radio, but Talk Radio takes the cake for being Stone's best performer. Stone is a director on which you are a fan or not, it is safe to say that before watching Talk Radio I did not like the guy and considered one of the most overrated directors of the film industry, although after watching Talk Radio some of my perceptions have changed. Talk Radio is a haunting and entertaining attack on what is now known as the reality show. Talk Radio follows a self-indulgent, dysfunctional, determined, hysterical, outrageous, and disconcerting radio presenter called Barry Champlain. who hosts a controversial nightly radio program in Dallas. Quickly becoming known for his daring and peculiar aerial presence, he becomes a late-night sensation, by which depraved junkies, delinquents, racist, sociopaths, sick, perverts, and idiots call to be ridiculed in the air. The film shows the rise and fall of man's career, carefully making a precise portrayal of freedom of expression. Originally adapted from a play, the film is attributed to the theme of the theater that was originally built around, beautifully broadcasting fierce nature of the film. <br /> <br /> With fierce energy and non-stereotyped air, Talk Radio brings all the joy behind the "crass media". It remains even more poignant today than it was in the late 1980s. The film will deepen studying the likes of arrogance, self-obsession, offensive behavior, controversy, hypocrisy and ignorance. The film shows in a controlled way how good it is to have a personal opinion and freedom of speech, but it is something that should be used wisely rather than shamefully blunt. Stone tries to show how free speech is a crucial importance in life, but it is something to be cautious and cautious about. The film asks the question of "our main protagonist is the same as the sad people who call the program?" <br /> <br /> Stone fabulously creates the main part of the film (the radio station) with an ambition and a cool atmosphere. He then manages to capture the isolation, fear, ambiguity and dangerous emotions that are built into the radio station. Eric Bogosian is perfectly chosen as the isolated, selfish and complex genius, Barry Champlain. It fits perfectly with the paper letting go of its lines with such enthusiasm, urgency, perplexity, brusqueness and finally the daring hilarity of its offensive nature. The performance overflows with spark, which was evidently stolen from an Oscar nomination. His voice matches the character, and the main element of a radio host and his power to act along with tragedy and comedy work brilliantly. <br /> <br /> There is a strong use of editing in the Stone and Talk Radio films some of their cleanest and most rhythmic editions. It uses wonderfully controlled camera techniques, which differ from being calm to getting rowdy. There is a vibrant energy behind the film, with its raw and wonderfully delicious writing working as the centerpiece to the greatness of the film. The impressive and virtuous cinematography stands out in the moments inside and outside the studio, capturing in a most impressive way the city at night. Not forgetting the frighteningly bleak and yet sombrely funny mood of "spiral to decline" is ultimately a remarkable cinema. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is an essential masterpiece, I'm sure you'll be amazed at how great it really is. . I highly recommend Talk Radio to anyone interested in media or film. Talk Radio is a great example of high-level, insightful intellectual entertainment that still offers a well-deserved wake-up call. Finally, if it were not for Eric Bogosian, the film would not be the fun, delightful, and enduring masterpiece it is today.
