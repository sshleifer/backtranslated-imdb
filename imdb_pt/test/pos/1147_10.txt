The Marines portrait in this movie is on the spot. The action scenes are some of the best ever produced in the accuracy of the content. The uniforms and weapons of the US and German troops were perfect. The Berber costumes and armor were perfectly accurate as well. This film could easily be used to teach militaria of the period and has been used by the USMC Academy for this purpose. The scenes depicting Roosevelt's shooting and the rifles he was wearing were beautiful. The acquisition of so many weapons of the period in such good shape is a testament to the attention to detail and presentation that this film must have in mind. Millius is a genius.
