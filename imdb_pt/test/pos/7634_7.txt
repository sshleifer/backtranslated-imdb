Italian clone Exorcist X soft. <br /> <br /> Woman buys statue of the crucified thief. This thief comes to life and turns out to be the devil with fantasies of rape. <br /> <br /> Ivan Rassimov plays the devil brilliantly. Mainly due to his evil-appearing gift. And because he never went above doing nudity. Good for him. <br /> <br /> The leading actress did a decent job. Her wide-eyed innocence and the fact that she looked very naked helped. <br /> <br /> This has a plot element similar to most Italian horror movies. The girl's parents are filthy and depraved. Watch for the details. <br /> <br /> Laura Gemser's husband, Gabriel Tinti, also appears as a random stallion. His portion is basically phoned, but like a cheap beer, it did the job. <br /> <br /> Blame the director for his failures. This could have been a horror / sex classic.
