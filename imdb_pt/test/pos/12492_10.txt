"Quai des Orfevres", directed by genius Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a film of great value, as it is one of the best exponents of French cinema in the postwar years. M. Clouzot, adapting Steeman's novel "Longtime Defense," shows his genius in the way he defines the story and in the way it interlinks all the characters in this deeply satisfying film that, as DBDumonteil pointed out in this forum, demonstrates how Cluzot was influential and how the next generation of French filmmakers is indebted to the master, especially Claude Chabrol. <br /> <br /> Armand Thirard's black-and-white cinematography was magnificently transferred to the Criterion DVD. we watched recently. Working with Clouzot, Thirard makes the most of the dark tones and shadows in most of the main scenes. The music of Francis Lopez, a man who created light music and operettas in France, works well in the context of the film, as the action takes place in the world of music halls and nightclubs. <br /> <br /> Louis Jouvet, who is seen as a police detective, is perfect in the play. This was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a pillar of the French theater. Jouvet clearly understood the mechanics well for setting up his police inspector who is wiser and can look deep into the souls of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from others. In an unfair comment from someone on this page, Jouvet's inspector is compared to Columbo by Peter Falk, the television detective. Frankly, and no disrespect to Mr. Falk intended, it is like comparing a great champagne to a good house wine. <br /> <br /> Bernard Blier is perfect as the jealous husband. Blier had the kind of face one could associate with the man consumed by the passion his wife Jenny Lamour aroused in him. Martineau is vulnerable and does not act rationally; he is an easy suspect because he did everything wrong, as he finds in the middle of a crime he did not commit, but all evidence points to the contrary. <br /> <br /> The other great character in the movie is Dora, the photographer. It's clear from the way she interacts with Jenny, where her real interest is. Simone Renant is tragically attractive as this troubled woman and makes a huge contribution to the film. Suzy Delair, playing Jenny, is attractive as the singer who suddenly jumps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like Brignon, the old rake. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best Clouzot directed during the film. distinguished career and that will live forever because the way he brought all the elements together.
