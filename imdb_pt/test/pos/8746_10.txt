This is a wonderfully brave drama, detailing the various sides of international heroin trafficking - from the hills of northern Pakistan, where opium poppy cultivation, tacitly allowed, occurs on a large scale; the "Euro-Trash" jetsetting in Germany and England that organize the importation of processed heroin into smuggled consignments of several kilos; for end users caught up in the network of addiction and the crime necessary to sustain their growing habit; and finally all levels of international government corruption and hypocrisy surrounding police efforts to control "the drug problem" - this drama is sketched with a wide range of well-detailed characters, a fully evolved plot, and outstanding character-playing. and leasing. <br /> <br /> This puts Hollywood epics like "The French Connection" instead! <br /> <br /> Traffik is a deeply instigating and suspenseful tale about modern drug-related espionage. and the international efforts of many people to try to eliminate it. <br /> <br /> Unlike many crime "dramas" revolving around drugs, Traffik focuses heavily on finding out the social reasons people slip into drug addiction. As one of the characters puts it, "... until we, as a society, build a world in which people want to participate, instead of wanting to escape, we will not be able to stop people from using drugs ..." /> This is a fascinating and totally captivating drama. I recommend!
