Based on Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time," this incredible Eroll Morris film documents the life and work of one of the greatest minds in astronomy history. He contributed more to science, in spite of his debilitating disease, ALS, than a scientist capable of dreaming. The movie begins by telling about Hawking's childhood, and how he was a poor student who was admittedly brilliant. He made his way through college and university, where he was diagnosed with the disease that would take normal functions of his body, but would allow him to continue living and thinking perfectly. <br /> <br /> Morris discusses how the brilliant Stephen's mind developed from childhood to the present, at one point his mother tells how, when she was pregnant, she prophetically bought an astronomical atlas to read while in hospital . Hawking chronicles the timeline of his discoveries while Morris interviews friends and close colleagues who have been fortunate enough to befriend the magnificent man. <br /> <br /> He tells how he was intrigued by the discovery that the Universe was expanding, similar to how a star expanded. Do we also know that stars eventually die and become what is now known as "black holes," if this is the case, will the universe also not begin to contract, reversing itself until we reach the "big crunch"? as Hawking puts it. And when the universe begins to recede, time will not "reverse"? When I asked this question, I began to think that death may not be the end, maybe one day time will come back and our death will become our rebirth and our birth our death. The universe is a great cycle like everything in life. <br /> <br /> That's what Hawking is telling us, everything in the universe is being recycled. This is completely logical and can make your mind marvel in a million directions pondering this. That's why I love this movie and why it's a must-see !!! An 11 out of 10 ... Morris never stops toamaze!
