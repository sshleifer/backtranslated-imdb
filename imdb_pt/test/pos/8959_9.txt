Once again, I'm surprised that Thomas Gibson did not make it to the top of the list early in his career. In this film, Gibson once again demonstrates his ability to understand a character, regardless of sexuality, social status or nationality. Gibson plays a very convincing gay man from the late twentieth century. Suits but not effeminate, afraid of the basic principles of love, Gibson's character touches a variety of emotions. Also worthy of praise is the performance of Cameron Bancroft. His need to be the heterosexual conqueror, as opposed to his best friend's "homosexual achievements", provides dynamics for the relationship that in many ways are unexpected. The chemistry of Bancroft and Gibson is apparent from the first scene in which they appear together. There are many "panels" in this quilt. From gay relationships to direct relationships; from heterosexual relations to the exploitation of lesbian love; This film traverses the broad spectrum of sexuality, having the story of a serial killer at its core. My only regret is that it has taken 6 years since its release before I discovered this movie! I look forward to seeing you again and recommend it to any fan of Bancroft, Gibson or director Denys Arcand.
