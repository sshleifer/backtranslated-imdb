This classic of blaxploitation about a kung fu mom who travels to Hong Kong to avenge her brother's death offers everything you've learned to expect from the genre. Playmate Jeannie Bell (with an afro giant) really kicks her butt and usually loses her clothes very quickly. If you do not take it too seriously, the movie is a lot of fun to watch. Stan Shaw gives a solid performance, Jeannie Bell is a little less convincing. Pam Grier she is not. <br /> <br /> Here is where Quentin Tarantino got his idea for the light switch scene in "Jackie Brown". <br /> <br /> Don Julian's soundtrack is a gem and is often used in rap songs.
