I must confess that I am a big fan of the almighty David "the Hoff" Hasselhoff since he starred in the 1980s TV series, "Knight Rider." Whether it be his extraordinary debut as a libidinous basketball player in the hilarious and cheeky "Revenge of the Cheerleaders" or his brilliant portrayal of a dashing prince in the science fiction jelly "Starcrash," Hoff has proven over and over again that he is simply an actor fantastic (and shamefully understated) supreme. Hoff stands out here as Gary, a skeptical and skeptical photographer who, along with his reprieved girlfriend and virginal Leslie (attractive brunette Leslie Cummings), investigates a haunted hotel in ruins located on a remote island off the coast of Massachusetts. They have been researching witchcraft over the years and the last owner of the hotel was an actress who allegedly practiced the black arts. A family of fights also appears on site to check out the hotel. Very soon several people begin to be expelled in several horrible ways by the mysterious Lady in Black (a mysterious Hildegard Knef). <br /> <br /> Granted, the rest of the cast gives Hoff a run for his money. : the always clever Linda Blair projects her usual charm as a courageous pregnant woman who ends up becoming possessed (natch!), the legendary jazz singer Annie Ross complains with a cheerful tone like an old bat (poor Annie ends up being burned alive later that she has her lips sewn and she's hung upside down in a chimney), and beautiful blonde Catherine Hickland conveys a handsome sexual appeal from every attractive pore like a lusty slut. Direction competent of Fabrizio Laurenti, a suitably frightening atmosphere, the lustrous and glossy cinematography of Gianlorenzo Battaglia (Steadicam tracking fluids are especially pleasing), the garish special effects, the stinging stridency of Carlo Maria Cordio and Randy Miller's sadistic violence is on the same level. But ultimately, it is the tremendously dynamic and charismatic presence of one and only the Hoff who makes that choice a tasty Italian horror cheese, a winner: he takes off his shirt once (hubba hubba!), Is sprinkled with blood and - - ATTENTION: Major * SPOILER * at the front - even meets an unpleasant and unpleasant end. Produced by none other than Joe D'Amato, this overall picture rates so good, despicable fun.
