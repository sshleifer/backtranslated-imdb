The film was apparently born of an idea by one of the writers when he "saw" one of his creations in a supermarket. The inhabitants of Royston Vasey enter "our" world to persuade writers not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their world. <br /> <br /> If that sounds a little too serious, do not get discouraged. In the first minutes we were: Berenice (the vile female vicar) leaving an unfortunate penitent during the confession; Chinnery (the vet who inadvertently destroys all the animals he touches) trying to collect semen from a giraffe; Mickey (beyond belief) being, ah, thick; and Tubbs (in-sister sister-wife and local shopkeeper) being sweet as ever - but still disgusting. <br /> <br /> Some of the regular characters are missing, but a new Gents idea introduces some sixteenth-century characters - and we also have the Gents themselves in action. If you're new to the Gentlemen's League, this is an easy and fun introduction. If you're a longtime fan, this has everything you expect - including the joys of Jeremy Dyson. <br /> <br /> All told, it has the same slightly surreal humor that is the trademark of the series, plus some moments of 'introspection' quite moving. Herr Lipp, for example, maintains a gentle dignity by knowing that he is considered by his creators as a "character of a joke". While most characters remain as they are, some develop in unexpected ways that are perfectly natural when they happen. <br /> <br /> This film is a 'swan song' for Royston Vasey, but it is also a showcase for the film. Gents who prove that (gasp!) They can write other things - and this can be very funny. (But you knew that anyway)
