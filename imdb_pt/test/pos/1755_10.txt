I saw this cartoon as a child, a father and now a grandfather. It's my favorite cartoon. I love the characters, the great melodies and the very good drawings. I totally love the main song that appears in the cartoon. I think it's a cute cartoon. Everyone I've shown simply loves. It's too bad that it was opened on such a bad day (Pearl Harbor bombing). Had it not been for the bad time, it would have been a great success. I hope to find a DVD, because all VHS tapes do not do it justice. <br /> <br /> I think if someone shows to your child, it will have the same result. They will love it. <br /> <br />
