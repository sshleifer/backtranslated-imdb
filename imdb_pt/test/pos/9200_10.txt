I do not usually comment on movies or TV shows, but I had to post a comment about Las Vegas. Of course, here in the UK, we are around 2/3 until season 3 and although I have managed to watch the last series of season 3 (by other means) I am still stuck all over Friday at 9:00 p.m. <br /> <br /> Since the first episode of the first season I have been a huge fan of this show and has all 3 seasons on DVD, yes I can not wait for the 4th season to start in October. <br /> <br /> So why do I love this show so much, well, I have to agree to the last poster ... James Caan, I know a person can not make a team, but Big Ed Deline was made for Caan or maybe it was the other way round, I read that the producers were thinking of Martin Sheen for Ed Deline ... No, not at all! ! I also agree that the character of Caan is getting very soft, I also preferred the hard test of Big Bad Eddy D that we saw in the 1st and 2nd season, he seems to have matured. <br /> <br /> I said no one makes the team for himself and of course the other cast members Josh Duhamel / Danny, James LeSure / Mike, Vanessa Marcil / Sam, Nikki Cox / Mary, Molly Sims / Delinda contribute well even outside cast members such as Cheryl Ladd as Jillian Deline, Harry Groener as Gunther, Dean Caine as Casey, Mitchell Longley as Mitch who can present 6 or 7 times during a season can fit as well as if they were in every episode from day one. This show has everything, drama, action, suspense, laughter, romance, glamor, glamor and big-name celebrities that often touch themselves. <br /> <br /> Many may disagree, but this is one of the best digital TV programs and I hope it continues for a long time after Season 4.
