Now, maybe it has something to do with the fact that I saw this movie at a low point of my life, when I was really trying to figure out where I was going and what I needed to make me happy, but this movie actually talked to me. Jane is an ordinary woman: although she has so many positive things to her, she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. She is strong and intelligent, but was fooled by having achieved her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a life of second choice. She seeks new challenges and happiness, desperately seeking to fill the hole in her heart. Dreya Weber is an exquisite Jane. As we travel with her, we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her despair, and finally the force of her conviction. The beautiful Addie Yungmee is also very well released and a trump card for production. Allison Mackie is a scene thief as a spicy character with a flawless timing. I highly recommend this movie; although it is low budget, has large written budget and production figures. PS- large aerial scenes with two gorgeous sexy women. Women will love the story and the characters, but there is also something for the men here. :)
