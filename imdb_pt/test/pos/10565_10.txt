Wow!! Where to start? <br /> <br /> This adaptation of Sarah Waters' third novel is one of my all time favorite movies !!!!! <br /> <br /> I'm not big on fiction novels (seriously I've never read fiction), but the book is as fabulous as the movie! Or should I say that the movie is as FABULOUS as the book? I JUST LOVE THIS HISTORY !!!!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I postpone watching this three-hour film (2 DVD series, 3 TV series / book) for about a year and a half. . It just did not seem so interesting ... BOY WAS SO WRONG! <br /> <br /> I became immediately immersed in the rich plot and full of suspense ... totally enchanted! Just like the book, you can not stop watching / reading. Grab your attention for 3 whole hours ... and when it ends ... you wish it had not. <br /> <br /> The story flows so beautifully and you'll be wondering where the time A lesbian sub-plot was just a icing on the cake! The parts that I love the most are the subtle facial expressions and the looks / eye contact between the two characters. You really feel their desire for each other and yet they can not act on it ... until they owe it. <br /> <br /> I would like to point out that the "lesbian theme" is an important part of the film, obviously at the heart of the film is a genuine unexpected love story, but it certainly is not what the whole movie is about. For me, that's what makes this story so unique and intriguing. I've never read or heard of anything like that. Sarah Waters is a pure genius! <br /> <br /> The twists and turns you take leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. Seriously! My hands were entwined on my sofa with every startling twist and I even yelled several times ("OH MY GOD! NO WAY! IT HAPPENED! HAPPENED?") ... I NEVER do that! /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that I wish they would have added more of the book. But of course having the time constrained fit, they could not add everything I would like. How horrible it is ... I guess I'm just being brutally selfish now ... forgive me. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes seem a little rushed. However, they put all the important parts in it, even if you watch only the movie and choose not to read the book, you will be more satisfied with the result. <br /> <br /> The actors are simply SUPERB! BRIGHT same! Sally Hawkins (Sue) and Elaine Cassidy (Maud) have such great chemistry on the screen that they increase their television set. Simply electric! The emotions ... the desperation ... the struggle each of them feels is seemingly effortlessly expressed by these wonderfully talented actresses. Rupert Evans plays a guy as good as the Gentleman. I found myself boiling every time he appeared on the screen, but I loved him because he was so cute and somehow still charming even if you wanted to wring his neck. Imelda Staunton gives another fantastic performance as Mrs. Sucksby. She's such a hot actress that you can not help but love her ... even when the character she's playing is not so delicious. Everyone else in the cast was perfect! They really represented the characters well and were exactly as I imagined them to be after reading the book. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for any cinephile! In fact, anyone and everyone should see this movie and read the book! Chances are you will not be disappointed! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars of me! There are only four other films that I gave the same rating as well. It's very rare that I really like a movie so much that I give it 10/10. This is one of those movies. Fingersmith is truly a masterpiece!
