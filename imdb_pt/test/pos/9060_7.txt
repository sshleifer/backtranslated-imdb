Not since "Harold and Maude" suicide was so well used as the theme for a love story. The performance, by a first line cast, is great. With a well structured script, things progress at a nice pace. There are moments of black comedy, but I would rate "My Suicidal Sweetheart" as a unique romantic comedy with a touch of black humor. The relationship between two psychologically challenged lovers is both touching and engaging. The movie really makes you wonder, what is a normal relationship? I recommend "My Suicidal Sweetheart". Search on DVD under the title "Crazy for Love". You will not be disappointed. - MERK
