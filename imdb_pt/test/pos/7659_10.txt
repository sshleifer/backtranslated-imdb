Beautifully filmed, mind expanding the exploration of gypsy culture in the context of his music. Travel through a continent, experiencing the incredible musical styles of various groups of gypsy people. It's kind of misleading to say that this movie is not narrated. It is masterfully narrated by the music itself, the growing melodies and subtitled lyrics tell a much better story than a narrator would have. Watch this movie.
