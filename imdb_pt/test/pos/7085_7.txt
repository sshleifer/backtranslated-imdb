"One True Thing" puts Zellweger in the middle of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to take care of his dying mother (Streep). Dark and dingy, the film studies the adult child who accepts the adult vision of his parents, as he gradually reveals that it is something less than the ideal she knew as a child. A study of excellent character and a find production with little lack, "OTT" offers three perfect performances by a trio of top actors and some moaning reflections in life and death.
