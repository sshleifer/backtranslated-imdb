Battleship Potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece. The direction of Eisenstein is truly a vision. The film tells of a ship of disgruntled sailors who are tired of being mistreated by their superior officers. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the sailors finally have enough of the abuse and send packing officials. During this period of time, there was a shortage of film stock in the Soviet Union. The government wanted to take their message to the people, so they started a National Film Company and one of the members was Sergei Eisenstein. The films were shot in tiny budgets and the shortage of movie stock forced Eisentein to be careful and selective with the footage he recorded. In the end, Eisenstein had to reuse the footage to make a feature film. <br /> <br /> The most famous of the action sets in this movie is the much talked about massacre on the steps. This scene was faked in Bananas and more recently in The Untouchables by Brian De Palma. If you want to learn how to make movies, I strongly recommend that you watch Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> It is one of the essential items. <br /> <br /> A +
