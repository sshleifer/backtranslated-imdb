I got this movie at the end of a tape that I had used to capture a movie that I really wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name on the opening credits, I decided to watch it. In fact, it was kind of fun, and it took me back "on the way back" machine to the farcical movies that Hollywood produced during the 60s, much in the same vein as the current Austin Powers. Oh, the acting was not great, nor the plot, but it was worth watching. There were some delightful sights, though Mrs. Welch was the nicest of them all. Tape it if you have the chance and watch it when you have absolutely nothing to do. It's not a snoozer, but it will not make you roll in the hallways wanting more.
