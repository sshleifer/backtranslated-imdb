Like many of the other reviews I've read, I fell in love with this movie as a kid. My sister and I had a copy of the movie on Beta (before VHS) that we used. Of course it did not help when our parents sold the BetaMax in a garage sale. We have since tried to find a copy. I, as another commentator, ended up locating a rental copy at a local video store. The owner would not separate from the copy after several attempts to beg, bribe and cry until I owned the tape. GOOD NEWS! I bought a new and newly released VHS copy of Midnight Madness for $ 9.99 on Amazon.com two days ago !!!! Finally, Disney is stiff. Now, if they just re-release the Southern Song ... If you love the movie, grab it. If you have not seen the movie yet, it's worth checking out - totally stupid but fun humor (Stephen Furst is hilarious).
