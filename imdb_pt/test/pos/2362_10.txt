Two astute but cunning women decide to act as HAVANA VIÃšSVAS sailing to Cuba to meet and blackmail wealthy lords ... This was the kind of ephemeral comic humor that the studios produced without much effort during the 1930's . Well done and very enjoyable, the Depression audience could not get enough of these popular and funny photographic dramas. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell are perfect as frantic and fast women who go to great lengths to make a small dishonest mass. Although Joan is as successful as the romantic scenes, the two girls are as talented and helpful as they are beautiful. <br /> <br /> Lyle Talbot is Joan's persistent suitor, but he has relatively little to do. Chubby, cherub Guy Kibbee appears as the intended target of the girls. Whether waking up to find yourself in the wrong bed or being chased on the roof of a Cuban farmhouse in his long sellers, he is equally hilarious. Behind him, a series of character actors - Allen Jenkins, Frank McHugh, Ruth Donnelly, Hobart Cavanaugh, Maude Eburne and Dewey Robinson - all equally adept at pleasing the most difficult crowd. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize an unrecognized actor. James Murray as the suspect bank teller with the forged check. This very talented actor was removed from complete obscurity to star in King Vidor's THE CROWD (1928), one of the most prestigious films of the silent era. Expectations were high for a great career, but his celebrity quickly disappeared with sound images. After a long string of papers and tiny, broken and indigent parts, his life ended in the waters of a New York river in 1936. He was only thirty-five years old. <br /> <br /> Although the stars of the first Joan Blondell (1906-1979) and Glenda Farrell (1904-1971) never animated dozens of films in Warner Bros. during the 1930s, especially the eight in which they appeared together. Whether playing garimpeiros or paper girls, reporters or secretaries, these blond and cheeky girls were almost always a combination of any prominent man who was lucky enough to share the same level of billing with them. With a malicious look or a glance, his characters showed that they were ready to face the world - and any man in it. Never as perversely blatant as Paramount's Mae West, you always had the feeling that, as tough as they were, Blondell and Farrell used their resistance to defend vulnerable hearts ready to defeat the right guy. Although many presentations from seven decades ago may seem exaggerated or planned today, these two lovely ladies are still spirited and bold.
