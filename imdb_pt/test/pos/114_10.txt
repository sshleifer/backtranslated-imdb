I admire Deepa Mehta and this film is a work of art. I recommend buying this movie on DVD because it is a movie that you may want to watch more often than just once. And believe me, you'll still find meaningful little details after watching it over and over again. <br /> <br /> The characters - except the grandmother, perhaps - are all very balanced, not black and white. Even if you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists, there is also empathy for the other characters. <br /> <br /> I think the IMDb rating for the film is very low - probably due to its controversial policy. content.
