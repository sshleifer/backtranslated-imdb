Linda Blair has been working for 40 years, and although she has never escaped the role of Regan MacNeil in "The Exorcist," few of her later horror films have used her legendary status as successfully as "Witchery" does. She plays Jane Brooks, a pregnant bachelor who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to buy. They are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth) and upon arriving on the island they find a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his girlfriend writer (Leslie Cumming) who are illegally crouched in the hotel while investigating the legend. of a local witch (Hildegard Knef). It seems that a long witch hunt resulted in her suicide, and she was pregnant at the time. Unaware of the danger, Jane recently dreamed of the witch's dramatic death, and Jane's younger brother, Tommy (Michael Manchester), was most directly visited by his ghostly black spirit, whom he calls "the lady in black." The group's schedule at the island's inn begins quietly; unknown to them, however, the Lady in Black has already dispatched the captain of his hired boat (George Stevens). In a short time, the isolation and the cold begin to affect everyone, and it is during this period of bad mood and tension that the Lady in Black begins her reign of terror. She plans to avenge her own fate by possessing Jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child. Each of her other victims fulfills one aspect of her vengeful curse - greed, lust, and the blood of a virgin. As the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild, she pursues them one by one in horrible and terrible ways. The location of the island is indeed scary, and the inn is very scary and haunted. It's such a colorful movie that it reminds me of Dario Argento's work. The lighting is great and the decor of the setting is perfectly scary. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The effects of terror are extreme, terrifying and unforgettable. Cinematography is great, and that's what brings us back to Linda Blair. The creative team behind this movie shoots her as if a horror star had to be filmed: many dramatic shots, lingering close-ups that subtly detail Jane's incremental possession, and moments reminiscent of other great horror films. Hidden tribute to "Rosemary's Baby", "Jacob's Ladder", "The Shining", "Black Sunday" and of course "The Exorcist". She does a great job, and absolutely steals the show with her temperamental and understated performance. This does not mean that the rest of the cast disappoints; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good, and veteran Annie Ross is memorable as Jane's crazy mother, Rose. Hasselhoff does his best, but he's not essentially a movie star, and his television personality gets in the way of his performance. Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together. The film is so violent and creepy (in a good way) that it desperately needs its warmth (Blair also played a mother in 2003's "Monster Makers", and her maternal scenes in that film have the same affection for them). Finally, Hildegard Knef (in one of her last roles) plays a great witch, and she has the most incredible voice and accent. Along with Blair, she was also perfectly conjured. But it's Blair's movie all the way. Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic ability, and this aspect of the film goes back to "Exorcist II: The Herege". I think "Witchery" is up there with "The Exorcist", "Exorcist II", "Night of Hell" and "Summer of Fear" as the best Blair genre work to date.
