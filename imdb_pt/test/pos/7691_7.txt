I first saw the opening of Otto Preminger's "Porgy and Bess" on TV, probably sometime in the early 1980's, and my younger self found it a little slow, despite the timeless music. I deleted it. <br /> <br /> Last night, an extremely rare and mixed impression was exhibited at the Los Angeles Cinematheque and it was a revelation. The performances are strong and memorable. Dorothy Dandridge brings a great deal of vulnerability, strength and subtle (at least by today's standards) eroticism on her part. Sidney Poitier is said to be uncomfortable with the film, but her performance is fantastic, as is Pearl Bailey. Even better are Sammy Davis as the amoral, cat-like Sportin 'Life and Brock Peters as the villainous Bully Crown. <br /> <br /> Still, I'm not a fan of previous Preminger, leaden - and much easier to see - "Carmen Jones". Porgy and Bess "is far superior to this less controversial film - although this may have to do with the fact that the source material is also much higher. As seen last night, this is a tough but far from perfect work, not every moment comes to life, and there is a certain strangeness in the way the film mixes the set of Catfish Row (beautifully done by Oliver Smith) with the actual locations. In addition, while this does not detract from the filmmakers' achievement - Preminger's decision to shoot almost entirely into wide-shot shots without occasional close-ups and occasional shots has undoubtedly made it unattainable on "panned and scanned" TV and can condemn it even on widescreen DVDs if it receives the restoration it deserves.In smaller screens we will not be able to see the many details that are crucial to the way Preminger staged the film. I heard that last night was strange. particularly at the opening "Summertime", seemed unduly subdued and overwhelmed by instrumental music. Maybe this can be fixed in a restore. <br /> <br /> There is the question of the racial politics of the film. Personally, I see nothing wrong with this, at least in a contemporary context. By the time so few movies showed strong African American characters, this may have seemed like an unfortunate choice for a big-budget Hollywood movie. And while there may not be much "empowerment" here, these are recognizable human beings who are not racial stereotypes. These are operatic characters who make bad choices, because that's what the tragic characters do. That alone has taken a big step forward at the time. In a modern context in which strong and heroic African-American characters are less rare (although not yet common enough), these characters look nothing more nor less than human. They really could be poor people with little education of any ethnic background. Outside of thorny politics, the original work is undoubtedly one of the truly great achievements of American and (secondarily) American music. Poitier, Davis, Dandridge, Peters and, yes, Pearl Bailey, were all amazing artists we'll never see again. This film less than perfect, but still solid, clearly deserves to be seen and valued.
