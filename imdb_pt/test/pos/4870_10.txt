OK, so in any Wile E. Coyote-Road Runner cartoon, we know that WEC will mount all kinds of traps for RR, but it will always mutilate in a number of ways. This certainly happens in "Beep, Beep". Predictable? I think it is, but when you think about it, these drawings show how the more you try to harm someone, the more you are harmed; more or less like Daffy Duck always tries to undermine the integrity of Bugs Bunny, but Bugs sees it around. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is another classic of the Termite Terrace crowd. Sometimes, I think, if we really wanted to ease the tensions of the Cold War, we could just let the Soviet Union see the cartoons of Looney Tunes; I'm sure they would have loved them. Another great one. <br /> <br /> PS: I learned in "Jeopardy!" that the middle name of Wile E. Coyote is Ethelbert.
