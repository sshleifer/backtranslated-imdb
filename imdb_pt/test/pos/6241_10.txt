This is one of my favorite horror movies of all time and I used to think I never got what I deserved. That's until I read the brilliant reviews here. It seems that many feel the same way I did when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> It's a very scary movie, and I've spent most of my life watching scary movies. I always found dolls, mannequins and so scary! Check out the dolls in "Beyond the Door" and of course the great "Trilogy of Terror". And about the magnificent Twilight Zone episode "Living Doll." Hell, the dolls are scary! And Tourist Trap has a few moments that will make your hair stand on the back of your neck. All aided by an excellent soundtrack that only makes Connors performance even more exciting. <br /> <br /> I remember watching the trailer for this movie on TV late at night and thing, "Wow, I have to see this!" It was memorable. And it's one of the only trailers I remember seeing as a kid that scared me. It took years to see, but it was a pleasure. Stephen King also mentions this movie in his book "Danse Macabre", and gives a brilliant recommendation. Very good company. <br /> <br /> This movie will always be at the top of my to-do list. It is a true solid addition to the genre of the time and deserves to be placed alongside the best of the 1970s schlockers.
