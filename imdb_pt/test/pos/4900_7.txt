A cohesive musical family, a benevolent father, and four lively teenage daughters is first rooted by the appearance of Felix, a young dashing composer, and second, and deeper, Mickey, his insolently attractive orchestrating friend. <br /> <br /> It takes time for Michael Curtiz to catch this piece of American floating. The first part seems almost a paraphrase of a cereal commercial, not without a certain picturesque and highly bourgeois charm, and then John Garfield comes on the scene as the doomed Mickey, making his first appearance in movies with messy black curls, sleepy eyes, resentful, rude and misaligned, the absolute opposite of Felix, who is persuasive and madly charming of Jeffrey Lynn. Garfield is in complete, and DIRECTLY needed, counterpoint to the rest of the house ("Nothing I would do would surprise me," he thinks), and suddenly the film becomes interesting, although I agree with critics who find that the twists insufficiently < The four sisters are played softly and seriously subscribed, but Claude Rains as the pater familias has their moments. <br /> <br /> Beware of Garfield, however, he's the only really lasting thing about it.
