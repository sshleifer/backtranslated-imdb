When I watch a short as Boy-Next-Door, I see myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that was well thought out, perfectly executed and just bold enough to be interesting. On the other hand, I regret the level of comedy usually produced. TV and movies are so consistently filled with easy and condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence on a scale of mediocrity. So you see someone like Davis, who, without the "benefit" of studio bills or substantial budget; can create a very cool little comic gem. Producers and network attire need to turn to Travis Davis for material and stop granting agreements to people simply because their resume or agent may demand that they should. Boy-Next-Door, hopefully, got the attention of the right people to facilitate more Davis work. It's great fun and very well done!
