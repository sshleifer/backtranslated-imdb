Once again Almenábar provided us with a high quality film. This director is incredible, and he has proven that he is equally talented and effective when crossing genres. The excellent character development of the film, through dialogues and personality quirks, but with more subtle details (the look of Ramon's father), allows the audience to identify with the protagonists, making the importance and emotional impact of events that occur more deeply. The visuals are sometimes simple, sometimes impressive (the dream of the beach), and I think Almenábar's films really benefit from the fact that he also composed the music - it fit perfectly with the different modes of the film. More than just a film about euthanasia, which in itself is a major issue, this film addresses the duality of a man who sometimes seems to enjoy life (albeit in a rather limited way), and yet one who is unshakable in his desire to die. The overwhelming sadness of the movie is punctuated by well timed humor jokes, which seem funnier because they provide a welcome relief to the melancholy you will surely feel. <br /> <br /> Although clearly in favor of euthanasia, this movie does an excellent job, representing the myriad views of Ramon's friends and family. The most poignant was Ramon's father, when he said, discouraged, "There is only one worse thing than losing a child. That the child wants to die." <br /> <br /> Excellent writing, acting, directing, cinematography, music - 10/10.
