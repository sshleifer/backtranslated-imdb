I'm so excited that the Greek is back! This season seems really hectic. I'm glad Casey's trying to take the school seriously, but he's still involved in the fellowship. It's really funny that she wants to get into politics and that they're highlighting her "intriguing talent." I loved Calvin's new haircut! This makes him look more mature. They should shave Cappy's head as well. All the guys are hot, but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I can not wait to see more of him! I'm especially interested in what happens between Calvin, Adam and Rusty! I love Rebecca, too. She is very beautiful. I really think Rebecca and Calvin should connect. Go ahead, Calvin! Join my team!
