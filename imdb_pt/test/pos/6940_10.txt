I first saw this documentary in the UK in the 1980s, and I was intrigued and amazed at how well those intentions could go wrong. Previous commentators (who are Australians) have explained the details of the plot more clearly than I could ever before, but I would like to comment on what may lie behind the sovereign power of the United Kingdom of the governors-general. All modern laws, as I understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root to exist in the first place and become a law. That being the case, and it is said that the Conner / Khemlani mess was possibly set up (just how many businessmen / millions were served by Khemlani, presumably no complaint), then the Labor government could have been a "trap" which certainly would have to have been investigated by the Governor-General as or until he could see that the budget impasse was a genuine result of Whitlam's ineffectiveness, and NOT elaborate imprisonment sponsored by 'unknown person or person'! If it is true that Kerr in practice did not need to refer to the law because fiscal circumstances annul everything, then 'real power' borders on irrationality; The implications in any Commonwealth country are the "tax" rules, literally, and that any person or organization has Carte Blanche to break any other rule, physical or mental, as long as they have control over the ropes!
