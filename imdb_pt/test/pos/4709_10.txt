Certainly this proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Patricia Arquette is what she is promoted to be: AN ATTRACTIVE! This is undoubtedly her best acting moment and she certainly deserves credit for her work. Never in any of her other films, with the possible exception of Holy Matrimony, was she totally credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Plot: A young woman finds herself in Southeast Asia and is suddenly thrown into the political chaos of the countryside. It witnesses mass murder and totalitarianism and runs away. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that you MUST see or have not seen all the best in Hollywood. I rate him 58 in the top 100 films of all time. Thank you Bob
