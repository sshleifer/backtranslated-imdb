I was in my teens when I saw this movie, and I was impressed by the beauty of the young stars, as well as the loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story. It amazes me to know that Alvina died recently, that Bury apparently has not worked in the business for almost 30 years and that both would be 50 years old. <br /> <br /> Elton John's soundtrack is unbelievably beautiful. and supports the air of protected innocence that the characters experience in seclusion. I saw the poster of the movie, entitled "Deux Enfants Quis'Aiment", which apparently means something like "Two children who like each other" - English-speaking distributors were wise to abbreviate the title! <br /> <br /> Paul, the unknown 15-year-old son of an English businessman living in Paris, meets Michelle, an orphan at the zoo. The two take what they claim as a vacation to Michelle's late father's cottage, but end up staying there for a year, isolated from the outside world. They fall in love, Michelle gets pregnant and they have the baby alone at home. After the baby's birth, the police arrive at Paul's workplace and take him away. <br /> <br /> "Blue Lagoon" comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of protected innocence in an isolated paradise. So sad that "Friends" was never released on DVD.
