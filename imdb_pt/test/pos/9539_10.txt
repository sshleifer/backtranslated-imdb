This is a movie that I love above all others. I try to revisit the main locations of the film at Oakworth and Oxenhope whenever I can, which helps to restore the magical qualities that this movie seems to incorporate so uniquely - reminiscent of a more genteel and more educated age, with its unspoken assertions that People really do It does not matter that family life is not just another disposable, and that life really deserves to be lived (though sometimes we may doubt it). In short, a film that soon brings tears to my eyes, perhaps helped by the deeply evocative music - some songs are cheerful (like the melody of Perks, played on a trombone, sometimes with spoons), the stirring melody when the first familiar set out to Yorkshire not knowing what lies ahead, and the haunting melody played on a solo clarinet (or is it an oboe?) that precedes sudden changes in the boys' happiness. <br /> <br /> This is both a movie for adults and children, appealing to the eternal child in all of us - a key that effortlessly reacts to the deep and seemingly lost values ​​and feelings buried within us that are usually left sideways by the demands of modern day life. This is a film about basic human kindness and decency in which we viewers are left to make of it what we will, and there are welcome touches of humor sometimes added to a good measure, such as the arrival of the aunt or, in a more level ground, the room scene at Perks birthday - "Alright Bert - how's your birthday!" I need to know all the scenes, all the lines of this movie, and yet so great is the magic that every time I watch it, it's like I'm opening a box of delights for the first time, savoring every moment - sometimes humorous , sometimes ... ..well, very different. As Peter says in the film, "It's perfect - more perfect than you realize." And so it is !!!
