I was also lucky to see "Checking Out" with Peter Falk at The Phoenix Film Festival. This is an extremely sweet character-driven film that leaves the audience fascinated by the Applebaum situation in life. More than funny, each character in the family contributes an invaluable comic relief that not only stimulates laughter, but also inspires a few joyful tears. Peter Falk was born to play this role. He plays a 90 "young" father of three who gathers his adult children in what could be one of the most important moments in his life and their lives. The two-day journey that the Applebaum family takes away from New York's charming setting (with carefully selected characters) not only leaves the public wanting more, but also nourishes its own sense of family. "Check Out" is a must-see movie, not only for all those who cherish the family, but also for all those who do not !!! My thanks to the director who took the opportunity to bring this gift to the public. Robin Sly, Scottsdale, Arizona
