I saw this movie many years ago and I hated it - I could not wait for it to end and I would have left, but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I have never forgotten this movie, and more, I would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and songs over the years. How many movies I cried and laughed at the movie house, so I forgot as soon as I got on the street, like ... you see, I can not even think of one! Rare are movies like Death in Venice, which enter your consciousness and operate changes in the sea. The French like to say that cinema is an art, and movies like this prove they are right. I give it 10 stars, up from the 3 that I gave the night I saw.
