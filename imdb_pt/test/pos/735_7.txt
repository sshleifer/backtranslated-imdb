I just discovered this obscure 1970s horror movie while browsing YouTube. For a low budget effort, there are many compelling moments in the gradual pace that lead to the surprisingly shocking ending. While there is a woman who takes off her blouse constantly, the fact that she is a nymphomaniac makes these scenes important to the story and there is a scene with the young man with curly hair as he tries to seduce her that excited me before he back she made her scream crazy. The young nurse who comes in and is hired is seducing herself and I'm not surprised she posed for the Playboy cover. Some characters are very annoying and some scenes look ridiculous. For the most part, though, Do not Look in the Basement offers a lot of drama and chills for a fun B movie.
