I have 2 full sets of life time, this is my all time favorite movies. Love all the actors and actresses .. Awsome picture..Love Patrick Swazy .. This is the movie that showed his true talent. But even so, he does not receive credit for the performance he performed! Much credit has been wasted on these films. Love the way they portrayed the dry and dusty monologues of the Civil War. Doing this in one of the greatest love stories of all time, and showing by all the obsessions of life, that true freindship it means how two divided countries were divided. But, still, all and all the groups of relations remained solid, although the war divided kinship and relations of friendship. But through everything, until the end, they remained and taught us the viewer, It can still remain until the present day! Simply the best ... The wind does not compare to this movie.Patrick Swazy at his best,. After seeing this movie for a hundred thousand times. I became a big fan of Swazy .. And I have followed his career since .. I have all his movies after he did North and South!
