If you watched this movie for nudity (as I did), you will not be disappointed. I could have done without the cheaters cheaters or the bear though. Some bottomless nudity might have been shown, but from what I think, H.O.T.S. has to be the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> It's not the kind of movie that could have been made today, which is a pity, because it's the kind of movie worth watching at those times. <br /> I would take nonsense about the main points of the plot at any time. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the DVD has no extras, since they did not have DVDs when it was filmed which is understandable. I'd like to know more about filming the movie, especially where they shot the football game in the end.
