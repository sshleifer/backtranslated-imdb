I own the miniseries on DVD because I really love that story. This is one of the best pieces of the Civil War period I've seen that tells a story of friendship divided by war. The costumes are great, the stories are great, I love how the story jumps from character to character to keep him guessing what will happen next in their lives. There is a great balance between good and evil. Some of the characters that are bad in my opinion are too good not to watch. Every time something more despicable than the last happens, I yell the TV as if they could hear me. I love how this miniseries makes me feel engaged in your drama. I would advise, however, NOT watch the third film in the series on DVD. It's a disappointment compared to the first two films and most of the original characters do not return. I do not want to remember how the third movie ended, I'd rather live with the thoughts of the end of the second movie. This makes me happy.
