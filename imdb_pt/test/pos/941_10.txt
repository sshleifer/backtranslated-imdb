A fantastic film with great Australian talent. Director Mark Lamprell has dealt with the potentially hassle-inducing theme in a humorous and refreshing way. Definitely the highlight of the 2000 Brisbane International Film Festival. Australian film veteran Sam Neill was, as always, fabulous as Frank's college professor and new talent, Matt Newton, in a performance that will make people say " You know, Bert Newton, Matt's father! " Get out and see this movie !!!
