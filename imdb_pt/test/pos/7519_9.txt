If you liked Paddy Chayevsky's "Network", you'll probably also enjoy this comedy of dark humor, as it's another brilliant writing by Chayevsky, a wonderful satire in big city hospitals and a perfect vehicle for the Geo. C. Scott. He plays a burned-out medicine chief on the heaviest day he or his hospital ever saw. His personal crisis is peaking and his hospital is falling all around him as local residents demonstrate against the hospital and patients and doctors are dying at an alarming rate thanks to a biblically-inspired and murderous saboteur. The latter, who theatrically declares himself to be "Crazy for Christ," "Parakleet of Kaborka," "Wrath of the Lamb," and "Angel of the Abyss," plunges physicians into the head, administers lethal injections, and exchanges patient identities, the treatments and operations are performed on the wrong people. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you uncomfortable, as deadly mistakes like these happen (hopefully not so many, not so much and not in one place) and at the same time makes you laugh at priceless portraits of characters. One of them is Richard Dysart ("LA Law") as Dr. Wellbeck, a sort of famous surgeon who spends much more time worrying about his stock-exchange investments and shares than his patients, who suffer lethally from his vast indifference and neglect . There is Diana Rigg as Barbara Drummond, free-spirited and hippie, who seduces the besieged medical chief (Scott) and tries to get him to run away with her. Then there is the deluded murderer who is Barbara's father and who "works well" in the Indian reservation, where she lives with her daughter and even runs a clinic, but who is driven mad simply by being put back into civilization. The strongest portrait by far is Dr. Bock, Scott, who discovers his soul as a former childlike genius, a failed father and husband, a brilliant physician and steward, who dreams of suicide constantly, but must endure the demands of their work. Scott is exceptional in this demanding role. Until the closing scenes, it is unknown whether Bock will leave the hospital behind because of Barbara's Indian reservation and a quieter, simpler life if his murderous father will be caught. or whether Protestant and revolted residents will take over and put the hospital on their knees. Watching the mad killer at work, we suspect that Chayevsky is telling us that our lunatic society causes him to do these things, as they tell us that he is a different person from cities and people. <br /> <br /> As my father was the chief administrator of several large hospitals over the years, I had an idea of ​​the demands of his job and the enormous responsibility he assumed. This story makes this responsibility the key to Scott's crisis. This is a funny and scary movie, with the actors meeting the considerable requirements of Chayevsky's script. It's also a movie that I get more of every time I watch.
