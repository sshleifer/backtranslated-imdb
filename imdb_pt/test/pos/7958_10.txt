Palwol ui Christmas is very Korean, if you went to Korea or have Korean friends, you should know what I mean. Korean people are very traditional people, they see love quite quitely. a kind of feeling that you do not find in today's world. I think that's why this movie is so special. It is wrong to compare this movie with "Love Letter" by Shunji Iwai, the japaness is very good, but could never make one like the Palwol ui Christmas. If you have a chance, please see this movie for yourself.
