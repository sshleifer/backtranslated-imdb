Yes, let's get this out of the way before we begin: * This is what Sean Connery returned in 1983 after the period we had of Roger Moore. * It's the last Connery movie. * And yes, it's a (kind of) remake of Thunderball, but more of a movie inspired by it. If all of you Bond purists think I'm going to be controversial, you're right. Bond is one of the greatest film series of all time, but that does not mean that a series should last forever. This, I think, is one of two films in which they could have done a huge favor and finished the Bond saga. Not offended yet? So I'll continue ... Hey, if you're thinking I'm indifferent about Bond movies, you're wrong. I grew up with my mom being obsessed with them. Any free moment, Bond and his antics would be on TV. Bond Rules, and 'Never Say Never Again' (directed by Irvin 'Empire Strikes Back' Kershner) is one of the best. It may not be 'Goldfinger' or 'From Russia ...' and may not have been made by the same production house as all others (what I hear is why they refuse to accept what was done!), But yet stand up and shoulders above the recent Brosnan rides ... (if you have not spat on the screen, keep reading). DESCRIPTION!!!!! Something that so many blockbusters forget nowadays, but something essential to tell a good story. 'Never' played a superb hand treating 007 as if he was aging since 'Dr. Not'. He is 'getting a little' and so he has to do things like go to a health farm - a direct order of 'M' (!). Yes, if you have not seen this movie, I will not give much of the plot because A) Loads happen and B) Obviously, I want you to see for yourself. Do not get discouraged by the revelation of my 'old Bond', Connery still has many superb pieces to attack, swim, punch, accelerate, crush and break through. The man is a legend, and this film is one of his most enjoyable outings as Bond. High-tech gadgets galore, some great villains and an excellent supporting cast (including a fantastic appearance by Rowan Atkinson) elevate this film above the public's expectation. <br /> <br /> This could have been the last James Bond movie, and it would have been a party to remember. Touching the secret agent as someone close to retirement was a refreshing stroke of genius - the last scene ends things perfectly for the series ... ... but we still had more, and then more, and more, and more, and one more Moore. Still, if you like to find out what "Fatima Blush" is, get this movie. So you can at least pretend 007 spent his last moments as a secret agent, in the arms of Kim Basinger, and smirking maliciously at Mr. Bean. (P.S. * What other movie I think could have finished it all? The gritty 'License to Kill'
