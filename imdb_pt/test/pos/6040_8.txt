Elizabeth Ashley is receiving phone calls from her nephew Michael - he is crying, screaming and asking for help. The problem is that Michael died 15 years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie scared me in 1972 when it aired on ABC. Seeing this again, years later, still works. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit slow and predictable, the killings are very tame and there is a happy ending, but this is a TV movie so you have to make room. Elizabeth Ashley is excellent, Ben Gazzara is fine and it's fun to see Michael Douglas so young. And those calls still scare me. I really had to light a light during one of them! <br /> <br /> A little scary TV movie. Worth seeing.
