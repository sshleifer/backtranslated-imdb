I wonder if I could watch a musical comedy from Russia or East Germany or from other countries that for decades have almost always published propaganda, anti-fascist, anti-war films (as this documentary points out) that only reflected dark and exhausting times under Stalin and the life behind the iron curtain. It is fascinating, then, to see the other side of the coin, the types of clowns and rebels with music at their side to try to please the masses more often than not get stuck in the socialist walk of life. A film actually looked quite impressive, called Jolly Fellows by the pioneer of the small group of musical filmmakers, Grigori Aleksandrov. From the clip (s) I've seen from the movie, I bet it was one of the only works to really get out of it and get into a half-wild, manic way of making you laugh. But as this movie shows, if you were a filmmaker wanting to entertain, it would be better with a "message". Through interviews, occasional quasi-dramatizations (of the Russia / Germany / etc movement type on the censorship table, and clips, you get the full picture of how it was - both behind the scenes and Some of the films (well, most of them, apparently only 14 selected in the last 40 years in the countries mentioned) have done a good deal of the change, but for what purpose really? culture of everything, how much it differs from the American way of "if it works, do it while it's hot." But at the same time, perhaps because of this repression, some interesting, entertaining, and (as I have seen) movies were made. They may have been quite typical of what was asked to be shown to the masses, under Stalin's careful but demanding terms, such as life with tractors.It is a more succulent story as we are shown as it was in the 1960s, The last wave of musical comedies, when rock and roll and pop finally played their waves. <br /> <br /> In short, some good things ... but only if they are interested, in fact. I was shown the movie in a documentary class, and half the class fell asleep. So be warned, on the one hand, though, on the other hand, if you look for it, you can make a really rewarding journey into the history of European cinema.
