Story of a strange love and a desire to fall. Poem about beauty and its perfection, fear and touch. A slice of Visconti, Mahler and Mann. And an agony of Venice. I do not know if it's a masterpiece, a poem or the reflection of a filmmaker's world. It is absolutely a memento mori. and an exploration of illusion. An ancient mirror of limits, signs and delicacy of death. A trip in an ancient space, nostalgic, cruel and splendid. "Death" is a copy of Orpheus's journey in immediate reality. And the essence is music. A sweet, sweet song, like honey or winter fire. Like all regrets and all sorrow. Like a refuge in deep solitude. Gustav is gay by chance. He is the seeker of the last form of the presence of God. Beauty, that beauty that gives meaning to life, which is sin and virtue at the same time, present of expectations and sufferings. It dies because it has the right to expect, to believe in the reality of the miracle and its way. A victim? No way! Only Tadzio can give freedom as an insignificant sacrifice. Who has seen the sun can expect to live in the same condition?
