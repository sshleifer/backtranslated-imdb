Although I have definitely read this particular book by Agatha Christie at some point, I have not remembered anything but the name "Abernethie". Which is a good thing, because to see this story unfold without knowing how it will unfold has allowed me to appreciate once again the pure GENIUS of Agatha Christie: the way she deceives you and then pulls the rug from under her feet is the main reason for its success and timelessness. In addition to their stories, excellent production values, beautiful locations, wonderful music, high level performance, elegant direction, etc. are the reasons for the success and timelessness of this series - and all these virtues are present in "After the Funeral". A word of advice: be alert from the start - there are clues scattered all over the place, even in the opening sequence! There are also quite unnerving times, in contrast to the peaceful locales of the English countryside and a few little touches of humor. A must-see for mystery buffs, and just a pretty good movie overall. (***)
