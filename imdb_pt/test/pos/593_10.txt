Who does not remember the Muppets movie? <br /> <br /> Caco, the Frog, is now an icon of American culture. What child does not appeal to this character? <br /> <br /> As the first real Muppet movie, the simply called movie, The Muppet Movie did very well. Caco accepts the advice of a Hollywood agent and leaves his swamp to respond to the announcement. Along the way he meets a pig, a bear, chickens a rock band and some other quality puppets. Watch dozens of appearances such as Madaline Kahn, Steve Martian, Richard Pryor, Mel Brooks and more. I grew up watching this movie and I loved it.
