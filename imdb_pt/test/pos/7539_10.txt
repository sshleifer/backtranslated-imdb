Miss Fritton's inspirational portrait of Alistair Simms transcends drag. He is one of the great characters of the comedy in the cinema. Equally wonderful is Joyce Grenfell's character - Ruby Gates. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you should curl up on the couch with a damp Sunday afternoon and be transported to a long time ago earned our respect - not our wrath! I hear a remake is on its way with Rupert Everett as Miss Fritton? Will he have a hard time competing with the master - or should he be a lover? - Alistair Simms. <br /> <br /> Go and rent - beat a lot of what today is the comedy.
