Well, I should say, "the only film related to club / DJ / electronic music and raves ... that ratios respect". <br /> <br /> Seriously now. It's a gloriously fun, fast, and accurate portrait of the night of a raver. Although, in a club, it is in Wales and a bit dated. The film leaves out some of the weirdest elements of club life, but it does not completely disassociate them. It presents an idyllic but serious picture of the ups and downs of characters' lives. At the center of the film, and the best element of Justin Kerrigan's script, are the characters, eccentric, unique, but completely understandable and accessible. This simple movie would not work and would be infinitely less fun if it were not for Jip, Koop, Nina, Moff and Lulu. Viewers can deny the political and social implications of Human Traffic's subtext as a drug film, the Winstabe of Trainspotting, an important piece in British youth culture around the 90s, BUT ... they can not deny that these are captivating characters . <BR> It's frantic, brutally honest, it's sober, it's exaggerated, but it's a great comedy. <br /> <br /> Raves are a complex thing as well as the drugs that are taken at these events as well as the people you will encounter. But from someone who went to parties, got tired and still is ... Human Traffic is the best snapshot that could be taken from the subculture. Just do what you do, avoid "Groove" as the antithesis of all that is good about Human Trafficking.
