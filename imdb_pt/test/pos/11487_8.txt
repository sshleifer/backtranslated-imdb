It was sad that COMMITTED lasted only two weeks at the Dallas theaters. I thought this movie had a lot to do with it. The script was funny, full of subtle emotional changes and had a good message. The performance was great. Everyone did a great job, especially with the subtleties of the script. Heather Graham not only has beautiful eyes, she has * expressive * eyes. In fact, all the actors were attractive! Why did not you do well in your theatrical release, I do not know - beyond the studio, it does not seem to have much force behind it. But I deserved to do better, and I hope it's good on video. It is certainly one of my favorites for the first half of 2000.
