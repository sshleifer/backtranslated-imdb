I can not say that this movie was hilarious, but I must have a smile on my face all the time. I like this darker kind of comedy; "very bad things", "8 heads in a backpack" or "coldblooded" <br /> <br /> The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. For me, it was no big surprise what the end would be, but the way that end came out was. Another thing that stands out is the way they managed to engage the audience. The way Terry looks at us is hilarious, you can pretend to be his accomplice.
