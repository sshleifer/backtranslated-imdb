I am often disappointed by what the media calls "lesbian" movies these days: bisexual killers; psychotic killer lesbians; women who experiment with other women, but end up with men in the end; ridiculously beautiful women who only bond with each other to connect men, etc. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the FINGERSMITH is on a very high pedestal above this garbage. It's a love story of credibility acted WONDERFULLY by all members of the cast, down to the smallest of supporting actors. In addition to having a very engaging central conflict, the romance among the heroines is well developed and believable thanks to Cassidy and Hawkins. <br /> <br /> I've also seen TIPPING THE VELVET, but FINGERSMITH is far superior to the previous one, both in character / conflict development and acting quality. <br /> <br /> The pretending is satisfying and enjoyable to watch, offering lesbians everywhere a great job tracking to BANK.
