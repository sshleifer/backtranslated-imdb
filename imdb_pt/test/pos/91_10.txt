This NFBC film was made in honor of the Canadian Montreal Dynasty years in the 50s, 60s and 70s. My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to commemorate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I am a fan of Canadians for 29 of my 30 years of life. on a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a 117. All hockey fans should see this as I expect it to be placed at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and shown at the Bell Center in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall Place, put. Watch this movie with your family, it's a great movie. I also recommend the book in French and English. Go Habs Go.
