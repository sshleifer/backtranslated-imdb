Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget about Sunday morning. Moving images are works of art that stay with you forever. Mishima falls into the last category. This is the kind of thing that should win the Oscar, a brilliant visual film that is depressing and uplifting. Instead of making a simple look at the life of Yukio Mishima, director Paul Schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author's stories on his past and last day on Earth, the day he attempted to bring the Japanese army into rebellion on behalf of the Emperor. Not doing this, he commits ritual suicide in an ending that hits you like a ton of bricks. The three short story adaptations allow a look into what led to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them appear to be theatrical plays. Ken Ogata is magnificent as Mishima. Despite his eccentricities, he seems very nice, a man who is willing to die for his beliefs and does. This makes the ending much more devastating and the sense of loss more significant. Of the three adaptations of the story, the Golden Pavilion Temple, the Kyoko House and the Escape Horses, is the last one to be the strongest and most emotional. It is also the story that most closely resembles Mishima's mood in his later years and illustrates what really led to the events of November 1970. This review can not be complete without a mention of Philip Glass's impressive soundtrack. Since 2001, the soundtrack is not a perfect complement to the visual. Paul Schrader created one of the most beautiful films of the 1980s or any other decade. Leave the handkerchiefs ready because the ending will leave you in tears. Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters reminds us that sometimes the film can still be an art form and how art is brilliant.
