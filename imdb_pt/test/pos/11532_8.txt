I've seen this movie three times and each time I appreciate it more. I think Jordana Brewster should have received an Emmy nomination for her real, natural performance. Many of us who were Phoebe's age at this point in time, will understand just how real it is. The life of most of us is not a romantic or hard cynical pessimism. It's a blurred balance, and this movie captures that balance. It is also well built, with so many fine details in its composition. Like the movie or not, judging from the extraordinarily high ratings you get from the population of women under the age of 18, we may know that this film reveals an important truth about how young women see themselves in the world.
