Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated psychiatric hospital to become a full-time nurse there. She is confronted with a motley crew of madmen and an apparently crazier supervisor. Is Dr. Masters all she seems to be? <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THE BASEMENT is one of the best low budget movies of the genre and why people always put it below me. The performance is excellent, my favorite performance is Betty Chandler as Allyson, the nymphomaniac. The chills just come out of the screen. You probably will not have to say "It's just a movie, it's just a movie," it's not so scary, but it should please any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre, which I do. It's very difficult to make a scary movie with a low budget and few really do. AX is another cheap movie that is despised. Perhaps people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent movies that any movie that does not have great effects and / or is not considered a classic has no chance with the audience. But I think once people see this movie, they'll see how important the low budget horror genre is, and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other types of junk.
