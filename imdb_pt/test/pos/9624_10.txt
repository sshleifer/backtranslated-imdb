This was the first kung fu movie I've ever seen. The dubbing is not the biggest but a lot better than some I had seen. The plot is much better than some that are made today. It's bloody at times, but that's what gives you that special boost. Academy Award Material is not. But if you enjoy watching fights and a decent history backround, this is for you!
