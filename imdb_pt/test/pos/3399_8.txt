Sweeping drama with big sets, costumes and performances? although some people are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men who try to maintain a friendship despite family ties and location. Splendid Villains ?? you will want everyone to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this? good and bad. The secondary lines of the story are also well developed. Several stakes of great stars from ages past. Good representation of history and conflicts for those who are between friendship and politics. <br /> <br /> Wrap up on a rainy day with your DVD or VHS player and have a drink of your choice with this. A lap rug and a cat would be optional.
