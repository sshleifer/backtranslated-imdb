Let's face it, Australian TV is mostly terrible, but this is a real rough diamond that few people are watching. The Chaser team that makes the satirical newspaper and CNNN try something new by mixing live comedy, prerecorded satires and political satires in a live show filmed in front of a live audience like Rove, but funny. They love to cause controversy and this makes some of the shows more funny, especially Chris telling his wife to "live" on breakfast television and Julian delivering a novelty check signed by Saddam Heusein to the chief of the AWB. It's got to be one of Aussie's funniest shows since the Micallef Show.
