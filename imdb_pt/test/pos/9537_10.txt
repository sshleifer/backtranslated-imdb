Maybe once in a generation a movie shows up is perfection. For me, "The Railway Children" is that movie - a timeless classic that was directed and performed more beautifully. He describes all that is worth in humanity and reaches the climax in the conquest of love and faith over cruel injustice. Each performance is a gem, although Bobbie stands out and, like Judy Garland as Dorothy before her, Jenny Agutter makes it impossible for us to imagine anyone else on paper. <br /> <br /> The world is all the best for this movie and today's kids would be a lot better to watch it. <br /> <br /> Of course, like so many young people of my generation, I fell madly in love with Jenny Agutter and her dominance was so strong. when I had the good fortune to meet her a few days ago-the charming smile and the voice like dripping honey were still there to make me weak on my knees, as they did all those years ago!
