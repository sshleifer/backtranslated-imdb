The combination of incredible special effects and Oscar-worthy acting makes Vindicator one of the most important science fiction films of recent years. For some reason still unknown to me this gem was found in a bargain box, why some useless humans thought it right to mess up a modern classic, relaying to a bargain box is beyond me. I've never been so terrified by a man in tin foil and random bursts of fire. Forget the Terminator, Robocop, Foreigners and other films that ripped off this masterpiece, the vindicator is an unstoppable force.
