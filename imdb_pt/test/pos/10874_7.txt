I do not know if I would say this movie belongs to the pile of "Australian junk," but it's fair to say there are no Oscar nominees here. What should be considered is that most of the actors in this movie were not really actors, just kids with nothing better to do at the time. There were many others who were offered roles in the film, but refused them to surf the coast; all things taken into account, really was not a bad movie for your time. In some ways, it is no different from today's times, where peer pressure is still alive and kicking, just without the cell phones, computers and other similar devices that children lived without, unlike this generation. Anyway, I have to rate this movie as an old favorite that I watch once in a blue moon and never take very seriously ...
