I just want to point out (besides begging the series to be released on DVD) that a program does not have to be realistic to be fun. Nowadays, with all the blood and blood in the news and in crime dramas, reality shows, etc. it's good to get lost in a good show and extravagant with fun characters. PWOG fits into account. Was it Emmy stuff? No, but it was incredible anyway. <br /> <br /> I also have to vote for the second cast - they were more charismatic than the cast of the first season. I would definitely agree that the first season had a more serious vibe than the other two, but I definitely got more sucked by the last cast. Even though the series has been out for years, I will never stop waiting for it to be released for purchase.
