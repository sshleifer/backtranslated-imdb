Although Hayao Miyazaki's films have always been a success story, they are unmistakably beautiful, with characters from simple animation in a landscape of artistic images. Ponyo sticks to this formula, with such a lovely main character I want a stuffed doll of hers and such a beautiful scenery that does not look out of place framed like a photo on the wall. <br /> <br /> The story On the other hand, I did not like it as much as its last two releases, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. It was just a little juvenile, appearing more to the kids and leaving the adults just to enjoy the animation. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed that the score made by Joe Hisaishi, who also score for the above Two movies mentioned, were not so memorable this time round. Although I can not remember Howl's score now, I still remember being one of the prettiest I've ever heard. Ditto Spirited - although I just remember being very complementary to the movie. Maybe it's because Ponyo is more juvenile that the score is not so astonishing. In any case, this movie is still a must for fans of anime or Miyazaki.
