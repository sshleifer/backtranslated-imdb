If filming is about vision and real life, this movie is perfect: NUOVOMONDO talks about immigration in the US since Italy in the early 900's, but also speaks for now, when emigration / immigration is still a focus. <br /> <br /> It does not have to be rich to be a visionary film. <br /> <br /> Acting on an extra level, Charlotte Gainsbourg is a star. A good challenge for Oscars 2007 After Crialese's first attempt, "Respiro," an emotional but very intellectual film, he learned the lesson of Fellini and Taviani to name just two Italian masters. The plot is arguing, directing accurately, maybe just a little less of melodrama would be more effective. <br /> <br /> If BACK (challenging for the Oscar next year) by Almodovar is a mature film of an always brilliant director, NUOVOMONDO deserves more, because of its good effort to be a European film for the American scene . <br /> <br /> And that's it!
