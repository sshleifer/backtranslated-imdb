I am a new convert that you can also say. I borrowed the DVDs from my local library. I've been interested in samurai since I watched 'The Last Samurai'. My father told me that he used to watch Shintaro when he was a kid. He said it was very good. We are up to the 3 rd stage. I absolutely love it. It takes a while to get used to the voiced English voices about the Japanese-speaking characters, but I really like it anyway. It's a bit strange to watch the little pauses when the ninja stars are tossed into the characters and they stick to a tree or wall. I was not used to it, but I am now. But I suppose this is the technology they had in the 1960s. I have noticed that Shintaro is kind, sympathetic, willing to help the needy, he is very humble, most of the time he does not notice much himself (he just says is better than the enemy ninja). I admire Shintaro for these qualities. It's really interesting to see Koichi Ose's fencing. It is wonderful. This series is for anyone who is interested in samurai.
