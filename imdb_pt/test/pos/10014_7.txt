"Night of the Hunted" is starring French actress Brigitte Lahaie. In fact, many of the cast members in this slow production were porn actors at the time of their frantic filming. This film is certainly different from Rollin's lesbian vampire films, but it's not as memorable as "Lips of Blood" or "Fascination". Lahaie plays an amnesiac car ride that can not remember who she is or where she came from. Most of the movie takes place in a modern apartment complex where Lahaie is being held by some sort of medical group that is treating a number of people with a similar condition. Either way, it escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are trapped. On a road out of town, she meets a young man. who stops and grabs her. "Night of the Hunted" offers a lot of nudity, unfortunately the pace is extremely slow. The atmosphere is terribly sad and the relationship between Brigitte Lahaie and another prisoner of asylum Dominique Journet is well developed. Yet "th Night and Hunted" is too annoying to be completely enjoyable. Take a look only if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's works. 7 out of 10 and that's being kind.
