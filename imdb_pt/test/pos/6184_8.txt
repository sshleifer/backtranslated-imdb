This movie reappeared on Channel 13 in the 1990s when they did a series of Hollywood comedies in the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, to the sound of "The Jolly Fat Policeman," they had a montage of movie scenes to feature series of people laughing, including one of Gary Cooper laughing while watching a movie in a movie theater - a sequel to that. It all starts innocently when Cooper, a millionaire, enters a department store in France to buy pajamas. But he just likes sleeping on the tops. The clerk (Tyler Brooke) insists he can not sell half a pajama like Cooper wants. Claudette Colbert hears the argument and offers to help - she just likes to sleep in her pajamas. What if Brooke sells them to each half? Brooke has never had such an offer before, so he goes to the stroller (Rolfe Sedan) and asks if this can be done. He is also upset - the request is quite unconventional. Eventually they get in touch with the store owner (Charles Halton). Halton is in bed, and leaves - his lean frame holding only a pajama top (if it's a long enough because of censorship). Can they sell both customers a set of pajamas (half for each)? Correctly horrified, Halton replies, "No, of course not! This is communism !!" So the sale is not allowed. Apparently no one thinks Cooper can buy the full pair and sell half to Colbert. <br /> <br /> BLUEBEARD'S NEW WIFE from Lubitsch had a reputation for falling, most viewers did not like because of a misinterpretation of Colbert's character. She is seen as quite mercenary toward Cooper - selling herself to him on her own terms. <br /> <br /> In fact, Cooper's character is the most unpleasant since he is rich and thinks everything has a price. It is correct most of the time. See how Colbert's aristocratic father, Edward Everett Horton, sees his new son-in-law as a golden egg hen he can use. Cooper's willingness to marry Colbert somehow includes an agreement that if he is hesitant or decides not to marry her, he has to pay an indemnity. Horton, when he realizes this, picks up a watch, and (in a very comforting voice) tells Cooper - "Take your time, my boy!", To come to a decision. Later, we see that Horton's wardrobe has become more modern and sophisticated. The film, Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett's screenplay, compares well with Mitchell Leisin's MIDNIGHT script (also with Colbert, but with Don Ameche and John Barrymore). There Colbert is willing to sell himself for a cash wedding (for Francis Lederer), but it is complicated by a fictitious marriage with Ameche. She really loves Ameche (a taxi driver), but she explains to him in an unexpectedly realistic moment that her parents were married "out of love", but poverty made them grow up to hate themselves. This is not to be found in the Eighth Wife of Blueberry, where Colbert does not have a past like this (after all, she is the daughter of a Marquis). His mercenary conspiracy is to teach Cooper a lesson about his standards. <br /> <br /> The film has some cool work from the support team, including Herman Bing as a private detective who ends up hiding things that Colbert learns. and a young David Niven, who has a set of moments of choice as a punching bag and as an ear willing Cooper. Coop tells Niven about her problems with Colbert and how annoying she is. Niven listens respectfully. In the end, Cooper is moved by the willingness to listen to what he had to say. "Albert, how much do I pay you?" Cooper asks him. Niven thinks and says, "Thirty-five francs a week, sir." Cooper looks deep into his soul and says (shaking his head), "That's fair!"
