When you're watching Distant you know you're not watching a French movie, there's just sex and it's mostly elliptical and people do not talk much here, there are a few lines scattered here and there and a few important conversations, just to let you understand what is happening. It also does not look American, there are no car chases or shootings or violence, unless the death of a mouse is considered an act of blood or the daily strain of undergoing a moderate catastrophe. Sometimes relatively long-distance shots can remind you of Asian "contemplative" cinema, but just remember that the director does not take things to the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers, but again, this is not a Taiwanese movie, It's a Turkish movie. I do not know what that means, I do not even know if that means anything. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a storyline itself, and yet, these few lines, those that are somewhat long. Shots kept and often mitigated the tension gradually build a feeling that something is happening, a sense of 'plot', for lack of a better word, which grows in you. At the end of the movie, you may feel that you're going to miss those two cousins ​​who have many things in common but worlds apart.
