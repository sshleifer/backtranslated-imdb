Tiny Toons is the first cartoon I remember seeing as a kid and I loved every minute of it. When I was four or five, my parents bought the video How I Spent My Vacation. I watched it again and again until I renewed every word. Well, a few days ago my three-year cousin came and I had to entertain him. I decided to show him this old relic from my childhood. <br /> <br /> I knew he would laugh, but I was surprised at how much I laughed. Like all Tiny Toons movies and episodes, the mood is based more on crazy and bad humor and succeeds tremendously. Bugs, Babs, Plucky Duck, Maton Pig and Fifi all support amazing Bugs and Babs adventures rafting with a little help from Superman, Plucky Duck and Maton. Travel to the largest amusement park to ride the monorail and Elmyra goes on a strange mission to find cute kittens on a safari land. <br /> <br /> Part of the classic humor is in this Tiny Toon Adventure and it's one of the best crazy comedies I've ever seen. My favorite gag had to be the monorail thing when Hamton and Plucky arrive, walk on the monorail and depart to Plucky's heartbreak. No matter your age, you will laugh at tears without having to deal with language and nudity. <br /> <br /> Adventures of Tiny Toons: How I Spent My Vacation. Starring the voices of: Charles Adler, Tress MacNeille, Joe Alaskey and Don Messick. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 stars.
