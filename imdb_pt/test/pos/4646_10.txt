This movie typifies the early eighties as well as fun !! I remember watching this movie on HBO when I was little and it was my favorite movie. For a long time no one I've ever known knew what it was. So, about how long my roommate said she had seen too, and that was her favorite, they started to print it again !! Luckily, I have a copy now !! If anyone wants to see the biggest hunt that was probably the initial idea of ​​trotting for fraternities, this movie is !!! (Watcher - have to have a serious love for cheese brand 80 movies !!)
