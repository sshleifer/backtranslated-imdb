The dead spots and the shallowness of the "Out Africa" ​​postcard practically buried any interest I might have read Isak Dinesen. So when my brother bought me "Babette's Feast", and knowing it was based on a story from Dinesen, I did not run into the VCR. But as the titles rolled, it was clear that it was not an ordinary movie. Jutland (where it is found) is not Africa; the cold haze that accumulates in the camera pictures is not inviting. The cold, menacing sea; the heavy gray clouds; the cliffs pale green and icy - they translate themselves into difficulties that appear in the faces on which the director Gabriel Axel draws the curtain. The most credulous is Bodil Kjer as Philippa; Amidst the myriad merits of this film, the most memorable is that face. It is like a map before us the beloved wonder of the apostolate of his father's shepherd; like a labyrinth of long-neglected fjords, where the complications of the perseverance and commitment of his congregation hang like brilliant swords. <br /> <br /> I understand that Dinesen points out how the world is inexplicably drawn to Christian dedication when Philippa is rejected by her sole serious claimant (because he fears that he will never match the rules and rigors of his little religious clique) , and he returns to find his lover, whom he considers to be the greatest chef on the continent. I think it is also her point that Christ responds to the doubts and regrets of those who give up worldly success (Philippa Martina's sister rejects the efforts of a baritone visitor (Jean-Philippe Lafont whose joy creates an uplifting counterpoint to the sparsity of the spirit that involves her discovery) to turn her into an opera star, the title character leaves France and an enviable reputation and seeks refuge as servant of two unmarried sisters) to seek artistic triumphs only for God and those closest to Him to witness . But it is Axel who weaves the roughness of their lives with the richness of Martina's voice and Babette Hersant's table and produces a sumptuousness you would never expect from a movie about sacrifice, faith, and religious conviction. <br /> <br /> What sets this movie apart from other religious films is its malicious humor. Babette's Feast, that is, the banquet itself - a posthumous celebration of the minister's hundredth birthday - is a beautifully orchestrated confrontation of sensibilities that provides comedic moments from a set of actors unparalleled in their subtlety. It's just that deft comedy that enriches the solemn feelings at closing. Together, they do something that pious movies rarely do. They leave a believer tremulously hopeful and unexpectedly resolute and humble.
