This is more the same thing that made this cartoon popular ..... but who is complaining? It's always fun to see poor coyote try out various contraptions to get the Road Runner, and then get sprayed for each of those inventions. <br /> <br /> The pursuit of underground caverns was different from the normal fare and intelligent. This gave us an aerial view of the chase in a maze structure. I did not say it was hilarious; just different from the normal wiles above the ground. <br /> <br /> This, along with a few other Road Runner shortcuts, are featured in the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 and their downloads are spectacular. The colors are magnificent.
