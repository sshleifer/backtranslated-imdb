This film is engaging and complex, keeping the beauty simple. Our two characters come together sharing the basis of curiosity and solitude, but it is a springboard to learn these people, are lifestyles and past who support it. <br /> <br /> The two main actors (Bohl, Brundruge) were at the moment like any two actors I have ever seen. 100% believable, they effortlessly transport the audience to their world. The uninterrupted acting of the actors, combined with Bechard's beautiful realist dialogue and true direction, takes the story forward for a striking and moving end. This film is visual and smooth, increasing the intensity of the story. The soundtrack serenades the viewer, soothing yet still extracting the emotional content of the film. I think this project is nothing less than a work of art. intrigue.intense.
