"Murder Over New York" is a fun entry in the Charlie Chan movie series, but if you're paying attention, many plot holes reveal themselves to the attentive eyes. While traveling to New York for an annual police convention, Chan (Sidney Toler) meets former Scotland Yard investigator Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock) on the same flight. Now employed by military intelligence, Drake is following Paul Narvo and his Hindu servant, suspected of acts of sabotage around the world. Drake believes that by contacting Narvo's elusive wife, he will be able to discover the whereabouts of the main criminal. When Drake ends up dead in the library of George Kirby, president of Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation Charlie theorizes that he was killed by a newly discovered poisonous gas called "tetrogene" administered through a glass pellet that releases the poison when broken. Summoning Kirby to gather all his guests, Chan and Police Inspector Vance (Donald MacBride) question those present, since one of them may be the killer. Among them are Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), a fellow Oxford student of Drake, actress June Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown to Drake, but asked by him to attend, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), chief designer of the company of Kirby airplanes. and Keith Jeffrey (John Sutton), a broker at Kirby. Butler Kirby Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also suspect, especially after the number 2, son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) catches him smoking a cable, whose content concerns Boggs himself. <br /> <br /> There are a few other characters cleverly planted in the process as well. Mrs. Narvo appears as Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver), and countering Drake's suspicion that she could take him to Narvo, is actually running away from her ex-husband and a disastrous marriage. She is involved with David Elliott (Robert Lowery), director of a chemical research firm and therefore a suspect in the tetrogenic angle. <br /> <br /> As with many Chan movies, racial remarks should be taken into account. . This one offers two glaring. When Kirby's black servant is called for questioning, he claims he knows nothing about Drake's murder, which is completely "in the dark." Chan's response: "The condition seems contagious." Later, following Inspector Vance's order to gather all the Hindus in New York, Jimmy Chan comments on his arrival with "They are all beginning to resemble me." In fact, the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the film, since Shemp Howard personifies the Hindu mystic "The Great Rashid", but in fact is discovered by the police as the rogue Shorty McCoy. <br /> <br /> Before the end of the movie, two more victims fall into the clever Narvo - their Confederate Ramullah and the very tycoon of the Kirby airplanes. To uncover the killer, Chan, along with Elliott, organizes a test flight aboard a newly developed TR4 Bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before. Before he can release his deadly poison, Brit Fenton picks up the capsule falling in the air, revealing that he knew about the plant. Trapped and taken for questioning, Chan asserts that Fenton is not Narvo. The real Narvo reveals himself as he offers a cup of poisoned water to the nervous Fenton, eager to keep Narvo's secret. But Chan was clever enough to be wary of such an attempt, and reveals the real killer - Narvo now under the guise of stock broker Jeffrey, having undergone reconstructive surgery after a car accident. <br /> Now, to the plot holes. Investigating for the first time Hugh Drake's murder, police confirmed that the fingerprints found in the library did not match those of any dinner guests. However Jeffrey / Narvo was present for dinner. It had already been established that Drake had a non-party visitor in the library, the chemist Elliott. If the fingerprints really did not belong to the Narvo, making them a problem made no sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, at the end of the film, when Narvo offers Fenton the poisoned water, how does he think he would escape? with him with everyone there as a witness? But going even better than that, as a saboteur traveling the world, like Narvo, would have the time and resources to establish himself as a stockbroker in New York, it just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> For fans of curiosities, a few more points should be mentioned. In the movie, Number # 2, Son Jimmy is a college student who studies chemistry when it comes to "Pop" help to solve the case. In Chan's previous film - "Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum" - Jimmy was a law student. The venomous gas formula would be reworked in a later film by Chan, this time by Monogram with Roland Winters in the role of Chan in "Docks of New Orleans." In this story, the poisonous gas is released from similarly destroyed radio tubes to claim their victims.
