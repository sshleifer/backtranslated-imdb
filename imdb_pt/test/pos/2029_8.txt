What about a movie like Rock Star? Very, indeed! This is the kind of movie that is almost made for critics to hit. It's also a movie that I, as a big Hard Rock fan, really loved - as I was aware of his many flaws and the film, while a decent effort in some respects missed the chance he had to do. escape into grandeur and become a rock classic. Oh well ... <br /> <br /> I loved this movie - and I would see it again and again - but I know this is purely based on my own personal tastes - Rock Star is a movie that goes please anyone who has experienced elements of the rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to follow the road to nostalgia. It was a great time for metal heads. And it's good to have a movie that effectively captures that (long forgotten by many non-rock fans) time effectively, as I think Rock Star did. This is one of the strengths of the film, the filming of the show. You will feel like you are there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love it? As for setting the atmosphere, Rock Star wins 10 out of 10. It also gets 10 out of 10 for pure entertainment. If you want a movie just let yourself go and free flow into some great memories of good times past, then this is the movie for you. It's also the reason why I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> But it's not a great movie. I understand this and it was my real job to review movies professionally, I would probably have to be a bit difficult on this one. The problem with rock star is character development. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with character development is this, there is none. None. The film has certain scenes - few and far between but that are there - that touch on the greatness: WARNING SPOILERS OF SCENES: 3 examples - 1) when Izzy makes his stage debut (including the fall that he does) 2) The first party "after the series" with Emily (Anniston and Izzy). <br /> <br /> 3) Going back a little - At first, when the original vocalist is dismissed (dismissed) - The whole tone "business as usual" sets the stage for what is to come. It is played very effectively. <br /> <br /> But the problem is that nothing arrives. There is little or no development of someone's character in this film, people's personas are merely touched but never fully explored. I do not think this is the fault of the actors / actresses, particularly Anniston who tries hard, they just do not have much to work on. It was just that the script was weak and did not have the ability to go beyond the "formula" sense to the true depth of the film. Rock star was so sugarcoated at times (incl. At the end) it was almost ridiculous. And yet, the scenes I mentioned were excellent and very convincing, unfortunately, much more in the film was not. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer mentioned the lack of development at the end and I agree, but in fact there was a lack of buildup on anything. Why does Izzy leave at the end? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band does not let him write music? This tests the limits of credibility. And frankly, the ending was just cheesy. It made no sense and had no reality in it. Watching this, it's almost like watching a movie where the makers said, OK, this happens here and then it happens and then this etc etc. In the end, it's no longer a movie about a boy who has become reality, it's just another well-formulated love story. And you wonder why so many details are left out ... <br /> <br /> I hope I'm not being hard on Rock Star because I really loved it - but not for the right reasons. I would have loved to love this as a great movie about the ups and downs of rock fame. Instead, I loved the feel of the 1980s, clothes, hair, lights, life .... Although many others adored, I suspect that most are from people who have lived the life of a fan of rock, like I did or some who play. I would like to see the film go by and be respected for being a good and well told movie rather than a clich√©. I think one of the problems was the length. Myself, I hate long films, but this was one that really should have been longer, if a movie is actually made, the duration is not even felt - there is much more in the story to be as short as it was. "That's one of the reasons why there does not seem to be much development of either the story or the humans portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> So to finish - this is a movie that you can get into a lot - but it's not a great movie. See for fun. Watch for entertainment. See it back to that great big space in time where metal was not just a part of life, it was life - and for those who were not rock fans - see it to catch a glimpse of a life that meant and still means so much to many of us.
