Okay, I grew up in the Who, but I have not loved a doctor since Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston made me love someone again and I will be furious with him forever for leaving. <br /> <br /> The writing is grand, the acting superb, the direction (which was terrible in the old days) is simply fantastic. I was very skeptical about this program, and watched it just to not be forced, but now I'm a big fan and I love it (I have a touch of a Dalek shouting "Exterminate"). <br /> <br /> Some of the things I love about the new show - 1) people really do realize when Rose (Billie Piper) disappears from the planet. Some of the old ones show that an assistant would leave for a while and then return home as if nothing had happened, no one noticed. 2) Chris's Eccleston loves Rose - romantic or not will be debated, but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about his mate. He would destroy the world if he had to save her, which was missing from the old program-often a doctor would not mind if he never saw his assistants again. 3) They talk and think like real people - when Rose is shown something strange or new (like aliens) she acts like a real person - shocked. I never liked it when an assistant to the old show, who never saw anything alien, just fit and fit instantly. I want to see the surprise on Rose's face when she sees a plastic doll come to life. She gives me this. <br /> <br /> The few things I do not like about this series: 1) Almost everything happens on Earth (London or Cardiff) and I was kind of hoping for a show out of the world. 2) That Eccleston came out so quickly, he really made the show brilliant. <br /> <br /> But I can let these things slip away - I really appreciate the series more than I expected, so I do not care if they have things on Earth. <br /> <br /> Just do not take this series seriously - it's fun, it's smart, it's fun, but it's not a super heavy show. It's pure fun and purely British, and I can not get enough. Watch with an open mind, and just put your brain in neutral and enjoy! <br /> <br /> ps - I do not watch series 2 or later. series 1 was brilliant, the first episodes of the series 2 were good but did not watch it once it reaches Love and Monsters. Absolute rubbish, completely destroys the show.
