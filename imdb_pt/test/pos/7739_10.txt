What will Prospero be in the twentieth century, what is his life? Why would a man need to choose to live on an island with his daughter and girlfriend? Because it is very difficult to live and love in good conditions in "civilization". This man (John Cassavetes) is a heartbroken giant, he can command the storm. He has the power, the force, but he is human. The deep love for life is the theme of this extraordinary film. The acting is incredible, all genius John Cassavetes, Gena Rowlands, Vittorio Gasman and Shakespeare and Paul Mazursky of course. Do not miss it, it's going to be a mistake, this movie is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of movies.
