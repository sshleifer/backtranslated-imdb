One of Starewicz's shorter and shorter short films follows a toy dog ​​in search of an orange after cheering on the tear of a girl's mother yearning for an orange. The dog comes across an orange after falling from the back of a car on its way to be sold, but at night must protect the orange when it enters a diabolical nightclub with many bizarre and scary characters. With the help of a plush cat, the dog gets the orange back to the girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death. The mascot features new techniques that I have not seen in Starewicz movies yet. The addition of synchronizing sound and a live action mix with stop-motion animation makes a new twist on Starewicz's old puppet style. Live scenes of moving cars and people's feet walking like a doll sitting on the concrete sidewalk is stunning and cool. The car honking and shouting from street vendors is remarkable due to the fact that small studio-to-sound changes were expensive and Starewicz's use of the new technology looks like an old hat. New puppet characters in this film are scary contributions to the Devil's Club scene. Twigss and newspaper fragments come to life. Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs hatching skeleton chicks. Characters come flying from all sides on pats and pans and rocking horses. A new editing technique uses fast zooms that are achieved through editing to accelerate the pace of what might have been a slow scene before. Overall, Starewicz is able to update his style of making movies to meet the demands of a new audience, making this film one of the best examples of his work.
