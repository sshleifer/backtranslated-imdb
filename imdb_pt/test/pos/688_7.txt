This seemed like a dull movie to me that betrays a low budget with bad cinematography and not all the editing work. It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during World War II, but I recommend that everyone else take care. Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story about men being called back to work during a short leave seems quite realistic, but there is no real pace or a tension in history. I also had difficulty understanding what the actors were saying, partly due to some strong English accents and perhaps some due to a lower sound recording work. I give it to 55/100. Most people will want to "steer" clear.
