As you can see, I loved the book so much that I use the title for my internet alias and I am over 15 years old. (Ok so it had to be written phonetically to adjust the character limit of the name to the BBS at the time, but what could I do?) If anyone finds this movie, I'd love to see it! Janet McTeer is great at everything I've seen of her. I think she would have made a great Prue. And even introduces the first Clive Owen - from before Chancer (a great series itself). What is not to love? I hope the powers are wise and make it available on DVD soon! With a part of the real dredge, they disdain, it is time for well-executed productions to reach the market as well.
