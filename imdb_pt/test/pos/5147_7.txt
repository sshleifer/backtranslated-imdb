This absurd and surrealist film is the first film I saw from the Swedish cult director Roy Andersson. He is a veteran filmmaker who made his living filming commercials, directing only four feature films in the last forty years. This scenario shows: the film looks like a collection of fifty artistic commercials of 2 minutes. There is no story linking these vignettes, although some characters appear in more than one vignette (there is a theme behind them, however: the absurdity of modern life). Some of the film's mannerisms (making the actors appear in light white makeup) are more irritating than illuminators. Some of the skits are too little (an insecure man in which line do you stay?). Other skits are better, though. The best is the one about the rock girl dreaming that she goes on honeymoon with her bride rock guitarist in a house that connects something like a train (you have to watch to get it). A film worth seeing, even if comparisons made by film critics with great filmmakers like Keaton, Tati and Kaurismaki seem exhausted: Andersson does not have their vision and the lack of a story linking the vignettes is fatal to the pretense of the film to be masterpiece.
