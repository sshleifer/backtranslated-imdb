"Miss Cast Away" is a fun trifle that spares a serious plot or character development to pack as many jokes as possible. Best enjoyed with a large audience that is open to such entertainments and perhaps had some drinks. Most of the jokes are based on current events, so in the coming years, this film can become a time capsule of pop culture references at the turn of the 21st century. The 30i-to-24p conversion from filming creates a brusque appearance in some parts, most notably the aperture air intakes. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Michael Jackson is indeed a strange non-sequential event. But I, for example, find it encouraging that Mr. Jackson has shown a useful interest in one of his protégés, even after he (the director) has passed the stage of the cute-preteen boy. The effects work is not as bad as a suggested review. Most were made by a one-man team in a brief period of time, consisting of animator William Sutton, whose name seems to have been omitted from IMDb's credits. His work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps fill the gaps in this film. I hope he has finally been paid!
