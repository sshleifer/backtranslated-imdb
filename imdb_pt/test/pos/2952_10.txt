For those who still prefer movies focused on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see. <br /> <br /> In training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers land that is beyond the reach of most filmmakers. He explores an ordinary, but often unspoken, family dynamics, and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low-key at first. In addition to providing an investigative look at a family - and, by extension, all families - Block also recorded a very specific period in recent history. I do not know if this was intentional but inevitable due to archival content. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
