It takes some time to adjust to the sound of Sons of The Pioneers, but you like it. If the soundtrack were played by an orchestra like Max Steiner or Dmitri Tiomkin, it would lose its folkloric character. The music drives the movie, everything seems to follow its rhythm. The whole cast is excellent. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. are the young people who lead the caravan. Ward Bond is the Mormon leader and Joanne Dru is an actress who flirts. Ford could imagine what a common Western would be, something totally different and original, showing us the music, the dances and, above all, the people.
