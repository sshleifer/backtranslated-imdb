This movie is one of my favorite Christmas classics. Of course, it's cute, it's not "relevant," but when movies being simply fun and entertaining become a bad thing? No, this movie is definitely "A Good Thing," as Martha Stewart would say (appropriately)! Barbara Stanwyck is so attractive in this film and Dennis Morgan completes it perfectly. Both have charm and warmth to spare. They are assisted by a team of incredible actors who seem to have disappeared since the 1940s and 50s - Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall, Reginald Gardiner and Una O'Connor among them. Where are the characters like that today? No role could have been better cast. Bette Davis happily refused this role as below her and she was right to refuse. She would have tried to vaporize everyone and everything around her and completely destroy the movie. Stanwyck was a strong actress, but she had the wisdom to interpret this lightly. She has rarely been more attractive and is perfect. Morgan is the essence of the cool guy. Since the part of him is the least explosive, there is a tendency to ignore his ability. Just the fact that he could keep surrounded by actors of such distinguished character is an achievement in itself but he is also absolutely perfect like Jefferson Jones. Avoid the ill-advised (and meaningless) remake of 1992 and watch this brilliant and sparkling Christmas gift!
