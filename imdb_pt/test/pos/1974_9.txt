yes, I've noticed that there are 347 other comments, I think that's a good sign for a movie, even if some are negative. I've seen this movie two and a half times. I love it and watch it again. is very intelligent, but I can understand why some people would hate that. they do not understand. Yeah, I have a weird taste in the movies, but this is a great movie. some of the lines are as fast as the whole Chinese restaurant scene. I started to die of laughter. that and when he was on the assembly line talking to the contact. Jewish law was marvelous, though it was humorous, he trying to cover up his wonderful accent. Anyway, I do not consider myself the movie goddess as some critics of this movie and if you have nothing better to do than write reviews of pseudo-intellectual movies about movies you hate online, I'm sorry for you. Why do not you write about movies you like, like me? I just love how everything comes together, you guess, even if you think it's wrong. the ending was interesting and not overdone. was purely intelligent. I would not compare it to the matrix, because I think people get the wrong idea. I entered this movie expecting nothing except the law of Jew and a science fiction. I was impressed. I have no idea of ​​any other Cronenburg movie, but I love it on its own merit. Another smart thing was the prefiguration of the dog. definitely watch this movie.
