I was fortunate enough to see the DVD version of "Horror Classics" from this movie before being mysteriously removed from the 4-movie DVD and replaced with something else. The quality of the picture and the sound of the film in that issue was a nightmare in itself. Still, this version is STILL superior to the one that has the luxury DVD treatment. The reason was mentioned in the excerpts from Brad Fiedel's interview on the DVD Special Edition. He noticed what I found so impressive about this movie. This being the use of music in moments of inactivity in the film, but leaving the moments of activity in silence, thus giving the scenes of terror a stronger sensation. The problem with this reprint is that it carries the extra punctuation of the film used to fill those intentional gaps in punctuation. Fiedel complained about it and made it clear that the fill song was not his. The song actually sounded a lot like Howard Shore's work for Videodrome. Sadly for me, I'm also a big fan of this movie and I have to associate them both. <br /> <br /> The film itself was able to add some interesting and realistic elements to the horror horror film. A group of friends climbs on an inherited mountain. On the mountain they are confronted with a family with a nightmare secret. The movie moves at great speed. In fact, every time I've seen it, I'm still shocked to see that 45 minutes have passed before things started to go wrong for the campers. <br /> <br /> Although the Horror Classics version is filled with many gaps, The fact that there is no track accompanying the horror scenes is what makes this movie clever and even superior to most of the horror films I I already saw. Director Jeff Lieberman had made some original horror movies before this, making this one of the most mainstream and yet very different from the mainstream at the same time. It's a fun movie with amazing acting performances. The new version of the DVD is worth a rental, now the Horror Classics version is currently worth it.
