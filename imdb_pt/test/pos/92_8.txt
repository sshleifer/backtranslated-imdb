I would say that this movie would be praised in Canada - particularly in Quebec. That's because Canadians traditionally loved hockey and Montreal Canadians were like gods in Canada for decades. As an American, the closest thing we have to them is the New York Yankees. If you are a fan then they are the biggest and most winning team in history. If you are not a fan then they are Satan's team !! Well, at least that's how I grew up in Washington, DC, compared to the Dallas Cowboys. So I'm sure that when this movie was shown in the North, everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction - their national sport and the closest they have to a national team in the NHL. <br /> <br /> Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it starts and the main character talks about growing up in Ottawa and cheering for Canadians AND Maurice "the Rocket" Richard. However, when her mother accidentally buys a Toronto Maple Leafs shirt and forces her to wear it, I immediately knew what a horrible and shameful thing it would be like for a boy. This ability to connect with the character - even if he lives in a distant land, is what made this short film very special. The way the other children treated him and his conversation with God in the end make this movie a lovely nostalgic movie. Very smart and memorable.
