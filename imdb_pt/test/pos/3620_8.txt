Obviously made at low cost to capitalize on the notorious "Mandingo", this coarse piece of gooey Italian slime sexploitation really pours on the nasty stuff with a laudable lack of taste and restraint: The arrogant and evil white family who owns and operates a luxurious the slave plantation spends most of its time on the canvas engaging in its children and its various slaves. Director Mario Penzauti and screenwriter Tecla Romanelli pile up this fetid dirt with an exaggerated excess of hissing: we have unpleasant rapes, interracial copulations (a white lady makes wild love with a muscular black stallion while he is tied to a cross), copious woman nudity, brutal whipping, vile degradation, very soft sex, and a tragic surprise that mixes elements of incest, murder, and miscegenation in a questionable attempt to make a statement about the horrendous inhumanity of slavery. Special congratulations are in order for the brunette brunette actress Paola D'Egidio, whose lusty and uninhibited portrait of the depraved and lascivious evil bitch Rhonda burns the canvas positively. In addition, Marcello Giombini's vibrant and throbbing tribal score hits the spot. The very polished cinematography of Maurizo Centini also does the trick. A satisfactorily dirty piece of dirt.
