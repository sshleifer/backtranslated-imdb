But not very hip. And not very flattering. "Judas Kiss" unites the new noir thing. Great rhythm and a varied score complete a winding tale full of sex, treachery and infallible a liners. Inspirational work around. Congratulations in part to HalHolbrook (his best work ever), Gil Bellows (Ally Mc-what?) And Carla Gugino (the best fatme hungry in ages ... smart, fun and ultra-hot) ... I I give 9 (out of 10) and that's because 10 should be reserved for films like Humphrey Bogart and Coen Bros.
