Peter Lorre makes one of his most evil performances as owner of the titled place. The plot has a new government agent being put on the runway of Peter Lorre's character. When the G-man contacts his dead by one of Lorre's agents, the G-man is sent to jail for murder, although everyone knows there is more to the story. Lorre sends the man to his care and takes him to his island where he is mining diamonds. Lorre wants to know what our hero knows, but he is not speaking and a battle of wills is set in motion. <br /> <br /> This is a good solid suspense that does not do much success. sense, but even so the film holds its interest. I had put the film on last night to use it as something to sidetrack, instead I found the story fascinating enough that I would stay for another 70 minutes. Lorre is the reason someone falls for it. Your behavior is unnerving. He does very little, but it is clear from his orders and the way everyone reacts to him (see how they light their cigarettes) that he is a bad guy. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look if you must cross it.
