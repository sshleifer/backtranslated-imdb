I know the girl who made the figure skating for the main girl. She once dated my brother and she's always been really cool! I also live in Cranbrook B.C, about 15 minutes from Fort Steele. Haha I used to go there for field trips when I was in elementary school. It was kind of weird seeing it in the movie. I also had the chance when the movie was filming to be an extra because there was a cast call for them at the mall. But I did not feel like going to the time because I was not interested in acting. Now I totally wish I did. This was an amazing movie that I bought from Ebay. It never came out here, (which is kind of weird to see that it was partially filmed here), so I was excited when it came. I really loved the plot and the poler bear was kind of cute. But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask :)
