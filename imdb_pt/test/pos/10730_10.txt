Certainly, when I saw this movie on HBO, I was a little erratic in following the plot, but it caught my eye when I saw Dustin Hoffman in it. Honestly, I'm not delighted watching old movies, but in the long run this changes my point of view. Watching this shaken movie made me feel once more in my seat without noticing my tears suddenly rolling down my face, and then I let out a heavy sigh as I realized the impact of what I just witnessed. Kramer vs. Kramer was in fact one of the best classic drama films I've witnessed for a long time that even I, myself, could not imagine how it touched me. The story was strongly emotional, but not saturated with such. The characters were not unrealistic for their roles; they possess qualities that make viewers like them any position they have in the film, such as the role of Meryl Streep, she was a mother who honestly admitted her mistakes in the past but then she is confident in raising her emotional motives to achieve what want in a fair and square battle. Dustin Hoffman was very remarkable, I can not even imagine how this guy could play difficult roles and suddenly jump to another role that is completely different, so I performed well. Even though I've seen the movies many times, when I sit down and sit down at my house to read movies and pay a visit, glimpsing Kramer vs. Kramer will make of my experience another worthwhile moment.
