So when I first saw commercials for the Greek, I had some questions about how they would approach Greek life if they would donate sacred secrets of brotherhoods and fraternities if they were going to focus on the brotherhood and brotherhood of a fraternity or fellowship brings, or what most college kids think of Greek life as a great holiday. Fortunately, it covered everything. The plot of the story was great, gave you a character to love, hate, someone you want to be, someone you do not want to be, and of course a crazy roommate! <br /> <br /> One of my first glances at what the writers believed the Greek life was, and I can honestly say they got it right. <br /> <br /> I love how one of the biggest things they covered over the season was the relationship between Rusty and his crazy roommate. It's hard to get away from home and be forced to live in a small room with someone you do not even know, so come and find out ... you have nothing in common. Probably every college linked freshmens worst nightmare. <br /> <br /> Rusty sister Casey was practically the typical girl on campus everyone is jealous of. What does not she have? Oh that's right .. Evan everything to herself. Rebecca and Evan had a "case" earlier in the season, which made you feel quite nice about Casey. His character evolved, and his relationship with Rusty became more and more loving and extroverted. <br /> <br /> Cappie is one of the most entertaining and absolutely insane characters. One of my favorite episodes included him being completely destroyed in a strip club, and Rusty having to call Casey to rescue them. I like how they approached the issue of gays in Greek homes, Calvin was a very real character, and I really respected him because he followed his standards. So Jen K was pretty crazy, but she really liked Rusty. It was surprising and I continued to question her from the start, but of course, I wanted it to work out between her and Rusty. <br /> <br /> I am definitely looking forward to the return of the Greek. It takes you to the truth of Greek life, something that many people look past. One of the greatest things fraternities and brotherhoods are known about is parties and drinks. Greek is a great show, and the characters are easy to relate to.
