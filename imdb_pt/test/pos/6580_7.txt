The problem I have as Finnish is that most of the actors in this film are in all Finnish films. I have the feeling that Finland has only five actors. I think if you're not from Finland, you really like this movie as a refreshing novelty. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a terrible chain of events that affects some people very severely. Alcoholism, cold weather and darkness may be clich√©s, but they are still very real in today's Finnish society. Many people in Finland have depression, especially during the winter. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film is very melancholic. I liked it and Louhimes' direction was again very solid. I really liked this movie, only the negative is that you see the same faces you've seen several times.
