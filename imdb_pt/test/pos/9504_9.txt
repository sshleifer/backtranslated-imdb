"Icky Flix" is a great starting point for anyone with a vague interest in residents. Most of his classic videos are present (though "Earth vs. Flying Saucers" and "Do not Be Cruel" are curiously absent), and the "concentrates" of his various CD-ROM projects offer tempting glimpses of how orbed have been spending their time since they realized that MTV was no longer putting them in high gear (or actually showing the period of the videos). <br /> <br /> All videos in this compilation feature stunning images and idiosyncratic music (with choice of original and newly recorded tracks). And two of them - "The Third Reich 'n' Roll" and "One Minute Movies" - are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Check out this DVD and find out why.
