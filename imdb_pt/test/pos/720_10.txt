If you like puzzles and suspense, you'll enjoy this movie. Truth be told that it was mainly the part of Adrian Paul that took me to catch him, I knew almost nothing about the film beforehand. The plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, begins to play a mysterious puzzle trying to discover "the motive" and engages in "game" solving puzzles. Vern (Adrian Paul) owns a store, also a puzzler, and also gets entangled in the game. The myth says that if you solve the game, the meaning of existence (referred to as "The Design") is revealed. The character of Brendan Fehr is a type of "village idiot" hanging in the store that shows itself more than it seems. Overall, I thought the movie was very well done. And it's definitely an original concept, a rare find nowadays! I personally like puzzles and puns, so while most of them were not too difficult, it was still a fun movie. It's worth the rent. <br /> <br /> So if you have not seen it yet, buy it! :-D <br /> <br />
