Shepitko is the wife of Russian filmmaker Elem Klimov, who directed the most well-known commercial film of 1984, COME AND SEE, generally regarded as one of the most realistic war movies of all time, none notable for its poetic intensity, but I believe that he does not have the inner complexity of this even larger Russian film, which examines not only the external graphic horrors but finds truly inspiring images focused on individuals or small groups of characters reflecting the absolute insanity that occurs within these human beings whose end is simply stunning. Bullets fly and bodies are dying in an armed confrontation over opening credits, where the intensity of the film never goes away for the entire duration, focusing on dark faces, soldiers worn with almost nothing to eat, a terrified population under occupation, starving children with petrified mothers, all sprawled in an immense landscape of endless white snow. As the cranes are flying (1957), this characterizes a retreating Russian army, a traumatic shock at the beginning of the war, when they were almost decimated. The Russian countryside was invaded by German Nazis who are terrorizing citizens, stealing their food, forcing them under duress to become their eyes and informants' ears. What the Russian soldiers are left to hide under the forests, but are forced to send food expeditions to the neighboring farms. This film follows two soldiers who, from the outset, are on an almost impossible mission, since there is little food left anywhere in the height of winter. One is healthy and fit, Vladimir Gostyukhin as Rybak, while the other, Boris Plotnikov as Sotnikov, is retarded by a tuberculous cough and eventually a bullet in the leg that almost leaves him to die, but his partner heroically rescues him. As they walk through the snow to the knees, crawling in some spots with insufficient protection against the aggressive elements, like so many other Russian films, nature itself becomes their most difficult adversary. Spoilers !! Everything is reduced to a matter of survival. When they arrive at their destination, the farm was demolished and left in ruins, pushing into the occupied German territory, where the next farm is occupied by an elderly Soviet collaborator who fears retribution from the Nazis. Partisan soldiers find him a coward, but they go on, where they are eventually captured and taken to a Nazi camp in a nearby town and held as prisoners, along with a proud and protective mother (Lyudmila Polyakova) who helped to hide them. Anatoly Solonitsyn appears as Portnov, the interrogator, a Russian professor from a nearby academy who became sympathizers of the Nazis. Russians torturing and running Russian colleagues is the depth of war depravity and Solonitsyn is brilliant in the despicable role that he is perfectly suited for. From what we can see, as the Nazi officials talk jovially next to each other, he is a stranger even among this group, seen as some sort of black-and-ugly undertaker who routinely sends men to his graves. The public is not spared from witnessing acts of torture in Sotnikov, who offers nothing but contempt, while Rybak speaks freely, hoping to save his life, but both are doomed, although Rybak can be offered a chance to serve the Reich German. police officer The mother, the elderly collaborator and a child are added to this group, spending a last night together, where together they discuss the merits of a soldier's mission, of being a patriot, a mother, a coward, or a collaborator. Each seems individually guided by a desperate need to survive, but Sotnikov offers himself as an altruistic example, trying to confess his guilt to spare others, where the appropriately chosen title reflects his spiritual redemption. The next morning, Portnov seems slightly amused, mocking them for his sudden will to speak, but spares no one but Rybak, who shifts aside to maintain his life, rationalizing in his thoughts that , if you are alive, you will at least have a chance to escape. But there is no escape from this torment. What happens is shown with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace, as we witness the betrayal of war without a single shot being fired, as execution by hanging is transformed into a public spectacle, where the villagers at the tip of a weapon are forced to witness. The rhythm and harrowing intensity of this film is relentless, as there is never a moment without imminent threat, beautifully filmed by Vladimir Chukhnov (who died in the same car accident as Shepitko), presenting perfectly composed landscapes and a lot of camera movement, much of it short distance with portraits, especially that of a ferocious young man at the end looking at the damned, who makes a surreal connection with the next generation without any words being said, accentuated by the psychologically horrible music of Alfred Shnittke that resembles the transcendent monolithic music but furiously disturbing of Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). The sound design of this film is highly advanced and uniquely modern, where the use of off-screen sound continually exposes the raw nerves of every moment, dogs barking, wind blowing, shooting bullets, Nazi chatter in untranslated German or laughing sadly from their helplessness, which only increases the hideous tension to insane heights. In many ways, resembling Dreyer's, total insanity is exposed here, the ruthless realization that you have no choice, but you are still forced to make one. The inner thoughts of nightmare at the end are expressed wordlessly, where the nobility of the dead speaks volumes, where the voices continue to reverberate within the heads of the living like an explosion of endless echoes, but only the silence fills the winter air with a bow sad. and a deep sense of loss.
