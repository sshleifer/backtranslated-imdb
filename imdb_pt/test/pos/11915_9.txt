I recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase I'm going through. I was born in 1980, so the movie from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s plays an important role in my growth. <br /> <br /> This particular movie was one of my favorites, so I was thrilled when it became available in the UK. It did not get any worse over time, it's still a very fun movie, with a lot of excitement in its own way. Of course, this does not apply to the shadow of bigger, bigger movies, but do not let that stop you from enjoying it. <br /> <br /> Worth a rental, or even a low-priced purchase you'll find for.
