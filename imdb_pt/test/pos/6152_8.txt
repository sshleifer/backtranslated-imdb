This looks like a Czech version of Pearl Harbor. It has the same story, the two guys fall in love with the same woman. And add to the twist, the woman is actually a married woman whose husband has been missing for a year. I do not think the plot is very strong. The younger guy is pretty naughty, that's cute. It kept me watching because of the emotional music and the nice scenes one after the other. It also has some strong special visual effects. Best of all, love stories are seamlessly integrated into the story. <br /> <br /> I think if it were in English, it would be such a big scene in every state. Too bad people are not open to foreign films.
