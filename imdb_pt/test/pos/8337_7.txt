... Wow, grandpa's time. <br /> <br /> More than the gangsters, it is a detailed description of an American family around 1930: the father, proud of his work, who cares about the son who gave up high school, the mother who everyone would love to have, the daughter who forgets dinner time in the arms of the squeeze and the twins who are absolutely kind ("Do not sleep first, please!"). <br /> <br /> And there's Grandfather, playing the Yankees scrawl on the flute. Did you realize that this song plays the same role as Doris Day's "Que Sera Sera" in Hitchcock's "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1956)? And there's that grandpa who's finally the bravest person in the family. So old that she does not even tell him her age, but proud of her country and resisting the hateful blackmail of the gangster. <br /> <br /> A good Wellman movie.
