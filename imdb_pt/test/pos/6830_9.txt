The movie was good. Really the only reason I watched it was Alan Rickman. He did not take the southern accent, but he did very well with it. Now, Emma Thompson did very well, she definitely took the southern accent. I like every character in my opinion, none of them did anything wrong, another thing I noticed. I read all these comments and no one commented on Alan 5 0'clock shadow. Which made it look even better and he pretty much had one all through the movie. I would give the film a 9 out of 10. Another one of my opinions is that the movie would be better if there was no sex. It was still okay. I love the scene where he says "Aw sh * t" when he is putting in his car and sees them in the mirror.
