There have been very few great comedy movies in the history of Hindi Cinema. Andaz Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of getting rich by marrying the daughter of a millionaire (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan try their best to deceive each other and conquer Raveena. The plot is complicated when Paresh Rawal & Co. plans to acquire all the wealth. The film is very rhythmic and very funny. He rarely comes across a Hindi comedy that is both funny and clever. This is one of the few films with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only movie!). Unfortunately, it did not hit the box office, and we may never see a movie of that caliber. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and proved his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as an idiot. Raveena plays a convincing role as a rich and confused girl, and Karishma, who is Raveena's assistant / friend, is also funny. Paresh Rawal, Ajith Junior, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania just add to the taste of the movie! All in all, the best hindi comedy ever made and I wish they would make more quality films like this. You will want to watch this movie over and over again. <br /> <br /> PS - For those of you who watched this movie, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new), etc.
