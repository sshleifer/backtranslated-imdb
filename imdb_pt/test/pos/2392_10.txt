I've been writing police fiction for years. When a writer develops a story, he always has a character / actor in mind to bring the story to life. Last weekend I found a new one on Paul Vario playing Uncle Benny on Eddie Monroe. This was a slick film highlighted by the presence of Vario both on and off the screen (as the narration of his voice is also heard). I also especially liked the actress who plays Benny's niece and Eddie's ex-wife, although everyone has done a good job on this thrilling movie about playing with bad guys and the double cross that goes with it. Good work around ... and Mr. Vario shone brighter. He has to be my Tony Gangi someday ...
