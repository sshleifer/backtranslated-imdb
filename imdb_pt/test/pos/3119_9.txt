Most of us kids who grew up in the 40s or 50s were western fans, but this was one that escaped me until I saw them on Movies for Men Channel today. I loved the story of the film, the cinematography, as well as the excellent cast of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. in the lead roles along with the ever-reliable Ward Bond. Apparently, this film was the inspiration for the later television series "Wagon Train" which featured Bond, again as the head of the train wagons heading west. Johnson steals the movie with his riding skills and it's good to see an actor doing his own action scenes as Ben does in this movie. Other notables include the lovely Joanne Dru as Denver and a non-speaking role for James Arness who later became famous for his role in the Marshal Matt Dillon in 'Gunsmoke'. If you like movies of this genre, you can not miss this movie.
