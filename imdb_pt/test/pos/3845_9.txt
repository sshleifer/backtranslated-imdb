When "Madame" decides to let her cats inherit her, that means trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar, who is next in line to inherit, decides to get rid of the cats. So the story can begin and cats can go on an adventure that otherwise would have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not totally reliable, O'Malley cat. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> The strength of this film is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is willing to settle the bills and, of course, himself takes some serious beatings. One of the best scenes contains him being chased by the two dogs Lafayette and Napoleon. The score is great and as in "The Jungle Book" you have scenes that are almost "musical" in the sense that the story does not progress and the focus is to let the protagonists express themselves through the dance. And of course we like it, the score is very jazzy. <br /> <br /> And of course it's not just me, but also my children who love this one. Greetings to Simon
