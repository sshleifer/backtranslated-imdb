This is an underrated solid thriller, which has thrills, an abundance, with a cool story, Sandra Bullock is fantastic!. All the characters are great, and I was surprised at how unpredictable it was as there were only a few predictable moments, plus Sandra Bullock is simply amazing at this! Jeremy Northam has played an incredible villain, and I know what Bullock's character is, because I am of the same type of person (I almost never go out), and this is very well done and written most of the time. . This should be higher than 5.5 in my opinion, and Denis Miller was surprisingly better than expected in his small role. The scene in which Northam terrorizes Bullock on his boat was quite suspenseful, and it was one of my favorite moments, and I also enjoyed the chase scene at the carnival, plus I enjoyed the ending too, as it was very well done, even if I did I think Northam was defeated too quickly. There are many other good chase scenes too, and it's also smart sometimes too, there are also some shocking moments too, this is a little underrated solid thriller, which has thrill of plenty, with a cool story, Sandra Bullock is fantastic, I recommend highly this! The direction is great!. Irwin Winkler does a great job! work here with excellent camera work, adding good atmosphere, good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The acting is fantastic! Sandra Bullock is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is extremely friendly, hard as nails and still quite vulnerable, and I could feel for her, because like I said, I'm kind of Angela, I almost never go out, I really liked it of her work in that movie! (Ox Rules !!!!!!!) Jeremy Northam is excellent as the villain, he was sneaky, unpredictable and very menacing, he was great. Dennis Miller is surprisingly good and not uncomfortable in his small role, and managed to bring some comic relief. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall I would highly recommend this!. *** 1/2 of 5
