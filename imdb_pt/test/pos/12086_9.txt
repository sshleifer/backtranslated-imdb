Forget all those romantic romance movies that involve notebooks and closed-lipped couples who somehow manage to go together into the afterlife after a lifetime of simplified unrealistic romance. Forget all those shameless movies that "the dog gives the life to save his family" (although I have to admit that I have a soft spot for them). Forget Ricky Schroeder already showing his propensity to exaggerate at a young age (now that one was without shame!). <br /> <br /> This TV movie, which unfortunately never seems to be exhibited anymore, is the all-time champion of looms, hands down. And a well-written and well-interpreted story. Ann-Margret had a great chance to take on that role. Nothing extravagant or sexy about her here, and that's a monumental achievement in itself. Based on a true story, she plays Lucile Fray, a terminally ill mother who chooses to fight to the last breath to find good homes for her ten children instead of leaving them in the hands of unpredictable government agencies. Frederic Forrest does a great job as her husband, the good but unreliable heart earner, whose crippling arthritis and personal demons make him unable to care for children. <br /> <br /> The film takes us to the painful process of Lucile. of interviewing prospective parents, and then watching their children leave home. It also gives us the perspective of the children themselves and the father - lamenting the tragedy that is taking place now and the one that will certainly follow, frustrated with their inability to do more. The scene in which the youngest of the children (Steven) is taken to his new home is the most heartbreaking I have ever seen. Now, I grew up as a "hopeless romantic," and have spent many years since becoming a more difficult and more cynical shell. I usually find more to mock than to empathize with the sentimental kinematic tripe foisted on us these days. But that gem of the early 80's still kills me. <br /> <br /> I would really like someone with a sense of marketing to publicize a DVD version of this drama. Among the special features, you need to include the Emmy Awards broadcast the following year. A-M was nominated for this role, but the prize for best dramatic actress went to Barbara Stanwyck for "Thorn Birds". In what must be one of the greatest moments of what is now a truly monotonous award, Stanwyck began to cry during his acceptance speech and said, "Ann-Margret, I love you!", Which led Ann-M to tears. > <br /> A final note. The cast and crew for "Who's Gonna Love My Children" is 6.4 at the time of writing. However, more than 75% of ratings are in the range of 8 to 10 (mostly 10). Whatever type of handicap system this site uses to modify the overall ratings of the movies listed by IMDb, it completely loses the brand in this. This is the "whiner" of all time, and a good TV movie to boot.
