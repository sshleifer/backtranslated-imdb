Ken Loach showed the world the bad side of Swinging London with "Poor Cow", about London woman Joy (Carol White) hooking up with a thief and having a child with him, just to see the man end up in the slammer. While his friend (Terence Stamp) manages to help her, he proves to be a little better at a loser than he is. It soon becomes clear to Joy that she will have to make a serious decision about where she is going in her life. <br /> <br /> One thing I have determined - I do not know if this is correct or not - It was an ironic use in the movie. Her name is Joy, but she does not feel joy in her life. Even though this was not planned, it is still a movie that I recommend to everyone. Featuring Donovan songs (one of them - "Colors" - appeared in another Terence Stamp movie: "The Limey" (which incidentally came out in 1999, when I was as old as my parents were when "Poor Cow" came out) ).
