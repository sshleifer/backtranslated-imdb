I like full house and step by step the same. I do not have a favorite episode I just like certain scenes. but some scenes that I do not like, but I have to say that the reason I started to attend this show is because Suzanne Summers was there. and my most favorite character was Dana. and Karen could be snobby at times, but she was also a good character. I just like watching family gigs instead of junk that has a lot of drugs and violence. This show is very much like other family shows where one parent is always strict about curfews and dates. plus step by step, my other favorite shows are full house, Sabrina the teenage witch, gomer pyle usmc, the show of griffith andy and dukes of hazzard.
