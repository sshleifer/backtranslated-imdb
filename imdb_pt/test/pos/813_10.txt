This has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The idea of ​​a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the desert. When Mom and Dad lose jobs, not to mention they have green slime in their tub. They decide it is best for their families to move to Oregon. Once there everything goes wrong. An interesting cast of characters praises this film. Including a young Molly Ringwald, this movie I definitely recommend.
