Being a freshman in college, this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mother. Of course, my situation is not in keeping with the situation of Natalie Portman and Surandon; but my mother and I grew up with the typical struggles of mother and daughter. There is always the mother telling you what to do, or not being the kind of mother you want to be. I was rocking my eyes at the end of this movie. His daughter's Surandon reaction to the east coast, miles away, after all that passed, reminded me of how I felt, from a small town on the west coast to New York. <br /> <br /> The film is aimed at women who have children who are now grown. It's very touching, I was touched by the film. All the feelings of the characters in this movie were totally real, you had no false sentimentality. I was sitting with the credits at the screening of this movie, alone, wishing my mother was sitting next to me so I could hug her and thank her for everything. This movie is a little tacky, of course, but everything is truly momentous. It's all about what a mother can learn from her child; and what a child learns from the mother. 8/10
