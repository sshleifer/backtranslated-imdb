I always knew the day was coming. We all knew. There is just too much oil in the soil and one day we will run out of fuel. But should not there be enough coal to use? And wind power, or something. Things for future generations to worry about. <br /> <br /> So this documentary hit me between the eyes. The oil makes the fertilizer which is the reason for the first time in world history practically nobody lives on farms. When the inevitable shortage of oil arrives, many things - air travel, too many drugs, plastics, suburban life - will become impossible. But the craziest perception of the documentary is this: oil gives us so much energy with so little effort that without it our lives must change. Even if substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately, at best they will soften our landing in a strange post-oil world that (the documentary claims) could be starting NOW. <br /> <br /> Despite his somber message, the documentary is often very entertaining. It contains fabulous historical images (sober images of dark urban factories and exaggerated funny things from the 1950s) that remind us why we moved to the suburbs in the first place. It also offers hope that a massive effort initiated now may ease our oil transition and make the world a better place. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the documentary is that it does not devote time to the mystery of why we are discovering these things now. How can this be a major emergency all of a sudden? We knew that by the 1970s we should be preparing for a post-oil world - and we began to prepare ourselves with alternative energy research and smaller cars. If our failure to follow President Jimmy Carter's initiatives 25 years ago has condemned us to a hard landing in a post-oil world, why did not anyone shout about it on stage? <br /> <br /> In the end, I found the documentary highly persuasive; and this left me with the terrible cold of being dragged out of a very beautiful dream. It is for everyone who is not afraid to face a very likely future, we still have time to do something. Charles
