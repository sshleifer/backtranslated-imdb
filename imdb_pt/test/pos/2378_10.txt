Four unhappy women leave the sad London to pass ENCHANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth von Arnim's novel comes to life in this charming little movie that demonstrates the virtues of a literary script and ensemble. acting. All elements come together to produce a film that, although almost forgotten now, still produces a feeling of appreciation for the proper resolution of the story. <br /> <br /> The actresses innocently splendidly. Ann Harding is the free-spirited wife who longs for "wisteria & tranquility" away from the hazy London. Katharine Alexander plays the quiet housewife who desires the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle. Jane Baxter is the beautiful young noblewoman who has temporarily escaped from her multitude of male admirers. Jessie Ralph steals all the scenes in which she is like an old lady just wanting to be alone with her memories of the past. <br /> <br /> The men of history are also well made. As Miss Harding's husband, Frank Morgan has a rather complex role as a spoiled researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer. Reginald Owen, as the spouse of Ms. Alexandra, is wonderfully pompous as a well-equipped man for England (her hilarious attempt to take an English bath in an Italian bathtub is even more fun with the help of Charles Judels and Rafaela Ottiano. Finally, Ralph Forbes, one of the best forgotten actors of the decade, is cheerfully eccentric as the carefree owner of women. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize Ethel Griffies, uncredited, as the owner of the Hampstead Housewives Club.
