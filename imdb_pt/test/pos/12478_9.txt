What do you get when you have a tenacious and experienced French police inspector named Maurice Martineau to solve a murder case? Well, just a fun and fun movie. The remastered black-and-white film "Quai des Orfevres" delivers the products despite romance, jealousy and marriage that seem only to disrupt the truth of "who did it?" Inch by inch, technique by technique tempered by experience and intuition, the patience of this Master Inspector attacks the truth - but of course, with the help of a bag full of dirty tricks of police questioning. <br /> <br /> Martineau is the centerpiece of this film. Henri-Georges Clouzot's use of strident music to intensify the drama in the grand noir film style is a wonderful cover around the visual experience. <br /> <br /> Martineau finally solves the mystery and arrests the guilty. Hey, he's good !! But unfortunately, Martineau can also keep an obscure secret in his past. Who is this boy who may not be his son? <br /> <br /> Some things can never be solved - even after the final credits.
