I would buy this and "Thirty Seconds Over Toyko" today, if available. I also saw this movie after seeing Jack Webb's big billboards in his Dress Blues on the road at the age of 12. I've always admired Jack Weeb as a John Wayne and American guy all the way. He almost became a Marine just because of this movie, but served in the Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Army Reserve for 32 years. I have not seen this movie on TV and would like to have it on DVD. At least if it were on TV I would copy it to VHS and use it even available on DVD. I also have a large collection of World War II and Korean War films and I always look for new releases on DVD.
