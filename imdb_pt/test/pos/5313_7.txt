After stabbing a retarded boy, troubled and pessimistic Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) of fifteen, is sent to juvenile detention. His teacher and aspiring writer Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle) approaches and tries to understand him, first with the intention of writing a book and then becoming his friend. Leland slowly reveals his sad world view, showing that he is a sociopath. <br /> <br /> "The United States of Leland" is a depressing and interesting study of a character. The low-rhythm riveting script discloses pieces of the story as a puzzle; there are excellent lines and dialogues; the performances are great, although twenty-three-year-old Ryan Gosling does not convince himself as a fifteen-year-old; but it looks like it's missing a bit to complete the puzzle and make the "United States of Leland" an unforgettable movie. The disappointing clarification of the "why" of Leland's violent action against Ryan Pollard is not convincing or touching, in fact shows that this character is a totally crazy sociopath with a strange and unhealthy view of the world. Also, the way Allen Harris picks up Pearl's knife is ridiculous. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The World of Leland" ("The World of Leland")
