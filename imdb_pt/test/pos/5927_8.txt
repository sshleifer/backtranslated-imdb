I've watched this movie several times over the years and have always found it a fun experience. As a retired pilot, I'm interested in most aviation movies and this is one of the best. I know that Lindbergh was only 25 at the time of his historic solo flight to Paris and that James Stewart had almost 50 years making this film, but I can ignore that fact because Stewart has always been one of my favorite actors of all time and does one of his outstanding performances as the "solitary eagle". <br /> <br /> There is a good mix of comedy and drama throughout the film and good use of flashbacks. It also helps that James Stewart was a real-life pilot in both military and civilian life.
