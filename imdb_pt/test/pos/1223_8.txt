Well unlike most people .... I got into this movie hoping it was not so good and turned out to be an amazing movie. Very cool plot I love the idea of ​​that, but what really made this movie was the actors. they all did an amazing job and it was really cool to see fishburn and dillon working together. It's a movie where you immediately think you'll be able to predict what's going to happen, but it does not end like you predicted. I do not want to give anything about the story, so I will not ... but I suggest giving this a chance. If you saw the movie Money Train and liked that you would love this movie. Maybe all that Lawrence Fishburn plays is gold?
