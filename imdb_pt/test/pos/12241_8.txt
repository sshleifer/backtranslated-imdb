Or maybe not. Whatever anyone thinks of "Broadcast News", good or bad, almost all credit for this "thought" belongs to writer-producer-director James L. Brooks. As a screenwriter (of whom he has long been one of the best), it is not easy to attack an entire business - in this case the "business" being television news - but to do so with a smile, a wink, a nod of knowledge and a laugh practically every step of the way. To do all this requires real talent, something Mr. J. Brooks has in abundance. <br /> <br /> A user of this site, in his summary, asked the musical question: "Did Walter Cronkite act like this?" Answer: no! Of course not! And the reason for that is Walter's day - Mr. Cronkite, the only thing that mattered was bringing the news to people. The same goes for John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Of course, they had to pay attention to their services, even if only to please their bosses. But all they REALLY cared about was the news itself. <br /> <br /> Now, of course, all that has changed. In the last 25 to 30 years in the network news business, the only thing that really mattered were rankings, rankings and rankings. The bottom line. How many dollars will our news division provide to the network? Do not believe this? <br /> <br /> Let's consider "The Big Three": Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings (aka Stanley Stunning). All three are already at work on their respective anchor tables for the last 15 to 20 years (Peter actually got his first break in the 1960s, but he was totally unprepared for the job). Of the three, Dan is the one who has the most field training as a reporter. Personally, I think all three do great jobs as news anchors and deserve their positions. All this has nothing to do with why all three are actually in those jobs. All three are now in their 60s (Dan is pushing the big 7-0) and all three are still very cute. And if you think they're still good-looking now, imagine how handsome they were in their 40s when all three were hired to (say, "put") their current jobs. But you honestly believe that any of those three would have been "placed" if he looked, say, Fred Gwynne ("Herman Munster"). Or as - heaven forfend - ME !!! Not only that, if Dan was retiring tomorrow, a young man (who is today) Walter Cronkite would not be able to recover his old job. Because? Not pretty enough. And it would not matter at all that he was, or once was, "the most trustworthy man in America." <br /> <br /> And that's what "Broadcast News" is all about. Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), the next little boy-national newscaster who has trouble with some small things, like thinking for himself, being able to write and know things. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the brilliant news producer with news and ethics business standards, all of whom are taken to the wind when she falls in love with a handsome boy, Tom. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, unrelated to James L.), an excellent news writer and field reporter who has no hope of a national job because he "sweated" behind the support table. And many other defective characters you KNOW actually exist in the news divisions of the various networks. <br /> <br /> The "Net" made its way. Eleven years later, "Broadcast News" took the torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, what will be the next movie to save the network business "news you can use" ..... maybe. Or maybe not.
