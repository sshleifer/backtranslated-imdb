A pretty woman, a backwoods, an innate monster man, a super-sweet monster truck, a zombie road-killer brother and two friends ... a reclusive, overly sensitive anal, nerds, and the other a dirty, teenage idiot. Play them all together with a dash of Jeepers Creepers, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Road Trip and you have Monster Man. A hilarious horror / comedy that never comes out to "say anything". It's a party of simple and direct laughter. Unpretentious and well done, this horror / comedy is in your heart, a movie of friends. This film offered some hilarious and sickly pieces. I recommend this to scare the fans who want to have fun.
