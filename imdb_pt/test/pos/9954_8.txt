People have been uncomfortable with "The Merchant of Venice," because of its anti-Semitic affair. Fortunately, this film avoids this, instead opting instead to show how anti-Semitism reigned supreme in sixteenth-century Europe. The story, of course, is that Antonio (Jeremy Irons) needs money to help Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) get Portia's hand (Lynn Collins) in marriage. He receives money from the Jewish usurper Shylock (Al Pacino), who demands a pound of flesh from Antonio if this does not repay the loan. When Antonio can not repay the loan, Shylock is determined to get what he owes him. <br /> <br /> We hope this cast does a good job, and they do not disappoint. It's more proof of the great actor Al Pacino.
