There was a recent documentary about making movies, which featured a long list of actors and directors talking about what it's like to make movies. A common theme is that you can have a great script, a great cast, the best director and lots of money and still make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Down Periscope is proof of the corollary of this theory. It's not an original script or terribly well written. Some solid but mostly unknown actors, and this movie makes you laugh out loud! It would be easy to say only that Kelsey Grammar has made this film, but this is not really the case. Other character actors, such as Rob Schneider, and the hilarious Harland Williams, have significantly increased the fun of the film. <br /> <br /> Cast dynamics, or that mysterious "magic movie", was what happened here, creating a movie. which flows smoothly, has incredibly well executed transitions and line after well written and well executed line of dialogue. <br /> <br /> An absurd premise, many and many technical inaccuracies and just plan foolish things that could not happen in the real world, or the Royal Navy, but you just do not care. As a merchant marine, I discovered that the overall feel of the movie, though not plausible, was not too far off the mark with regard to life at sea. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny movie. , a good family movie, and particularly if you're a fan, much of Kelsey Grammar's grace, sarcasm and damn fun.
