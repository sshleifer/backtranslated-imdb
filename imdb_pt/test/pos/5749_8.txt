I would just like to say that the film was good and touching. The movie explains to you the true meaning of being saved or born again and is very well defined. The acting was very good, but it could make some improvements. The story of the painting is captivating and when my church had service to the young and we watched, 8 people gave life to Christ. I would also like to also say to anyone reading this, give your life to Christ and repent of your sin.
