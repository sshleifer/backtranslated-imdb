First of all I would like to say that this movie is the greatest thing that has ever happened to mankind. It's the best of all the great Muppet movies, and all the other movies out there! then BOO-YA to Jim Henson! <br /> <br /> This movie is the first of all Muppets movies and the best. (boo ya) It's about a frog (kermit) trying to make for hollywood. along with the incredible friends he meets along the way come some of the best songs ever made that are doomed to become classics, including "The Rainbow Connection" <br /> <br /> In conclusion I would like to say that watching this movie was the best thing ever!. If you still have not seen it, leave your computer and leave it at the nearest video store !!! (if they do not have the muppets movie, I would process them BIG TIME)
