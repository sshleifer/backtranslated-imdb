In this movie, astronauts sent to explore a newly discovered planet must deal with various dilemmas, and they do so intelligently. The film approaches its main theme of the plot in a unique way, and unfolds it gradually, although it can be guessed in advance. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good, although sometimes rigid, since some actors from the late 60's can be. It can also be a little wordy and even melodramatic, especially after the theme of the plot unfolds. Visually, it has a scene that resembles one in the "2001: A Space Odyssey" of the previous year, and that tends to date the film. Some of the actors went on to star in the 1970s UFO TV show, which is deliciously exaggerated and worth checking out on DVD. <br /> <br /> Despite these small points, space flight itself is realistic, and considering that was in 1969, the scenes inside the spacecraft's cockpit also had a realistic appearance. (Also look for the video technology of the 1990s and 2000s!) One thing: I suspect a love scene has been cut, but I can not prove it! It would have been a distraction anyway. <br /> <br /> Unlike most science fiction films, this movie will make you think about the plot, and this is well worth it. I'm happy to have this movie in my video library.
