Exceptional film that deals with a theme of great proportions with a well balanced direction. Dmytrik was a very good director, at least from what I can say of this film and Murder My Sweet, but he was seriously affected by HUAC like other film directors and actors. It's somewhat ironic that Crossfire did not get Oscar, because it's a great example of how to make a great low budget movie. Everything about this film is exceptional: a well written screenplay that makes use of extensive flashbacks, a great cast, superb lighting that seems to tell the story more than the actual actions. What else can you expect from a top-notch movie? I may add that the noir is used here for its elegance, and I could add financial advantages. But this again proves that what was originally considered a B movie may have more impact today than most of the heavyweight films that have lost their audiences over time. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a noir movie and this raises serious questions about what the noir really is. The style is definitely noir, in terms of scenery and especially lights, but the theme surpasses the recipe of "noir genre". You can see things from the opposite point of view and state that anti-Semitism is just a pretext for criminal investigation, the riddle around murder is the real focus. This would have been the case had it not been for Robert Ryan in an outstanding performance. Anyway, the film has a lot to offer and it's a shame the director has suffered so much iniquity from his old beliefs in a really "noir" period of America.
