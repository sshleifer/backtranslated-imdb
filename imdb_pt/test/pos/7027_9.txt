Dirty Dancing follows the story of Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Gray) and her family as they spend the summer at Kellerman Family Summer Camp. We begin to see her discover herself as she falls in love with dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). <br /> <br /> The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!) Some good music, and fantastic scenery. It handles some difficult issues with dignity and grace and of course has (shocking spoiler here!) A happy, wonderful, good ending! You know how it will end from the beginning, but that's not the point here. The point is the journey, a journey that touches all members of the family. <br /> <br /> It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV ... no matter the fact that I've already memorized it!
