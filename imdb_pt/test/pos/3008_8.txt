I give this movie 8/10 overall. Visually, much of it is nothing less than impressive: the dream mix of an art director of Hieryonomous Bosch, Salvador Dal√≠, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe - and a valid testimony of the power of cinema as a serious art form . Beautiful use of colors, shapes, images, environments - and fabulous decorations, combine with state-of-the-art computer graphics. So, 10/10 for that! Wow!! <br /> <br /> The plot is, well, more predictable. You know they'll save the girl and catch the killer in the end, but the story is still interesting and peaceful enough to pull you in and keep you there. 6/10 for this. Squirm factor ... I'm not going to give this a rating, but the movie certainly made me squirm, and I was watching video on a tv screen. It would, of course, have a lot more impact on a big screen. The graphic violence of an erotic and distorted nature in a surrealist landscape - even if beautiful - is highly unpredictable. The world inside the killer's head is not - thank God! - my world. As I watched this film on video, I was able to reproduce some sequences and discovered a lot to admire the second time I was not so nervous about where the scene might be going, and I suspect the movie would be worth it. seeing a second time, just for "visual art". <br /> <br /> General suggestion: Do not take kids or conservative grandmas to this one, but if you are interested in the look of movies, such as surrealist art, do not mind a little eccentric, and just want to do a little "mental journey", this is a winner. Oh, and if you like babies, Jennifer Lopez is very hot. <br /> <br />
