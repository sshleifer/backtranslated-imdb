I had this in Turner Classic just because it was pre-coded and looked interesting. When I first started watching, I noticed that the "criticism" gave a star and a half on a four-star scale. I began to watch with apprehension - even old movies can be bad movies - but I soon got caught up in the story and performance of Mary Astor as the brains behind the rise of a simple salesman to success. It's not a really great movie - very predictable - but certainly better than advertised. And I wish I had seen more of Ricardo Cortez as the man who appreciates Mary, but does not give up on his wealthy wife. I would recommend taking a look just to enjoy Astor's and that long way we came, baby.
