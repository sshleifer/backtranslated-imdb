The mere presence of Sam Waterston as an Indian, is enough to put this movie in the category not to be missed. He is handsome and very subtle, with no lines. He is tender with his abduction, and yet we can see that he is among the proudest of all young Indians. Martin Sheen is just an idiot who decides to challenge Waterston (White Bull) to a beautiful white horse. Other subplots are really unnecessary. I do not understand the role played by Caroline Langrishe as the poor girl that White Bull kidnaps ... I do not know how she keeps her hands away from this handsome Indian man! It's a lot of fun, though; especially if you are a fan of Waterston. Dude, he looks GOOD in this !!! The role of Harvey Keitel is not even worth mentioning, to tell you the truth! But, rent and enjoy! In fact, I believe that if the soundtrack were better, it would have been a more dramatic film ... the music is so bad that it distracts. Still - there's Mr. Waterston!
