I love the Thackeray novel that this movie is based on. And while this modern version of Becky Sharp's story is a B movie, Loy's cast, in her first first role, is quite fascinating. Before Loy became the reigning good girl of MGM in a bunch of gentis and comic roles, she was an actress. VANITY FAIR was Loy's accompanying film for EMMA, in which she portrayed a greedy stingy daughter who nearly destroyed the loyal housekeeper (Marie Dressler). <br /> <br /> Loy's Becky is much more unpleasant than Miriam Hopkins' version 3. years later in BECKY SHARP. Becky, of Loy, is a pre-Code character with its necklines and amoral manners. It's the kind of character that Jean Harlow or Clara Bow could easily have played, but Becky must still be on the set. That's what makes her character so tragic. <br /> <br /> In counterpoint to Loy's understanding, Becky is the amiable Amelia (Barbara Kent), who is not just an interesting character. Mary Forbes is very good as Mrs. Sedley. Most of the other actors in this version are very blah: Conway Tearle as Rawdon; Walter Byron as Osborne; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin. Others are almost Dickensian is their strangeness: Billy Bevan as Joseph; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; Montagu Love as the Marquis; Lilyan Irene as Polly the maid; Elspeth Dudgeon as the maid. Loy is front and center everywhere. While the ending is quite shocking, she has several great scenes, such as the game scene in the casino, where she tries to steal the bet from another woman's winning roulette. The more Loy's Becky comes down morally, the more beautiful she gets until she is finally "caught". Bottom line here is that this is a very solid Loy performance in a film that must be seen.
