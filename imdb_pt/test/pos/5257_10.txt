Yes, this movie is another remake. Yes, this movie can be considered a girl's movie. And yes, this movie is not perfect. The Women is, however, a modern and smart update on the social behaviors of all women, with an impressive cast of celebrities like Meg Ryan, Debra Messing, Annette Benning and Bette Midler. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around four people. (Benning), Alex (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Edie (Debra Messing) and the female creature from out of this world who is responsible for most of the drama of the film, called Crystal (Eva Mendez). Mary is trying to deal with her betraying husband (who has never been seen in the movie), following the advice of her friends and her mother (Candice Bergen). <br /> <br /> In addition to Mary, there is Sylvie who is torn between her social life and her professional life. She has decisions to make this test her moral and ethical values. Then there is the writer Alex, who is a lesbian, with a lot of courage, but knows the way with words. And finally Edie with four girls and another baby on the way, who loves children and has a heart of gold, with a hidden secret revealed at the end. <br /> <br /> Together, women live by revenge, depending on each one of them. another, and give each other life lessons. But it's the special guest appearances of Bette Midler, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Carrie Fisher and Debi Mazar, who show the cruel and habitual behavior of women. Bergen plays Ryan's mother, she is tough, silver-tongued, experienced, and still feels she could have become what her daughter does afterwards. There is Fisher who shows how to blackmail and test the limits of selfishness, morality, and betrayal. Mazar, the gossip girl, who shows no mercy for what she says and for whom she says. Leachman who plays Ryan's sassy housewife, she knows her place, when and where she needs it, and how to deliver a good one-liner. Finally, there's the MIdler, who plays Leah Miller, a crazy eclectic but wise Hollywood agent. She is the only character who gives Mary of Ryan an epiphany about who she really is, discovering "what I want". Although the Midler scene steals performance and memorable quotes, it has been underutilized. <br /> <br /> But back to the film, together women show the public what it means to live in the 21st century without knowing exactly what you want until the time comes when you answer that question. It addresses feminism, which means to be a woman (fierce, relentless, rude, tacky, cunning, clever, shy, proud, self-conscious, careless, beautiful, strong, independent); and also what women want, why women are what they are. It's funny, modern and by all means is not a work of art. But the bottom line is, it's worth the money and time to see veteran and younger actresses teach us all about women.
