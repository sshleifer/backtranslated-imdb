This, which was shown in Italian in a Rome cinema (not as bad as it sounds) after being presented at the Rome Film Festival, is much more an art film and a festival film, guaranteed to delight and delight this audience for his distinctive film. style, funny humor; ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others; attractive and cheerful music; punctual performances; dominate the sweetness and humanity - but condemned, because of its uniqueness and lack of a convincing plot, to leave the common public wondering what it is seeing and why someone admires it, as it was done. <br /> <br /> Andersson gives us almost a series of dry skits. Going through them are various topics. Money: a guy at the next table (Waldemar Nowak) cuts a rich man's wallet talking on a cell phone in a restaurant with a glass of brandy, then orders a set of elegant custom suits; an imbecile son calls his celebrated father away from an elaborate meeting to ask him for another loan. A psychiatrist worries about his exhausted investments while his wife soaks him in bed wearing only a shiny Viking helmet. <br /> <br /> Depression: A primary school teacher (Jessica Nilsson) breaks classes because her husband called her "harpy;" the wife of the carpet salesman (Pär Fredriksson) faints before the customers because he calls her that. Several men have depressing dreams. But hey - this is Sweden. Is not everyone depressed? Problems of love: a fat and bohemian couple is always separating; a groupie of girls has fantasies about a guitarist, Micke (Eric Bäckman). Wives knock on doors when their husbands begin to practice their instruments. (The music is also obviously a unifying theme.) In addition to the violent guitarist, there is a tuba and a drummer who are in a Dixierland band and also play marches and funerals. with another.) A furious storm outside the window of many scenes, violent rain, people out there, thunder so loud it sounds like a battle that plagues the earth. This also unifies the tone and gives the impression that several scenes are happening on the same day, frighteningly stormy. <br /> <br /> Andersson is a master of visual composition and static mid-distance shooting, and the film has a hazy gray shade. The green look created by DP Gustav Danielsson is perfect because it evokes the darkness of a Swedish winter, but also shines with the subtle colors of the director's intelligence, which ends each scene with a smile. One hardly ever knew insomnia could be so beautiful. (Or perhaps one has done so: Alexcanr Sokurov creates such effects sometimes in very different contexts.) Within the scenes and in the film as a whole there is a kind of stillness that comes from the visual style, the rhythm of the scenes and the disinterested humanism of the general outlook. There is something about a fully mastered style that is soothing, comforting. <br /> <br /> Not everything works so well. You may feel impatient with the succession of ill-connected scenes, which are often read like the work of a Saturday Night Live writer who needs Prozac. Since some scenes clearly move you or make you laugh, it's obvious that the others are a bit boring. <br /> <br /> But some scenes are real, and an obviously triumphant climax of pure magic is a dream - described and then visualized dreams as another important thread) in which the girl imagines herself in a dress of a newly wed marriage with his ideal guitarist, who plays a delicate series of riffs as a crowd of admirers gather outside a large window. The viewpoint shifts to the outside and the window slowly moves away, as if the building from which the newlyweds of dreams appeared was a train leaving a station to take them to their honeymoon. It is a fresh, subtle and sublime effect. <br /> <br /> Eventually, you can feel everything in You, Live (Du Levande) is a dream, including the recurring scene where the bartender is always playing a bronze bell. announcing the last request, with which all the numbed clients rise from their tables and go up to get another drink. <br /> <br /> An Italian critic called this a "great little movie," and that's right. It is limited in a dozen ways, but there is greatness in it. Roy Andersson is a small master (like some medieval miniaturist) of the internal comedies of Scandinavian darkness, and this is a film unlike any other. Shown this year as a selection of "Un Certain Regard" from Cannes, this is also the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film of 2007. Hard to say what Bergman would think, but Andersson worked with him; is famous for its elaborate TV commercials, some of which can be seen on YouTube. Bergman called them "the best commercials in the world". It will be interesting to see if this director, whose art is as subtle as his point of view, will begin to work on longer segments at some point. Meanwhile, any good movie fan really needs to take a look at this. <br /> <br /> "Schadenfreude" is not exactly the right word. This means delighting in the misery of others. Andersson is teaching us to delight in the misery of all of us.
