Okay, I know it's clich√©. Taken on its surface, this is a bad movie - maybe in a league with "Plan 9 From Outer Space". The dialogue is suspicious (but Singlish is quite nice ...), the plot is not very believable, Gavin's character far surpasses. While watching the movie, there are some things that really make you wonder ... Cute and Kim enjoying a tank, Gwen eating a banana in a bath, almost everything Gavin says and does ("psssssssssssssssycho !!"). These things taken separately are perhaps flaws. Taken together, however, are just quirks. Watch this movie with an open mind (especially if you are not familiar with Singapore culture), and with a group of open-minded friends is guaranteed to deliver a lot of laughter and a memorable moment. You can not enter this movie expecting a masterpiece, or even hoping to bring something serious to everyone. If you can get this movie the way it is - an underdog movie about the underdogs, filled to the brim with their own quirks - then you should have fun watching this movie! I've seen this three times and I would not hesitate to watch it three more times !!
