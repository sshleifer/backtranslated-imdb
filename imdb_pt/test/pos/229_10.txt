One night, I listened to the radio and they had Leslie Nielsen on the program. He went on to explain why there were only 6 shows. 'With TV shows like MASH, you could go to the refrigerator to get a beer, and as long as you knew what was happening, you would not miss anything. But with the police squad, you had to watch the show, with the vision jokes that you missed a lot if you did not see them. Who could forget "... the part of the city known as" Little Italy "..." with the coliseum in the background. <br /> <br /> Even the movies depended heavily on the jokes of the vision, but again being In the theater, you were a captive audience. <br /> <br /> Leslie also said that the only reason the show, movies, and other films like Airplane were funny is because they did not try to say what was funny. Went to the viewer to get the jokes. <br /> <br /> Well, that's just my 2 cents.
