I just saw the film for the first time in its entirety (although I saw some parts when it was first shown in Britain in the mid-1990s), I really believe it to be a late 20th century cinema masterpiece . No doubt a film of this scope raises many questions, such as why there are some narrative differences between Hermann's 60s in 'Heimat' and Hermann in this film? For example, in the first film Hermann has a very significant relationship with his stepfather (he finances Hermann's electronic music), while in "Die Zweite ..." there is little mention of his father until the last episode. <br /> Another point interests me; reading about Edgar Reitz I am impressed by the historical similarities between him and the character Stefan, (spoiler coming) in the last episode it is revealed that Stefan won a prize at the Venice Film Festival, (Reitz won a best work premiere award there for his film "Mahlzeiten"); Reitz's film producer is called 'Edgar Reitz Filmproduktion' and Stefan's film is also nominated for 'Eponymosa'. I'm interested in Stefan being an autobiographical character, because apart from Helga he's probably the least kind of friends. <br /> <br /> Maybe Stefan is nothing, I do not know, what I do know is that I loved this movie and wanted more done so, except for "Cache" and Michael Haneke's "Werner" Grizzly Man "by Herzog, there is no such ambition, audacity, and passion in modern cinema. I can not wait to see number 3 now.
