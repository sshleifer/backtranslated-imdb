A remake of the silent film of 1916, based on the 1909 novel by Maurice Leblanc. The series of detectives would be turned into numerous plays, films and TV series in the United Kingdom, the US and France over the years. This 1932 version starred the crushing Barrymore brothers John (as Duke) and Lionel (as Detective Guerchard). They would also star together in the Grand Hotel, Dinner at Eight and several others in the next two years. Sonia (Karen Morley) appears in the duke's bed during a party in this pre-Hayes movie; first the lights go out in the room, then they leave the main ballroom, then the search is for the staff and the missing gems, as well as other missing valuables ... You can say that the talkers were not around too long either , as they still use caption cards several times. Also look for a new type of safe that does not need a combination. A well-thought-out plot, without big holes, but also without big surprises. Not bad for a movie. Smart end.
