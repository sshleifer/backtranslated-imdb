I was fortunate enough to see this movie pre-release last night and although I was not expecting it, I really really enjoyed the movie most of the time. The rescues and effects of the sea were amazing to watch and definitely from the edge of the bank's stressful moments, probably all the more knowing that there are guys who do this for a living. The weaker parts of the film revolve largely around stereotyped scenes. I'm not going to spoil the movie, but this really follows the lines of An Officer and a Gentleman and those moments give a rather unpleasant taste. <br /> <br /> As I've said all along this film is very good and worth checking as long as you can get through the clich√©s.
