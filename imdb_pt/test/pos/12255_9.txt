If you have not yet watched an end-of-the-80's movie about the Communication Department of a news broadcaster from the news broadcaster I recommend it. It is a sad comment about the direction of reporting in this country, but it tells the story with wit. The characters are well-developed and the performance of Albert Brooks is fabulous. It offers all its lines with a fun discreet comedy. I'm not a fan of Albert Brooks, so this was a welcome surprise. I have a friend who works as a producer on a local news station and he warned that this is almost as real as the director and filmmaker to do his research. <br /> <br /> Fun movie with a lot of insight into the world of the news network. It is not as obscure as another movie that I also recommend in the same genre 'Network'.
