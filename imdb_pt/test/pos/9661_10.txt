My teacher made this movie. It's a new beginning. Watch and you will not notice that it is a Romanian movie. The old boring style was gone. Now it's something else. A post-revolutionary film. He is using the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists. They are unique. You will not even know you're watching, it will simply be transferred beyond the screen and you'll feel each frame. Do not miss it, pay attention to the plot, but do not ignore the details. They make the difference between this film and the other Romanian films. You will hear some music at some point. It is representative of a part of us, but it does not represent us. Please keep your head straight and let your body free.
