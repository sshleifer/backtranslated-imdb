I've seen this movie years ago and never forgot. The theme is very timely. It was at TCM this morning and I'm wondering why this wonderful movie is not on VHS or DVD. I've been researching extensively for this movie, but I can not seem to find it. I believe that if enough people ask for it, the film will finally be released on DVD. It amazes me that such an impressive performance of Quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must-see for teachers and students alike. This film is a great teaching tool of the past, but in many ways as contemporary as "Crash." From previous reviews, I can see that this movie made deep impressions on everyone. Again, very bad, it is not available for sale.
