A tremendous action movie I've seen. It was the first expression I uttered after watching it twice on local TV in my country, Indonesia. A combination of constant shooting and a great fight choreography was well performed by David Bradley. He was good here besides American Samurai. His martial art skill was performed above average. He managed to make the cool fight scenes to watch. Not just punching and kicking like what most martial artists show in their movies. David Bradley could use all the techniques of martial arts, like throwing, crushing and kicking. Highly recommended for action fans. I tried looking at the DVD, but I still can not particularly in my city. can anybody help me?
