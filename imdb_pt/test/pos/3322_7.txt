This work girls go to hell soap is a time capsule candidate, courtesy of their immaculate physical production, 50s wardrobe (look at all those bows and pearls), creamy Johnny Mathis theme and oh daring (turn) sexual attitudes. Rona Jaffe's novel, on which the film was based, continues to be republished, and only a few years ago Vanity Fair devoted an article to this delightful bon bon from a movie. Take a look at the new DVD download and you'll know why. <br /> <br /> The three protagonists - Hope Lange, Diane Baker and Suzy Parker - echo the girls from "How to Marry A Millonaire" or Carrie Bradshaw and their "Sex and the City" friends. "Gentlewomen sings in a marathon ..." His romantic adventures and sexual engagements are the stuff of the paperback's passion: empty caramel calories, devoid of nourishment, impossible to resist snacking on. Lange is genuinely moving in her neo-Grace Kelly way, Baker is properly somber and idealistic as a timid virgin who gets gasped by an idiot. This helps that the cad is played by Robert Evans, the movie mogul who certainly took many innocent lambs to the slaughterhouse in his Beverly Hills room. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker is fascinating the first half of the movie, all cheerful self-confidence and knowing remarks. She uses her fashion style in the 1950s. Unfortunately, she's not where the movie sends her: to madness and obsession. But she exudes glamor and savior faire and her acting is at least adequate. One wonders why critics hated her, virtually taking her out of the movies a few years later. Perhaps an alien attitude on the part of a beautiful woman is too much to bear. It sank Ali McGraw's career a generation later, and when you think about it, Ali McGraw and Suzy Parker were basically the same actress. <br /> <br /> The only big flaw in the movie is a weak end. It pretty much collapses into a romantic fade in the end, rather than reaching a melodramatic ending, like the other famous novel by producer Jerry Wald, "Peyton Place," which made Lana Turner cry and grind her teeth during a rape. attempts. Here, Hope Lange wanders onto the New York sidewalk, is drunk, eternally stuck (but now, of course, sober) Stephen Boyd and they just walk together ... at sunset, we presume. Otherwise, this is pretty much the definition of guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... there's also Joan Crawford, breathing fire at all the girls and smoking cigarettes while she whistles for her married phone lover. And the titles are made in shock, with ribbon letters reminiscent of the late 1950s department store ads. Do not miss out!
