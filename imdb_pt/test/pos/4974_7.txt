The Violent Men is a good western. Perhaps the story is not original - a large farm owner dedicated to expelling small competitors from a valley he needs to raise his cattle - but the film has many ingredients that raise its level and make it worth seeing. <br /> The cast is a highlight. There is the trusted Glenn Ford (John Parrish) as a former army officer and now one of the small farmers, who tries to stay out of trouble until he is pushed hard. Edward Robinson (Lew Wilkinson) is as good as ever as the great crippled man, and Barbara Stanwyck (Martha) plays her treacherous wife in one of her usual feminine roles that she handles easily (others were in "Double Indemnity" and "Blowing Wild" ). Brian Keith (Cole) does just as well as Robinson's armed brother, an ambitious man who tries to take over his brother's ranch no matter what happens, villain Richard Jaeckel (Wade Mattlock) also ends as usual (no surprise Dianne Foster (Judith Wilkinson) plays Robinson's daughter who does not approve of how her father, mother and uncle deal with neighbors. Rudolph Mate brings a standard but acceptable direction, perhaps helped by beautiful Scenery and open and a good, appropriate soundtrack helps as well. <br /> <br /> The inevitable final confrontation between Ford and Keith is one of the best in Western cinema. <br /> <br /> Every man in his own duel style (note Ford's shooting with the his traight arm and targeting his target on the military path) settle their differences then once and for all. This is certainly one of Glenn Ford's greatest Western appearances, second only to the classic "3: 10 for Yuma", the and it was two years later.It's probably the cast that puts the movie at an "A" rate and, as for me, it's on the top 10 of the genre.
