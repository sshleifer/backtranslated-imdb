In a world so close to the future, a corrupt government constantly monitors everyone with computers and surveillance. A man has managed to avoid assimilation and operates outside the system, struggling to preserve his freedom. An engaging and imaginative story and some very interesting editing and camera work. There are some confusing and slow parts, but overall a great example of what a small team with intelligence and talent can do on a tight budget.
