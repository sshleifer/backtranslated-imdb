I work at a movie theater and every Thursday night we have an employee who screens a movie that comes out the next day ... Today was The Guardian. I saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much of it, and in fact I did not expect to see this movie. Well, it turns out this movie was so much more than I thought. It was a great story first of all. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner did an amazing job of acting in this film. Being a big fan of That 70's Show I've always found it hard to think of Kutcher as anyone but Kelso despite the great acting he did in The Butterfly Effect but after seeing this movie I think I can finally look at it as a serious It was also a great tribute to the unknown heroes of the US Coast Guard.
