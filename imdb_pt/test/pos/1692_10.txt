Krajobraz po bitwie, like many Wajda films, may not be understandable to the "rest of the world." History based on the few tales of Tadeusz Borowski, who during World War II was prisoner of the fields of Oswiecim, Dachau and Dautmergen. Borowski in his books describes the inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the point of view vorarbeiter Tadek - parole de autor who was also in the privileged position among the prisoners. Borowski was ruthless for humanity and ruthless for himself. He describes human history as the infinite chain of exploitation and humiliation. Ironically, after returning to Poland, he stopped writing artistic prose and became a communist propagandist, producing a chain of anti-imperialist and anti-American publications. After a few years, he committed suicide. In the film Wajda changes from point of view. Vorarbeiter Tadek - character created by Tadeusz Janczar - plays only supporting role. The story focuses on the poet, destroyed, burned by war and imprisonment and his one-day love affair with Nina, a Jewish girl who escaped Communist Poland, although she actually hates Jewish life and mentality. As a background we can observe the sad grotesque of the so-called "dipis" life (displaced persons), which after the liberation are settled by the Americans in the SS barracks. Marches, patriotic kitsch mixed with the hunt for the extra food and / or prostitution of German girls. <br /> <br />
