I really appreciate what Jung-won did before his death. All. I want to say that your choice for love is disinterested. If he chose Da-rim, that would be good for him. But Da-rim will need more time to recover from his death. Obviously, he does not want to let that happen. As he did in the movie, he chose to give up. So it was only a temporary agony for the Da-rim. <br /> <br /> As a comparison, My Life Without Me is very different. Their behavior shows great difference between the Eastern culture and the western culture. I can not say which is the best. Each one may have the right to choose. This is totally up to you. Life is the same for everyone. We can live only once. Any choice is acceptable if you think it is fit for you. <br /> <br /> In fact, the slow pace of the movie may not be the excuse to reject the film. Calm down. You will get more from the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best Korean movies I've ever seen. 9/10
