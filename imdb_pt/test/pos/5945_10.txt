It's a profoundly stupid mood ... but I loved it. Jean Dujardin is a great actor in this film. Bérénice Béjo is cute. He makes fun of all the secret agents like James Bond: refreshing !!! It's probably the most hilarious movie I've ever seen. I've seen it three times and still want to see it again. Buy the DVD as soon as you can. You will not regret. It's the kind of movie where you do not have to have a great scene because it's a parody. The only shortcoming is that OSS 117 is too short. It's a gem. It is not very often to see a French film succeed in the US, but I think this one has everything to succeed. Trust me!!!
