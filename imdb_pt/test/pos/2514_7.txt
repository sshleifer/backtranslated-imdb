A bland title disguises this solidly carpentered example of Hollywood's old-fashioned entertainment, this film proves a successful mix of several disparate elements: a period piece, a romantic drama, a crime film, and a political thriller. Curiously, although made by Fox, its protagonists? Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck? both were generally associated with other studios; his chemistry on screen here is palpable and eventually led to the wedding in a couple of years. Although a bit too young, Taylor is a dashing hero (a Marine personally appointed by President McKinley to uncover the culprits behind an organized cleaning of several banks); No surprises, as soon as he spotted them (led by the suave Brian Donlevy and the quarrelsome Victor McLaglen), does he fall in love with a singer (naturally Stanwyck) who played a lot with the gang? though, truth be told, the song is far from being the actress's forte! Likewise, in addition to having to prove his worth to be part of the group, he must compete with McLaglen for Stanwyck's attentions; by the way, the practical persona of Joker of the first reminded me a lot of Charley Chase in SONS OF THE DESERT (1933) which, incidentally, was also directed by William A. Seiter. Later, Taylor is in two minds about Stanwyck's involvement in the impending bait and tries to offer his resignation to the president while running away with the girl? but the jealous rival interrupts his plans. The robbery went wrong, we found Donlevy dead and the other two in jail; Taylor's hopes for McKinley's intervention? having in the meantime learned the identity of the indescribable and obviously prominent "inner man"? are apparently frustrated when the president ends up killing himself (a major turnaround in history, although the resulting last-minute suspense seems artificial)! To return to the confusion of movie styles, even if the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste, the romantic triangle slows things down and reduces the thriller aspect a little, does a beautiful production emerge, in fact? with the already mentioned actors skillfully backed by John Carradine, Douglas Fowley, Sig Rumann and, as two American presidents, Sidney Blackmer (the witty Theodore Roosevelt) and Frank Conroy (McKinley), who are inexplicably disappeared after only one scene!
