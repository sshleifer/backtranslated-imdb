We opened in a doctors' room of some sort. A girl is taken to a seat in front of the doctor. He asks her questions. Silence follows. He continues to ask questions, ignoring the obvious traumatized atmosphere of the girls. <br /> <br /> The story is about two girls being taken home after spending some time in a mental home after an 'incident' that happened before the hand. They are greeted upon arrival by their stepmother trying-too-much-to-be-good-but-so-totally-evil, to whom girls obviously resent. As time goes by at home, the evil stepmother finds new ways to torment girls. And, above all, there's a vengeful ghost that's far from helping the girls recover ... <br /> <br /> This movie is incredible. It has twist, curves and definitely leaves a lot to think about without making any sense. The relationship between the two girls is so comforting that it almost makes you cry on some points (I know I had a tearful time of two, specifically "the closet scene"). But what I love most about this movie is the total sense of dread over the credits. The soundtrack is flawless, the furniture in the house and the use of color are fantastic. A pure joy to the eyes. This is a must-stop for all Asian movie freaks. Or any type of movie fan! An easy 10/10.
