I'm not a big TV person ... but when I saw the first episode of Greek, I could not wait until next week! I do not miss the show for anything! <br /> <br /> THANK GOD for DVR! LOL I'm in love with Cappie ... he acts like a bad boy, but he's so sweet ... Everyone has their own character, so we have pretty much all kinds of people. You can still play a Hispanic and a chubby. <br /> <br /> I did not go to school in the USA, so I never liked the idea of ​​fraternity houses and things like that, so when my husband told me about the show I did not pay attention until he asked me to watch and since I did not have anything else to do, I agreed. I laughed so much the first night that I just had to keep watching. <br /> <br /> So, I'm with the other people who voted for this show to continue! I wait for a second, third and who knows how many more episodes! It's a really good show, a lot of fun and fun!
