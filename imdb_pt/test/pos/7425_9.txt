A real comedy. The dialogue is fast and very witty. Eleanor Parker at her physical peak. Flynn as only Flynn can be "the charming ladino" .. although now beyond his cousin .. Most of the scenes between the directors are short so the If you have not yet seen this movie, take a look. You will be amazed at the timing from Flynn's comedy. The scenes between him, Tucker, Parker and "Cudddles" Sakal are hilarious. Only based on the clothes worn by the more attractive Parker, this movie deserves a look. The novel of this 1940s movie will not be lost for those who tend to watch Hollywood's past golden movies. My bet is that Never Say Goodbye will not disappoint.
