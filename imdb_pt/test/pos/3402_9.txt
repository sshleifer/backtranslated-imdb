I watched the TV series in 1990 and I loved it (I was nine). I bought the first DVD about six months ago and got the second DVD a few days ago (thanks to my dear husband). Wow ... It was hard to sleep with all the thoughts in my head ... what was going to happen to Madeline and George etc. Questions of slaves and civil war have always fascinated me (a 25-year-old Finn). I advise reading Slaves in Edward Ball's family for those who want to peek into the past and try to understand what actually happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I want to see heaven and hell then many people have said here that it was not so good.
