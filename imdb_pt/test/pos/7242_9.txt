'Nemesis' was the last book to feature Miss Marple written by Agatha Christie (the official final case 'Sleeping Murder' was written in the 1940s) and I always had a weakness for it. I loved the characters and they are lovingly brought to life in this excellent adaptation of the BBC with Joan Hickson, wonderful as always, as Miss Marple. <br /> <br /> In general, he is very loyal to the book. Some characters are discarded, the first (new) murder is slightly different and some new characters are introduced. Personally, I felt that the additional character of Lionel Peel was unnecessary and rather annoying. Madge's tour guide was annoying in a different way, but often quite entertaining. It's largely because of Lionel that I do not recommend 10 out of 10! The other characters are beautifully made, especially Helen Cherry as a worthy Miss. Temple and all three weird sisters, but especially Margaret Tyzack, who does an imposing performance like Clothilde. It threatens to overtake the top, but it just avoids it. Female bodyguards are also good value and the episode contains one of my favorite Hickson lines ... "An Archdeacon ?!" <br /> <br /> This is another relatively early Marple BBC that looks wonderful and has a gloriously nostalgic feel to it. Highly recommended.
