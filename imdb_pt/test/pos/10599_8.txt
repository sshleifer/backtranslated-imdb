I watched this movie with the hope of a good laugh, but when I watched I did not stop laughing for weeks, they are so bad, and it made the movie a lot more fun to watch. (BTW Ryan Dunn did not eat the toy car, he shoved it in the ass) The random appearances of the skaters and parts Vitos were great. Give me some Vito grapes.! At Valo, your grapes are in the store. I would not recommend anyone under 13 to watch it, frankly they would not understand half the jokes or what they are talking about. I love VLB and after watching this movie, I could not stop buying it or the Viva La Bam series. What's the problem with this stupid comment thing? There have to be 10 lines what kind of Bull-sh1t is that? I should be able to write one as long or in this case as short as I want. I'll just keep typing until you tell me that I can send it. It's just a waste of time, I expected to just say what I wanted, it was not too much, but I was told I have to keep putting more and then correct my spelling, so if I did not spell something right, you understand what I still want to say. This is ridiculously long. <br /> <br /> ~ Those who live the Sword are struck by those who do not ~
