The film is partly a thriller and partly a public service announcement when viewing the events through the perspectives of politicians, terrorists and, of course, victims. In this clever drama, lessons are given about contamination and surviving chaos, while behind the scenes they look at how the crisis is generated, causing viewers to distrust guardians and become frightened by robbers. The film, originally screened at the BBC, raises doubts about the official preparation of the public. The presentations are adequate, discreet, but never excellent. The film is just a beginning, a provocative beginning that leads to a larger discussion, but works in my opinion, giving the right emotions and causing the audience to reason and ask questions.
