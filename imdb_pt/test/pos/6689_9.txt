Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation, perhaps the greatest. This in combination with another incredible actor named Jeff Bridges, can not be bad. And that's exactly what this movie is! "K-PAX" is one of the nicest surprises in recent years. To begin with, the film has a brilliantly written story. It's part of what makes the movie so good. The other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the film is acting. The Spacey-Bridges combination really works. <br /> <br /> This was the second time I saw the movie and I'm sure it will not be the last time. "K-PAX" has it all. There are moments that are extremely funny, parts that resemble a real suspense and others that resemble the drama of high class. I think this movie deserves a much higher rating and a lot more prizes. Great movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10
