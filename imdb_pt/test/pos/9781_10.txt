My family and I enjoyed this show and found a nice sketch of what people went through. <br /> <br /> My own father spent some time in Changi before going to the Thailand-Burma Railway in "F". Force. Much of what was said about the treatment received by prisoners of war, I will just say that my father was 6 feet 1 inch and 196 pounds when Singapore fell, at the end of the war he was 5 feet 11 inches tall and 91 lbs. <BR> <BR> No presentation could truly convey what prisoners of war have passed, but that comes closer than most. As the ex-prisoners say, "If you had no friends, you would not survive." This show can convey that message.
