First, I'm a big fan of Buddy Holly. I grew up knowing who he was, and I knew all about that fateful plane ride that extinguished three incredibly bright flames like that. But I had never really listened to his music. I had heard a lot about it, yes, but not until I sat down with the intention of getting some of it, I actually got to see the real Buddy Holly. And let me tell you that my world is different now because of it. <br /> <br /> Because of this adoration for such an incredible man, I bought The Buddy Holly Story without ever having seen it before. I'm torn with my opinions about this movie. Maybe it's because Buddy feels so alive with me that I could not bear to see Gary Busey in that role. I admit he did a great job, but his singing sounded so forced. It sounded as if I knew he did not sound a bit like Buddy himself, so I was using a lot of energy to try to make a similar sound. In some parts of the movie, he did it. But others .. alas. <br /> <br /> The film lasted several years, but I think that portraying that period could have been much better. I had a hard time distinguishing at what point in Buddy's life certain events were happening. I also had a serious problem with some historical inaccuracies. I think the worst of them was the picture of the crickets. I understand how their real names could not be used, and as for simplification there were only two of them in the movie .. and maybe that was a good thing. Because the background vocals of the movie were worthy of embarrassment, and I did not like the way they were portrayed as an obstacle to Buddy's career. Another thing that really did not make a difference to the film, but it annoyed me, it was the teeth of Gary Busey. They used me! Buddy Holly had much better teeth. I do not know why I noticed this, but I did. <br /> <br /> I'll finish this review of what I felt was the best part of the film: Buddy's last performance. Her final call to Maria, the performance of Big Bopper, bringing him and Richie Valens to the stage, followed by the end of the frame. It surprised even me, and I feel that this effectively shows the audience how, in a moment, Buddy Holly was so alive and energetic, and that her flame was blotted out in the blink of an eye. It was a beautiful way to portray this horrible tragedy, I think. <br /> <br /> Good movie, despite the obvious problems .. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Some obvious flaws, could use some work ... but not bad.
