Pat Conroy's autobiographical book "The Water Is Wide" proves to be a sort of "Up the Down Staircase" from the south, but despite the teacher's formula against odds, "Conrack" really moves the audience with every little innovation and creative flash . These students (uneducated black boys on an island in South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their wide-eyed collective innocence is unbelievably sweet. The only actress in the group (Tina Andrews, an incredible performer) plays the "tough guy" Conrack has to break, and once she falls under her spells, it all seems like a breeze. But the story is not ready for a happy ending, and I was not prepared for the silent simplicity of the ending. It's beautifully done. The script leaves the course from time to time, but director Martin Ritt is too smart to ever resort to the solid presence of Jon Voight. Scenes like the one in which he drives in his van venting his frustrations through a loudspeaker do not contribute much, but the whole movie is full of episodes that provoke excitement, and the real ending is the result. ** 1/2 of ****
