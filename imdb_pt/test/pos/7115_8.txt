This moody, creepy horror movie begins in a castle high on a cliff overlooking the sea, a great setting as a vampire bat walks in and approaches a sleeping doctor (Onslow Stevens). The bat becomes a man known as Baron Latos, in fact Count Dracula (John Carradine). He seeks the help of Dr. Edelmann to heal him of his vampirism. Eventually, the good doctor also wants to help his hunchback nurse assistant (Jane Adams), the werewolf (Lon Chaney) and the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange). But the trick of Dracula contaminates the blood of the doctor, and he becomes a vampire Jekyll / Hyde. This is a bit better than the previous year's "House of Frankenstein," being less episodic and more visually exciting. There is an astounding scene where Dracula tries to lure the second nurse (Martha O'Driscoll) into his world, where she is initially playing "Moonlight Sonata" on the piano, which soon gives way to terrifying music. Director Erle Kenton uses expressionist shadows and mysterious songs to frame many sequences, including a wonderful set-up sequence that the studio often used in its horror features. Two artists are worthy of note: Stevens, with his wonderful voice, is at first sympathetic, then convincingly menacing. Adams, his handsome face in alarming contrast to his twisted body, exhibits great pathos and sympathy. It all ends in a slam-bang climax, typical of the 1940s Universal horror, somewhat abrupt, with footage borrowed from "The Ghost of Frankenstein" (1942). I hope Universal releases it soon on DVD (it was left out of Double-Feature releases).
