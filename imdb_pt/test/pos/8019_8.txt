A very intelligent and thrilling thriller that does not depend on the action, but on the situation, which is rare these days. I would compare this movie to the Day of the Jackal, another film about the persecution of a dangerous international criminal. The overall performance is superlative - Aidan Quinn has a complicated double role as the cruel terrorist Carlos and as the naval man posing as the man. Donald Sutherland plays the amoral agent of the CIA who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays the Israeli officer who helps in the plan. This is a very tense and effective film, and it is remarkable considering the little action that exists in it. The first half of the movie is all set up, as the Navy man prepares to pass himself off as Carlos. The second half is a breathless actioner, the action coming out of the characters and their situations, making it even more exciting. A really tight movie that should not be overlooked.
