I've seen this movie about 4 times and every time I'm impressed with the work of Second Camera Assistant. It sounds trivial, but there is something very professional, knowledgeable and talented there. The film as a whole suffers from other problems, as other comments say. The significance for the issues being addressed is as relevant today as it was 40 years ago. The acting is a bit tense, but the Second Camera Assistant's work is stellar! This person needs to get back into business - maybe driving? What is this person waiting for? I'll be watching and waiting and cheering on the outside! Bob
