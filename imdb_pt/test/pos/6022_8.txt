If you want to see what could be classified as the 'stage' version of GYPSY, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> If you like (ed) to list for the MERMAN recording of GYPSY, then you really enjoy watching MIDLER as the mother of Gypsy, ROSE. It's my opinion that Midler has the volume, the vibrato and the gifts Merman already had. <br /> <br /> It's not very common these days to hear up-to-date versions of musicals, I get that tingling feeling that makes my hair tickling, but Bette Midler certainly shows her talents in this movie - see how you like apples ..... <br /> <br /> I know you might not like it, but for me, Midler is the definitive Gypsy.
