The last person to die before the New Year is cursed to run the Ghost Chariot for a whole year, catching the souls of the dead. <br /> <br /> I saw a scene from this old Swedish horror movie on Youtube. and decided to trace the entire film. It was worth the trouble to find it because it is an absolutely amazing movie for the time it was made. It has a wonderfully strange atmosphere. The old horror movie makers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, many of today's filmmakers do not seem to understand how important the setting and atmosphere are, and look for cheap jumps. The visual effects are excellent considering its production date. If you can find a copy of this, I recommend giving it a watch. 9/10
