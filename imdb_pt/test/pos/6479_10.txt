You do not have to be a Notre Dame football fan to take advantage of this because I'm not ... but, as a football fan in general, it was fun to watch. That almost makes me a devout Irish fighter. If you can not get involved with the excitement of this movie, whether you're a football fan or not, you'd better check your wrist because this is an emotional film with some very moving scenes. <br /> <br /> As a sports fan, I loved watching the classic filming of the first college games. They had some very wild plays at the time with many sides. They interspersed filming with Pat O'Brien shown as Coach Knute Rockne backstage and some of the players such as George Gipp (Ronald Reagan). <br /> <br /> Reagan is very good billing in this movie, but his part really is not that great. O'Brien is the only actor with a big role here. The rest - all playing cool characters - include Gale Page as Rockne's wife, "Bonnie"; Donald Crisp, as "Father John Callahan" of Notre Dame; Albert Bassermann as professor of chemistry "Father Nieuwland" and Reagan, as Gipp, perhaps the most talented and famous player of Notre Dame ever. <br /> <br /> What this film does very well is to balance personal history with football. No angle is exaggerated. The characters here all the people you can cheer as there are no villains. In my last look, it was interesting to discover Johnny Sheffield - Tarzan's son - playing Rockne at the age of seven and see George Reeves, TV's Superman, as one of the players. <br /> <br /> There have been very few football movies made in Hollywood for some reason, and a few good ones. This is one of them.
