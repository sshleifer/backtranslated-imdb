I find it incredibly difficult to write any kind of full-scale review for Giorgino simply because it's one of those complex, poetic, and philosophical viewer-dependent movies that use the brain if, while watching them, you're trying to have fun. your shell and get to your core at the same time, but there are several things that are certain and beyond any doubt for any man of art (which, I hope, I am). The first thing: it is a certain masterpiece, even of this type of art that remains for a long time; the second: it is one of those rare "dark" films in which darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much sadder than depressing, like the art of Pieter Brueghel or Caspar David Friedrich. As for the core of the film, someone called it Kafkian, although I do not agree with it because it is actually far beyond Kafka's misanthropic logic and much more like Edgar Poe's parables: dark and scary but playing the softest strings of our souls. Indeed, on the poetic side (which is far more important than the narrative), Giorgino is a tale of eternal peace and love that can only be achieved through the eternal infancy of the soul. Those who have such souls are generally branded crazy by our society, but from another point of view, they all have the virtue that all others lost when they became "grown up": the virtue of God's love. In fact, Giorgino is a very Christian film, "Be as children" (Matt. 18: 3). It is his true hidden slogan, although the film never deals with any type of morality and focuses only on Christian philosophy, dare to assume God true is beyond any human morality. However, I think Boutonnat is very hard portraying "grown up" people as a kind of demon trying to steal childhood from the rare surviving souls, but it's his point of view and he has the right to think so. While watching Giorgino do not try to search for some hidden symbols (although there are some), look better for thoughts expressed through characters and their behavior, and learn from them. Also I can not mention that the film looks amazingly through excellent photography, especially through the rational use of color filters, incredibly appropriate editing, wonderful performance of the whole cast and of course due to the atmospheric beauty of the winter mountains that reminded me of the Brueghel "Hunters in the Snow". Also, interestingly, the scene with Death in the form of an old woman with sunken black eyes riding a wagon instantly reminded me of Pesta (Prague) from the Norwegian painter Theodor Kittelsen's series of drawings, describing how a black plague is sweeping the population of a small town in the mountain valley. Is it a coincidence?
