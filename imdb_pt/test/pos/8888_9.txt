Black comedy is not always easy to sell. From time to time you have a black comedy that is extremely successful, like Fargo, for example. But usually they do not usually find large audiences. People seem to decide for comedy or serious chaos. There does not seem to be a great market for a good mix of both. Throw Momma From the Train was a pretty decent success, but few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age. Danny DeVito almost hit this one all the way out of the park in 1987. <br /> <br /> DeVito plays a boy from a strange mom named Owen wanting to get rid of his outrageous and nasty mother with whom he still lives. The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who died shortly after being released, and she is a caricature. She is tall, ugly, rude and arrogant. Although Owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself, he desperately wants his mother down. He fantasizes about it in some really weird scenes, but he clearly does not have the guts to actually do it alone. That's where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid intellectual novelist who claims that his ex-wife stole his novel and took millions out of it. He is currently trying to write a new one, but he can not even come up with a decent first sentence. "The night was ...." Owen hears Larry wish his ex-wife was dead during an explosion in the school cafeteria. And borrowing the idea of ​​Strangers on a Train, Owen decides to travel to Hawaii and murder Larry's ex-wife. Once it seems he did this, he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny and even pungent. Certainly it is never monotonous and often full of surprises. <br /> <br /> The performance is exceptional, even if Ramsey has been a little overdone. Crystal is as good as he can be, and DeVito has always been undervalued as an artist. The film draws on a bit of physical comedy that usually works, often painfully so. The film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the off-beat tone is truly refreshing. I have often been critical of the late 1980s as being a period of artistic malaise and making lazy films. Play Momma Train takes chances. Both in how their characters are drawn and in their overall plot. How many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered? The film is not very long and is full of laughter. Writers are apt to find this more interesting than the general public, but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone. 9 out of 10 stars. The Dog.
