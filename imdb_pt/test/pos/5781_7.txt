I was fortunate to have seen several films in my university's art museum. On occasion, well, more like half the time, I can not watch the movies there. I systematically tried to see each of the movies I lost. So Far Pest and Pleasure in the Salton Sea and Who Killed the Electric Car? It's the other movies I had to watch like that. The film tackles an intriguing theme and is well theorized (emphasis on later), but not as successful as Plagues and Pleasures, but far superior to Electric Car. <br /> <br /> The concern of the film's thesis is the future of the American concept of suburban life. It questions the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise. So the film discusses the origin of the suburb and its evolution until the early 2000s. One theme that the film discusses at length is the alienation that the suburban creates among its inhabitants. While many people can live together, they do not "know each other" when we define the word. This, to me, represents the strength of the film: its appeal to real human emotion. We are able to understand the filmmakers' argument much more easily because they do not have to convince us of the legitimacy of their argument. This is also one of the reasons why Salton Sea is such a wonderful documentary. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Suburbia loses its message with a compelling explanation in support of its central argument. As the interviewees speak, their arguments become progressively more similar to those made by militant environmentalists. We are told that oil production will reach its peak this decade, but scientific evidence (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc.) is not supported in support of this assertion. We are given little information on how this date was calculated. Luckily, that was the only significant flaw I could detect in the film's argument, but it's still evident. Another less important discrepancy I noticed was the liberal (political) bias that could polarize some viewers. However, this bias is revealed by clips from various events and not by the filmmakers themselves. The clips, especially those of the 1950s, seemed a bit unnecessary to me. The film was not better with his presence and would have been more concise in his absence. <br /> <br /> As I thought more about this film before writing this review, I thought why I found your argument more convincing than other documentaries I had seen recently. Finally, I realized that the filmmakers really offered analysis for the suburban problem. They propose a decentralized village system where pockets of people would live together. They postulate that this practice would reduce the need for fossil fuels and reduce the waste of space. They define the wasted space as the long stretches of parking lots between commercial areas, for example. What is incredible about this assumption is that it is really conceivable. Most documentaries say vaguely that some problem should end, but offers no method for this. Thinking more about the film, I decided that this analysis was what saved the film for me and why I do a favorable review. <br /> <br /> Although not perfectly convincing nor fluid in the presentation, The End of Suburbia is a worthwhile investment. It not only addresses the contemporary problem of expansion, but also provides a realistic view on how to change it. The public can also appreciate the high production value with several clips from the 1950s mended with modern arguments. People living in Atlanta, Georgia or the Triad region of North Carolina will particularly appreciate this documentary, as the expansion is the most established there.
