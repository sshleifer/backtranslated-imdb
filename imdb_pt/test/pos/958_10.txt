Big Fat Liar is the best movie of all time! It's funny and cool. Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz) proves that he was not lying and went to Los Angeles to get his article back from Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Along with friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes), spoils his life since Marty will not call Jasons's father and tell him he wrote the newspaper! However, everything ends well and is a good movie to watch!
