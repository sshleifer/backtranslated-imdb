There is not much you can say about this movie ... the plot is quite simple: two policemen (who are also lovers) are using a brothel as a picket to catch a criminal, with the help of the "lady of the house", played by pornstar hardcore Chloe. As anyone can guess, there are some twists and some alliances blurred, but the writing was just awful even for a softcore movie. <br /> <br /> I read a few previous posts about Nicole Hilbig's accent (she plays the female police officer). Yes, it's hard to understand what she's saying sometimes, but I think I put it on. I did some sniffing ... I think she's from Germany, hence her strange accent. She leaves an impression even without speaking, however ... she has a great looking body. <br /> <br /> There were some "behind the scenes" sex scenes in this movie that were very graphical for a softcore movie. ... great job there. The three-way scene toward the end was not bad either. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * I ​​kind of knew the female cop would become a part-time girl. at the end. She was very fond of her three-way road. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will not tell the story TOO, since this is a low budget budget. , direct movie from softcore to video. However, it seems like I've seen too many movies in this genre with a similar kind of plot. <br /> <br /> Women: B (Chloe and Hilbig were pretty much like eye drops) Sex: B + (scenes were kind of short, but good) Story: C (a recycled plot, but whatever It works, huh?) Overall: B-
