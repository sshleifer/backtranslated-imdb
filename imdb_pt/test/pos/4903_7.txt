Although it is a "woman's story", I find this still quite interesting. It's unusual in that there are three real life sisters playing sisters in the movie! I'm referring to Priscilla, Rosemary, and Lola Lane. <br /> <br /> Why the national critics loved this movie was the presence of the rebellious bad boy John Garfield. In their liberal-dominated minds, All-American characters are sickly but sour, poor-mannered types like Garfield played here are people with whom they can identify. Despite this, this movie still has a general feeling of kindness, and that's why I liked it. Some of the characters may have done stupid things, but they have good hearts. Whose heart was bigger than "Ann" (Priscilla Lane) here? I agree with the critic of user reviews here that says that this is Priscilla's film as much as Garfield's beloved (not by me). <br /> <br /> With a director of the caliber of Michael Curtiz, the film is better than it could be under someone else. Curtiz made sure that no scene, with or without soap, took too long. <br /> <br /> In addition to Sisters Lane and Garfield, we have Claude Rains (who adds the necessary humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (the girls' main love interest), Gale Page, Dick Foran, Frank McHugh and Mae Robson . <br /> <br /> Apparently, this movie must have been a success, because there were several spin-offs of it. of them approaching it in content and box office success.
