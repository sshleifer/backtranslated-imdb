This movie is a jewel! It's the story of Juliette, a perfectly clean housekeeper who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company, and Romuald, the president of the same. He does not take notice of her, he takes no notice of anyone until several conspiracies to wrench his company away from him, all beaten at the same time. He's lost, no one to turn to, and no one to trust when he discovers Juliette. As the maid, no one pays attention to her, so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to understand and use to help her helpless and unhappy boss. <br /> <br /> I've been watching for years for the DVD of this and to see an earlier review on the September 2007 release increased my hopes. Unfortunately, I can not find a DVD, does anyone know if it exists / was it?
