In this early work of Fulci, the director shows his more mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling narratives and more than a reasonable explanation for the genre. Personally I think he was unfairly defamed throughout his career as a blood esthete. It is a quite capable procedure and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows its distrust by the small-minded, small-minded mentality and the inefficiency of the police as well as the distorted ideals of the catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this movie fell on his knees when it was first released and could possibly have given the director another direction so soon. The comparative lack of blood in the film shows a more urgent and psychological imperative for this film in its prevailing "mystery", but the blood and puppets it uses is put to good use here most notably in the scene where a falsely accused murderer is foolishly lynched by a crowd of men in a graveyard and left to die in a vile and old-fashioned vigilantism demonstration, skillfully choreographed for the modern melodies of a diegetic radio. <br /> <br /> Another example was the final scene (which was in fact impressive) in which a surprisingly handsome priest falls off a cliff and the used marionette is markedly displayed in a medium close-up that accentuates his demonic appearance and obvious ugliness. Curiously, considering his later works, Fulci also invokes the idea of ​​modernity taken advantage of by the village maintaining its anachronistic superstitions and ignorance when the idea of ​​black magic is just that, a singular idea of ​​supernatural evil that never ends up manifesting itself from the voodoo dolls , making his witch nothing more than a disturbed woman. Another thing I liked was that he adds to these layers of character, turning a bourgeois city girl into an ambiguous figure - is he the corruptor the priest fears for his pupils and perhaps more telling, for himself? This giallo lends itself to become one of Fulci's most personal and substantive films, to the extent that we actually get a good flow of ideas from him.
