I have heard some comments, particularly from prisoners of war, that CHANGI is not historically accurate, and that is disappointing. Maybe it's for those who actually had to go through these things, and a lot worse. But for the rest of us, who really have no idea how the prisoners were treated by the Japanese during World War II, CHANGI is a remarkable introduction. But CHANGI is not a war documentary - if it had been, then the aspect of historical accuracy would have been paramount. It's a miniseries drama, with fictional characters and fictional situations (though based on real facts I've heard and read about) - and at the center of the story is the ideal of companionship. This group of young Australian soldiers, taken prisoner by the Japanese and kept in terrible condition for years, became a companion due to adversity and the strength of their friendships continued throughout life after the war. It is also a cultural study of the differences between the Japanese of the time and the Western world, with their music, games and entertainment: in part 5, when it becomes clear that Japan will lose the war after Germany surrendered in Europe, Colonel of the Japanese prison camp insists that his country must study the culture of its prisoners - to defeat a people, it is necessary to defeat its culture - and for that, it is necessary to understand it. All in all, Australia continues its rich tradition of producing exceptional television mini-series, and is an unrivaled world leader in this regard: avenging for the AFI Award with CHANGI is MY BROTHER JACK, the adaptation of George Johnston's novel and also a winner. Miniseries in recent years includes DAY OF THE ROSES, KINGS IN GRASS CASTLES (the adaptation of Mary Durack's historical account of her pioneering ancestors), KANGAROO PALACE (about a group of friends from a rural town in Australia who travel to London and change and distance themselves), and the (somewhat disappointing) adaptation of Bryce Courtenay's powerful novel, THE POTATO FACTORY. Less recently: the saga of Nancy Cato's life in Murray - ALL THE RIVERS RUN; Cusack & James's brilliant novel about post-war life in Sydney - COME IN SPINNER; Colleen McCullough's remarkable pioneering saga - THE THORN BIRDS; The kings of the river; The Romance of Ruth Park, The Harp in the South; BODYLINE; EUREKA STOCKADE; ANZACS; etc ..., etc ... (Of course, there have been some not so good productions - for example, MOBY DICK, DO OR DIE, ON THE BEACH, THORN BIRDS: THE YEARS IN FAIL, etc ...) Usually, however , if an Australian miniseries comes your way, be sure to check it out - and that goes double for CHANGI, a superbly-driven masterpiece. Rating: 9/10.
