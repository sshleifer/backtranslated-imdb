I have not been able to completely block this movie from memory, even though it's been two years since I've seen it. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong - I have long forgotten the main story - the relationship between Kidman and Law, which did not make any impression on me, but it was the torture scenes in the movie that really impressed me. I cried for about two hours in a row. <br /> <br /> It had never occurred to me how people in times of war could take advantage of something as pure as the love of a mother. We see several examples of this here - both in the scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers on the fence to keep the child hidden at home. I was shocked by these scenes and will probably never watch the movie again, because the scenes are now perfectly clear in my mind. However, I am happy to have watched the film simply because it made me more aware of the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that humanity can inflict on its own. <br /> <br /> The blonde albino character has been the top of my baddest villain list ever since I saw the movie. His horrible disdain and lack of any human feeling for the people he tormented really messed me up. At one point I wanted to get up in the movies and kill it myself (see the movie pushing me beyond reason, it only occurred to me after I'd only be tapping on a big screen - it shows the power of the movie and at least intensity) . <br /> <br /> I recommend the film for its pure experience not because of the intertwined love story but because of the way it describes war without needing a battlefield.
