My curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film, which was now released on DVD for the first time in the UK, was more than rewarded. Peter Watkins excelled in his audacity and technical skills. This pseudo-documentary is certainly ahead of its time and still frighteningly relevant and up-to-date. <br /> <br /> The film is inspired by the turn of the late 1960s in the United States, when the government increased its legitimized use. of violence and oppression, while the anti-war movement reacts more and more violently and radically. To deal with this, overpopulation of prisons and special training for police units, the government has introduced so-called penalty parks. Convicted "criminals," mostly activists, receive the "choice" of being jailed for years and years, or spend three days in one of these parks where they gain their freedom, death or even a higher prison sentence. . The situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations. This reminded me of a kind of realistic version of Battle Royale (2000). <br /> <br /> The structure of the film is extremely effective and resembles parallels with the Cannibal Holocaust, which is made nearly 10 years later. Both movies are constructed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged to think and feel that they are actually watching a real documentary and therefore shocked, even knowing that: this is a movie. Both confront us with the inherently violent nature of humanity, but where the Cannibal Holocaust is devoid of any deeper meaning (above all, it is a film of exploitation in every sense of the word) and raises no critical question about the state of world. Punishment Park does just that. <br /> <br /> I was deeply impressed with Punishment Park and I find it hard to believe how such a powerful and important film could have been rejected and sidelined for so long. Maybe that tells you enough about the truth of its content, about how the power structures in this world work. I disagree with the critique that Watkins polarises and stereotypes because the film shows activists and guardians of the legitimized power structures that are actually as polarized as they are here. If they were not, there would be no conflict and therefore no change in our societies. In fact, clashes between these two groups generally take on stereotyped forms, regardless of whether you put them between activists and institutions in Latin America, Russia or New York City. If these groups were not polarized to these extremes, activists would be part of the silent majorities that tacitly claim, but at the same time reside in the injustices of the world. <br /> <br /> As Peter Watkins tells us in the introduction on DVD, the actors in Punishment Park are mostly amateurs. Most of the children were real Los Angeles activists, most of the police were part of the national forces, and even some of the members of the courts were part of the social and political establishment of the time. Not introducing the two groups before the shooting of the scenes that take place in the improvised court room increases the spontaneous and improvised sensation. The parallels are plotted with issues of the time, such as repression of members of the Black Panther (one of the black prisoners is similar to the charismatic leader BPBeader Bobby Seale) and the trial of the seven of Chicago. <br /> <br /> I admire Watkins' obvious and sincere engagement with injustice and his concern for human rights and the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments (now in the name of the War on Terror) to silence those who do not agree and refuse to brainwash. Punishment Park remains an extremely important film that must be exhibited in schools and seen by everyone who shares these concerns. Perhaps their marginalization can finally be compensated.
