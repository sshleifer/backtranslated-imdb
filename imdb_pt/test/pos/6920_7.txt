This movie is about entertainment. Imagine your friends you love to spend time with, those you know from the inside becoming a little foolish and maybe having one or two characters. That's what this movie is about. An inventive and brilliantly executed script. It's not about pleasing the masses with this, it's about having fun with a group of brilliantly talented people. Which is what I'm sure everyone thought when they signed up for it. <br /> <br /> The above review seems completely unfair and I think the person who wrote this was in the wrong mood when they watched the movie. In a joyful moment, there is great dignity in it if you want to look. <br /> <br /> A job well done, I thought it was a great movie. I would observe this before the American norm any day. <br /> <br /> In short, it's not the best movie you'll ever see, but it has a lot of moments. I did not laugh that long at an age.
