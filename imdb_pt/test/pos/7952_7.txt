Korean "romance" about the owner of a camera store that is diagnosed with a fatal illness. As he engages in his daily routine and prepares for the end, he acquaints himself with a young girl who is a client. Friendship and romance grow, though they do not express any kind of affection for each other. A good movie is unlike anything you'll probably see redone in America simply because the studios would insist that the "couple" act on their feelings. He will not say anything because he does not have as much time to live, he will not because it is not the thing that is done and he is not responding as she thinks he should. Of course it's a lot more complex than I'm doing to be and in all honesty is the kind of thing you should find out for yourself. Is it a great movie? No, but it's a good one that will excite you emotionally. The final lines of the movie still haunts me: "I always knew that love would fade like a photograph - but you will remain in my heart as you are at my last moment.Thanks and goodbye." It may seem strange out of context, but in the context of the film is very moving.
