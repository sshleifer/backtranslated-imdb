In New York, a group of freshmen participate in High School for the Performing Arts after having been successful in their audition. For four years, her dreams, disappointments, success, love and personal dramas are revealed by the insecure Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), the homosexual Montgomery (Payl McCrane), the aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray), the hopeful Coco (Irene Cara) ), the ambitious Ralph Garci (Barry Miller) and his friends until graduation day. <br /> <br /> Twenty-eight years ago, "Fame" was a big hit, with teenagers looking for a place in show business, and I loved this movie and the soundtrack on CD. I just watched "Fame" on DVD, and currently I would say it's a good movie with great potential only, but with many defective subplots. The story follows many characters and leaves many situations unanswered. I do not know if Alan Parker had editing issues to reduce the running time of this film, but what happened, for example, to the dancer who goes to an abortion clinic? What happened to Leroy and his teacher, he failed because of his grammar problem? What happened to Coco after she undressed her blouse in this thug's apartment? The musician who plays the synthesizer and his proud father are left behind in the subplot. Anyway, "Fame" is still a delightful entertainment and cult film for me. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fame" ("Fame")
