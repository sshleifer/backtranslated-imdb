(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> The people who put the Lonely Heart ad in the newspaper are often idealistic. They try to put in a nutshell all they are and expect. The exchange of letters is full of hope ... Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), owner of a cigarette company in the Ile de la Reunion (eastern Madagascar) is so affected by the letters of Julie Roussell that he proposes to her. But not the gorgeous brunette expected comes from the "Mississippi" council, but - Catherine Deneuve. And we know from the beginning that she is an impostor of marriage and that a crime happened. She shows no interest in "Julie's" wardrobe (she does not even open the trunk) and neglects her canary until he dies. But the most basic tricks of seduction (an open zipper) are enough to turn Louis into a supple puppy. First: a joint bank account. And then, when Julie's sister draws attention to herself, the flight. With 27,850 million Louis '28 million - she would need your subscription for the entire sum. <br /> <br /> Louis and Julie's sister hires a private detective (Michel Bouquet). Louis tries to track down Marion (the real name of Deneuve) in Antibes, where she works as a taxi driver - her gangster lover has left her without money, or rather no stopover. Louis finds himself unable to kill her. She tells her story: orphan. Precocious. Lesbian experiences. Many sugardaddies. Prison - and then she carries it through her nose again. The detective ends up being cunning as a fox and tenacious as a bloodhound; Louis and Marion bury their bodies in the basement. They flee to Paris, where Louis learns that Marion has an expensive taste. She loves money as a deity. It sells your business for a fraction of its value. But when the detective's corpse is discovered (a flood) they have to flee again - without the money. Life in a mountain hut, along with a weeping loser - Marion can think of a happier life without this appendix ... A high point in the careers of all involved. Belmondo's self-deception makes him almost captivating. Deneuve looks beautiful in her wardrobe by Yves St. Laurent, and her performance is delectable: first pretends to the frail wife - too timid to ask for money from her husband, that's why the joint bank account is needed - but once exposed she sounds like Katharine Hepburn in the Bringing Up Baby prison scene. The scenery is spectacular - the tropics, the riviera, Paris. Truffaut directs with self-evident apogee: the sixties were the only decade in which the European films were head and shoulders above the American productions. After this film, Truffaut was able to look at his idol, Alfred Hichcock, in full in the face.
