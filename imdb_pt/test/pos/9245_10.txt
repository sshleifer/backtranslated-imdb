Good dock Stuie! <br /> <br /> Although it did not work as you wanted with the original movie, you have a fantastic job and a great visualization. <br /> <br /> It's obvious how much you put <br /> <br /> That goes for everyone else too. It's great to see the warts and the whole bill of the process without being "too good." <br /> <br /> I loved it! Worth seeing. <br /> <br /> What a shame, the writer of the 'original' movie could not appreciate what you achieved. <br /> <br /> Love the attitude too. Great piece. Looking forward to seeing the next job. <br /> <br /> Keep going hand! Paully
