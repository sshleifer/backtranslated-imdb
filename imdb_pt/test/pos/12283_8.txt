This is a nice design, which is not a movie as the title suggests. Good performance by Nadia Dajani, who reenacts the role of Grace. I follow the re-enactment of what happens with Mike and Grace in New York. She leaves, but he wants to get in touch with her. This project is his way of getting in touch with her. <br /> <br /> I saw in the IFC. I heard it will also be released on DVD. I like this trend of more independent projects. This is an example of a good project. <br /> <br /> I hope he finds her. <br /> <br /> Take a look and have fun. <br /> <br /> KirbyEF
