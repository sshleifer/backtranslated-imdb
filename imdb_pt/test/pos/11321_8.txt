Daniel Percival's "Dirty War," a BBC production made for television, was recently shown by cable. The film has a documentary style in the way it goes after the people who caused the near holocaust in one of the great metropolis of the world, London. In fact, this 2004 film is almost a warning about the events of the following year when terrorists put explosives on public transport that killed innocent people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. /> <br /> The film impresses by the pace that the director and the production team gave the project. There are no annoying moments in the film as we watch the preparation of the terrorists and the people who are following their dirty work. Although the inevitable happens, it is incredible to think what the consequences would be if a real 'dirty bomb' were planted in such a densely populated area. <br /> <br /> The latest images from the movie have a scary effect. The mafia scenes and the way the whole area is contaminated make the shivers of fear, thinking how it could happen anywhere.
