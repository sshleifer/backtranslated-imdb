Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, as so many other vehicles of Charles Bronson, as just another patchwork of senseless violence. And while there is a reasonable amount of chaos, DEATH WISH 3 is not such a dreadful endeavor, especially for fans of the series and its star. <br /> <br /> This time, Charlie's aging Paul Kersey is let loose by a desperate police chief to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one man army in an urban war of good versus evil. Bronson, at least the "older" version, is really at its best. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that DEATH WISH 3 is a classic. In fact, for the discriminating eye, there are a multitude of imperfections. The characters are usually made of cardboard. The violence is at the top. A man over 60 excels and overcomes dozens of young punks. But in the tradition of the original DEATH WISH and later films like FALLING DOWN with Michael Douglas, he has a definite charm to please everyone. Who does not want to see gangbangers get due? There are also some great brutal moments and one-liners so common in the 1980s movies. When a tenant in his apartment building sees Kersey setting a trap, for example, the watchman calmly says he is "tuning the herd." A single Bronson line can actually do the job. <br /> <br /> So, you see, the key to enjoying DEATH WISH 3 is to accept it for what it is. It's not Spielberg and it's not art. Then throw the popcorn in the microwave and have fun with it.
