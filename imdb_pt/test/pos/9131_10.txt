you loved the Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Vertigo, Oldboy .... And I guarantee you'll love this one more. is a brilliant thriller. The story is so simple but so exciting. keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. slow, simple scenes, add more perfection to the movie. is so genuine. the performance is first class the direction of the sequences ... they are very perfect .. if I could put it in the top 10 thrillers ever made. Suspense more fun than I've seen in a while ... ***** / ***** my vote help me move this movie to the top 250 <br /> <br /> you'll love ...
