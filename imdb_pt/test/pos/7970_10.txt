This movie is very similar to Death Warrant with Jean-Claude Van Damme and also has some similarities with Island of Fire with Jackie Chan and I also heard that there are some other very similar action movies but this movie has a much better action than Death Warrant or even Island of Fire (that's right, the Jackie Chan movie). Rarely do American action movies have such good action sequences, although there have been many negative reviews about this movie, it easily hits most of the action movies of the time that have been most successful. There were many martial arts scenes, David Bradley was fast like Bruce Lee in that movie and what's more, the fight scenes were much longer than in most American martial arts films. The shooting scenes were similar to John Woo's films, perhaps not so good but still very exciting. There were also many impressive explosions and a great chase scene. I've seen some other David Bradley movies, but this one is the best in terms of action. OK, this movie has some extravagant moments, but which movie does not? The acting was decent, Charles Napier was amazing and his character was very tough. Adam Clark, who played Squid and Yuji Okumoto, who played the main villain, was also very good. Other actors also acted very well, although the acting is not important in this type of film. If you are a fan of action movies (I mean the fan of real action movies, who really can appreciate the good deed), than you should see this movie.
