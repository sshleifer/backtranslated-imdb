If you liked movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you'll love the Two Hands. It has the same kind of black humor beat and will keep you entertained throughout the movie. Like Pulp Fiction, it has the crazy scenarios in which the characters enter and how they deal with them. Along with Gallipoli and Picnic at Hanging Rock, this has to be one of the best Australian movies I've ever seen. He is also starring a young Heath Ledger before he became really famous in the United States. <br /> <br /> This is a horribly underrated movie that I believe to be as good as Pulp Fiction and those great. You have to see!
