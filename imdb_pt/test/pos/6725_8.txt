Flowers! If it's something you're going to get out of this movie, it'll be the flowers. They are so prominent and are used as plot devices, you will become an expert at identifying with daisies and black tulips when the movie ends. <br /> <br /> In Amsterdam, Daisy tells the frustrating story of the love triangle. between 1 girl and the 2 men in your life. One a professional killer who makes a living, the other an Interpol agent. With a pan-Asian cast (Korean, Hong Kong) and crew (the director Andrew Lau of Hong Kong, a Korean writer and a Thai post-production team), I could imagine the coordination headaches. Park Yi (Jung Woo-sung) is a hit-man who found a soft spot for the painter Hye-young (played by the handsome Jeon Ji-hyun). It is love at first sight in the fields of daisies, where his clumsiness caught his eye. However, being shy and always aware of the dangers of his professional career, he can only admire her from afar, do small (or perhaps large) things for her in an anonymous way, but the one carrying the cake is sending her daisies in glass every day, without fail, at 4:15 p.m. He becomes his guardian angel from afar, protecting her and keeping her safe from danger. <br /> <br /> Hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger. She is constantly waiting for him to appear, but I really wonder how hard this could be given to delivering the almost punctual daisy. However, she is terribly moved and touched by this one act. However, as the stars wanted, Interpol's detective Jeong Woo (Lee Sung-jae) runs against Hye-young in a town square during one of his secret missions, and he is also captivated by her. Similarly, because of his profession, he has doubts about whether to take the first step. <br /> <br /> That's where the public would find it frustrating. The girl would obviously fall in love with the wrong guy (so again, he's the "good" guy), Park Yi getting mad at Jeong Woo's pursuit, but still refuses to go out and identify himself, and Jeong Woo being the opportunist the uninvited anonymous identity unintentionally. It's almost as if you wanted to give everyone a slap to wake them up. <br /> <br /> That aside, it's precisely this tension that keeps you intrigued. And it's perversely fun to see the two male leaders finding it difficult to fall in love without compromising their careers, or the loved one. But do not worry about action fans, there are enough cat and mouse revelations and undeclared camaraderie in the vein of Infernal Affairs, as well as extensive shootings, though I think the ending could have been scripted. <br /> <br /> Which rocks is the smart edition. Telling the story in a non-linear timeline (do not worry, it's not too bad, you'll still be able to follow the narrative) from the views of all the leads, keeping you in suspense, and culminating in a screen divided three-way showing all their emotions in a single convergent event, which I thought was extremely well done. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie in terms of landscapes of verdant meadows and bustling city squares with plenty of classical music to calm the soul. As with romance movies, all the protagonists are eye candy - the girls will have a picnic with the two handsome male leaders, while the boys have to settle for an ugly face (argh! OK lah, in certain angles) Ji-hyun. <br /> <br /> If you're in a romance movie with an equal balance in the action / tension department, then Daisy would be your choice. If you prefer a more conventional weepy, then the other Korean movie making its debut here at the same time, You are My Sunshine, would be your alternative. And yes, I totally dig the final scene, which I thought only Koreans did better? Kind of reminded me of JSA.
