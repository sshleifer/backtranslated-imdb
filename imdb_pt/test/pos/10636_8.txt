Isabelle Huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or of any other generation. "La Pianiste" really confirms this. As if that were not enough, Annie Girardot plays her mother and Annie Girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. So, as you can imagine, these cast pieces are worth the horror we've been through. Isabelle and Annie play characters we've never seen before on screen. A mother and a daughter, yes, but with such a virulent audacity that sometimes I could not even blink or breathe. Personally, I do not believe the director's intentions, I do not believe they (the intentions that are) go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream in frustration, but I was fascinated by the written history in the face of the sensational Huppert and the ferocity of Girardot's strength. I recommend movie lovers everywhere and to collectors of great performances like me, you can not miss "La Pianiste"
