The success of SCREAM has given rise to a new wave of horror films. I'm happy about it, like a big horror fan, and I enjoyed most of these new horror movies. The BOC is a great horror pack. Colorful, fast and original. I see this movie more as the opening of a new trilogy (much like episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) as it comes with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the relationship between boys and murderers, here is a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast to the crazy killers the size of a doll. Very inventive!
