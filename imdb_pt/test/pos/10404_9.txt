Being a big fan of horror, especially Asian terror, I have seen many movies, but this one is incredible. Because? It has a plot (which unfortunately is quite rare in horror movies). The actors did a good job. It looks like a real documentary (even if it is not). Do not be boring for a moment. The director skillfully combines the plot with the acts of a certain Japanese magical cult (perhaps this cult has never existed, but still, it is believable). This reminded me of the great movie "Forbidden Siren". <br /> <br /> For me, the only annoying thing about the movie was the character Hori, the psychic, but this is subjective. <br /> I recommend this movie to all fans of quality horror. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
