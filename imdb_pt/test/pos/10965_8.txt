Cassavetes' successful independent film introduced a style very different from what Hollywood shows to the public. This film also introduced some very taboo subjects, especially the actual racism that probably prevailed across the country, but was not exhibited by the majority white-controlled filmmakers of the time. The only black actors who had much respect at this time were those who acted and exhibited personality as whites (also known as Sidney Poitier). In addition, the idea of ​​ending a movie without actually completing the relationships that have begun leaves many spectators perplexed, but actually makes viewers realize that life is like this (continues ...). I prefer this kind of ending because it makes you think more about the characters and what may happen next and the conclusions are not just laid out for you. The film follows people's lives (especially some people who have a brief relationship and are the same color of skin) and then observe what happens when the white man realizes what he did. This is done very well and makes the film very special. The acting is supposed to be done on a whim, which makes the film even more surprising. I think you can say that I liked this movie if you can not tell. If you can find it, check out this classic independent movie.
