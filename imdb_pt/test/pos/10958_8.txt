Seven months after a revelation of Faces, I finally found a cost-effective DVD copy of Cassavetes' first feature. Filmed with little money in Manhattan and his ad hoc acting workshop, Shadows was the culmination of months of improvised rehearsals in which actors (mostly amateurs) created bonds, invented their characters, and perfected their techniques to give their filmed performances just the right tenor of spontaneous familiarity. This intimate approach led to an incredibly bold work on Faces, that is, Seymour Cassel thrusting her hands into Lynn Carlin's throat in an attempt to revive her from an overdose - just as the absolute conviction of the actors produces incredibly honest moments like Lelia and Tony's post-coy assessment of their relationship and Ben's disgust at the touch of a black woman as a manifestation of their racial confusion and self-deprecation. A home-made production in the best sense, dubbing and sound recording out of sync, and granular cinematography and camera configurations up close, build an immersive atmosphere that fits perfectly into Cassavetes' nuanced view of human relationships as perpetual works in progress, marked by desperate emotional fluctuations and melancholic attempts at communication and understanding. Charles Mingus' largely improvised jazz score is an ideal complement to the movie's vision of living for the moment, a mantra for which Cassavetes worked and apparently lived.
