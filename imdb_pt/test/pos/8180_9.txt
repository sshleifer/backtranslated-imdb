Another piece from the period for Chen Kiage ... (I can not remember him making a modern movie!) ... Good characterization with a simple story of trust and unfulfilled promises. None of the fight scenes of HK, or the type of Hollywood heroes, but it's good because of that. The characters are strong, I really felt for them. <br /> <br /> Understanding Mandarin definitely gives English subtitles the edge. The movie is 3 hours, but it does not look like it.
