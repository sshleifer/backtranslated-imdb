I have this eBay movie mainly because I'm gay and I love Til Schweiger. However, it's one of those movies that, when you watch a second time, you never say to yourself, "Hmm. I forgot that boring part. I'm going to make popcorn." You do not have that part. It's a very fluid and constantly interesting film. And, yes, Til Schweiger is worth it, if nothing else. But it's a great movie, even for straight guys.
