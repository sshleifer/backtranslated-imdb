Chucky is back, but this time he's not scary (very much) - but he's funny! <br /> <br /> When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old girlfriend of the trailer, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and turns her into a doll too. Tiffany and Chucky are now in the case of two high school graduates - eekkk !! <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie - it's a lot of fun. It's scary, funny, weird, crazy and stupid all in one! My rating: 9/10.
