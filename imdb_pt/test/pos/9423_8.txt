I liked that probably a little more than Terror by Night, though not enough to give the extra *. The beginning is simply brilliant as we spy on Nazi agents who plan to get their hands on a new bomb sight and their inventor in a small Swiss village just to be thwarted by a disguised Holmes who animates the scientist back to London. Once there, he does everything he can to stop the scientist from falling into the hands of the man behind everything - not Hitler, but worse: Holmes' archenemy, Moriarty. Of course the scientist disappears, leaving a codifying note tempting, and Holmes goes out in pursuit, again disguised. A climax in Moriarty's lair is exciting, and we can all assume that everything ends well, can not we? Patriotic message slightly exaggerated as the credits roll. Now that I think about it, good sense of place, despite the obvious sets, the use of Rathbone's disguise and the way in which so much plot is squeezed in just over an hour - what the hell does he get that extra * and is mine favorite of the 5 Rathbone / Bruce movies I've seen to this day. <br /> <br /> I watched on DVD, part of Mill Creek Entertainment's "50 Mystery Classics". Many of the transfers in these box sets are very poor quality, but Holmes fans take note that Rathbone / Bruce's films (there are 4 in this set) are all quite watchable and reasonably clear.
