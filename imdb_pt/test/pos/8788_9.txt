Alfred Hitchcock's saboteur is not one of his most respected films; Made between two much more popular and critically acclaimed photos, Suspicion and Shadow of Doubt, it is generally considered as a minor effort. I agree that the later film is groundbreaking, drawing Hitchcock entirely into the American mainstream for the first time, but the Saboteur is on its way at least as alive as the Suspect; his main flaw is the less talented actors, Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane. <br /> <br /> In Saboteur, we find Hitchcock traveling literally across America while his main character travels from California to New York in search of an arsonist for whose crime he has been charged. Cummings is very young here and quite engaging. His masculinity (but not immaturity) fits perfectly to the character he is portraying, and it seems appropriate, since the middle-aged director was in the process of reinventing himself, and an older, established star might have thrown it away . The brave heroine of Priscilla Lane, who was not typical of the director, was very common in American films of the time; and she and Cummings provide an opening and a young man the director needed both in his life and at work at the moment. I can not imagine older, more solid types - Cooper and Stanwyck, for example - doing better, as they would have, loaded, well, lots of luggage. <br /> <br /> How Normal In Hitchcock's films, nothing is as it seems. Where the Saboteur differs from his most well-known movies is that the audience enters the game sooner. Although Cummings is an accused arsonist, we know he is innocent. Villains soon become apparent; and the film depends more on the plot than on its ironies. What pleasures there are incidental, and here the Master does not disappoint. There's an interesting interlude, Tod Browningish with some circus freaks, who help Cummings escape the catch. In another scene, reminiscent of James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein, Cummings spends some time in the hut of a blind man, who, as you can see, is Lane's uncle. Has the director perhaps studied major American films from the previous decade? Whatever the case, these and other original and discursive aspects of the film give it a fun and variety, which, when you add the rather young lead factor, makes the image look like the work of a younger man, yet learning their craft. <br /> <br /> The later scenes of the film in New York are more suspenseful and typical of the director as the image gradually becomes more Hitchockian as it moves. In the end, I think it's a satisfactory job; and as neither Cummings nor Lane has a dark side as an actor, the film does not have one either. It is deliberately mild and suspected of being semi-experimental; an attempt by Hitchcock to see if he could, in an American setting, the kind of story he had done so well in England. He succeeded admirably. The next logical step: Shadow Of a Doubt, a film in which the main character travels from east to west, and with an entirely different set of values ​​and plans. <br /> <br />
