I watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations, having just graduated from college and moved to "real life". I was not in a fraternity, but a lot of my best friends were, and I attended many parties they did at their house, so I know what happens to some extent. <br /> <br /> This show is obviously a dramatization, not a documentary of Greek life anyway, or university life, although it has a lot of truth, though mostly exaggerated. If you watch the show for the amount it contains as a TV show, and nothing else, it's a lot of fun, much like movies like Old School, Porky's, Animal House, etc. If you watch him hoping to record all your experiences in your own college life, you'll probably be left wanting more, or crazy as they dramatize many events.
