This short, a cartoon with Pepe Le Pew, concerns a cat that thinks that it will solve all its problems pretending to be a possum. The problem is that it attracts the most inopportune attention of an honest and truly skunk (our hero, Pepe, entering the stage on the left) being decidedly more attentive, say, than M. Cat would like. Every great plan has its drawbacks, but this is a steed! I wonder if Jack Warner received a call from the Hays Office about the fact that Pepe and the object of his worship were both men. After all, Betty Boop was partly responsible for the Production Code that existed. Subsequent "achievements" were clearly and definitely feminine. Very good cartoon, but Pepe is a character who works best as a focal point, rather than supporting. It's worth watching. Recommended.
