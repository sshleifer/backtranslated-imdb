Did I get this movie about the most unlikely success? of a low league football team. The plot is thick and plays some great faint twists. I exchanged shots and comments from the 1970s. I was surprised by the fun of his movie. <br /> <br /> A great cast includes the excellent Tim Healy as the crazed (drunk) entrepreneur, fumbling with anything that will make his team win ...? I keep reminding of bits and pieces like the stolen secret file that Don Revie (about the united leagues and england manager) has about Bostock United (the underlings) that in his detailed report of his opposition, Bostock United , in this final of the FA Cup, simply says "Sh-te". <br /> <br /> Many other slutty jokes long before the fantastic feature film "Mike Basset - Football Manager" starring Ricky Tomlinson. <br /> <br /> Up there with the German Gung ho beating Germans in football. Well morally. Although the score lines say different, from "Escape to Victory" (I still wrap when England scores) <br /> <br /> And the unpleasant eternal routine of following a very bad team in Michael Palins "Golden Gordon "of the series" Ripping Yarns "(with Terry Jones), the team was called Bostonworth United, in case you are interested. <br /> <br /> I looked up and down at a copy of Bostock's biography - until the biography of Nick Hancock did not list (probably someone - no hancocks - mistake) <br /> <br /> Play again or Send me a copy - PLEASE ....
