"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is a nice and very cool action thriller, and a breakthrough for Geena Davis. The plot is very familiar to the Bourne Identity, but so what? The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plot is strong enough to keep you wrapped up for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> It is driven with a sense of style and avoids most of the clich√©s of action. Geena Davis is great as an action girl and overcomes her usual "good wife" role. Samuel L. Jackson is good, as always, as a support player. The villain in the movie is overly tacky and you can tell what will happen to him. <br /> <br /> It separates from ordinary common actions like Commando and On Deadly Ground and is definitely one of the best actions in years. Good fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4 / 10.
