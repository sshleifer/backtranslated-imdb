Chop Shop is a hidden treasure in theaters! I can not describe how wonderful the performances are in this movie. This film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary films should be and how to be. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a young boy, Alejandro "Ale" who works and lives with his teenage sister, Isamar "Izzie" in a tiny one-room apartment in a car shop. The story takes place in a part of New York City (which I did not even know existed - Willits Points), where there are numerous old irons and workshops. Here, Bahrani tells the story of two forgotten children hoping to make ends meet by buying and fixing a food van. <br /> <br /> Ale makes money by helping in the workshop, and Izzie helps in a food van; both, however, make extra money on the side. Ale sells pirated movies and stolen car parts; Izzie turns out to sell herself. Their lives are surrounded by courage and sadness, but even if they both witness, live and barely survive within their cruel world, their love for each other is never tainted by the dirt that surrounds them. And occasionally they are able to laugh and enjoy moments of their childhood that are being stolen by the reality of struggling to survive and get together. The best comparison I have to the Chop Shop is that Bahrani's juxtaposition of an innocent love among family members against such a gloomy atmosphere is as powerful as Pasolini's Mama Rome combined with the struggles to grow very fast in an adverse environment, as well as in the Mouchette de Bresson. Having co-authored, directed and edited this film and his first, Man Push Cart (which won awards worldwide), Bahrani is a total package filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that your movies are not hidden treasures for long!
