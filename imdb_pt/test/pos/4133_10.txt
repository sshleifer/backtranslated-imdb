Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly (1936-59). He has a spit image for the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is different from today. Having a group of three is usually simple in those days. I bet Buddy Holly (Busey) was a far better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was just a quiet rural town back then. Her parents were Christians, though her mother was a strong supporter of her son's work. That's one of the reasons he did not act like Elvis. He adhered to his kindest ways. This really does him good! When he went to Tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. They hated rock-n-roll, which took Holly out of time. Getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge for Holly and her friends. He toured with Sam Cooke, went to the famous Apollo, which the African-American audience quickly accepted, I liked that! And Sam Cooke made sure Holly and her band got some service. This is what I call tolerance. It's sad that he, Ritchie Valens, and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson had their musical careers interrupted by a plane crash in 1959, at least their memories will live in our hearts. I do not know what inaccuracies were in the film, all I care about is that Buddy Holly overcame the obstacles of music and politics at that time, and the music is almost perfect. For Gary Busey, he was perfect on paper and also did the music. God bless you, GARY BUSEY! 5 STARS!
