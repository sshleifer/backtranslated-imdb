In the tradition of "neo" noir flicks like "Chinatown," this film focuses on a criminal mystery in a dark realm with a bit of mixed character insight. The typical noir characters, including the strip to prove, a damsel in danger and a bad bad face. Sharky's Machine wins 9 of 10 for its first cinematography, plus its direction, history, strong performance and excellent jazz soundtrack. Available on DVD, although the soundtrack itself is exhausted (but available "used" on some auction sites). Filmed in a beautiful location in downtown Atlanta (writer Diehl's hometown) and in the city's organized look in 1979, an Atlanta citizen or an old visitor craved the old days before the interstate 12-band intersected the city, the dream of a filmmaker that time. This was Rachel Ward's first US feature.
