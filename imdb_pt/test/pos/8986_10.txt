I realized this a few times on TV in the late 70's. I only played late at night (after midnight). <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre plays a gentle and happy man whose face is disfigured by a fire. He is rejected by his girlfriend and left alone and full of despair. He turns to a life of crime and ends up becoming very successful. He makes a mask to hide his disfigured features and falls in love with a beautiful girl (Evelyn Keyes) ... who is blind! He tries to get right at her ... but he can not escape his life of crime or his hatred of his own scarred face. <br /> <br /> A film without budget B. Very short (works only a little over an hour) but well done and superbly represented by Lorre. This takes much more depth than you would expect from a quick photo B. Ankers especially takes the role of ungrateful "girl" and makes your character new and attractive. This unfortunately disappeared from the TV and was never put on video or DVD (as far as I know). TCM has demonstrated this recently and it was great to see the film still standing. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
