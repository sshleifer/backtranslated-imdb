"Do not Change Your Husband" is another comedy novel by producer / director Cecil B. De Mille. It is notable as the first of several films he made starring Gloria Swanson. I think you can also call it a sequel to your "Old Wives to the New" (1918). <br /> <br /> James (Elliot Dexter) and Leila (Swanson) Porter are a couple of forty years old where James went to seed and became sloppy and lazy. He has a crush on stinking cigars and eats raw onions. He takes his wife for granted. Leila tries to make him straighten up without success. <br /> <br /> One night at a Porters dinner, Leila meets the eye-catching Schyler Van Sutphen (now there's a nickname), the socialite nephew playboy Mrs Huckney (Sylvia Ashton) She invites Leila to her house at the end of week to make James "miss you". Once there Schyler begins to put the moves on her, promising her pleasure, wealth and love, if she will leave the husband and go with him. The sequences that envelop Leila's imagination for this new promised life are lavishly staged and anticipate De Mille's epic costumes over the course of her career. <br /> <br /> Leila, bored with her marriage and her disinterested husband, divorces James and marries the playboy. James finally realizes that he has lost the one thing that mattered to him and began to mend his ways. He shaves his mustache, works out, avoids onions and picks up a few ways. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, not everything is pink with Leila's new marriage. It seems that Schyler likes to bet and got involved with the gold digger Nanette (also known as Tootsie, or some other name) (Julia Faye). Schyler loses all her money and steals Leila's diamond ring to cover her losses. <br /> <br /> One fateful day, Leila knows the "new" James and is taken over by the changes in him. James takes her home and realizes her situation and ........................................ ... This movie marked the beginning of Gloria Swanson's rise to super stardom in a career that would rival Mary Pickford's. At the age of 20, she began her career in Mack Sennett with two teen comedies. Elliot Dexter was almost 50 at the time, but he and Swanson make a good team, although it's hard to imagine someone getting tired of the lovely Miss Swanson as is the case in this movie. Dexter and Sylvia Ashton had appeared in the similar "Old Wives For New" where the wife had gone to seed and her husband was wronged. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast are Theodore Roberts as Bishop and Raymond Hatton as Player.
