(Warning Spoilers) I can not say enough good things about this movie. It's a great horror / spoof comedy that does everything right for a change. The mood is great and varies from funny to funny, you will cry funny. In one scene, Ed gets mad at editing and erases a big scene. When his boss is looking at the Ed edition, he shouts, "Where's my beaver rape scene?!?!" Hysterical. There are also many other great, humorous, memorable quotes and moments: Ed yells "You're not looking at me !!!" punching some poor schmuck repeatedly in the face. Very funny stuff. The plot of the film itself is so ridiculous that it's invaluable: Ed is an ordinary guy who is moved to the horror film editing department, and after a while goes crazy, sees monsters and attacks people while citing horror. movies he edited. This movie has it all and is simply hilarious. The DVD costs only about $ 7, and it's a big bargain because it's the unrated widescreen cut. I own many DVDs, most of which cost a lot more money than this, but many are not as good as this movie. My Evil Ed DVD is one of the highlights of my collection and I would hit someone with a phone receiver if they tried to steal it. Evil Ed exudes style and quality - something that Hollywood filmmakers need to learn mostly. Evil Ed is a rare gem, and I would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful film - you did everything right, and I love the evil Ed! 10 out of 10 !!!
