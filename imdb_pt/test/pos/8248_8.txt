David "master debonair" Niven plays the Big Boss (IVAN), who attacks the unfortunate Richard Jordan (PINKY), forcing the unfortunate ex-condemned to explore his new position in a bank. Elke Sommer (Miss PELHAM) provides female interest most effectively, whom Pinkie can not simply not resist. It seems they were unable to decide on a name for this movie so instead they used four .... Unfortunately, this turns out to be one of Niven's last roles. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is fun and worth seeing if you can get one of your rare or late TV shows. <br /> <br />
