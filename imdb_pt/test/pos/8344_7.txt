This film is apparently intended for a young Christian evangelical audience as a teaching tool. For this I give a vote of 7 in 10 points. It's a decent movie to show a group of young people, but I do not think it will be very well received beyond that. For any other audience, I would rate this much lower. <br /> <br /> The reviewers who saw "It's a Wonderful Life" were right, though I did not think about it until they mentioned it. I remembered more of a "Chick Tract", those little gospel comics of 3 "by 5". If Jack Chick made a movie in one of his brochures, he would probably look a lot like "Second Glance." It has a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and the influence that each of us has on earth, but it is somewhat impaired by Christian stereotypes. The Christians are all very friendly, a little passive and completely clean, while all non-Christians seem to be bad people. <br /> <br /> Muriel, the angel, plays an important role, and he is the bravest, most jovial. character in the movie. He's the most appreciated angel I've ever seen in any movie, and the biggest negative. I do not know if the directors wanted his personality to go so badly, or if he impressed me that way. I admit he reminded me of someone I know. Dan's love for a very mundane girl who is not all his kind directs the plot in this movie. Why he fell in love with her in the first place is the only question I wish to have been answered. <br /> <br /> But the film shows positive Christian values, and your group of young people will have fun while they see something healthy with a good lesson.
