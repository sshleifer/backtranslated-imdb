BLACK WATER has to be one of the best Australian movies I've seen in years. My girlfriend and I sat holding each other's hands, jumping in all the right places. This is as much a crocodile film as the OPEN WATER was a shark movie. In other words, creatures are only part of the dilemma, the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances. As Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich, the director, twist so suspense and terror of a situation so modest that it is amazing to see the unfolding of events. And when I say terror, it is not exaggerated, artificially constructed moments of contortion, but smaller touches that when you ask yourself "how I would feel in that situation" lead you to conclude "without fear." The presentations were great, the pace and the beautiful cuts in the mangrove life were excellent and the final moments of the film seemed very right. This is a feature debut for two directors who must, by right, be very proud. Go and watch this very well filmed and acted thriller.
