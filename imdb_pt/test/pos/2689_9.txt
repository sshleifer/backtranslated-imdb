I'm not really a t.v. observer - except between the ages of 6 and 8 and "General Hospital" still had Luke and Laura - but there are some exceptions and I definitely think "King of Queens" is one of them. Every decade has its classics and I think this show will (or very well should) be among the best of this decade. Their comic timing is incredible and can sometimes be quite weird. On a more "serious" note, the actors more than manage to convey subtle - and not so subtle :) complexities in their characters without getting too mushy. One commentator wrote that it may take a few episodes to come in and I agree; It is definitely a type that grows on you, but once you are, you are very addicted. And with good reason!
