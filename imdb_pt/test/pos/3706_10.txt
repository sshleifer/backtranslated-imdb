Mama really should get a different title to distinguish her from all the other movies out there called Mom or the word Mom in the title. <br /> <br /> This is an immensely superior zombie movie for both the junk that shakes time after time and everything ends up the same way as all the other zombie movies out there. <br /> <br /> It's so different and refreshing that it almost challenges categorization. <br /> <br /> Gentle old lady who gets a queer tenant, who happens to be a meat eater, who then infects the old lady who also turns into a carnal zombie, or ghoul, exactly what is not defined. <br /> <br /> There are pathos in the story as your child realizes what she has become and, at first, horrified, tries to help her by providing 'food'. (I will not say anything more about it, for fear of inserting a spoiler!) It is one of those 'quiet' movies as opposed to exploding weapons, furious blasts, car chases, etc. boring movies that make so many movies all of the same garbage but still with enough bloody moments to satisfy the horror fans, at the same time it inserts sadness in the story, along with good touches of humor as opposed to the foolishness of some films called "terror" ". <br /> <br /> It's a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the movie, where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her Christmas tree as company and looks so 'innocent', but, what she becomes !! Oh my! <br /> <br /> A jewel of a movie and even if it is not your thing, it should at least be seen only once by any fan of terror.
