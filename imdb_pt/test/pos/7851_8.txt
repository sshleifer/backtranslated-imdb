I was amazed by this initial performance of Clint Eastwood. I had not read a summary of the movie when I decided to watch it on TV. Due to Mr. Eastwood, I expected some good movies and no deep story. I was very much mistaken. I found some topics covered in an unusual way and, until the end, I could not decide on who is good and who is bad. This movie is definitely not typical of Eastwood, but certainly worth seeing.
