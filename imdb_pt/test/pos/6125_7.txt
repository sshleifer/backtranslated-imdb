Babs Johnson (Divine) lives in a trailer with his son Crackers, his daughter Cotton and his mother Edie (Edie Massey). She is competing with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marbles (Mink Stole, David Lochary) to be named the most filthy person alive. The film shows their attempts to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. It's a problem on his face, with no abuse of bad taste. Crackers have sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while her sister watches; the Marbles take female rides, impregnate them, keep them chained in the cellar, and sell the babies to lesbian couples; Divine and family has a party that includes cannibalism etc etc. It's disgusting, but in a way, it's not unattainable. It's so over the top and it's so unapologetic about it that it's kind of fascinating. As John Waters would say, bad taste was well done. It's also fun to watch - the acting is so unfortunate (especially by Massey) that you simply watch in disbelief. A friend laughed out loud at how bad Massey was (she improved on later photos). <br /> <br /> This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Even with more than 30 years, it is still shocking. However, if you have an open mind and can have a lot of extreme behaviors, this is a must-see. The only part that really was too much is what the Divine does in the end.
