You could tell from the opening photo of the conveyor belt on the bench that this was going to be a great movie. <br /> <br /> A minimalist touch to feel with a touch of retro this film exudes style-the brilliant camera -work, acting, script and the way the protagonist's secret life unfolds complement each other in possibly making the best Italian film I've seen (up there with La Stanza Del Figlio - albeit different). What a shame for the people sitting behind me who made it clear they could not see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes meticulously created by the camera. Do not miss.
