Like most people, I'm tired of the clich√©d numbers Hollywood makes. There seems to be no creativity in Hollywood. Companies just want to spend money on remakes, sequences that have a built-in audience. <br /> <br /> This film is a welcome change. It could be classified as a romantic comedy by its genre, but do not let that distance you from that movie. This is a very original movie, which is not like most of the things Hollywood produces. <br /> <br /> If you're reading this, you already know the basic plot, so I will not bother with it. The only movies that come to mind to compare this are "Interstate 60" and "Art of Travel", which are little-known gems that take a different path than most Hollywood trash. <br /> <br /> This is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same. <br /> <br /> Dean
