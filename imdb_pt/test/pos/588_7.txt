The first feature-length adventure of Jim Henson's beloved muppets is a very competent musical comedy vehicle, while Kermit The Frog leaves his carefree and marshy environment for the bright lights (overshadowed by Hollywood actor Don DeLuise who heard him sing); On the way, he meets Fozzie Bear (an unfortunate comedian at James Coburn's El Sleazo Caf√©, who has Telly Savalas as security and Madeline Kahn, patroness!), the dog Rowlf, who plays the piano, drummer Animal and his friend. back, funky band, the egocentric beauty queen Miss Piggy (at a ceremony presided over by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc. All along, Kermit et al are pursued by burger mogul Charles Durning and reluctant acolyte Austin Pendleton, selling cars, ice cream and balloons to respectively Milton Berle, Bob Hope and Richard Pryor, served food by cheeky waiter Steve Martin, almost brainwashed the mad German scientist Mel Brooks and finally auditioned in the offices of tycoon Orson Welles. who has Cloris Leachman for a secretary)! The nice soundtrack is courtesy of Paul Williams, who also makes an appearance as a pianist residing at El Sleazo's. For the record, I recently acquired four of the subsequent Muppet films and should be watching them in the coming weeks when their turn is due.
