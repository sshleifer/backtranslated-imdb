I was very impressed with the last production of Mick Molloy. As a fan of him, I was accustomed to a different kind of humor than the one shown here. He wisely opted for a more subtle and broad style of comedy in Crackerjack, instead of his low wandering, in a low voice. It is sometimes inconsistent and unbalanced, but a decent script goes through it and provides a fun visual. Directed by Paul Moloney (who directed almost every Australian TV series imaginable), Crackerjack tells the story of Jack Simpson, a guy who belongs to his local bowling club for the sole reason of parking. When the club faces financial difficulties, it is forced to compete competitively in an attempt to raise funds to save the club from becoming a poker machine paradise. A familiar and successful formula that is well treated. There is no denying that the film owes its success to the great cast of Molloy. He seemed to have a great relationship with Samuel Johnson, and excellent chemistry with Judith Lucy, and although the character is probably not too far from his own personality, you can not help but wonder why he did not try his arm on the film. early. To soften the experienced cast, the delightful support of Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter, and often steal their scenes. They are two great actors and the two cross their roles with ease. If it were not for the huge success of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding', Crackerjack would have come to number 1 at the Australian box office, but when you consider what he is about the film and who is involved, reaching number 2 was a remarkable effort . All in all, a witty and well-being movie. Great cast, great crew and a great soundtrack, combine to make one of the best Australian films of 2002. 7/10.
