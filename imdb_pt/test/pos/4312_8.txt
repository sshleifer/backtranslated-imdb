it's a good watch if you have the time - deal with three friends who enter an unnecessary bar dispute and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some dark people and can not handle it. very, very disturbing picture of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life ... some intense scenes but a bit of a potboiler <br /> <br /> the spoiler was that the plot is not very clear based on sub-titles in English. obviously, I do not know Japanese. <br /> <br /> The only other Japanese movies I've seen were kurosawa, which is different and much higher than this modern genre. so you can not compare. otherwise, it compares best with most Hollywood blockbusters for plot plots and story-telling. <br /> <br /> taptieg24
