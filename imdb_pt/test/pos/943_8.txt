I do not see how a film of this quality receives only an average of 5.7 of IMDb voters. It is a classic Australian production that resembles recent efforts like LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES, THE SUGAR FACTORY, CASUAL COURSE, RUSSIAN DOLL, PERSONAL PERSONS, THE SECRET LIFE OF US, LA SPAGNOLA, STRANGE PLANET, FRESH AIR, DUST WINGS, MAKING TIME FOR THE PATSY CLUB, etc ... as a 19 year old uni student (Newton, perhaps in his best role, along with CHANGI, at least) with a bored and overly religious mother gets the shock of his life. life when she decides to enroll on the same course as him - and before you go think of another movie, there is, there is some real substance here. Of course, it's a simplistic view of life in general and arts students in particular (but they're rather simplistic under all this philosophical nonsense, are not they?), And perhaps the study of Sinead Cusack's character is a bit confusing at times. , but the film is brilliant, funny and has some important messages. The main cast is fantastic: Cusack and Newton are wonderful, and Rose Byrne (see also in THE GODDESS OF 1967) is so underrated that it's not funny. She is a beautiful, new and confident actress who deserves all the praise she gets. I gave my mother FRANK 8/10.
