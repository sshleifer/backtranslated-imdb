Max von Sydow of Bergman and Liv Ullmann starred as a couple of villagers, Jan and Eva Rosenberg. The story began with a common couple fighting and makeup. Jan was a sensitive person, but an escapist who cut himself off from the world. Eva is a practical woman who is getting tired of her husband's lack of ambition. Because Jan procrastinating in fixing his radio, the are unrelated to the impending war. Of course the war came, and the film was a fascinating study of their transformation from one another and the other through the invasion when they were mistreated by the enemy and by their own government. <br /> <br /> There was no musical score for the film, but the soundtrack was the noise of war. In one scene the pulsating background gun, the explosion and the sound of the fly by airplanes were incredible. From time to time, Bergman widened his facial expression as different events unfolded. When something violent happened, he turned away to let the audience feel the violence instead of watching closely. Movie very well done.
