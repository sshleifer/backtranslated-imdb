This film is possibly one of the most creative works of terror of all time. It has everything you could want ... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, Native Americans, brains eating ... If you're looking for the best of all brainsucking movies, look no further. The story of a man inclined to revenge. And how best to achieve this? "I know, I'll suck your brains!" With great sound effects and stunning special effects, I can not recommend this movie enough.
