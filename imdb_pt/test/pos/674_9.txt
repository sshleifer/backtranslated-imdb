The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier who Lupino hires as a handyman. She is a war widow. <br /> <br /> The set is limited, but the performance pays off. Robert Ryan is in conflict: one moment he looks good, then confused about where he lives. First Lupine tries to help you. He looks disturbed, but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? The suspense is built. I really like movies like that, which depend on the human element for suspense. What is this man capable of? There are some scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying grocery kid who sees something wrong. We continue to think that she will be helped, so Ryan's personality changes again. He becomes like a Jekyll / Hyde character and eventually chases Lupine with a knife. <br /> <br /> It pays to watch these two superb actors. 9/10
