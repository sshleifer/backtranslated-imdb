Shtrafbat - Criminal Battalion is a movement, and mostly honest, looks at the lives and deaths of Soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash their crimes with blood during World War II. It can almost be said that it is the Russian equivalent of the highly acclaimed "Band of Brothers" miniseries. Formed in July 1942, on the eve of the Battle of Stalingrad, the battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrific deaths. (sometimes as high as 90%). Gulag prisoners, deserters, soldiers captured by the Germans, but managed to escape, soldiers accused of violating the protocol, had a chance to join the Shtrafbat and prove there were "traitors to the homeland ". "with their lives Those who suffered injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reintegrated in the eyes of the law. This miniseries takes a look at one of these Shtrafbat under the command of Tverdokhlebov - an honored officer, who was captured by the Germans, was shot and left to die.He presents a colorful and varied group of people, pushed into a situation that there is no escape from.the author, but honored crime boss Antip "Kulak" (The Fist) and his small gang of unreformed criminals, a young Jewish intellectual who attacked his anti-Semitic officer, the priest (orthodox priest) Mikhail who joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed. , political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the Gulag, but who are willing to fight one last time for their people and their country, must find their courage and their reasons for continuing to live, and to continue fighting. <br /> < Although not defined during a war, not all episodes feature combat, in fact the combat scenes that exist are often chaotic, sporadic and short - which was probably the intention of the director. . In between, the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast, its background, its thoughts and tragedies. The rape of a young woman by one of Shtrafbat's soldiers and their execution, execution for alleged AOL, periods of annoyance in the march, the celebration (and subsequent consequences) of finding a German bunker stocked with food (and champagne), the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors, betraying a spouse and other situations, appear prominently. The camera is unshakable - it does not stray from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature, nor from raw human emotions. Nor does the dialogue censure the oath. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb and deep, and the script is also well written. Everything, from anger, to exhaustion, to resignation, until you find a little joy to cling to, is presented almost without fail. One complaint may be that some of the Russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies can not always be understood by someone unfamiliar with language and culture. Because it is a drama of history, some terms and situations (military classification, mention of other battles, certain historical references) may be lost on some spectators. This understanding is not necessary to take full advantage of Shtrafbat, but these references are a beautiful touch of authenticity. Another claim that could be raised is an occasional anachronism and the bending of the story to suit the plot, but frankly, this is such a fascinating miniseries that it is likely to forgive these minor setbacks.
