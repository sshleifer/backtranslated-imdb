I read the book before seeing the movie I knew the movie was going to be good because the book was great I really recommend you to see this amazing fantastic movie. I know you'll like it. When I went to see I was there with my sister and there was no one that was with us I was a bit disappointed but nobody I know went to the movie and went out saying it was a horrible movie. No one can be that big I guess everyone will like it (so bad no one wants to see it) Anyway I hope what you heard about this movie from me will make you want to see this movie I guarantee you'll like it so much How much I (I'm obsessed) literally I am
