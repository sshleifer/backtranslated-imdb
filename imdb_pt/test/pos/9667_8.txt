Romanian cinema is little known outside of Romania. No Romanian director has attracted the attention of the international public, as some of the other Eastern European countries, such as Hungary, Czekoslowakia or Yugoslavia, have managed to do. One of the few great directors of Romanian cinema is Lucian Pintilie, who for 35 years directed a great film 'Reconstituirea' - quickly withdrawn from the circuit by Communist censorship. After that film, still a reference for Romanian cinema, Pintilie was not allowed to create freely in Romania until the communist regime fell in 1989. 'Fury' reminds me of Pintilie's film 35 years ago . The title means "The Rage" and I can not imagine why the distributors chose to translate it differently. It's about a lost generation. While in the classic of Pintilie the root of evil lies in the oppression and lies of the Communist regime, here the young people must deal with the emergence of the subculture, and the moral filth that filled the void left by totalitarianism. rule. The ending is tragic and painfully expected. <br /> <br /> The film is well directed, and the acting is good. Without much complexity, it manages to create an emotional connection between the characters and the viewer. One might say that some situations look similar to '8 Miles' or 'The Fast and the Furious' - but look at the production date! This movie was done at the same time, if not before the western couple. If this is really the first film of director Dan Munteanu, as the IMDB says, it's an excellent debut. In any case, a good movie, can compete and can sell well in the western market. <br /> <br /> There is hope for a new generation of Romanian films that, with some luck and good distribution, will make their place in the movies. international film scene. <br/> <br/> 8/10 on my personal scale.
