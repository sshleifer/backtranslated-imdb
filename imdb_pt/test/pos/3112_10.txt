I finally got my DVD today, I saw it and I am pleased to announce that this is the original theatrical version of the movie. As you may have read in previous reviews of "Rich and Famous" that edited for the TV version of the movie that somehow reached the VHS sometime in the late 90s, but now WB corrected the error and released on DVD complete with the airplane bathroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's naked butt and the scene in the hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C ** t! It's all there and it looks better than ever! A crisp, clear, widescreen digital transfer and special features that include original theatrical trailer and a 1981 vintage feature called "On Location with Rich and Famous" featuring cast interviews and director. If you love this movie like me, you will not be disappointed with the purchase of this DVD. Glad to finally have it on DVD? Worth the wait! Thank you Warner Bros!
