Not a movie, but an experience! <br /> <br /> It's not the usual candy I thought it would be. Many things are happening at the same time, his senses could hardly handle it. A state-of-the-art product (we were split between just sitting down to enjoy the show and putting on our 3D glasses to decipher the magic), the music is great (it's a show!), The Disney characters are in it (and you are part of their world), it's funny, it's magical, it's exciting - I know this is starting to sound like an ad - but it's really amazing! Beat Christmas in bringing the child in you! <br /> <br /> This attraction alone already makes going to Disney all worth it. ;)
