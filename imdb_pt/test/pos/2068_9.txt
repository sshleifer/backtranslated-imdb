Incredible, incredible, incredible. What else can be said? Jacobi is the best Hamlet who has ever graced the stage and captures every inch of character. Every nuance and element of Hamlet is represented and well represented. Some people complained about your age, but you honestly do not know when watching the movie. If anything, it looks drastically younger than 40. I only wish a more dignified Ophelia could have been found. Her acting is acceptable, but she just does not seem the part. The only real exceptional performances come from Jacobi and Stewart, who is a great Claudius. The rest of the cast is good, but Jacobi is what really elevates this teleplay.
