Tumbling Doll of Flesh (also known as Niku daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) This has been on my wish list for quite a while, and so I finally got a copy on Ebay a while back. It was never on DVD, and what I received from Ebay was a DVD-R of very good quality, with which I am quite satisfied. The movie is I believe in the most extreme example of porn torture, with an emphasis on pornography. A woman responds to an advertisement for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed. Porn is definitely real, with the annoying Japanese pixelation to try to hide the hardcore scenes, without much success most of the time. After the pornographic film is filmed and the actress is ready to leave, she is beaten on the head with a baseball bat, and carried back into the room and wildly dismembered in slow scenes, and in one of the most disgusting scenes, pornography male face presses it into an open wound on the chest. This after the two legs were severed, her arm and some other goodies. This film beats the series of guinea pigs for a long shot, in fact, they are nowhere near realism, despite the cheap gore effects shown in this movie. This is actually one of the best fake snuff movies I have ever seen, if not the best. Now I must warn you, that if you are not in these things, you must stay very far. This movie is very strong, and with real sex, it is a very sickly, erotic way to a certain extent. And I mean, in a very unhealthy way. But wherever you come on this subject, this movie brings the merchandise home, and I definitely recommend you to look for it. After reading about the movie, I was expecting something very strong, but overcame it by a lot.
