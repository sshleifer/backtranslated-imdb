Even with all the movies dealing with the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacob's Ladder, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver to some extent), we feel we do not even know half of what happened. Even contemplating the horror seems inhuman. And a progression - or withdrawal? - for the inhumanity that this demands is a key part of Apocalypse Now, the largest and one of Coppola's most important films of all time. Vaguely based on Joseph Conrad's classic 1902, "Heart of Darkness," which chronicles the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that comes with the distance of civilization - a surface of bestial nature, as it were, the Lord of the Flies - brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam. The story is about Willard, a general in charge of a special mission to Cambodia after his first mission in Vietnam was held. Willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in Saigon, psychologically unable to return home - echoing Nicky in The Deer Hunter. Then he is contacted: his mission is to assassinate a renegade Green Beret who isolated himself at a remote outpost on the Nung River, and who was supposed to be completely insane - worshiped as a god by the natives, and killing indiscriminately. The name of this man is Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in the second best role of his career (being the best Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire). While Willard travels upriver on an army boat with some accompanying soldiers, witnessing the horrors and insanity - and the utter nonsense of all this - leads to a sinister sympathy and identification with Kurtz before they even meet. When they arrive, Kurtz's methods do not seem as wrong or as they should, and certainly do not seem too unusual or out of place. Apocalypse - a place beyond morality, the outpost at the end of the world. The loss of civilization, the loss of judgment, of the self. Kurtz's monologue on an atrocity he witnessed as Green Beret and his later revelation is one of the most chilling and well-publicized speeches in film history. The film is about trauma, about the human spirit and its breaking point - here, it's very much like The Deer Hunter, and as good as it is. Apocalypse, however, carries the limits of what we can endure on a global level - Coppola's sweeping images of Cambodia's damp, dark jungles and a sequence of helicopters amid exploding forests and an orange sky - set to a soundtrack as well chilling scenes in the river and an air raid on a village with Wagner blasting loudspeakers (a scene that has become one of the most chilling, darkly humorous, and surprisingly pointless war scenes of all time) - all contribute to the sense of the Apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at some distant point in the future, but Revelation Now and forever. The Deer Hunter is much closer and personal, you might even say by title, and it shows the total effect that the trauma has on the individual psyche, the breaking of the human soul, and its ability to surrender completely to the forces of darkness. or to limp. That's why both movies are the same - they are two parts of the same thing. In "Heart of Darkness," Kurtz is shown as conflicting between morality (civilization) and his inner savage. In Apocalypse Now, Kurtz left all the conflicts behind. He is beyond good and evil. He abandoned morality as a drowning man, releasing a saving hand in the moments before his death. Kurtz, in fact, is just waiting for death, quoting T. S. Eliot in his temple for himself, lost in the jungle. His last words, and the words echoed at the end of the film, are: "The horror ... the horror". He is referring to the infinite emptiness of existence, the human psyche, and the dark emptiness within his own mind, where atrocities are born again. It is impossible to express in words the experience that goes on watching this film - the experience, in short, that Willard experiences on his journey. The final part, at the outpost, almost in fact comparable to his brother scene in The Deer Hunter, is one of the deepest, quietest and seductively disturbing things I've ever seen.
