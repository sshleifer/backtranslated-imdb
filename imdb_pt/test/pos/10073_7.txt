So Madonna is not Meryl Streep. Still, this is one of his first films and a comedy. Give her some time! Of course, the film is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its previous counterpart w / Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby. For what it is though (a piece of fluff), it is a bit fun to watch. I have not yet heard anyone criticizing Madonna's acting skills with evidence or even adjectives other than "horrible", "bad" or other vague and descriptive words. If you want to see a bad performance or justify the argument that singers should continue singing, how about Whitney Houston? She had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and could not get out of a hat box. The American public obviously can not discern the difference between a reliable performance in a movie and the power of the star. I think Madonna has always been at least credible in her films. Get real people. Madonna-beating is so 90's.
