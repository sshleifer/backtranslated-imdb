After a group of young friends experience problems in the car while traveling out of the way, they accept an offer of help from the lonely Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors), owner of a nearby museum, full of historical wax mannequins. Once in the frightening attraction by the roadside, friends are chased by a lunatic wearing mask that can bring the dolls of the museum to life through the power of the mind. <br /> <br /> Tourist trap villain is a demented cross between Leatherface and Massacre's Leatherface and Anthony, the scary kid from the classic Twilight Zone episode, 'It's a Good Life', while the plot is a mix of elements of the aforementioned TCM, Hitchcock's Psycho and House of Wax. The atmosphere and the execution of Tourist Trap, however, are so unbalanced that, in this respect, it is virtually impossible to make a comparison with previous films. <br /> <br /> David Schmoeller's continuous and inventive treatment of his own script gives the film a distinctly nightmarish quality, and with brilliant left-field performance from Connors, an astonishingly scary score from Pino Donaggio, a collection of truly disturbing mannequins with detachable jaws, and the presence of super sexy Tanya Roberts, who spends the film on (and briefly out) tiny jeans and a hugging-boob-tube figure, Tourist Trap is a totally unforgettable horror experience and , finally, one-of-a-kind well deserving of his next cult.
