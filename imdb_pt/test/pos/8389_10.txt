Inglorious Basterds does not apologize, does not ask for forgiveness, it is an attack without restrictions to the senses. Tarantino does not care if he offends, if he steps into all stereotypes and clich√©s, this is making movies purer. It's great to see a filmmaker whose work is clearly not interpreted by the powerful. Tarantino is a master of increasing tension immensely and mixing it suddenly with laughter; you're not sure if you should be looking away with disgust or laughing, anyway, it's a roller coaster and one not to be missed! It's not for everyone and I'm not sure how the Germans are going to take the film, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a bit difficult to swallow, but never, it's a movie that simply has to be visa. No respectful movie fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph Waltz ... Oscar does not dare to ignore it !!
