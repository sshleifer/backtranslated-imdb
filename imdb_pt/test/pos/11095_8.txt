This story is based on the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daunton Lee. This fascinating story occurs around the time of Whitlam's dismissal, in which during his time as secretary of the TRW, Christopher had access to classified correspondence that admitted the involvement of the CIA in Australian political and trade union circles. The film shows several scenes involving Gough Whitlam (broadcast on US TV), where events take place confirming the secret documents Christopher had read earlier. The removal of Gough Whitlam was an organized coup by the CIA. Elsewhere in the film, it has been mentioned that most people have no idea about the level of deception that ultimately takes place to ensure that the US is used as a vehicle to promote certain policies at the request of all others . At the present time, nothing has changed. <br /> <br /> Christopher's life was deeply affected, read shocked, by his knowledge of what and how the CIA shapes foreign democracies, including the democracies of the allied nations to the United States. Christopher reacted, probably not in the best way at the time, by selling secret information to the Soviet Union, with Daunton Lee acting as his exchange student. Eventually Christopher and Daunton were captured and convicted of treason. <br /> <br /> On May 23, 1982, while serving time in the US prison, Christopher Boyce agreed to a single interview with Ray Martin of 60 Minutes Australia because it was the Australian connection that profoundly affected him. This caused a furor in the Australian media for about a week, then was stuffy. <br /> <br /> I liked the symbolism of the film of the hawk, and in it Chris was called Falcon, and Daunton, the Snowman (drug connection), but in reality the title "Falcon" was not something that was used by Chris. <br /> <br /> Christopher Boyce: Criminal or Man of Conscience? You decide. <br /> <br /> Resources: http://www.playitforwardoz.com/boyce.html
