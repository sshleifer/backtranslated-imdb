Before continuing with the new millennium, I will be back in time once more, because I had completely forgotten these precious stones !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 1987, Disney was still a "low" company. in the 80's, was able to start a series of movies on television called "Not Quite Human", about a nerd teenager who, as in "Inspector Gadget", looks like a human, but is really a robot !!!!! Now, this SCREAMS 80S, along with other films like "Tron" and "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids" because it combines everything from the past with the technologies of tomorrow !!!!! <br /> <br /> My parents remember seeing it on TV back then, when I was born or something. However, my first encounter with this movie was on the Old Disney Channel (once, I saw this, and the other parties on my 12th B'day in May 99 !!!!!) /> "Not Quite Human" is a good series of movies to watch, if you can find those movies again. <br /> <br /> Has this been shown recently? If so, give me an email or personal message. <br /> <br /> 10/10
