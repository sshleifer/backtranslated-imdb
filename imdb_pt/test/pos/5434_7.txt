Not every line of a comedy is funny. This film takes a serious issue, depriving voters of rights and keeps it light while telling jokes about it. It's the movie that the Daily Show would have done if they wanted to turn it into a movie. I found Robin Williams to be a lot funnier in this movie than he was in RV. And while my wife and I shared some opposing political views, we both found ourselves laughing through various parts of this film. The writers here could give Fox News some fair and balanced lessons. Lewis Black was well on his side, but he never seemed to be able to bring his particular brand of comedy to his role. Christopher Walken was also good, playing his quite common supporting role, pushing a story.
