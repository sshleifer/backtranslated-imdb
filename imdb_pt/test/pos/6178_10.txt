Centers in Czech pilots of WW2 ?? the older Frantisek, the impulsive Karel and, in the background, the discreet Honza, of piano. When the film begins, it is 1950, the war is over and Frantisek and Honza are trapped in an old monastery. In their native country, now controlled by the Soviets, they are "enemies of the people". Honza is severely mistreated by her fellow communists and dies. <br /> <br /> In 1939, many pilots managed to escape from German-occupied Europe and move on to England, where they joined the RAF. Despite their high motivation and experience, they face the reluctance of the RAF and the rigid British upper lip. Finally they fight gallantly in the battle of Britain. However, Frantisek and Karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall in love with the same woman. <br /> <br /> In terms of romantic sub-plot, this is very similar to Hollywood Pearl Harbor production. However, given the context of the film and the final destination of Frantisek, it is also possible to read the treatment given by the English to the two men as a symbol of the British treatment of the Czech and Polish pilots of the RAF: forgetting them properly once the war is over. In addition, the film is much less clich√© than Pearl Harbor and the characters are more fully realized. Dark Blue World also scores in terms of its impressive aerial combat, which was created seamlessly using a mix of models, live action footage from the 1969 epic The Battle of Britain. <br /> <br /> In short, Dark Blue World is a well-made, moving, thought-provoking and thought-provoking drama that drives Pearl Harbor mad. Highly recommended.
