It has the drama, thriller and character developments that you would appreciate if you enjoy dramas that engage you, entertain and educate. <br /> <br /> Writers know their material and show. The direction is always engaging and not blas√©, and the acting is great. Why this program did not win any awards tells me that the "powers that exist" in Hollyweird know no drama or more. <br /> <br /> There is a twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well interpreted. I'm glad it was not used as a shock scene for any climatic end of this series that would have been more typical and monotonous. Rent this series in one go! Let's hope it is brought back from the extinction of the celluloid.
