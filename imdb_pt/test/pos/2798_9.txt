Clich√©-avoidance is one of the main achievements of this film. When do you hear a vague outline of the story? Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing an apartment in Barcelona? you foresee a collection of European stereotypes in a farmer's tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a well-judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are a few minor roles observed in an excellent way (the arrogant French neurologist, the irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's desperate mother) and a great visual humor, especially in the opening scenes that mock the bureaucratic complexity of the signup process. So what does Xavier learn about relationships? Nothing positive. In place of a conventionally happy ending, is there a lamentably portentous ending about 'Identity' ?? Xavier became 'all the friends he made. However, this highly enjoyable film deserves its great success. I saw him in Luxembourg with a mixed Euro-audience, who enjoyed himself immensely and even applauded in the end.
