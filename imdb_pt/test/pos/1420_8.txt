A Brief History of Time is not just a documentary about the beginning and the end of the universal and of reality as we know it, it is a story about man and the genius known as Stephen Hawking. It is its history that reflects the history of time and change throughout the history of the universal. The style of the documentary / interview editing style begins and ends with a rapid black fade. Almost like flashing between segments and interviews, the documentary gives you a strange feeling as this is Stephen Hawking's point of view and not the camera eye. The execution time is just over an hour. It's a short story, then again, your subject could be spoken for days and days. An interesting and proud story.
