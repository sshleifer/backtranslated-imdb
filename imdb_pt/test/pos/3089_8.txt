Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary by German documentary filmmaker Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be heard with the commentary on. It is a visual feast of the imagery of North Africa (especially the Sahara) that is timeless. You just could not say that this was done more than thirty-five years ago. The film's soundtrack, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality. The narrative of three different German storytellers (German cinema historian Lotte Eisner, Eugen Des Montagnes and Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg) is solid, and Herzog talks about the importance of Eisner for this project, about himself and the history of cinema , but English The author of the translation, James William Gledhill, has a voice that seems downright deifying, which lends itself much more perfectly to this project, although much of the text - in any of the languages ​​- is superfluous. Yes, the false Biblical sounds of the myth of Creation vuh in the first part of the movie, Creation, are interesting, but the text that Herzog wrote for the two remaining parts (Paradise and the Golden Age), along with quotations from a poet German Herzog names like Manfred Eigendorf, almost looks like a satire of the somber tone of the first part. The film seems to have been assembled during the filming of several other Herzog projects simultaneously - the fictional Even Dwarfs Started Small, and the documentaries The Land Of Silence and Darkness and The Flying Doctors Of East Africa, but the material rejected by these projects only adds for the beauty of this film, as aerial scenes of a flamingo mating lake from afar that give someone a strange supernatural sense, which Herzog sings about in his commentary. This supernatural sensation has been present since the beginning of the movie of several planes landing on a desert lane, with their images increasingly blurred as the heat of the ground increases and increases the waves that distort the images. That this film was influential in Godfrey Reggio's Quatsi films is a euphemism. But while Reggio is content to just cast pictures for you, Herzog has a capacity that only American filmmaker Terrence Malick has: make a vocabulary totally independent of juxtaposition of images and words, and dependent on an emotion. first impulse. Analysis may fail when brought to such ventures. Herzog often does not understand why his art is great. The best he does often is totally unconscious and mesmeric. That's why his contempt for the Minor Common Denominator of Hollywood is openly stated in the commentary. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best illustration of this comes in a scene that, in the commentary, Herzog tells us, followed a severe drought in Cameroon. It shows the carcasses of the cattle, and Herzog describes the unbearable smell. However, the viewer can perceive all this from the images, the darkness of the dry portions of the sun of the animals and the bones stripped. However, even in this commentary, Herzog focuses on the bad smell, not on any deeper meaning. He is content to let you imbue and interpret what you want and his work, such as the almost erotically feminised forms of the sand dunes, reminiscent of a scene from Ingmar Bergman's Hour of the Wolf where Max Von Sydow becomes hand. The beautiful curves of Ingrid Thulin's naked body. But the archetypal image of the film, which symbolizes much of Herzog's career, is a mirage of a distant car driving from side to side on the surface of what appears to be a lake. It is profound, hypnotic, illusory, indescribable, supernatural, but real, just as Herzog, the believer who came from a family of militant atheists, is. But then, like everything else, it ends.
