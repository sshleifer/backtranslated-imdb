I saw this movie for the first time on TV in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of the Western, but I recognized Ben Johnson from the movie "Mighty Joe Young." What drew me to "Wagon Master" were the great songs sung by "Sons of the Pioneers". Merian C. Cooper, who produced the film, was the first to order original music to suit the mood of a specific scene and thus created the soundtrack of the modern movie. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic King Kong creation. Steiner later won an Oscar for the theme "Gone With the Wind." Cooper was also the producer of "Mighty Joe Young." If you remember, the song was important to the great monkey who would only respond to the sound of Stephan Foster's "Beautiful Dreamer." In 1947, Cooper would partner with John Ford, who directed. "Wagon Master." Of all the famous Ford westerns, this is my favorite, which features his brother Francis and a somber Janes Arness.
