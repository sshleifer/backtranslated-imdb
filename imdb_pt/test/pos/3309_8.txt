Nice movie that gives you romance, psychodrama of women on the edge, workplace, sexual harassment, adultery and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the longtime user, an employee who feels the need to be like this because she is with the big boys. Hope Lange is the ambitious entry-level maid whose determination to reach the top using her mind and not her body. Your personal life is the subplot. <br /> <br /> Wardrobe for the movie is great, but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairdresser that "a little bit will get you!" The amount of Brylcream in Stephen Boyd's hair is a distraction at times. Your character's relationship with Lange's character has never been fully developed, which I found disappointing. Overall, the movie is enjoyable. Rating: 8/10
