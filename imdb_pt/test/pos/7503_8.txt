George C. Scott gives his best and funniest with a wonderful drama also in this screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky. Diana Rigg is attractive and quite complicated. This film transitions between tragedy and chaos in a late 1960s New York hospital with disconcerting consequences. Barnard Hughes is delicious as always (great theater actor too). <br /> <br /> An 8 out of 10. Best Performance = George C. Scott. Chayesfsky was a big hit when he defeated Vanessa Redgrave at the 1978 Oscar ceremony, but he is a good writer. A truly set cast that does wonders, down to the smallest role. He won the best screenplay at the Oscars and Scott was nominated. He should have won for this instead of PATTON the previous year (which he was also brilliant). Look for this!
