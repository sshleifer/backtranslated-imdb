Rookie Owens Private trains the skills of Sgt Moore (Jack Webb) trainer. No explosions or bloodshed or soundtrack or sex. He is at the USMC training camp at Parris Island S.C. and most of the cast was from Marines. There are numerous memorable one-liners, and closing credit "dedicated to ..." is intense. With such strong male and female characters, this movie could not be made in today's sensitive world.
