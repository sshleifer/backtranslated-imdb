What makes this movie better than most movies is that it does not look fake. The film tells the story of the hot head director and his rise and fall and rise, using real names and recognizable events during the silent and early sound ages. Instead of the generic "sound will put us out of business", they actually show Jolson and "The Jazz Singer". The acting is indeed very good, with convincing performances by Don Ameche, Alice Faye and J. Edward Bromberg in particular.
