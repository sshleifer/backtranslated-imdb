I saw my video last night for the first time in at least ten years. I found the work itself and the performances as exciting as they were in my memory. George Hearn, of course, was the master of the role of Sweeney; there is never a touch of softness in his determination to take revenge on those he believes caused his wife's death and the disappearance of his daughter; at least not until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for revenge led him to murder his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex picture, such as Mrs. Lovett. She understood that Sondheim wanted this role to be some sort of "comical" counterpart to Sweeney; and even brings a bit of tenderness in his courtship with Sweeney and his boy Tobias creation. For those with long memories, this performance takes you back to their debut performances in The Picture of Dorian Gray and Gaslight; long before the murder, she wrote. Just a year ago I saw the musical at Chicago's Lyric Opera. with current opera star Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. Others commented on the operatic quality of the score. My conclusion is that "Sweeney" works best with actors who can at least deal with vocal lines, rather than with opera performers who have limited acting skills. As a final note, I commend the artist who portrayed Tobias. with their mixed loyalties and confusion about what is happening around them. It seemed appropriate that he had practically the last word.
