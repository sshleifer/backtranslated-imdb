My son Adam (5 years old) is a big fan of Scooby Doo. He really likes this movie. He particularly liked it when the Loch Ness monster tried to attack Shaggy and Scooby. The vote score is your choice and reflects your love for the characters. <br /> <br /> Having seen the movie "Vampire Rock" first, this, not surprisingly, was very similar, as they repeat a well-worn basic plot in one <br /> <br /> Few adults will come across with this without having your own memories of the TV cartoon series and less will still watch without children. You also like it or love it. I loved Scooby Doo for half an hour as a kid, I'm glad my son adore, I can only take it now.
