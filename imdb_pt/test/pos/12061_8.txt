I really like this series. his funny and unique style from outside the wall, sometimes controversial comedy, is a new insight into the genre. while it is a sitcom, stands out due to what could be strange matters. <br /> <br /> Every aspect has a comedy turn, and the show really is very good. My favorite part of the show is the rather strange comments from Dad, Dave. their speeches break the program and allow for a really good flow. is not perfect because sometimes the comedy is not funny, and the actors sometimes seem to be waiting for a response from the audience, but on the other hand, this show is good. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this program, and I'm very sorry for being canceled. please make another series, and complete this correctly
