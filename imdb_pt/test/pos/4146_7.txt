Where do I start. I say how great is cinematography. I commend certain scenes that show the creativity of the directors. Do I tell you how realistic the scenes are on Ellis Island? I must mention that, for a change, we do not have the cliche scene of seeing the Statue of Liberty. (So ​​far, the immigrants who see the statue of the ship's parapet are a cliché) <br /> <br /> Now, what's not nice, two important things, one is a modern soundtrack and not a good one to get started . <BR> Second and almost deadly, the film is boring, it moves so slowly that watching dry paint would be an improvement. <br /> <br /> The running time of 118 minutes is over and yet the movie seems unfinished. We do not see scenes of this family in the USA. Our hero mentions that he wants to find his twin brother, I would have liked scenes from his futile research, perhaps instead of other prolonged scenes. <br /> <br /> The film is almost a fault.
