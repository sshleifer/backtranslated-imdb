It is surprising that such a production is made today, especially for television. Considering the strong sexual themes and the explicit scenes of making love, not to mention lesbianism, was given an excellent treatment and direction. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes are impeccable, the direction is elegant and the characters are pleasant. There is a fair amount of humor, but it has surprisingly dark interludes. The protagonist is indeed a tragic figure, but not devoid of happiness. In addition, this production avoids the error most movies / programs make when dealing with homosexuality / lesbianism. The characters are very human. It seems that to allow people to feel comfortable watching gay and lesbian TV and movies, most programs fill it with cliches and leave the characters obsessed with being gay. Not so with that. In Tipping the Velvet, the protagonist hardly knows what it means to be a lesbian! <br /> <br /> The BBC has done some wonderful productions in the past, and this period of adventures only confirms its standard of excellence on all fronts.
