Ignore the bad reviews here, this movie is awesome! "Just Before Dawn" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget, if you have a dedicated team, decent script and a good idea for a movie. It is very fun. <br /> <br /> I liked it a lot more than most other slashers of the 80's because the killer is so unique. "Wrong Turn" ripped this movie out of something fierce! There's a lot of blood and scares. My girlfriend was terrified and she watches almost everything with me and does not back down. He has that shiver. <br /> <br /> I'd say "Just Before Dawn" is the best slasher of the '80s out there. I really liked that. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, kids.
