This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. I watched for about 20 minutes, a bit confused by what was happening. So I started laughing and did not stop long after the movie ended. This inexpressive satire is indeed rare. Christopher Guest has a true eye for the humor inherent in those who have no sense of humor about themselves (about 90% of heterosexual white men to begin with). As in "Waiting for Guffman", Guest sews America's self-important idiocy on the wall. I can not wait for his next movie.
