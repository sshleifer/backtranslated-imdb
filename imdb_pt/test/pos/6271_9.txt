This movie, Blade Master, can be cheap, awkward in appearance and sometimes is, but shares thoughts about problems that are far beyond the era in which this film takes place. Actor is the chosen one who has to protect the earth against a terrible weapon, this is compared in an unforgettable unforgettable way to the atomic weapon. He goes through obstacles like a shrewd character who is just more than muscle power, although he has a lot to do. I would say that this aspect of the film causes him to go beyond a movie like Conan, the barbarian, which is the least I can say without a brain. He does not diminish in any way the great adventure film that is Conan, but gives to Actor his health that he does not share with the barbarian. For a low-budget movie, this movie does well in terms of set-up and fights are mostly believable. Zor, the villain, has as prisoner throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological confrontations that give tension to the film, even though Actor seems very suitable for the task to be lost. <br /> <br /> What gives this movie a little extra are those scenes that may seem strange but worth mentioning. The fight with the serpent god, despite being a gigantic puppet, is well treated since the snake, with good lightning bolts, remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. The movie climaxes in a very unusual, rather anachronistic, but breathtaking way: the sequel to the deltaplane. The scene itself is not introduced correctly, it is not read at all, where Actor got that machine, it is rather unconvincing, but leads to a really beautiful and poetic sequence of poetics, which independently, is the culminating point in the film, raising Actor in a place where few heroes of human fantasy went. <br /> <br /> If Blade Master is not among the great great films of all time it is no surprise because of his faults, it is a big surprise considering the philosophical way he chooses in the confrontation between good and evil , the truth speaks and shows the heart, that this film is so unwanted. I suggest this to all fans of the genre and try to take it seriously as a clever film that should be taken more seriously than it seems.
