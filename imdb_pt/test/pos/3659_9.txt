The opening night of the 'South Asian International Film Festival' (SAIFF) in New York was an event that many of us were expecting. <br /> <br /> Would I finally watch 'Hari Om' ?? I was tired of watching "promo" in a loop and the lingering taste of the song Angel by Nitin Sawhney on promo, left me begging to hear the rest. I was impressed by the look? and tremendously curious about how the car rickshaw driver looking stout would win the hearts of the French tourist looking stunning stunning! I remember being rather intrigued by the theme, when I read a line or two about it in the papers, a long time ago! Especially since I personally had been very fascinated a few years ago, by how extravagant the jinriquixas in Jodhpur were! The snow and crowds outside the theater just added to my anxiety. <br /> <br /> Once inside the theater, I discovered that the SAIFF organizers only had a disaster. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed by how badly the event was organized and I found myself at a difficult spot, trying to explain and apologize to my (mixed nationalities) friends that I had invited on the VIP guest list. I was hoping to prove to them that Indian cinema was not always about Bollywood? Eventually and FINALLY, the movie started sending some fresh air on our way. Or so I thought? Hari Om ?? It started with chaos and noise. Authorickshaws honking, traffic and a lot of chaos. I found myself smiling when I felt a "house" feeling filling inside me. <br /> <br /> So began the journey of Hari Om ?? a self-rickshaw driver in Jaipur ?? The director could not have done a better cast selection with this character. Wedding Monsoon to Hari Om? Vijay Raaz, despite his non-hero appearance, carries this film only in his acting skills and his opinion of the character, replete with all the nuances of a rickshaw driver in Rajasthan. He is a winner all the way. But how and where he learned to speak English even though fluently, is the question! However, your character portrays beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity. I love the innocent portrait of a simple guy from a village? who has big aspirations to be famous someday? and still knows when to cut reality. <br /> <br /> Camille, on the other hand, enters the film wearing clothes that NOBODY would not dare use in a place like this. It's funny, though, that no one seems to care much about her dressed like that. She looks very stunning though! Especially in the second half of the movie, when she switches to the Indian costume. Her relationship with her boyfriend, however, seems very vague. This probably increases the touch of the reality of certain types of relationships. <br /> <br /> Does the movie take us through the most beautiful parts of Rajasthan ?? The amazing part is that none of the places has been pictured anything beyond what they REALLY are. You see the dirt, do you see the primitive houses? you see Rajasthan exactly the way it is !! Still ?? Is there only one adjective that leaves you with? 'pretty'. <br /> <br /> This is the first director who probably knows how to portray India exactly as it is - with the dirt, noise and all the negatives that India is bound! However, making it look like one of the most beautiful places to be. Kudos! for him for this. <br /> <br /> The only disadvantage of the movie that I could see, is the rhythm? Did I find it a bit slow in certain parts? but rest assured that you will never be bored. <br /> <br /> Nitin Sawhney's background notes add an international and Indian flavor to the film. The song "Angel", which touches on a crucial moment of the film, blends beautifully with the visuals. <br /> <br /> I also heard that in addition to the main characters, all other actors are actually just normal people. who had never faced a camera before !! This is commendable considering, most of our so called established actors ?? it is still not possible to portray realistic characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> All in all, was watching this movie a beautiful experience? It's a pot of emotions. Do you have romance, humor? realism?? beautiful visuals and places ..., good music, a great cast ?? A PACKAGE! When I left the theater did I feel proud of being Indian? A few days later, I asked one of my Bulgarian friends who watched the film with me, if he would like to watch another Indian movie? and your answer was? "It's better than Hari Om? If it is, then will I?" "If not, I think I'll move on." Hari Om will now be the reference for every Indian film I see. " Mr. Bala, are you reading?
