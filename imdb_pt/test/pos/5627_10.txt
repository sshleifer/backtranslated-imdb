The subject of this film is potentially depressing: a man in his thirties, unemployed, poorly educated, three children from a failed relationship, living in his parents' house but dreaming of directing feature films. But about half an hour after the movie, you realize that Mark Borchardt has an endless supply of motivation and ambition - it's just that everything is channeled to his need to direct movies, and nothing else will make him happy. The movie jumps across the emotional spectrum, but in the end you leave happy because you just met some wonderful people. Go see this - you'll end up wishing it were longer.
