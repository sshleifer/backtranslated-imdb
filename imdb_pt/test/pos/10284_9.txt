An obsessive love story where the characters were extremely convincing. I think this movie highlights the talent of professional actors. Especially for Vincent Cassel, who (at the time it was filmed) would not be the first character you think of in such a role. And yes, he managed to seduce the beautiful Monica Belluci, in addition to the film, during this creation. I can only say that this movie should have been released in the US, instead of thinking about doing a remake. It's just so French, almost perverted ... and yet so true ... this film must remain untouched ... <br /> <br /> A director who should definitely have more projects, since this type of subject requires right amount of ingredients to not make it a failure ..
