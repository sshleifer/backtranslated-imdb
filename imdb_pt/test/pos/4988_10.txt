It's also the best book I've ever read. Karl Urban and Steve Zahn are great together. It had drama, adventure, and sweetness and sorrow. I laughed. I cried. It's hard not to laugh when Gus is talking. I wish Gus had hit Clara like he did Inez. Clara only takes Gus in all those years with no intention of marrying him. She just liked to play with him. It was sad that he spent his whole life yearning for it. It would have been nice if Woodrow had married Maggie, but she would have died anyway. Woodrow was a man who could not express his feelings and kept them bottled up. It was obvious that he loved Maggie after the attack in Austin when the guards returned and he ran to embrace her. Val Kilmer is excellent at playing strange characters. I loved his picture of the Captian Inish Skull. I loved the whole Lonesome Dove saga. Comanche Moon is the best of the group.
