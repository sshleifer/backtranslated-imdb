Oz is undoubtedly my favorite show of all time! the best word to describe is "genius"! the writing, the acting, the stories ... everything about this show is absolutely incredible! <br /> <br /> I just discovered the show and became addicted to it right away and was really surprised that it did not get the recognition it really deserves. It's violent, and most characters are not for you to like them, but the show is written so brilliantly that it lets you see beyond violence and criminals and see them as real people. They are the lowest forms of slag but still find a way to let you understand many of the characters and even worry about their stories. <br /> <br /> Violence in the series is necessary to make it as realistic as possible, but the show is not about violence as some people may believe. It's really a work of art and I'm sure someone who has a chance will love it as much as I do.
