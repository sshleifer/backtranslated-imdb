I've never seen a movie have a worse launch than that. And that's a pity, since this is the funniest movie of the year! You might think that an ad with the line "From the Director of" Office Space "" would be enough to ensure great publicity! But there are no ads, there are no posters, there is no website, I doubt the stars even knew it came out this weekend. What is 20th Century Fox thinking? Mike Judge's science fiction comedy is set in 2505, but it can come true in about 10 years (if things stay as they are). Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph froze in a secret army experiment and woke up to a future full of consumers retreating innate from zombies. The movie reminds me of "Sleeper" by Woody Allen, "RoboCop", "Planet of the Apes", "Blade Runner" and "Network" and the late "Futurama". Try to see before Fox burns all the prints!
