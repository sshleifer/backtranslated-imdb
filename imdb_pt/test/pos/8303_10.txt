I think this is a great classic monster movie for the family. The mole, what a machine! The tall creature with the beak, the green lizards flying, Ranthorincus / mayas or whatever they are and the monkey men's things speak telepathically to them. The battle of the men in rubber suits fighting for a doll at breakfast umm! tasty! Class, what else can I say? How would they do a 2002 remake of this?
