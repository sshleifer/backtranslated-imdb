Of course, most people will designate "Island of the Fishmen" as silly and bland, but can you honestly name another movie that brings out these exciting themes? This Italian gem represents pure entertainment and features things like voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutant creatures, the mysterious continent of Atlantis, treasure hunt, a remote island full of deadly traps and totally crazy scientists! All this and more in a simple movie? Yes please! Fair opponents of Italian horror movies can easily mark this film as a cheap exploration version of "The Island of Dr. Moreau", but the truth is that this is so much more! "Island of the Fishmen" delivers thrills and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and surprisingly stylish camera work. The story opens promisingly with a small group of prisoners, survivors of a wreck, washing a tropical island. They meet the sadistic Edmond Rackham, who rules a native tribe and a legion of genetically engineered amphibian monsters that live in the marshes of the island. There are so many extra twists and sub-plots in the story that it's almost impossible to write a resume, but, believe me, this gem is worth checking out. Sergio Martino once again proves that he is an ingenious filmmaker who has the talent to be mental and creative at the same time. It makes a great use of the beautiful island location and also the interior sets look very impressive. The stunning underwater scenery and imaginative setting actually elevates this film well above normal exploitation standards of the late 1970s. I do not quite understand why Roger Corman reworked both the original and launched it on the American market under a different title (" Screamers "), because there are very few elements open for improvement. The cast members are all Sergio Martino's regular (with the exception of the great Joseph Cotton, which is a supporting rule) and make great presentations. If you can get your hands on the newly restored German version, you will receive fifteen minutes with no extra cuts. Look!
