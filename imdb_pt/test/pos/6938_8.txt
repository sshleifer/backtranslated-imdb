Todd Sheets, of Do-It-Yourself indie horror, returns with another fun and atrocious knockout in the video, which is basically just a faint excuse to use a lot of watery blood and guts guts as fast as possible. A demonic demonic scarecrow resuscitates the dead as voracious and rotten zombies, so they can delight in the living. A bunch of quarrelsome college kids, a trio of dangerous convict fugitives led by the evil Slade (Byron Nichodemus to an outrageous degree), two equally savage thugs and a trio of hot sisters, all have to do their best to survive. this harrowing ordeal. This is for the plot unnecessarily confusing and confusing, but fortunately, what this hilarious and horrendous joke lacks narrative consistency (abundance) more than makes up for with a pleasant plethora of glorious and coarse content. The disgusting highlights include a woman having her fingers cut off, a fatal shot in the groin of a young girl, attempted necrophilic rape, gutting and, of course, eating more repulsive food than you can shake off a pile of damp bowels. In addition, we also have a rough, gritty cinematography that alternates between faded color and grimy black and white, unspeakable fighting scenes, lousy performances of a uniformly pathetic and nameless cast (Jerry Angell in particular, police officers, the top crummy thespic). dishonors his ridiculously abysmal histrionics like Joe Bob), a trash metal soundtrack, and a generic synthesizer soundtrack. Let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumble into some jars of bacteria that eat meat to use in the hordes of undead. Of course, this movie is pure, but it has an abominable quality, which in turn makes it a lot of fun for terrorist fanatics.
