These types of movies simply do not get the credit they deserve. This is my second favorite movie of all time, (Stand By Me being 1st). The reason I watched this movie was because Wil Wheaton was in it and he is my favorite person in the whole world and I think he did an amazing job that movie and Sean Astin as well. I watched it last night and it surprised me. Everything in the movie is very exceptional. The script, the acting, the script. I was on the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mother was not in the room, I would have gotten rid of it when Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) died. I did not expect this !! Not at all !! I was really surprised when I learned that it was not very popular in the 90's. I was born a few years after it came out, of course, I did not go to theaters, but I'm sure it would have been alive. If any of my friends watched this, they'd be like, "uhh okay?" but that's just because it's not cool enough to enjoy work like this. If you have not seen this movie, or are looking to watch something that is the bomb, this is the movie for you to watch.
