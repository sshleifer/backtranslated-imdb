One of the most bizarre and scary horror movies of the '70s, "Tourist Trap" even for the weak, convention-free standards that defy the conventions of "worth all" of their time rates like a real weirdo. However, it is the very strangeness of the image - a masterfully mounted atmosphere of supernatural dread perversely out of order which, from the outset, registers itself as frighteningly scary and becomes increasingly opaque and frightening as the film progresses, offering ample shocks among some. scattered moments of a subtly enchanting elegance that ends in a bitterly ironic, overwhelmingly nihilistic note with an astonishing final image that is hard to shake - making it a unique and singularly disturbing experience. <br /> <br /> Five teenagers traveling through the desolate California desert by car are desperately lost. They come across "Lost Oasis of Slausen," a decaying dip on the road that is a gas station, three parts of the wax museum and all parts full of cracks and forebodings. The solitary, seemingly unfriendly and inoffensive joint owner, Slausen (suffocated exaggeratedly with the contagious hammy brio of Chuck Conners) turns out to be a demented psychic killer with lethal telekinetic powers. Slausen brings his strange collection of uncomfortably human dummies to life and chooses his children one by one so he can add them to his growing collection of victims. Director David ("Puppermaster", "The Arrival") Schmoeller manipulates every last drop of tension he can extract from the extremely ambiguous and open script he co-wrote with J. Larry Carroll. (The stubborn refusal of the script to provide a rational excuse for all the bizarre things that permeate the film, often mistakenly criticized as one of the film's major weaknesses, is actually the key force in the film, giving the image of something scary and all - it may happen, the common logic of being a real nightmare come horribly into life would never have been achieved had there been some kind of reliable explanation for what is going on.) Donaggio pin is very discreet, Nicholas the somber cinematography of Von Sternberg and Robert A. Burns' stunted and grimy production design contribute immensely to the film's deeply disturbing mood. Outstanding performances are another significant advantage, with the handsome and joyful Jocelyn Jones (Ellie-Jo Turner in "The Big Texas Dynamite Hunt") particularly fine and gentle as the most resilient and likable of teenagers in danger of extinction. Even Tanya Roberts does well as an unlucky girl with a levitated knife on her head. Unusual and unusual, "Tourist Trap" is worth a visit.
