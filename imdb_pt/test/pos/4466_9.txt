I tend to be furious over Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Often he is categorized as a filmmaker without talent, just to shock and disgust the entire audience with images of pure blood. It is true that his films contain more imbeciles and diseases more explicit than conventional American production, but his films are always wide-ranging and the plot is terribly morbid. Do not torture a duckling is more a story! This movie is a pure jewel of Italian shock cinema! I easily dare call this movie a masterpiece? It is an old-fashioned giallo that includes all the bright aspects of genuine horror. The film shows the quest for an inhuman serial killer in a small Italian mountain town. The bodies of three boys are found, horribly mutilated. There are many pseudo-crazy ones in town, but every track leads nowhere. Among the suspects are a greedy bum and a scary woman, obsessed with witchcraft and voodoo. As a true mentor, Fulci knows how to find the right and scary tone for his film. It portrays the small town as a claustrophobic and inescapable setting of macabre events, backed by a dizzying soundtrack. Fulci also develops as a genius of stories here. The script is always one step ahead of you and the complex plot will deceive you more than once. In other words, this is a single giallo (murder mystery of terror). The blood is not presented as grotesque and explicit as in Lucio's later landmarks (among them the legendary Zombie 2, The Beyond and New York Ripper), although there are still some nauseating and difficult to watch sequences of shock. <br /> <br /> Do not torture a duckling is the most convincing and effective achievement that Lucio Fulci has ever presented and that easily ranks among the greatest Italian horror films ever made. Right next to the works of Mario Bava and Dario Argento. The film is fascinating from beginning to end, some aspects of the plot are alarmingly realistic and the tension is always an adrenaline rush! A must see for horror fans and an absolute must for Italian shooters!
