I remember seeing this movie when it was released and I still remember the 'buzz' I felt when I left the movies. Everything about this movie is magnificent! The music is top notch and I still play the soundtrack after all these years. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so many times and yet I have yearned to watch it several times. Nicholas Cage was great and whenever I see Cameron Dye in anything nowadays, I always associate him with this movie. It's too bad that the rest of the cast has not gone through bigger things, but maybe that's part of the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to make a film school criticism, since I'm sure all analysts out there may find fault if they wanted to, but what I'm going to say is that this movie defined my adolescence and still continues to influence my life more than 20 years later. The movie 'looks' great and stirs up emotions when you watch it (well ... it did for me) and I can not recommend it enough to anyone who has not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> You also 'Get' the movie or you do not! Those of you who 'understand' will be rewarded with a unique movie experience.
