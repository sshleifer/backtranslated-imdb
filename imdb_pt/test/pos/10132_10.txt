Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr., who performed perfectly in this film. It's a comforting story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we care. I think there was a lot of realism with the characters. The writer did not incorporate racism into the film in a way that most movies do, which I thought would create a more realistic story. <br /> <br /> Writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism, but often go to sea. <br /> <br /> There are so many cities like this where people of different races live harmoniously. Ed Harris should have been nominated for an Oscar for being great as a leader and trainer, a realist as a father, and an affectionate side in helping Radio.
