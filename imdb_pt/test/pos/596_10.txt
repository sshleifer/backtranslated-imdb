I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with Sesame street muppets and then realized how much effort and time it took to bring these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a master genius and muppeteer. When I watched this movie the other day, it took me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler. For this time travel I rate this movie as 10. The plot explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. Laughter and jokes are classic muppetismo. I'm glad these movies are still out there for the next generation. I hope the magic of the puppets never goes away.
