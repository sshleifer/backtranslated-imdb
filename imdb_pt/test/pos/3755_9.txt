Thanks to a fellow member of IMDb, I was able to watch this movie for the second time in almost twenty years, and I can honestly say that it has not lost anything. I can not believe that Channel 4 has let this disappear without a trace, since it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic view of the consequences of lost loyalty. <br /> <br /> He focuses on a group of friends over ten years and his relationship with two 'strangers' from the school; specifically how they use one and relentlessly torment the other. As the events of the past and the present unfold, the tension becomes ever thicker, not unlike Shane Meadows's excellent revenge shroud Dead Man's Shoes. The acting, the writing and the direction are very bold for 1983 and still today they accumulate despite the high accents of the crust of the central personages. Yes, it can be set in public school, but it is worlds apart from anything done by Merchant Ivory; I have a state education and I can still draw countless parables from the story. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you will remember for a long time if you see it - except that you probably will not, because Channel 4 (or FilmFour) chose to bury it. On their own official website, they describe it as "an inexplicably neglected gem of the early days of Channel 4" - ignored by whom? This was one of the first films on Channel 4 (later to become FilmFour thanks to the success of films like Trainspotting), so somewhere someone still has to have the master print. These days, where you can get DVDs with more or less collector content, it's a bit unstable that they can not give a movie as good a promotion as it deserves. <br /> <br /> So if one of Channel 4's production minions is reading this, stop making programs that show people humbling themselves in the hope of getting a deal with the tabloids, pursue that movie and pick a good birthday special. edit disk or something, please!
