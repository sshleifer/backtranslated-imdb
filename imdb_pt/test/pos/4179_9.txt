That this movie failed at the box office, and still fighting for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - but in a way quite appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed in making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on the screen. To so brutally destroy his carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to The Beatles is brave enough to be reckless, as well as the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (literally) in the film itself. artificially. The Monkees television series was not so conventional, but the HEAD is totally without plot ... although in the end there is some kind of circular logic for all this. Uncontrolled by a genuine plot, the surreal sequence of events is hilarious and quite disturbing. The biggest irony is that the Monkees effectively signed their death warrant as a commercial force at a time when they were reaching their artistic peak. His exploration in psychedelia reached its apogee with HEAD's soundtrack (all songs are memorably woven in the film), which is one of the reference albums of the sixties. The Monkees began to disintegrate after the box office failure of this film, but the HEAD serves as a noble legacy.
