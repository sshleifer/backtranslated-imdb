This is a very unusual movie that starts with a rich guy getting a new sports car for graduation and decides to take a ride in the local town. Rich boy meets a poor girl in 'Mabels Diner' who is a waitress and the local boyfriend gets very upset and starts a fight. There is a car chase and all sorts of problems seem to occur and the rich boy and the poor boy end up having to do community service as ordered by the city judge. The rich boy and the poor boy just do not get along and the rich boy wins the heart and soul of the poor boy's girlfriend. There are plenty of walks in the woods and poetry is quoted and some very deep thoughts about life. Poor Girl says, "Some people go through life and never find Love, I can say that I've found love and I'm clinging to it." You will need some tissue if it is sensitive, there are many romantic scenes and I doubt very much if you guess how this photo will end. The producer and director got a good idea and finally put an end to a movie. If you like real life stories with poetry and very sensitive subjects, this is your movie.
