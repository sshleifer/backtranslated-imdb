I loved this movie, independent movie at its best. The cinematography, rhythm, rhythm and acting were perfectly in sync. Fred Carpenters best work to date! The film is well written with many twists and turns that lead to a great ending. It moves well and keeps you engaged. Being a photographer, I was very impressed with the cinematography. the lighting creates humor and a beauty that is usually found in a much larger budget film. This gave the actors a great screen to start, to work their magic. And that's exactly what they did! Great performances from all the actors and from each of them were well cast in their roles. As I said at the beginning, the film is wonderful and one of the best Fred Carpenter films. You will love.
