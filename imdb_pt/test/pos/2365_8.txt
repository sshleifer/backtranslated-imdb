Great comedy from the 80's comic strip in the South West of England. It's a story of sex, drugs, teas and murders by the sea. Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Planer (hilarious in drag) and Robbie Coltrane play a role. Dennis (Edmondson) tries to impress the girlfriend, claiming that he is involved in a million-pound drug deal. This leads to complications with hilarious results. I'm trying to figure out the proportion of the original image for this movie, but it does not appear in "Technical Aspects" of the IMDb site. I saw the DVD in the store and it seems to be in the 1.33: 1 format (full screen). Was the film filmed in that proportion or was it originally a widescreen movie with a panoramic and a DVD scan? It would be helpful to know how I hate pan and scan movies. So come on IMDb. Could you find out for us?
