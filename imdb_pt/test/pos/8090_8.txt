This was Charlie Chaplin's first movie. Yes, there was a bit of sound and speech inserted in his previous film, MODERN TIMES, but it was still essentially a silent film. So it was not until 1940 that the audience heard Chaplin speak in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. While I liked the movie, I was not as impressed with it as Chaplin's other full-length movies of the mid-1920s and '30s. That's because I really felt uncomfortable with Chaplin's over-action when he played Adenoid Hynkel - especially when he was giving his speeches. The silly pseudo-dialogue looked similar to something a smaller comedian would have used (like the Three Stooges). Also, playing a funny Hitler is difficult for me. <br /> <br /> However, when Chaplin played the Jewish barber, he was not especially funny (he really did not mean to be a funny character), but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency. This movie should not be remembered as a comedy (especially because it does not stand out there), but for its outstanding acting and humanity. The barber's final speech (representing Hynkel) is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes. Watch the movie for this reason alone.
