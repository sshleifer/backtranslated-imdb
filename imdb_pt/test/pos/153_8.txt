Now that I saw it, it was not what I was expecting, at least not until the end. I read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this one from Amazon and I was glad I did. Having first been introduced to Park's work via Oldboy, I was curious as to how he treated the genre and was quite pleased with the clever way he executed it. I think Park has matured in terms of presentation, because while Oldboy and some of his other works have a very good and deliberate camera work, he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I had not seen in other vampire movies. For example, the scene in which Father Hyeon is noticing the "beast" growing inside him as he gives his shoes to the ever-bare Tae-ju and he is able to see the blood pumping through the skin of Tae-ju and his eye widening in lust for blood for it. That was a good effect. I was also happy that Park did not shit the CG of the movie and that, in fact, is very little CG. I left Bakjwi being fully prepared to think that something was going to happen and be taken for a walk in the true fashion of the Park. Also, I liked the fact that Park played with a bit of symbolism and reversal, whereas we generally do not realize that this is the cinema in Asia. During the beginning of the movie, we see the plot unfold slowly and meet the characters, and you feel like an invisible observer of the thing that is happening. Park treats you a bit like the future of the Ghost of Christmas coming show you, albeit a little annoying, how life is out of your world. Ah, but then we began to feel a bit of kinship with the fading father and his growing lust for Tae-ju and conflict with duty as a priest. We almost started to cheer for them until Park did not bring us back so well to reality and we actually see that in the end Bakjwi is a film about moral dilemma and right and wrong. I will not ruin it if I tell you to watch Bakjwi from the mentality of a priest and I think you will get out of it with what Park wants you to leave. Do not expect Oldboy and styling, because that's not what you'll get here. A very interesting approach to the genre. Those who lost MANY literary elements and religious allusions watched some other film, not Bakjwi. After Bakjwi, watch Let The Right One IN, neither is what you expect.
