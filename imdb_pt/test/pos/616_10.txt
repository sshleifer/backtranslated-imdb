I'm just beginning to explore the wonderful world of Monsieur Ozon. I've only seen 4 movies so far, and with the last one in line it occurred to me that they were all really about lonely women and their actions. Not a single female non solitary character of 12 years, and they all have a strong impact around. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the only one (of four) where this impact is good. The gay theme is an almost normal part of the background of the Ozon films, so it does not pick up the accent (though the characters look the way they look). Pay attention to feelings, not your objects. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant and fleeting, truly like a summer romance, and although it is a relaxation for thought and mind, it gives a little food to the soul.
