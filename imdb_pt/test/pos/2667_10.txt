For all those perplexed with the duration and pace of this movie ("how, why does it show spaceships bundling by, like, 15 minutes?"), Here's a word you might want to think about: Beauty. <br /> <br /> Beauty is an understated concept. Of course, you will often see cool pics and so on in movies. But when did you last see a movie that contains beauty purely because of it? There is a strange belief among moviegoers that anything that is not related to a plot or character should be removed. This is depressing bullshit. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the plot of the movie. A director can show 15 minutes of spacecraft for no reason other than being beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so. '2001' requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch movies. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experiment with beautiful and strange images without feeling guilty about not having a complex plot or detailed characterization. Do not get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they are not the best and the end of everything. There are different types of movies, and to enjoy '2001' you should tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, pure beauty, free from the banal conventions of everyday movies. <br /> <br /> "All art is completely useless" - Oscar Wilde.
