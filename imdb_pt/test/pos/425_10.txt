I'm fed up with a series of young, ignorant people talking about their "problems" all the time, egocentric, boring, and utterly annoying (Popular, Dawson's Creek, Beverly Hills, etc). "Hack" is a breath of fresh air with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different storyline, reliable people with real problems (thank goodness !!) and very, very good stories. I just love it !! I hope "Hack" continues for a long time, because it's a great television series for adults, for a change.
