I love this movie .... one of my all time favorites !!! This was the first big-screen movie that my mother took me to see when I was 9 years old. I recommend it to all African Americans. This story is about love, confidence, challenges and everyday life of a black family. All the actors worked well together. I wanted it to be on video, but so far, it's not available that I know of. I caught on television a few years ago, and recorded it, so whenever I feel like watching ... I have! The soundtrack is amazing too! Unmissable!
