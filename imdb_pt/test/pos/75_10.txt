This often slandered movie is a must for fans of Blake Edwards, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini or Hollywood musicals. Other writers have commented on the changes in tone, the confusion of the plot, etc., but the film has many things to recommend it. The score is one of the best of Henry Mancini (and he has written many wonderful ones), several songs are sung to perfection by Andrews, Julie's performance is subtle and she is dressed in beautiful clothes (she is absolutely lovely here), the photos on-site are breathtaking, and there are some funny gags in sight of Inspector Clouseau. Rock Hudson basically phoned in his performance, but he's reasonably good. A real curiosity item in what was the last great film that Julie made for about 10 years and in many ways is a precursor to Victor / Victoria. It's beautiful to look at and listen to. When will it be available on DVD ??? When it is, I would at least like both versions - the longer and shorter the cut of the director. Since being satirized in S.O.B., they would make a great package of two!
