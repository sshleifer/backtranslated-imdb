Okay, everyone agreed on the best season. The first. And killing Boone was a bad decision. Also killing others was bad. Blame the directors and writers for it. Bad Boys. BUT. I still think this is the best scifi series of all time! Sorry guys, I can not help it! I see that the quality of the series was declining after the first season. Yet it's easy to accept Liam as the new main character if you're on top of Boone. He's really ... mysterious. The thing that shocked me most was when Lilli was written out of history and how. This was something she did not deserve! And what did we gain? Some blonde girl named Renee, with absolutely no character! But these Taelons remain mysterious, and you wonder if they are real plans to the end. Real suspension. The conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant. <br /> <br /> I understand that when you enter an episode of the 3rd, 4th or 5th season, you may not understand this show. But when you watch from the beginning, you just can not let go! <br /> <br /> The acting is great, the special FX is wonderful, the music is beautiful and the plot is intriguing. I have to see this, people!
