When I went to see this documentary about the communist block musicals, I was expecting something totally insane, like a communist Cop Rock. Some scenes were recorded, including a clip from a Soviet film called "Tractor Drivers". <br /> <br /> Do you think the filmmakers were given the task of making ideologically correct musicals that sing, dance and adopt the Party line. face insurmountable odds. And yet, one of the surprises of "East Side Story" is that some of the films presented looked promising. One was a mid-1950s East Germany effort called "My Wife Wants to Sing", in which, as the title indicates, an unhappy hausfrau seeks to launch a singing career over the objections of her traditional husband. <br /> Another genuinely interesting film, also from East Germany, was called "Midnight Revue". In this film-in-a-movie, the producers falsify their own creative situation with the history of a group of filmmakers under the orders of the Party to make a musical. (The filmmakers themselves are able to make a musical number about avoiding "very hot" subjects reminiscent of the tone of the 1957 Silk Stockings movie.) <br /> <br /> The documentary is marked by a somewhat insipid narration . , but it's still a lot of fun to watch. (Look for the ultimate dedication to the person who made it all possible.)
