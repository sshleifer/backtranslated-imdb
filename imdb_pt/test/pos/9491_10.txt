I bought my first Zep album in 1974 (at age 17) and got hooked ever since. This DVD now occupies a prominent place in my music collection. It is not often that a band has 4 virtuosos in its formation, but here we can. Each member made their own contribution to the band, but on stage together, the electricity they generated was larger than the 4 individuals. This masterpiece covers the entire career of the band, from Led Zep 1 to Coda, and this is captured magnificently on this DVD, as each show shows how the band has become more and more over the years. My copy recently disappeared, but I'm happy to say that it was found in my 17-year-old son's room, while the new generation discovers how great these guys were. This is a must have for anyone who has an appreciation of rock music. Long live Led Zeppelin.
