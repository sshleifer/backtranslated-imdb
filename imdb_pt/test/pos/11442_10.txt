This film probably gave me the most pleasant surprise I've ever seen. It was not a big budget production and its premise, middle-aged amateur jazz musicians having an unexpected professional engagement at a resort like the Catskills, seems quite modest. What is not modest is the success of the film. This is a little slice movie of life that is more fun everywhere. Director Frank D. Gilroy also wrote the script and is filled with interesting subplots and unexpected twists. <br /> <br /> Actors are the craftsmen who do a solid job. The biggest revelation for me was Cleavon Little. He plays a professional musician who is hired to fill a sick band member. His attitude immediately collides with others. While they see it as an opportunity for great fun and a unique thing in life, he sees it as his job and not as something particularly interesting. This leads to conflict, but when the group gets in trouble, it drives them. Little, who died very young, really showed me that he was a great actor with this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real sleeper, the kind that a movie fan always hopes to discover. I recommend it with all my heart.
