The majesty of the second feature of Ramin Bahrani is that, like the work of a poet, he portrays the very soul of humanity and allows it to flourish on the screen. In addition to the scope of most other independent films, CHOP SHOP is wise, exuding the best of the great movies of the ages; we can look at the works of Bresson and Pasolini and compare the work of Bahrani with theirs, and yet CHOP SHOP is fresh and urgent for modern society. Can we see a master working here? a certain sense of beauty, style and content merge into a film that reminds us of what it means to be alive. Instead of focusing on the NYC side, we often see, live and breathe with our young hero, Alexander, in the destitute Willits Point? a fascinating quasi-sub-world of our culture? and it's still a very, very real place. Trying to stay afloat, Alejandro has to support himself and his older sister. Watch this movie and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that Bahrani takes us toward ?? all with deep and concise realism.
