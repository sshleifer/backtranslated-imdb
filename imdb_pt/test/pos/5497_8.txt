Clint Eastwood is a big hit in this thriller since 1993. Equipped with an absolute master of suspense, Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood delivers as much as he can. Likewise, John Malkovich is on my list of most effective villains in movie history. like the insane killer. Like Rene Russo as Clint's love interest, I think Kirk Douglas said best when referring to his career: "I keep getting older, and my top women keep getting younger." very effective thriller with enough twists and surprises to keep him going.Eastwood and Peterson must bond more often. Top quality movie.
