Look at being Anglo-Irish, I assure you that this reviewer is anything but Bias. But I assure you that this is an Irish film - not English, as the last comment seems to have suggested. This film was written by Neil Jorden and Conor McPherson and directed by Conor McPherson as well - both Irish. The cast is almost entirely Irish - was filmed in Ireland with an Irish team. Even Michael Gambon was born in Ireland - I remember him joking about it in an interview about this movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Cane was evidently brought in to raise outside box office revenue. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie, I just wanted to correct a totally uninformed comment! <br /> <br /> Now, with the review - I loved Dylan Moran, I was always a fan of him, he himself and Michael Cane formed a surprisingly good couple Aja. It was great to see Morans as an actor while he played several different characters during the movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in comedy - as it represents a new, quirky and inventive twist on Irish laughter films. I laughed a lot. What more could you ask for?
