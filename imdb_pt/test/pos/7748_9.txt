I thought this movie was really good. It was at TCM (Turner Classic Movies) at three in the morning and his eccentric humor kept me awake until five in the afternoon. Kelly performs wonderfully in this role, especially with her grandmother (whose joke almost made me laugh at my place). The lead actress was fine, but the father was able to keep his character isolated from the marriage conflict and kept the mood coming. If you like a good old movie, I recommend it. Unlike the other comment, I like Gene Kelly. He was the perfect lead actor for many of the early musicals and I think in this role, he exudes his charisma. A disadvantage is that the dance scenes get a little tiring, but if you can get through them, it will be clear.
