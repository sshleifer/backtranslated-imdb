One of the greatest French hits of the year 2002, "l'auberge espagnole" was also very well received abroad, which is extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons for this success. This film made by one of the most interesting French filmmakers of recent years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students from all over Europe and gathered under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described as those you imagine or see in everyday life: either sloppy, serious or with a sense of humor. I think if the film worked so well, it's because many students must have recognized themselves in the portraits of the main characters and especially those of Xavier. <br /> <br /> We follow the film and then your experience abroad as Student Erasmus through the eyes. Xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities, his faults. A clever production with many ingenious ideas perfectly expresses your lost mind and your anxiety about the world and being an Erasmus student. On this subject, the best examples can be found in two sequences. The first is when Xavier asks a woman at the university for the documents he has to send to prepare his DEA. When the same woman informs you about the different required procedures, all roles appear on the screen when she is naming them! In the following sequence, Xavier's voice gives the viewer his vision of the modern world. Now, where to find the second example? Well, the scene in which Xavier has a meticulous medical examination during which Klapisch films his visions is amply sufficient to speak of himself. <br /> <br /> In addition, the director was not really interested in the studies of his main character. He left this point discreetly. He put a lot of effort into Xavier's private life, of course, in his affair with Anne Sophie, but also and especially in his dealings with his fellow tenants. It is a true friendship story that Klapisch shows us with his moments of happiness, but also his arguments and his tensions. Through Xavier's adventure and at the end of his stay, he will have been initiated into life that will make him more mature. The message the author wanted to convey is not difficult to guess. You naively believe that you live in a messy and complicated world. You should not give up, but look hard to get what you want, even if it is difficult. <br /> <br /> In addition, we may also fear that, with the topic, Cédric Klapisch did not avoid a trap: the clichés. Let's be frank about this: they are included in the script, but the director does his best not to spread them too much in his film. So the script contains convenient and predictable moments: at the airport and before boarding we see Xavier shedding a tear after he left his family. But fortunately, the shortcomings of the script stop here. Very funny dialogues and young legal actors perfectly at ease in their roles make up the whole. <br /> <br /> Despite its weaknesses, "l'auberge espagnole" should be taken as a success in the young film. people. In addition, the whole atmosphere that it brings makes us think that this film is aimed primarily at a young audience. Ultimately, the end of the film and its great success allow us to suggest that Klapisch succumbed to a fashion that holds true for American cinema: the making of sequences. And, in fact, the filmmaker is currently working on a sequence entitled "les poupées Russes". Let's hope it is as good as "l'auberge espagnole".
