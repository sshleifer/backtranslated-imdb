This show was amazing, but very esoteric for most people. If you had never actually seen a European variety show in the 70's or 80's (or at least one Mexican), the whole show would probably be lost on you. If you did, this show was dead in a satire of the fake and superficial show that these shows plunge into the worst of them. Directed by a seductive aspiring smoking man with a pencil mustache and his ultra-glamorous and immaculate harridan from an ex-wife, "Viva Variety" is a variety show that tries to take off every episode but always goes down in combat. and acts very wrong. The hosts are joined by "Johnny Bluejeans," an obscure side kick that seems to have been named because jeans is a very popular product in their country and that means kids will like it, which of course they did not. The result was a hilarious parody of variety shows in general. Imagine the discussion that probably happened BACKSTAGE during the last days of the "Sonny & Cher Show". Now imagine what is happening in front of you and the stars are trying to maintain their composure. Now add extravagant acts and a Euro-riche mentality (tuxedos, dresses, drinks, accents and cigarettes). NOW you have "Viva Variety". <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard a musician whose music was practically written for other musicians? Too conceptual? Viva Variety did it for the comedians. It is very esoteric for the American public standard. It was funny as Hell. And condemned.
