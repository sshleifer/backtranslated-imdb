It's a unique movie because it gives us our only chance to see young Noel Coward in all his ironic glory. Because he seems so reserved and detached that he is perfect for the role of a loveless cad√£o who uses with ease all those around him. However, in the serious mortal act (no pun intended), when Coward must do as the flying Dutchman, he is much less comfortable. <br /> <br /> But his path with an epigram is unparalleled, and Hecht & Macarthur gave him some gems (Macarthur, actually - he was the peer's intelligence). <br /> <br /> The film is superbly lit by the great Lee Garmes, but has little camera movement in addition to a storm sequence. Hecht and Macarthutr worried about one thing: putting their dialogue on the screen. (NOTE: H & M itself has appearances as "homeless and lost" as vagabonds in the flophouse scene). <br /> <br /> The most notable supporting player is the only notorious Alexander Woolcott on Broadway. Columnist and close friend of Macarthur and Coward, who appears as one of the swindlers always kept waiting in Coward's reception room. Curious that Woolcott would agree to make a film that clearly satirizes the legendary Algonquin Round Table, of which he was one of the founders, and Macarthur, an auxiliary member. <br /> <br /> Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for best story, although that win is probably more to Coward's imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot. It's Coward, Woolcott and the dialogue you remember ...
