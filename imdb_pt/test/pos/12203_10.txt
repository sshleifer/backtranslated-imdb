A new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you at the tip of your seat. Lake Bell is wonderful .. its worth your other show "Miss Match" has been canceled. I'm glad she came back on "Surface". I can not wait for the return of "Surface". This show is really something unique to watch. With a strange underwater world that is similar to Jurassic Park, this show keeps you wondering what comes next. Nim is adorable, even if it will turn into something bigger and much more sinister. There are so many generic programs out there that seem to just remake the same old stuff. When something like "Surface" appears, just say "THANK YOU!"
