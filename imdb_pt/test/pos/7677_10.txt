I saw this movie when I was very young. It's my all time favorite. I had been unable to get a copy until recently and seeing it brought back so many good memories. I loved the Porgy portrait of Sidney Poiter, he's your character with so much strength and courage. The part of Pearl Bailey, though small, was no different from many members of our own family. My favorite songs were and still are "Bess You Is My Women", "Porgy, do not let him treat me" and, of course, "Summertime." According to the guidelines, if I am interpreting correctly, I will not be able to post where I got my copy, sorry. That's why I registered to share this information. Before registering the guidelines are not posted. <br /> <br /> Phone numbers, email addresses, URLs. Availability, price, or ordering / shipping information.
