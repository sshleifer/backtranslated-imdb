This great movie has the best acting you've ever seen, and that alone makes this a must-see. The whole cast is excellent but, again, it had to be to accompany Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. It did not take long for me to get addicted to this movie, and aside from a court scene that is simply good, this is prime entertainment. This is a rare movie that really deserved all the recognition of the Oscar it received. See for yourself and you definitely will not be disappointed.
