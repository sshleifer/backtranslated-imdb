Romuald et Juliette is one of those romantic French comedies where they seem to break all the rules, like Trop Belle Pour Toi. The beautiful Daniel Auteuil learns about true loyalty and love when his life threatens to hit his ears. The film is not a tale of preacher morality, but a wonderful story that will keep you connected until the last. Firmine Richard (as Juliette) is a heroine that women will applaud - her laughter is my permanent reminder of this warm and witty film. The realistic way she has to include all her children for different parents - particularly birthdays - gives the film an edge that elevates it above its ordinary romantic comedy. But it's always the Frenchman who seems to show us how easy this is!
