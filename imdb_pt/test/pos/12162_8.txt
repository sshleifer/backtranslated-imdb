The Frozen Limits is a big-screen vehicle for the artists known as The Crazy Gang. They were a group of British artists who formed in the early 1930s. For the most part, the six men in the group were Bud Flanagan, Chesney Allen, Jimmy Nervo, Teddy Knox, Charlie Naughton and Jimmy Gold. Extremely popular in the salons of varieties, the group was also the darling of the then Royal Family. The plot here sees them as the Wonder Boys troupe who set out to fetch their fortunes in Alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper. The only problem is that when they finally make it to the Red Gulch, they find they are 40 years behind! <br /> <br /> I often shudder when I see the statement "it's very British" because it implies that those other than the British Isles may have trouble getting it. The reason that bothers me is that in this internet / www era I have assembled a number of non-amateur friends from British films who have been known to share their sides in the best of Ealing, Will Hay and the imperious Terry-Thomas. So, is it true that something like The Frozen Limits will hardly be appreciated by a non-British audience? Well, yes, it's true, a lot here is topically British, but it really should be said that the classic movie fan is quite versed in history, and when all is said and done the visual joy here is universal. With the anarchic "no", so wild in the west, conquering an absolute winner. A winner who has every chance of being more appreciated by an American audience now than it will by a British audience. Not all the comedy works, and in fact the "Big 6" are outdone by a movie stealing from Moore Marriott. But there are sketches and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of approval for more illustrious comedy acts. You're unlikely to almost fall off the chair like I did because of an Ovomaltine joke, but what if you're a fan of classic comedy movies? I'm sure you will, at worst, acknowledge that there are some very talented people working here. Now, then, of the Mounties always take their man? 8/10
