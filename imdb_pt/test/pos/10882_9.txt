This game is not exactly the best N64 game of all time. Sure, it's good, but only when there are 4 players. Without 4 players, the only fun thing to do is pick up remote mines and see how many people you can kill. But half of that game is levels at which you have to save Natalya, so you'll have to limit your use of remote mines to those levels, and that gets pretty annoying. The graphics do not reach exactly the level of Super Mario 64 or even Mario Kart 64. And if you're talking about a great multiplayer in a first person shooter game, you'll have to choose Perfect Dark. At least you can play "multiplayer" alone.
