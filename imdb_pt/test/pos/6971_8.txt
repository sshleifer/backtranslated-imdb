The first Francis Ford Coppola 'personal' film, completed and released in 1969, was the last film he made as an unknown and rising director before The Godfather, and contrasts with both the film and the rest of his film . career. It is ostensibly a road movie involving a disconnected young woman bored with domestic life, and pregnant with a child she is not sure she wants, fleeing the trap of her monotonous marriage and hitting the open road in search of freedom. Along the way, she befriends a good man, a former football player who suffered brain damage from a traumatic head injury, interpreted unexpectedly subtle by a young James Caan, and decides to "help" him despite of being frustrated with his simple ways. His efforts to get rid of him always fail, whether by guilt or by chance, and end up taking her directly into the hands of an emotionally wounded cop (Robert Duvall), who has his own ideas. The plot is threadbare, but Coppola does a great job at detailing the emotional lives of these characters, and uses editing techniques to relay stories that were not common in American movies of the time. The shots are simple yet remarkably effective, conveying both the melancholy desolation of the open road and the emptiness of American suburban life infused with a soft melancholy provided by the movie score. Coppola also deserves credit for addressing the issue of domestic discontent from the point of view of a woman in the culturally turbulent 1960s. Overall, a rather understated movie that is not what the audience expects from Coppola, but one that is a small triumph in its own quiet and unpretentious manner. 7.5 / 10.
