This film tops the previous incarnation by a mile, taking everything to the next level. As always, the JackAss guys are purely unbelievable, and I personally laugh more than I have in a long time. Like the first JackAss, this is not so much a movie as a sequence of eighty-minute stunts and tricks. It's pure circus entertainment taken to the highest level. Essentially, these guys are clowns, bowing down to the fun of others. And it's great. The antics are so low, scandalous and often disgusting that they transcend into a higher form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> You can not evaluate this along with other movies, it's a class of its own. And it shines. Go and enjoy the pure spectacle that is.
