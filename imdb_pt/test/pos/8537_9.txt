Oh my God. Obviously, when you rent or purchase this, you are not expecting to see a documentary about the mating habits of small rodents in their natural habitats. You're expecting a visual feast of blood and blood and maybe even a fright or two. well, for those who are as sick and twisted as me, you will not find many scares, but you will come very close to urinating yourself in laughter. the slogans in this movie will stay with you and your friends forever. The first time I showed this to my friends and colleagues was for over 3 years, but still we laughed and used the catch phrases. is as addictive and funny as Sam Raimi's Dead Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn and Peter Jackson's Dead Alive / Braindead. From the absolutely ridiculous dialogue of the opening scene, to the best works of the Department of Splatter and Gore, to the wonderful skills of Ed, the movie cutter, you will laugh and laugh again. As for the visual feast of blood and gore, oh yeah, they did it. And they are very good at it ... "The neck bone is attached to the head bone ..." This movie may also have made the best nightmare / hallucination / scene of totally effing nuts I've ever seen. and this is not to be funny, but the man is well done (and scary). Overall, for those who are not up against a lot of blood and a good time, IF YOU NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE GET IT! is on Netflix, I know that for sure.
