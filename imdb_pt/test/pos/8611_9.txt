Crushing movie about cinema. It shows the intense and strange relationships that can develop between directors and their actors; the games of manipulation and mind; the preening egotism of artists. As in any workplace, sexuality complicates things, but here to the last degree they are filming a sex scene. Absolutely fantastic presentations by Gregoire Colin as the fragile, male wannabe and lead - and supremely - Anne Parillaud as the director's self-portrait. The image of her laughing and eating a banana at the end, having finally gotten what she wants from her puppets, is sheer delight.
