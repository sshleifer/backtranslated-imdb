Yes, I'm ashamed to admit it, but this show is positively DEVINE !!! It's so fun, and I have the best time to watch it. So since Cycle 1 has been great, and I have not noticed a drop in its glory in ALL.Tyra Banks as you know is the host, and as fabulous as it there are also other judges and co-hosts such as J. Alexander, Jay Manuel, Nigel Barker and Twiggy. The main point of the show is for all the girls invited to become America's Next Top Model, have to work their way to the top, completing and winning photo competitions. It looks great, does not do that, and let me tell you it's great !!!! It's amazing to see all the different kinds of pictures taken by the girls, and each one is different, cool and daring. Anyone who hates this show, has no idea, and I'll tell you that this show will happen for a long time, so deal with it !!!
