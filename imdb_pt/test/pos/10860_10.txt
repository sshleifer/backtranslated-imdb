I have nothing but praise for this mini series. It's only about a year and a half old, but I've seen it twice already; with greater pleasure the second time than the first. I am seriously thinking of seeing you again soon, since I think it is spiritually uplifting. <br /> <br /> It's a very tender romantic drama with such beautiful performances, scenery, costumes, music and scenes that resonates almost in a league of mini-series. <br /> <br /> Some others commented on the difficulties of living as a lesbian in Britain in the 1890s. Nothing particularly difficult about it; it was only male homosexuality that went against the law as poor Oscar Wilde experimented at its great cost and as a great loss to the literary world. Anyway, I disagree. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is essential for television. It is perhaps one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas since Romeo and Juliet, though not in the conventional sense. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 of me. <br /> <br /> VMY
