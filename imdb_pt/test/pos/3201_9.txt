I guess I was not sure what to expect from this movie, it had a good cast, an interesting story, and a lot of other things going on, but I still could not get rid of a feeling of fear I had in my stomach about as it would be. I'm happy to say that I was very pleased with the result and I regret worrying about it all the time. The opening scenes of the films were extremely intriguing and were enough to sustain the early interest in the film. As the film progressed, we were introduced to the characters in the film as well as to what happened in the riots in prisons. Like most reviews for this movie, I have to admit that there are some non-surgical cliches, but this can not erase the general power of this movie that looks like a good novel. The cast is great, especially Chestnut and McGowan, and the film is considered one of the best films for this year's TV. Certainly worth seeing if you are looking for a good court drama.
