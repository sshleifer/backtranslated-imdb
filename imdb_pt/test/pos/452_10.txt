"The Journey" is a very good movie. Produced in the spring of 1958 in Vienna, and released in 1959, this film was quite popular in its early years. Despite the political problems, which influenced the success of the film (because the story takes place during the Hungarian Revolution, the Cold War), "The Journey" is a very good but not very well known film. I think it should be released immediately on DVD because most of the people who watched it so far want to have it at home. One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, their intense relationship. All of their scenes together are very important, but they also reveal the strong feelings, the great passion and love between the characters (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another quality is the script, which is very well written. It was even published as a novel by screenplayer George Tabori. The film keeps its tension from beginning to end. At first we did not know if Diana and the other travelers could leave Hungary, because the Communist Major discovers that Diana's friend, Paul Kedes, is Hungarian and can not leave the country. The Major falls deeply in love with Diana and this is, in fact, the real reason why he does not want to let her go. But after he hugs her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on the screen, and she kisses him too, he lets her go. And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic finals ever filmed - Major and Diana say "Goodbye!", She arrives at the border with all travelers, including Paul, while Surov is shot several times by some Hungarians, so he dies. Yul Brynner is very, very handsome and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful, charming, refined, like an English lady. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. They are one of the biggest couples in Golden Hollywood. A true spectator should watch this movie. "The Journey" has everything a good movie must have - a great and captivating story, interesting characters, a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is, in my opinion, at its best). Finally, I want to give a message to Warner Bros. Studios or for those restoring and releasing classic movies: Please release "The Journey" on DVD as soon as possible.
