I just thought to add another note here. Although there are some visual sub-references in this episode to the possibility of underexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman, Janice Rand; There is a special moment, physically tender, in the end. When the Enterprise is reverting at an emergency speed in an attempt to escape a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that her life is about to reach a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they they observe the instrument approaching their imminent fate in the main viewer. I thought it was sweet (and Janice, of course, it's beautiful!). <br /> <br /> (P.S. Goof: - Several times, while supposedly firing phasors, the movie shows torpedoes of photons being released)
