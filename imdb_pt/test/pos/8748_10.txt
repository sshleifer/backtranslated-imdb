I have not seen the latest "Traffic" which is based on this, but I would bet on this one as the best creation. I know of no other film that portrayed the intricate tragedies of drug trafficking and the "drug war" so well. I watched this movie at least four times and I'm liking it again as part of the Masterpiece Theater's 30 year old performances.
