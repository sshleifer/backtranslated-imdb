I just watched Marigold today and start by saying that I found this DVD on the shelves of Blockbuster. As I strolled around looking for something new and good to see, Ali Larter's picture caught my eye. After drooling over Ali Larter, I took the cover and continued to look around the cover. Apparently, I thought the clothes were a little overdone. And then I saw the other Indians on the cover and I realized that this was some kind of fake movie or something. <br /> <br /> When I leafed through the part of the synopsis and saw Salman Khan, I took a second look. . Salman Khan in an American movie with Ali Larter on a DVD at Blockbuster? Because Salman Khan is for Bollywood films as Mel Gibson is for Hollywood movies, I had very high expectations for this movie: it had to be good! I am very pleased to say that Marigold is a phenomenal movie! It far exceeded any and all my personal expectations! <br /> <br /> I suppose a movie like this is what happens when you have a decent script, a talented, experienced, experienced and goal-oriented director, two amazing actors playing the main roles and only one cast and crew support working very hard! Khan and Larter seem to have great chemistry together and they both shine on the big screen: they look pretty good together. The musical numbers were not bad at all, which was surprising considering how much Indian and long movie musicals are currently. And you'll be happy to know that Indian costumes are a long way from being cheesy as you will. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie was a bit slow, the medium was very good, the scenes leading to the climax were quite dramatic, but the end was simply fantastic! I have some complaints and complaints about the DVD, however. Although I loved the widescreen format of the DVD, I did not like the fact that several other things were left out of the DVD. There are no subtitles for starters. Now English being my first language, it's not a problem. However, when some of the Indian actors and actresses spoke, it was (sometimes) difficult to understand what they were saying; The caption would have helped. <br /> <br /> Another thing I would have appreciated on the DVD would be a wrong recording or some sort of collection of outtakes. And finally, what about a menu feature that would allow us to jump right to the musical numbers? Dude, some of these songs were really good! On the other hand, I really enjoyed watching Marigold's creation. <br /> <br /> I have a lot more to say about the greatness of this movie and how much I liked it, but I do not have the time nor do I want to continue writing why I liked it so much? I hope Salman Khan will make more English films, as well as his Hindi movies, and I hope this Hindi movie is not Ali Larter's latest Bollywood movie. And I encourage the director to continue making Bollywood hybrid films with Salman Khan, Ali Larter and other big names - just make sure the scripts are original and good. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - this is just a great love story movie that your whole family can enjoy!
