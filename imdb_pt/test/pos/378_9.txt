In the truffaut interview with Hitchcock, it is clear that Big Al's fear of police dates back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station carrying a note. The note said, "He is disobedient, imprison him for an hour." The police were forced and since Hitchcock had a deep fear of being unfairly accused and taken away by the police. "Strangers on a Train" is probably one of the best in his "unfairly accused" series. . The film is based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith. This is the same author who wrote the Ripley series. She has always been fascinated by intelligent criminals. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock's opening is very strong and takes you immediately to the protagonists: Guy Haines, a famous tennis player, and Bruno Anthony, the would-be criminal. The two guys share a chemistry that at that day and age was probably much more than the audience could chew. Bruno tries to convince Guy that they can commit the perfect murder (without leaving clues), if they change the victim. Bruno is going to kill Guy's wife, who would not give him a divorce, and Guy would kill Bruno's father. The motives are, respectively, love and money. <br /> <br /> Bruno's performance must be seductive and homoerotic. This is not something that was done by chance. In fact, Hitchcock edited two versions of the film: one from the United States and one from the United Kingdom. In the North American version, the volume of seduction of Bruno was refused a little. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on a Train" is a very deep film, but more importantly, this is another great Hitchcock thriller. An excellent example of an exciting scene is when Guy is climbing the steps to Bruno's father's bedroom. Hitchcock argued that the public's attention needed to be distracted at this point so they would not find out what Guy would find in the room. Hitch treats us of a HUGE dog and threatening at the top of the stairs, which provided the necessary distraction. <br /> <br /> The most famous scene of the film occurs during a game of tennis. Bruno has been chasing Guy continually for Guy to do his part in the deal (kill his father). When Guy looks at the audience, all heads are turning back and forth. All but one - Bruno. He's looking directly at Guy with a "I'll get you" smile. <br /> <br /> The ending is another example of suspense. Both fight for a key piece of evidence on a carousel that is spinning at crazy speed. A worker is crawling to gain access to the controls. When we finally left this tour and the movie ended with Guy proving his innocence, we were exhausted and without nails (for those of us still biting our nails!). <br /> <br /> "Strangers on a Train" is easily one of Hitchcock's best "unfairly accused" films. Some credit him to one of the best villains (Bruno) as well. All in all, the movie may seem a bit dated, but that's a lesson from the master himself. I will not refuse Leonardo, if he came to teach me Renaissance painting, then you should not either. <br /> <br /> << Review posted on FilmDailies.com >>
