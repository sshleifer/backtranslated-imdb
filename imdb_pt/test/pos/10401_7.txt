Another hand terror means another divisive film that fans should still seek out and decide about themselves. <br /> <br /> Imagine a cross between The Blair Witch Project and The Grudge and you're close to the overall content of this movie. It's another horror recorded on video, but this time most are edited together, ready for a video documentary that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared. <br /> <br /> I certainly had a sense of dread as I watched this movie (Does anyone have a better fear than our Asian friends?), but the scary moments, the really chilling moments, were sadly a little less and more between what I expected. I also felt that I was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent "revelations" appeared, so I certainly can not recommend this as well as [* Rec]. That being said, it would be an omission from me not to strongly recommend any film about ectoplasmic earthworms, to contain at least two subtly scary ghosts and to ensure that I had to turn on the lights for a while when the sun set. See if you've taken advantage of some of the latest genre releases. And the ending is a chilling thing. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: The Last Broadcast, Pulse, Angel Heart.
