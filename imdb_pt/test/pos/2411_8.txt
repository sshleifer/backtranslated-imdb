Okay, this is a complete steal from the first Karate Kid. However, I think there can never be many movies like the first Karate Kid. There is something about this kind of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me. You have a general sense of being able to overcome adversity by discovering new things about yourself. In this film, Hillary Swank is a special gem as the next Karate Kid. You can really say that she has a bright future ahead of her. <br /> <br /> Not to say that this movie is not without problems. Unlike the former, Miyagi seems to be a little anxious to get Julie to learn martial arts and engage her in the fight. It seems he almost forgot his values ​​from the first film. In addition, one must have disbelief suspended when examining the monks. The movie makes the monks seem to have a very simplistic view of life, and does not really explain why they do what they do in the plot. Villains are also somewhat questionable, though they are bad-untouchables. I also have a suspicion about Martial Arts movies that end on prom night. <br /> <br /> So maybe this is not a perfect movie. So maybe this is not the best movie to rent on a Friday night. However, in more ways than one, it is a guilty pleasure. Hillary Swank is so adorable, and the story, even without originality, works. In a genre of movies that seems to be based on nothing more than action and violence, this is a breath of fresh air. Unlike all those Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van-Damme, this is a film about the spirit and the heart. There are some people who need movies like that, and we'll get what we can. My rating: 8/10
