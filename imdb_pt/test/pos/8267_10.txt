When Precious Bane aired in America, I was impressed by this beautiful story. All the actors were brilliant; Clive Owen really understood the character he played. I went immediately to a bookstore and asked for the original novel, which is even more beautiful, and which went out of print shortly after I had bought the book - although I have seen it online a few times. I also hoped that with the Oscar won by Janet McTeer and the enormous popularity of Clive Owen, the BBC naturally got this great DVD production ... I can not believe that all those years later we still do not have any DVDs. It has to be the only production ever created by the BBC that is NOT for sale. Come on the BBC - you have money to leave us fans here. Get this on DVD please!
