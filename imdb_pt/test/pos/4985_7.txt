This is more of a western about a baron of greedy cattle wanting to drive out small farmers and ranchers. Surely everything was done before and after. But The Violent Men is something special. <br /> <br /> What makes it special is Barbara Stanwyck playing the fox, as she always did in her later films. She is married to the crippled Edward G. Robinson, who is the baron of cattle here, but Robinson is crippled and there is some indication that his wounds may have rendered him powerless. It does not matter to Barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother-in-law Brian Keith. This does not fit well with either Dianne Foster, who is the daughter of Robinson and Stanwyck, or Lita Milan, who is Keith's Mexican girlfriend. The Infidelity subplot almost assumes the film, but Glenn Ford as the small, sturdy farmer who is a civil war veteran comes west to get his health to stay here. He is the whole western hero quiet that people make the mistake of pushing once too often. I almost expect the famous words of Wild Bill Elliott to come out of the mouth of Ford: "I am a peaceful man." It would have been very applicable in The Vioilent Men. <br /> <br /> The 1950s were the adult western age, themes were entering into horse operas that had not been explored before. The following year, Glenn Ford would make another western, Jubal, one of his best, who also exploits infidelity as a component of the plot. <br /> There is a lot of traditional Western material in The Violent Men and a lot for those who are addicted to soap operas as well.
