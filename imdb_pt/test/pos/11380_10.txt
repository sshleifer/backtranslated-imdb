This is an absolutely brilliant blow to Paul Thomas Anderson, the writer / director of this film. It really examines the pros and cons of the world of pornography and the consequences for its actions living in a world literally fueled by sex, drugs and rock n 'roll. Only the best cast members with Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle, Philip Baker Hall and others.
