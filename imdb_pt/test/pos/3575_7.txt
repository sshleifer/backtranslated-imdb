The performances of Jim Varney as Harem Girl and A.U. are incredibly funny - at one level beating Chaplin and Keaton. Linda Kash is great in her once-in-a-lifetime role as the waffle waitress in the hometown who yearns for adventure. Unfortunately, the remaining 90% of the film was terribly bad due to the atrocious plot. The creators of Ernest Goes to Africa have not met the creative challenges inherent in low-budget filmmaking. Only worth seeing on the cable.
