I think Andrew Davies did an admirable job of getting a magnificent book that mimicked the rhythm and style of a Victorian romance, turning it into a moving and entertaining film. I'm glad I read (twice) the first book that is usually the case for me. I know you have to see a novel and a movie as a different medium and judge them accordingly. But still, it is often difficult to read the original material after a movie shows the best parts. <br /> <br /> I realize that Davies is a very good adapter, but I wish the producers had chosen a woman to write the script. Davies, as he admits in the accompanying commentary on the DVD, particularly wanted to emphasize the more eschatological bits of the book. I certainly liked that, in the movie as in the book. But Davies lost half a dozen painful and painfully painful moments that he could have incorporated if his sensitivity was more feminine. <br /> <br /> I would also disagree with your use of the primary symbol of the book, the rose. <br /> <br /> As the script was plotted by Davies, the outcome was inevitable and appropriate. But I really think that the author's final approval for the rose symbol was much more interesting. And I preferred the novel to let Nan "mature" than the way Davies chose. <br /> <br /> A quick comment on the four actors rehearsing the lead roles. They are all wonderfully talented - well, except for singing and dancing, perhaps - and moreover, their physical presences are as much what the mind sees as it reads the novel before seeing the movie. I thought they were all fantastic. <br /> <br /> I recommend that any lesbian and anyone who likes good fiction, add BOTH the book and the TIPPING THE VELVET DVD to their book shelves.
