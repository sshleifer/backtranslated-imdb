This film was a modern scarface. It had me on tiptoe. This movie is one of those rare epic movies that makes you want a sequel. I especially liked Damian Chapa's performance deserved a gym award, which he deserved for his performance in Blood in blood out. The only thing I did not like was behind the scenes because it did not show the intensity that the movie had, and I wish I had seen less narrated scenes. But the movie was great and it's in my top ten movies All in all, the acting was great, there was not a bad scene in the movie, I loved it, Jennifer Tilly was just as perfect as the whole cast. I can not see how anyone wouldn liked this movie was a great one. Definitely a must see.
