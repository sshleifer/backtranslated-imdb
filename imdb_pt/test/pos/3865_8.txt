No, I'm not kidding. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat and rather funny movie from Disney. Who does not love kittens? The music in the world wants to be a cat is playing. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later, when Cats Do not Dance came out, I saw a movie that was musically entertaining. What Aristocats does not have in animation and history, makes up for in charm. In addition, everything moves at a relaxed pace, and even the villain is not so scary. It's perfect for the younger ones, though it's not so sentimental that adults do not like it. If Snoop was here, I'm sure he'd say the same thing. Yes. Dig those crazy cats, man.
