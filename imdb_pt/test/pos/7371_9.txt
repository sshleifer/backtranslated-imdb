This was on Saturday before Halloween this year (today, at the time of this writing) and has to be the best horror anthology out there. I'm not usually a fan of horror movies - largely due to the volume of junk that was released recently. However, the director of Campfire Tales has the gift of suspense Hitchcock-esquire - unlike other contemporary films, he does not take every opportunity to scare him, using foreshadowing and "near misses" - incidents that seem like the instant when the climax will occur in the previous instant, but will end up not being. <br /> <br /> I did not get 'The Hook' or the first main thread, but from what I read here, they were two you could lose. <br /> <br /> 'People can lick too' was full of suspense - this short one keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for something to happen to the little girl as she wanders. your yard and home looking for your soccer ball and then your dog. She finds so many near misses that the suspense reaches the proportions of stopping the heart before the climax of the short, when the girl gives up and goes to bed, thinking that her dog is under her. She reaches out to let him lick it, and she feels the touch of a tongue in her hand ... before realizing that in the mirror, written in blood, is "People can lick too." I will leave the last seconds for you to discover, my reader, for at this point the short could have made any number of turns. <br /> <br /> "The Medallion", however, was the undisputed masterpiece. of this film. It starts with a man on a motorcycle, just driving ... toward what he does not know, but he can feel himself approaching. While he is driving, a storm breaks out and he is forced to find shelter in a dumb girl's house. The two quickly snuggle up to each other, but before they can do anything but kiss, the girl reveals through writing that the ghosts inhabit her home. They quickly start packing to leave, but are caught in the middle of a reconstruction of a scene decades ago - a father, returning home to his daughter and her boyfriend preparing to flee, murder the two and then commit suicide. I'll have to leave you to find out the ending here as well - I could not expect to do justice to the story in any case, and what I have said so far is only a brief summary of the story - I could not hope to convey the nuances and details sense that they add to it. <br /> <br /> 'The Bonfire', being the connecting thread between all the stories, is a rather interesting repetition of the theme of the car accident and the girls are very attractive - in fact, most of the girls in this movie They're pretty. Anyway, despite the fact that it is cut, history is given justice, and the ending is difficult to predict if you are worried about the other stories. However, if you pay close attention to the segments of The Campfire scattered throughout the film, you can certainly predict the ending, especially if you've seen films based on the same premise. (Fans of MST3k, remember Soultaker? Same premise, but without the horrible writing of Vivian Schilling, and most of the film.) If you saw the first 30 minutes of it, you should be able to predict the ending. everything, the best horror movie I've seen a long time, and the only anthology of horror worthy of a purchase.
