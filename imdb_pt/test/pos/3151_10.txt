The Reader is a perfect example of what a short movie should be. A touching story, told simply through well-written dialogues, beautifully painted images, a trail that penetrates perfectly into the narrative, and characters portrayed with thoughtfulness and grace. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at a festival where other interesting films and ideas were exhibited. But none of the other short films had all the elements of big cinema coming together in a movie like The Reader. The Reader commanded the attention of all the festival goers and for 10 minutes took us to the emotional life of the characters. <br /> <br /> Duncan Rogers has created a beautiful film and I hope to see more director be more shorts or maybe a feature film.
