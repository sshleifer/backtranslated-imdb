This is certainly a quality movie with a class cast. As for the films about Carlos the Jackal, this one beats Bruce Willis's weak efforts in 'The Jackal' to a bloody pulp, and then spits on them. I'm a bit surprised that this movie has not attracted more votes, something of a 'sleeper' obviously. Too bad because this movie is worth watching. He's smart and never bored. Veja, 7/10
