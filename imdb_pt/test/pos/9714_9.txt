It seems that everyone wants to jump on the wave and say "Maha Go Go Go" .... The word is MACHA ........ Like "Mach" ..... Pronounced maa - ka "... < I grew up with this series in the early 70's here in Los Angeles at the very end and much regretted channel 56 ... Prior to that there was Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy) which dates back to 1963 in Ol 'KHJ Astro Boy was the first example of an anime that came here in the United States ... I was anime as a child and I followed it until the end of the 80's, when, then, it would become a series of "talking heads" barely animated. phenomenon that only got worse, "Nuff said. <br /> <br /> As for" Speed ​​Racer, "I really liked the basics there, the POV photos, the kinematic aspects of the live action skillfully adopted for animation. .. It was quite typical of most Japanese animes of the time ... Graphical graphics graphics! Note at some point how the series was obviously inspired by Stanley Kramer's movie "Grand Prix" (1966), especially the American credits redone ... Oh yes, I have the original comics the series is based on, so I know what I mean. <br /> <br /> What were we doing in terms of animation besides crap like Johnny Quest? things we've been doing since the 1920s ... Ho-hum! <br /> <br /> I think the real problem I had / had with the way the anime was / is shown on American TV is the hatchet job done in scripts, credits, etc. to "sanitize" to the American public ... I will not go into other programs as we are talking "Speed ​​here." Look at clowns like Peter Fernandez as one of the culprits here, as he was 99% responsible for the rewrites of the series ... Not to mention the voice of Speed, Racer X and others ... Between him and the goofs on Trans / Lux (Think Felix the Cat, and the Mighty Hercules - oy vey!) They did a very sophisticated show and they fell to the level of the Sesame Street. Think "Cruncher Bloch", "The Company Forthebird", "Skull Duggery" ... If I continue I will throw up. This series goes back to 40 years ago , but I was, in time, eager enough to feel insulted by the dumbness of this and other Japanese programs ... I mean, it's obvious that Someone is being killed, but they remove it or cover it up ... Pleeeeeze! Good show - originally. Unfortunately, all the latest incarnations of the series have that CRAPPY look "made in Korea", not to mention being nauseatingly "pc" in content. Even the Japanese outsource their animation now ... Try watching the original Japanese opening on YouTube sometime ... It sends shivers down my spine ..... If only .... .. Oh well. Robert
