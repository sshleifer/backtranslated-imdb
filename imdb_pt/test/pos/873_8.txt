On Reunion Island, in the Indian Ocean, the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is involved in correspondence with Julie Roussel and he does not know her. When Julie arrives on the island to marry Louis, he waits for her on the dock, but Louis does not recognize Julie in the passenger ship and finds that she is totally different from the image she sent to Louis. They get married and Louis shares his bank accounts with her. When Julie's sister writes a letter to Louis asking her to write to her, Louis learns that the woman is not Julie who is missing. In addition, he discovers that the woman has cleared her bank accounts and left the island. The sister of Louis and Julie hires an efficient private detective Comolli (Michel Bouquet) and Louis travels to France in search of the woman, but he has a nervous breakdown in Nice and undergoes intense sleep therapy in a clinic. He recovers and discovers that the woman, in fact Marion Vergano (Catherine Deneuve), works at the Phoenix Club Privé in Antibes and lives in the low-budget Monorail Hotel. Louis invades her room and when she arrives from the club, she says she was happy with him, but her dangerous ex-lover Richard blackmailed her. Louis is still in love with Marion and runs off with her to the field. But Comolli is chasing after Marion in France accused of murdering Julie. <br /> <br /> "La Sirene de Mississipi" is a noir film by the great director / writer François Truffaut, with an unconventional love story of passion, murder and love that hurts The femme fatale Catherine Deneuve is surprising, probably at the top of her beauty and it is delightful to see her face and the topless scenes on the road and in the living room. Jean-Paul Belmondo is very athletic, and the sequence when he stages the wall of the hotel is impressive. Catherine Deneuve makes this film stand out and lends credence to Louis' passion and lust. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Mermaid of the Mississippi" ("The Mississippi Mermaid")
