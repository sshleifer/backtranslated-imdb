Great British director Christopher Nolan (Moment, Insomnia) directs this strange film about a writer obsessed with following people. This proves harmless at first but soon becomes dangerous after taking the game one step further after finding a man who thinks like him who shows the pros and cons of getting in and out. The two men soon pass over their heads in a strange world involving the mafia and prostitution. Jeremy Theobald plays the writer and Alex Haw, the friend who thinks like him. Both are great performances. This low budget film was filmed in a total guerrilla style, with no permissions to any location and no big stars, but has what many big budget movies do not have, which is a clever script and creative direction. An impressive debut by one of today's best directors. Good thing!
