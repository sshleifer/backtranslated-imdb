A cranky police detective suspects a French duke of being the infamous thief ARSÃˆNE LUPINE. John & Lionel Barrymore cost it together for the first time in a movie in this intriguing police drama. Both so different, they are the perfect counterpoint to each other. John interprets his role with soft sophistication (when not disguised) and Lionel is earthly and common in his interpretation, each one obviously having a wonderful time trying to act like the other. Helped by a generous script, the result is virtually a draw, with the viewer the clear winner. <br /> <br /> Although overshadowed by the two male stars, Karen Morley is intriguing as the mysterious woman that John finds naked in her bed. Tully Marshall gives a colorful performance as a silly nobleman with a lot to lose to the master criminal. Henry Armetta and George Davis are very nice as two seriously inept security guards. John Miljan offers a strong presence in his small role as prefect of the police. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize an uncredited Mischa Auer as a guide in the Louvre during the climax scene that is about an attempted theft of the Mona Lisa. .
