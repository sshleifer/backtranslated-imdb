Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy, that team. While Rene Russo, William Shanter and Everyday Guy are together for the ride. This is a funny and great movie. Not only that, but it's a good movie of friends. <br /> <br /> Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon) directs this movie. From beginning to end, it was a masterpiece. No clown humor here. But good old days laugh. Making fun of all the other police movies (to name a few lethal weapons, Beverly Hills Cop, fifteen minutes, etc ...) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie, check this out. You will love. You have a wonderful cast and crew. So, quit your a ** from watching "COPS" and watch "Showtime" for a thriller. And remember, they'll be protecting your neighbor in ... um ... oh! On Friday nights at 8:00 AM (dude, everyone says I'm a bad writer).
