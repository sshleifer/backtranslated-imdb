Yes, I am sentimental and yes, I love movies in which children are the best human beings. It is true that Klatret√∏sen has some logical flaws or even the plot. These are more than compensated for by the great performance of the boys (the first film by Julias!) And by the charm of a film Dogma (I liked this kind of cinematic art long before the Dogma, from Herzof's Herz aus Glas). Well, I cried in the last fifteen minutes, which is a bigger rip factor than the bambi or the Fly Away home had for me.
