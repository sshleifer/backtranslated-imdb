This is one of the best movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> It's so full of details and every time you see, you find new things ... Like Dad was in the shower but still lonely hear a voice, and when the girls flute, they can not do it at the same time because then there would be two girls, and there is not. <br /> <br /> I have some trouble finding out in the middle of the movie, your "uncle" visits them, but why does his wife go crazy?!? Another fantastic movie !!! The best Asian movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I hope people like it. There have been so many movies where the main character is skit-so (The Machinist, Secret Window and so on), but this movie is way better than them!
