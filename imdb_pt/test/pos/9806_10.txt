I believe this is a heart-pounding film. Richard Donner (directed the highest grossing film "Superman"), did a great job directing this movie. Some of the segemets were good, and several were horrible because, Bobby (Mazzello) was beaten by the King (Baldwin, and especially his dog, Shane attacked the king, which meant he paid for what he had done for Bobby. > Elijah Wood played a good part in this film. The memorable scene of this, he dreamed that he took the advice of the buffalo about Bobby being beaten.Lorraine Bracco, (Pre-Soprano) had portrayed an impressive role. > I give this movie *** of four !!!
