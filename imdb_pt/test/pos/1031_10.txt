'Oppenheimer' with Sam Waterston in the title role and with David Suchet as Evard Teller is an example of the docudrama at its best. Well written, well represented by actors who have a credible resemblance to their historical, highly informative and very entertaining characters. Costumes and costumes capture the US sensation during World War II, and the plot and dialogue make the viewer feel as if he's really present in Los Alamos and involved in the excitement of the Manhattan Project. The only downside is that this is a British production, and some of the actors lack the ability to affect a convincing American accent. (The ability of current Australian and Irish actors in non-native dialects is staggering.) The plot is entirely consistent with Richard Rhodes' definitive story of the development of the atomic bomb. Unfortunately, the miniseries only appeared a few times on PBS in the early 1980s and apparently disappeared into oblivion. <br /> <br /> Oppenheimer compares favorably to the latest "Fat Man & Little". The feature film Boy with Paul Newman as Leslie Groves (the chronically overweight, rather homely General would be totally flattered) and Dwight Schultz (former student of 'A-Team' on TV) as Oppenheimer. As a mini-series, 'Oppenheimer' is about 4x as long as the Newman feature, but uses all additional time completely in its favor.
