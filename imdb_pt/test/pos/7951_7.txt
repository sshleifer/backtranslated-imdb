I watched this movie with great expectations, but I was a bit disappointed. Although I like this movie and was impressed by the story, I did not think it was moving and I thought the end did not materialize. <br /> <br /> The story consists of the friendship between a man who runs a photo shop and his best client. who is a traffic cop. The location is a picturesque Korean village. <br /> <br /> This film is somewhat realistic, as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic. However, I was not moved by a movie that portrays a man so loved by a woman but that does not even give him the option of entering his life. In my opinion, he is a sweet and noble loser. <br /> <br /> Good points - Excellent performance by the two main leaders, nice picture of village life <br /> <br /> Cons - End of apartment <br/> In general - Good, but I prefer the movies Before Sunrise and After Sunset (or before sunset and after sunrise)
