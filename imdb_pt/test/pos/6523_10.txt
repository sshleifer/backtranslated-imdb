"Coconut fruit salad island Fred!" is a hilarious show that is on Saturday mornings on WB. It stars Coconut Fred and all his friends on the island, and each episode is a very funny misadventure of them. Most of the time, it's because of Coconut Fred's difficulty in doing antics, which makes it funny, and other things happening on the island at the same time. The mood is great and no one on the island is very bright, which adds that it is as much fun as it is. I do not think this could be funnier. The characters' voice talents are magnificently superior and exaggerated, which adds to the joy of the show. If this is already on DVD, I'm getting A.S.A.P! <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended for a good laugh.
