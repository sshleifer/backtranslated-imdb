I saw this 1997 movie because I'm a fan of Lorenzo Lamas (and his father, the late Fernando Lamas). In my opinion, Lorenzo looked his best in this movie, mainly because of his hairstyle and wardrobe that were flattering to him. As the plot progressed, I realized that the movie was more than just entertainment or a reason to see a favorite actor. The story was about a ring of serial killers and police attempts to investigate the ring and bring the members to justice. There was an adequate suspense, and I believe that violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I was shocked to learn that the film is the true story of horrendous murders that occurred. in Utah. In addition, Lorenzo and his protagonist were portraying real FBI agents who solved the disappearance of many young women and contributed to the seizure of the ring. I believe the film is worthwhile as it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element.
