Seeing Les Amants Reguliers immediately calls for comparison with Bertolucci's film 'The Dreamers', in my opinion the best film made on the 1968 student revolt in Paris. In fact, director Philippe Garrel does not seem to avoid comparing himself to his much more famous colleague, dividing the lead actor and even including a direct eye-to-eye replica of an older Bertolucci film. And yet, the LAR is a different and interesting film. <br /> <br /> The plot also seems familiar. The film begins with long scenes from the 'emeutes' of 1968, perhaps among the best made so far. The film is made in black and white and the perspective of the static camera on either side of the barricade reminds Eisenstein. Then, as in The Dreamers, the action moves in the Parisian apartment, where the heroes of the defeated revolt make art, smoke drugs, dream and fall in love for each other. There is no direct social commentary, no real explanation of the background of the revolt. The film focuses on the psychology of the characters and the love story between the main characters. It is like a premonition of the process of transition to the establishment that the 1968 generation has gone through, that not all participants can adapt or survive. <br /> <br /> The film is more about the characters than about the events. And it is only by the style that will be remembered. Black-and-white cinema is memorable not only in the scenes of the revolution, but also when one looks at the evolution of the characters. Many sequences are enhanced by a technique that is derived from silent movie films, with long takes accompanied by a piano melody. The effect is excellent. However, the duration of the film is hardly justifiable, lasts more than three hours and I doubt that cutting it for only two hours would have been a fault - in fact, I am convinced that it is totally contrary. <br /> <br /> Without raising the depth and subtlety of Bertolucci's LAR film is another perspective to be remembered about one of the most important years in the history of France and the world in the twentieth century.
