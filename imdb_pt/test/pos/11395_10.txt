I rented Boogie Nights last week and I could tell you, when I watched the movie I had a blast. If you think that when you watch the movie, you get sick with pornography. I mean yes, if you are not a porn person you can not bother to be by that, that this is not the movie to see. But the thing is, the whole movie is not really about pornography. Right in the middle of the movie is about the porn industry, but the other half is about character development and the bad situations these characters go through. The actors played perfect roles, especially Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly and William H. Macy. The sex scenes, of course, are great, but they mostly focus on the character's hype in pornographic films until there are fights. Excellent movie, one of the best! Hedeen Perspective: 10/10 **** A +
