For those too young to remember, or too old to have been part of the "hype", Michael Jackson's fashion in the early '80s was in a fever pitch, like the hype about the Titanic, except that just did not make him give up . Every song, every video, every word Michael uttered was important. Nothing similar had been seen since the Beatles' rise. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this video for the first time, on a skating rink. Everyone stopped skating. There was no question whether you were a Michael Jackson fan or not; You were. Everyone gathered on the projection screen and watched the video ... <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the longest video clips of all time, and definitely the best. Perpetually comes second in the top 100 annual videos of MTV (# 1 is always the flavor of the month and somehow the # 1 of all time has surpassed # 2, to make way for the new # 1 figure. ), and Thriller has become a phenomenon in itself. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, you should watch the video; not just the parts shown on MTV or VH1. If necessary, you should research Making of Thriller at a video store. Hey ... your parents probably made you watch the footage of the Beatles and Woodstock because "it was important" ... well, that's also important.
