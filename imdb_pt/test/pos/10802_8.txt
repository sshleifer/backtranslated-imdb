Many American brains who adore and support the political half-truths of street vendors like Michael Moore would do well to watch this movie more than once and see how hypnotic manipulators can scare, intimidate and lie to an uninformed audience and get the people they fear or detest dead, spindles and mutilated. Robespierre in this beautiful epic kills the opposition by remote control, all in a fit of hypocritical devotion to his principles. We were under the impression that Robes found it justifiable to cut off his opponent's head even as he sent his followers to defeat false and deceptive accusations against the state. Today, the captains of our rotten media institutions are far more sensitive than Robes ... they simply kill your character with insinuations and false accusations laid without foundation or sources. Witness Dan Rather's attempts to assassinate W's character on the eve of the 2004 election, or the constant noise that the 2000 election was stolen, though constitutional scholars continue to ridicule such irresponsible criticism.
