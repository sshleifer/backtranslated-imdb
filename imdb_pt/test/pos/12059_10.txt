I have not seen this funny of a show in the fox in a long time, and the wait was worth it. The kids on the show have something I can relate to in each episode, and even my dad will sit and watch. It is a spectacle that is not for all ages and that is not bullshit for the kids. It's like I'm still standing, but to the next level. The things that everyone says are things that everyone says and actions that everyone does. It says things we all think, but in a well-rounded presentation way. The first time I saw the show, I could not believe I was in the fox, and that it was allowed to stay in the air after a few episodes, from Hilary's boyfriend's choices to the choices of Kenny's boyfriend, it's worth watching.
