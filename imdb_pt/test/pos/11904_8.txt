This movie is the Latin godfather. An unlikely mafioso makes the bridge to some unlikely alliances and forms an empire. I liked the action and shootings along with the hectic and colorful characters. This movie is not Oscar winner, but definitely fun. Hey, who needs an Oscar? <br /> <br /> Plate has some balls to drive and act (think he produced too?) this movie. Reminds me of another filmmaker who likes to do everything, Robert Rodrigez. Continue like this, is there a sequence in the works? There are a lot of ropes that need to be tied. Son comes back and avenges the father's death?
