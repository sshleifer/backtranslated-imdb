Uzumaki, is a visually stunning film, and I do not think anyone will be able to argue this. But unfortunately, the story falls a little. <br /> <br /> The movie, however, is a lot of fun. He uses his wild style to tell a rather non-existent story. The movie almost works, just based on its characters and style, but in my opinion leaves something to be desired.
