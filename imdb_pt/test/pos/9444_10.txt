This has to be one of the best episodes of Doctor Who I've seen since coming back last year. There is a brilliant blend of fun, fear and all-mixed tenderness, which amounts to an incredible episode. The ood was brilliantly designed and I'm sure there will be a lot of ood jokes in the next few weeks. I myself am guilty of it. I particularly liked the way we saw a different perspective on Rose's relationship with Doctor and the end, well, it's the first time I hid behind a cushion! I can not wait until the next episode week to find out how they get out of this mess.
