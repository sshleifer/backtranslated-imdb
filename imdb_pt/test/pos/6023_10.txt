This is the best version of Gypsy that was filmed. Bette Midler is simply superb as Mama Rose. She has the voice, the gestures, the look and, above all, a supreme acting ability to perform the role and make her character come alive. Her singing is, simply put: MAGNIFICENT! She shines especially in two numbers - "Everything's Coming Roses" and "Rose's Turn." The other actors are also well, particularly Christine Ebersoll as Tessie. Also good is Peter Riegert, his interpretation of Herbie is represented with great style and credibility. The direction of this film is very, very good. In all production, this film is a big improvement over the Roz Russell version, filmed in 1962. Ever since I saw him again, I can state that the three greatest Mama Roses are: Ethel Merman, Bette Midler and Angela Lansbury. Watch this movie. You'll be glad you did.
