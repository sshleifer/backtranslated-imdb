Ladies and gentlemen, the show begins with this documentary. It is structured in three chapters, each organized chronologically. The first presents the classical physics and links to Einstein. The second study in depth the quantum physics and enters the theory of Strings. The latter reveals the theory of Everything ... The difficult concepts used here are introduced very simply, with everyday objects; although you must believe in them without checking for yourself - if you are not a scientist (and even if you are a scientist!). The film is not a masterpiece because of its fabulous technique or the way it is produced; what really matters is the history, and WHAT A HISTORY !!!
