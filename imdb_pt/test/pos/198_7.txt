The Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me a lot of young Audrey Hepburn and the camera of the movie The caves fly seems to like her so much. It is the focal point of a bittersweet war novel against the backdrop of World War II in Moscow. <br /> <br /> The film is almost poetic in its stunning black and white cinematography that was the main reason to watch the film in the first film. place, since I had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on TCM. <br /> <br /> It's a very touching love story about a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly snatched away by her role as a soldier drawn up in Russia during the war. She is unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him, but inexplicably marries someone who has forced herself to her, a pianist who soon realizes she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear. Their marriage is troublesome because she can not leave her memory of a happier time with her soldier boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Until the end of the story, she accepts the idea that he will never return. and is able to face reality and deal with the situation. There is a very moving final scene at a train station where soldiers arrive greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers, giving some flowers from her bouquet to the gay families. <br /> <br /> The elegant and striking camera work is what carries the film as well as honestly played story. <br /> <br /> Tastefully done, but perhaps English subtitles have not told the whole story, because some of the plot elements seemed a bit confusing to me as if they had been covered up. <br /> <br /> In short: It is easy to understand why he won awards at the Cannes Film Festival. It reminded me, in great style, of another great Russian film, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER.
