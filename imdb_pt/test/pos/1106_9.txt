We received this DVD from the ACCENT range, which is a publisher specializing in art-house flics, have released Irreversible and a number of Bergman options. What impressed me about the oddly titled Alex Frayne LOVE movie is that it's a flawless movie that breathes with perfection and vision, a movie that brings us to the mind of Mr. Joe Average, full of voices in head, visions, and madness. It is set in the rural redneck of Australia, the film does not trivialize or praise the staff like so many Australian films. that is, our films are full of "lovable ladinos" or people with "golden hearts", etc, etc etc. <br /> <br /> Not in this movie. The spirit of Stanley Kubrick is great here, not perfect, but has a fascinating attention to detail, a romantic outline and a mood that is exhilarating if not acceptable. <br /> <br /> Smaller reasoning ... the transfer seems flawed - the front credits have been cut, they do not fit into the frame. <br /> <br /> In addition, one of the short films is corrupted, it stops halfway.
