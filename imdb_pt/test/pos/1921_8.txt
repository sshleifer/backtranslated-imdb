Even if you do not like documentaries, you'll probably find that fascinating. Not only is there a well-mapped plot that, though easy to follow, contains its interesting detours; It also has a very strong emotional resonance, not one that is based on a simple specific tone. Instead, the emotions here are as deep and turbulent as the seas. <br /> <br /> That being said, if you know nothing about Donald Crowhurst and the 1968 boat race around the world ... as was the case for me ... please stop reading and renting / Watch this movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOLLOW <br /> <br /> My friend Brian recommended this at the same time that my aunt sent me a cut linking this film with Antonioni's work. In 2007, I was hypnotized by several Antonioni Films, I still am! To connect this movie with Antonioni, I think it's a bit exaggerated, the character most likely to be seen in one of Michaelangelo's films is Fran√ßoise Moitessier de Cazalet. It's funny on the IMDb homepage, he's not even listed as "Himself," which is probably a function of his long name as opposed to his self-realization / renunciation. Since Moitessier gets out of the race, this can be considered a bit like Anna in L'Aventura. A great secondary character. <br /> <br /> Although there are many things to love in this film: the actual filming of the time, the best stoic friend, the absolute power of the Forty-Two, I came out with a simple connection. A truly man at sea. There have been times in my life when I wonder how I got to that point, caught between dreams and reality, feeling like a clandestine in my own skin. It may be that I'm reading too much in this documentary, and that the directors in turn read a lot in Crowhurst, but I found that sense as fascinating as the other secrets kept in this film. On the strange chance that Crowhurst's wife (which seemed a remarkable study to restrict with understandably conflicting connotations) and her children (so young in the images found, and still young at this late date in the sense of their pain and pride for his father), I am sure that the comments here and the film itself can not catch the man his father was. At his death, however, he gave the world a glimpse of something like a lost myth, he is a pre-GPS Odysseus. Never finding his body increases the air of fragile immortality, if not the stature of a cosmic being of which he had written. <br /> <br /> This movie gets you after the show, as if you expected another turnaround emerge from the deep waters. Or, at the very least, you expect the continuation of Moitessier. <br /> <br /> Thurston Hunger 8/10
