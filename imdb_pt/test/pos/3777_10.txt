Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde. <br /> <br /> Michael McGuire was the father. <br /> <br /> Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon. <br /> <br /> Have you seen this movie? ? I doubt it! <br /> <br /> Blankfield was quite popular right now for playing the doctor taking pills on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from films to series and stand-up comedy. If I find this movie on DVD, I will definitely buy it. I recorded this HBO movie in '82 and I've used the tape a lot. One of the funniest takes on the theme Jekyll & Hyde. <br /> <br /> Of course. With all the cocaine references in this film, it would be criticized for being very politically incorrect today, as well as Cheech and Chong. Too bad, because it's FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY!
