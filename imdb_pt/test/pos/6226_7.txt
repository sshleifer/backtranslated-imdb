Tourist Trap (1979) is a fun horror movie from the late 70's, the movie is about a group of young friends stranded on an old deserted street by an old and scary wax museum. The owner of the museum looks like a strange but harmless old man, but things take a very unpleasant turn when members of the young group begin to be killed, who is responsible for the murders, is the old Slausen or is it his collection of creepy mannequins that seems to be alive and hungry for blood !!!! This movie was good, it was fast, the performances were very good from the actors / actresses (Tanya Roberts was very sexy) and the film was never boring, and as I said, it had some very scary scenes, so be prepared to hide under the covered! Definitely recommended for horror movie fans / ghost stories! I give this movie a highly respectable 7.2 out of 10.
