If there is a cartoon that helped put the UPA on the map more than any other, it's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a boy who speaks only of sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, he loved music, abstract animation and backgrounds, Marvin Miller's narration, practically everything. And it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film of 1950. I'm glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how amazing! I hope to see the subsequent short films made in the series, if not on YouTube, then maybe in a DVD collection. Now I think I'll watch another short UPA there ...
