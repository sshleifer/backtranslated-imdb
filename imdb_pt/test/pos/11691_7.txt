This film by well-known Czech collaborator and writer Petr Jarchovský is notable for its particularity, but it is annoying and distracting in its details. Taking his theme and title from a poem by Robert Graves, he deals with a woman with several men and some unpleasant relatives in her life who are trying to survive and protect her two children, 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and asthmatic blonde little. Kuba (Adam Misik). The poem is very much in evidence, but the theme - gets a little lost. Marcela (Anna Geislerová), Beauty, and Jarda (Roman Luknár) lost everything in the floods of Prague in 2002 and apparently nothing is left but good sex, in which they go with so much vengeance in his tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the television, must keep their ears attentive to the noise. Hrebejek appreciates such clarification and skates on the verge of embarrassment or shock. There is not a good explanation as to why, but financial desperation led Jarda to process stolen cars in the large garage that sits next to her flatlet. His cohort of carriages threw out an elegant Volvo that Benes (Josef Abrham) left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large estate he owns. Benes is a super cool guy, but he's not stupid. Your Volvo is turned on for satellite tracking in cases like this and this takes the cops directly to the Yard garage and he and his cohort are trapped. <br /> <br /> "Beauty in distress flee to the good angel, / Whom she can trust," begins the poem Graves. But in fact, this fight takes Benes to Marcela, when he finds her at the police station. He introduces her to sushi and drinks wine and dresses with an illustrated book about Tuscany, where he, although born in Prague, owns a beautiful village and lived most of his life. He is here to recover the house in Prague, now occupied by a couple with an old and sick mother, whom he allows to remain. All gestures of Benes are benevolent, although he does not prevent Jarda from being arrested. In these circumstances, Marcela must withdraw with Lucina and Kuba to depend on her mother's charity Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the much less tender mercies of Zdena's current husband, the skeletal diabetic Richard Hrstka ( Jiri Schmitzer) - which, for children, starting when they commit the main sin of consuming their dietary biscuits, proves to be the uncle of hell. Jiri Schmitzer kidnaps the movie right now, and he never lets it go. Even in the final scene, he is a malicious threat figure. It is surprising that the detestable Richard does not sexually abuse one or both children. He insists that Marcela needs to go out alone, and when Benes offers to take care of her, he and Richard become unlikely allies. Unlikely - perhaps implausible. Why should Benes like him? But then, what is the whole story of Benes? On some things, the film gives a lot of information and about others, not enough. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the "good angel," Benes is infallibly kind - and an older, polished, good-looking man whose manners fit his Italian creation. It is only in the end, when he is pushed to the limits of his property in Prague by the rogue occupants, he proves that he is not someone who does not want to lie down and be stepped on. Also the religious fanatical mother of Jarda, Sdena (Jana Brejchova) should be treated, and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to be observed. But she's just another wild card that does not raise the deck. <br /> <br /> The poem was played in a Czech translation and sung on the screen by vocalist-accordionist Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extensive scene staged at a prison presentation witnessed by Yard and car thief friend. If you revere Hrebejk as an author, you can appreciate this sequence; otherwise, it tends to feel free. Also included are several songs by Glen Hansard / Marketa Irglova from the Oscar-winning Irish musical film 'Once', including the theme song from the last album, 'Falling'. They feel more out of place than otherwise because of their 'Once' familiarity - although this movie first came out. <br /> <br /> Hrebejk's staff is arresting; even little Koba has his Shakespearian childish moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to stray and expand too much. The problem Benes faces may be helpful in showing that he has a difficult side. But such an elaborate demonstration was not necessary. The acting is good, and there is a marvelous with strangeness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex and money get lost in the confusion and Marcela's conflicts and how she solves them never become clear. It is good that there is no resolution and be faithful to the theme and poem of Graves that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda during a visit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and their children. But there are still many doubts about what to do with the annoying Richard or with the annoyingly pious mother of Jarda (Emília Vásáryová). How come, all of a sudden, we learn that Koba is getting letters from "India" supposedly from his father, who is in custody? When did this happen? Interesting details, pasted in a hurry. It looks like a world where you can not see the forest to the trees.
