I was really surprised to see that, unlike most documentaries, this was written, directed and produced by a film critic - Richard Schickel. Most of the time I know where film critics have been heavily involved in movies, movies turn into bombs (Rex Reed starring in "Myra Breckenridge" and Roger Ebert writing "Beyond the Doll Valley" are great examples). However, in this case, the critic's powers are used for good rather than evil - and the results are better (though that is not saying much, since the films I just mentioned are among the worst movies ever made). As for the documentary, it is narrated by Clint Eastwood (a good choice) and manages to discuss his long career - from his days of silence to his death in the early 1960s. The only negatives, and they are small, are that the film is very short (like most film documentaries) and there is very little about Gary Cooper as a human being - you really do not learn much about your life. However, as a good overview of your movies, it works very well.
