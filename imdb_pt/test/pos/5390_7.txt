Gary Cooper is a cool guy. I've always liked his easy-to-use characters. As some others have commented, there are some oddities in the script, like a US Marshall who got his job and can not even hit a barn with a pistol. A farmer with about thirty hands, but he can not seem to stop his cattle being taken away. <br /> <br /> But there's a quick, direct reasoning for Cooper to keep you entertained. <br /> This film was made in the 1950s. People in their 20s and 30s have trouble understanding that the films were made for entertainment, not Oscar. <br /> <br /> Waiting for Oscar material does this cinematic injustice. It's about the good guys to find a way around the villains. <br /> <br /> So rent, borrow or buy this movie, make some corn and enjoy the Coop once again.
