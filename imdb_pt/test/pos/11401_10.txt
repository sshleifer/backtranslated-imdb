Paul Thomas Anderson's elegant and irresistible vision of the porn industry of the 1970s follows Eddie Adams, also known as Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), through six years of sex, drugs and disco. His chance encounter with porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) begins his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the era. Dirk's character is based on the real porn actor John Holmes, who, like Dirk, was known to be extremely "well endowed." This is where Dirk finds the initial success. <br /> <br /> The main themes of Boogie Nights are the obvious themes related to a movie of this genre; pornography, drugs, sex, betrayal, violence and music. Boogie Nights deals with the subject of pornography with some control. It is not exaggerated and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal, but mentally explicit when they occur on the screen. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, cocaine is abusively abused, and the setting of the movie, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the drug's popularity at the time, which the film captures perfectly. However, Boogie Nights does not promote cocaine as there are scenes involving addiction and overdoses. For example, at Jack's party, they meet a girl who recently and graphically had an overdose; blood drips from her nose and she begins an unconscious attack. The film, before this scene, has been quite optimistic and comic, but from this point on, foreshadows the darkness that will occur. <br /> <br /> The musical scenes are performed brilliantly, from superbly staged disco scenes to Dirk's out and about singing terribly in his new musical career. The soundtrack is also great, with songs from The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and the unforgettable sound experience. The highlight scene in the entire film comes down to music; Dirk, Redd Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) visit the home of drug dealer Rahad Jackson (Alfred Molina) in order to make money selling fake drugs, but Sister Christian of Night Ranger , which is playing background, increases the intensity of the scene incredibly, proving that the music can bring much more depth to a scene. Boogie Nights is full of such scenes, which makes the movie even more fantastic. <br /> <br /> The highlight in Boogie Nights is Burt Reynolds as the enigmatic movie director. In the scene in which he attacks a young guy for slater his films, it is a complete shock to the public, because before this point he has been quite mature and contented. Other notable performances are Julianne Moore, Heather Graham as the beautiful Rollergirl, John C. Reilly and Mark Wahlberg, who presents the performance of his career. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original movie, using themes but filmed in a realistic and realistic way. Anderson's approach was totally captured in these characters in a time when nothing seemed to go wrong, or at least until the 1980s. From there, things get very dark, and all the characters' signs and recognizable situations from the first part of the movie have disappeared. This, however, does not reduce the high level of engaging entertainment that this movie offers. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights was not a blockbuster, earning only Â£ 2 million in theaters in the UK. But this is not the concern of the movie or the director. Anderson acknowledges quality, not popularity, which is evident in his other three films, Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a simple parable full of great and variable situations, because at the end of this movie you will realize that Boogie Nights is a simple morality tale but one that will stay in the mind days after watching it. Boogie Nights is both shocking, hilarious, devastating and visually and audibly exceptional.
