I was fortunate to see a performance of this remarkable short film by Joshua Leonard prior to its premiere at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. In twelve short but exquisite minutes, Leonard takes us on a life-changing journey as he investigates one of the issues social, and ethical issues that our society faces. The film incorporates elegant direction, thrilling performances and a heartbreaking story. Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate like the two lovers. And in his first adventure in the dramatic narrative, Leonard proves to be a director with a propitious future. I feel this short must be expanded into a movie. It's hard to describe talent, but as this debut movie proves, you know it when you see it!
