The cast of power pulls the crowd into the theater, despite the ominous title. Jake Gyllenhaal invited Conan O'Brien to promote the film and explained that "Rendition" was a euphemism for information through torture. Since Sept. 11, "extraordinary rendition" has allowed the government intelligence agency to extract untested people without due process and use any necessary means in exchange for information. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaal plays the new CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (note the irony that is divided over his designation that makes him a mere observer of heterodox interrogation procedures in an underground detention facility outside the US <br /> < Omar Metwally plays the terrorist suspect Anwar El-Ibrahimi, an Egyptian husband and ecologist of the American Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon) .Hisabella and his son hope that Anwar returns home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the passenger manifest of the plane.Ã‚ She seeks help from her college friend who works in government and learns that Chief of Intelligence, Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) is behind everything. Surrender is directed by Hollywood rookie Gavin Hood (who is scheduled to make X-Men Origins: Wolverine), and raises the question of whether such "extraordinary surrender" is exercised in real life. i was released locally following the Glorietta (bombing / misfortune) explosion, and a crucial scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public square, so this must have sent shivers down the spine of all viewers. Seeing the picture exploding with a solitary red and yellow signal Aajala (Ayala?) In the upper right hand of the screen, plus the effect of silence and slow moving images have magnified the impact of the real-life coincidence of the scene. <br /> <br /> There are lessons to learn from this movie and it all comes down to the personal decisions we make every day. We all have choices that we can exercise at will, and we often do not always want to see how it affects others, who may end up as unfortunate victims of circumstances. What the 'greater good' should not have to be a forced choice that our leaders must take if each of us already decides correctly at the source. Now this is a utopia worth building.
