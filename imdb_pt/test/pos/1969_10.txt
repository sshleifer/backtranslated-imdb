This was a film that I found by chance. I was flipping over and saw that it was on Showtime, so I watched. Now I watch at least once a month. This is a movie that is full of symbols that can cause some people to destroy it. Do not listen to people who hate this movie, if they want an action movie with f / x expensive, they should have rented a movie that promises them. If you're in the mood for good science fiction, I recommend it. If you buy on DVD, I recommend the Alliance Atlantic edition of the film, it contains many more extras than the edition of Dimension Films.
