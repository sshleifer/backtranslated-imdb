Being advertised as the most expensive film ever made in the Czech Republic, it automatically does what you think will be most glorified and clich√© (for fear of budgeting). However, with a budget of 8 million and half the film in English, it was not exactly a big budget, a high-risk film. <br /> <br /> What we have is a great epic tale centered on the friendship of two people, Karel and old Frantisek. As pilots of the Czech air force when the Germans invade before the beginning of the Second World War, they escape from the country to England to join the RAF. <br /> <br /> Their friendship becomes tense through the love of the same woman. However, there is a bond of friendship that goes beyond being merely friendly. His friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the Czech people and their country. Remember that they were not the winners, they defeated the Germans only to be invaded by the Russians. <br /> <br /> Funny, exciting, intriguing, beautiful, sad and enlightening this movie is one of my favorite war movies. Most of all, I like the way they make fun of the British in a way that is incredibly endearing and gives a surprising insight into how the British military fought World War II. <br /> <br /> Forget the recent American efforts (Peal Harbor, Saving Private Ryan), this is the best WWII movie for a long time.
