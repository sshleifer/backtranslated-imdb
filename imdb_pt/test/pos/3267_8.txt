Jordan takes us to the crime scene in Sydney, Australia after the desperate attempt of nineteen-year-old (Heath Ledger), who arranges a job for a local gangster and needs to do some repair before getting to him. The gangsters (led by Bryan Brown) are a threatening bunch with a good-humored trait. That's what makes the movie work, because we always see the gangsters as a hard bunch to screw you. But this crowd also tickles your funny bone. A smart and structured script from Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught up in the web plot.
