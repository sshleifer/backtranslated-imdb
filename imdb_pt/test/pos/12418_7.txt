I have Monster Man in a box of three movies, where I mostly wanted the other two but still had a really nice time with that. It combines horror and comedy to a reasonable effect, helped considerably by the decent performances of Eric Jungman as the nerd leader, Justin Urich as his hole friend and Aimee Brooks as the love interest. The film is quite predictable and mine ideas from a number of other films, but it remains fun everywhere, with some good and horrifying depths. Of course it does not compare to the classic bloody comedies, but this still works well. Director Michael Davis still manages one or two scary scenes, such as in the bathroom or bar. The film is likely to be watched in any case a little confusing and written and for me only lost a little at the end when the title Monster Man begins to resemble a Slipknot member and the film tries to go more to the horror style , but it is not twisted or convincing enough. The final moments are also a bit weak. Still, despite the lack of much suspense and general nonsense, this is a good example of unpretentious, often moody comedy that should please fans of it.
