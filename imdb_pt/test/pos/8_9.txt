I am a First Class NCO (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and feel that this film strongly represents the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were much sought after. The most forced was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went down inside the sinking ship to pull the captain of the vessel out of the engine room ... that would never happen. Swimmers can not enter any ship, whatever the circumstance. Second, the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak) looked more like a NASA command center ... we do not have high-tech equipment. Third, the Air Station Captain would not be performing search and rescue cases with 10 people on watch. In fact, it would be an E-6 or E-7 as the SAR Controller and maybe 2 other support staff, such as a SAR Controller and a Radio Watchstander. Otherwise, the movie was dead, I think they should have incorporated more of the other GC rates and their search and rescue roles, instead of just Aviation-based fees. Some of the "A" school scenes reminded me of my days and the stupid things I did and got into trouble in my early days.
