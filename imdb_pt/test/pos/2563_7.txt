The trailer for this film has focused so much on the chain (of course, because it is so sensational) that it missed most of the film, which is about a somewhat simple, though somewhat simple, development relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they try to recover from their past pains together. <br /> <br /> Of course, with the premise of a chained nymphomaniac, it is not surprising that there is too much implicit sex involved. However, at its core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping someone else. Maybe it's just me, but I think poor Lazarus should have his story focused on more. He is a wounded man after his wife leaves him, but we never see fully how to help Rae solve her past pains as well the priest. It is only implicit that this happens - in essence he plays the mage who helps the young Rae to overcome his curse, through a large old chain and some blues. <br /> <br /> I like the story, but I wish it was a little more uniform and did not have to depend on the sensational. The secondary characters were pretty decent, if simple and I liked the music. The acting was good enough, though I can not be sure if the Rae character is totally believable. But that may just be my naivety. <br /> <br /> All in all, I liked the movie, but I was not compelled by it. Maybe it's because I'm very critical, but the story seems a little too convenient to be totally believable and while everything looked really cool, I could never really buy. The jail thing was a bit exaggerated for me. Still, this may provide some entertainment for those seeking dramatic rescue stories with a blues photo. 7/10
