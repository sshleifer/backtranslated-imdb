Piper, Prue and Phoebe bring Dr. Griffiths to the mansion in order to try to save him from the source's personal killer, Shax. As Phoebe searches the Book of Shadows for a spell to defeat Shax, Prue and Piper are attacked by Shax and chase him down the street. Unbeknownst to Prue and Piper, they were filmed by a reporter and his videographer using their powers and broadcast live on national television. With Phoebe in the underworld, Prue, Piper and Leo must find a way to reverse the damage done. Leo goes to Phoebe and tells her that the Charmed Ones have been exposed as witches. On the surface, Piper is shot by a maniac aspiring witch, and Prue has to take her to the hospital. The problem here is that the crowds are blocking the driveway. So Prue has to use her magic in the crowd, and they go to the hospital. Piper is pronounced dead, and a SWAT team comes into action. Leo discovers Piper's death and goes downstairs to tell Phoebe. Cole is asked to ask The Source to redefine the time, and The Source agrees; only if Phoebe turns to the dark side. Phoebe agrees, but the deal will destroy them. On the surface, Prue and Piper are fighting against Shax. Prue yells at Phoebe, who without their knowledge is in the underworld. Shax plays Piper and Prue by a wall, and Dr. Griffiths walks out the window. Prue is not pronounced dead until the episode of the Season 4 Premiere, "Charmed Again, Part One." <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is an exciting episode, and made me sit on the edge of my seat. . It's sad that Prue is dead, but happy that there will be another five seasons of Charmed. My vote; 10 out of 10. EXCELLENT
