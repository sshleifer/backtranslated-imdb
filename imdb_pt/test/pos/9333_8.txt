Although I am not a fan of Michael Jackson, I like some of his early songs and some of Jackson 5 as well. 'Thriller' is one of their greatest songs and comes from the best selling album ever with the same title. As for the video, it's incredible, one of Michael's best, but also very eccentric and weird. <br /> <br /> There is a story behind this video, but it is so complex that I can not fully understand it. It's weird. The strangest things are Jackson's transformation into a werewolf, his evil red eyes at the end (like a werewolf) and those dead people dancing. <br /> <br /> The video is very dark, exciting, cold and original. There are excellent settings and settings. The music itself is full of life and rhythm, characteristic of good old 80's pop. <br /> <br /> I like Vincent Price's soliloquy. He makes a great narration with his unique and distinct voice and his maleficent laughter in the end is incredible! My favorite 'King of Pop' videos are 'Billie Jean' and 'Do not stop' until you have enough '(both of your best songs).
