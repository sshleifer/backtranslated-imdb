Clouzot followed Le Corbeau, where no one knew who was writing the poison, so they were all suspicious, with another masterpiece, Quai des Orfevres, four years later, in which we know from the beginning (or think we do) that we do not know. Louis Jouvet's first line did not appear forty minutes ago, by which time Clouzot established a rich environment of Music Hall, music editors, etc. and an excellent cast of colorful characters; Angela Lansbury's look-alike (Lansbury appeared in Paris Woman the same year) Suzy Delair scores as the singer whose desire for better luck inspires the envy of her husband / companion Bernard Blier, who follows her to an old man's home to discover is already dead. Then things go very seriously, his car is stolen before leaving the scene so that his prearranged alibi leaves the window while at the same time unknown to him, his wife confesses the murder to the neighbor photographer, a lesbian in love with she, who volunteers to return to the crime scene and pick up Delair's handkerchief and while she's there, carefully wipes off her prints of the murder weapon, a bottle of champagne. At this point, the investigator Jouvet gets involved and from there it's a case of keeping the dishes spinning in the air. Clouzot's production was relatively small, but virtually all of it was, as Spencer Tracey said in another context, "cherce", with Le Salaire de peur and Les Diaboliques still to come. In short, this is a must for fans of French cinema.
