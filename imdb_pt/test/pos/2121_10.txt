I went to the Preview Engagement of the "Grand Champion" today (Dallas / Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and a few other cities in Texas). There are so few movies suitable for small children ... but this is it, and it's great. Although the plot is a little "Hokey" (also the name of the ox in the film), it is a wonderful story for children. And I also liked it. <br /> <br /> The film represents very well the family life on the ranch of West Texas, though a bit exaggerated. Director / Author Barry Tubb must hit right since he grew up in that environment. He called the film his "love letter to Texas." <br /> <br /> Joey Lauren Adams plays the single mother of Buddy (Jacob Fisher) and Sister 'Blow' (Emma Roberts). See Emma Roberts (niece of Julia Roberts); she's very good and I think she'll be in more movies. There are also appearances by Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, George Strait musicians, Charlie Robison, Robert Earl Keen, Joe Ely and rodeo legends Larry Mahan and Tuff Hedeman. <br /> <br /> If you have small children or just want To watch a wellness movie, check out "Grand Champion" when it comes to your city (supposedly later this month). You will have fun and it will make you feel good. <br /> <br /> I think since I'm from West Texas, I can be a bit biased ... nah, I'm unbiased. The movie is great!
