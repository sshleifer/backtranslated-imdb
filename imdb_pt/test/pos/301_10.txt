Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great end to a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s, there was an atmosphere of tolerance, open-mindedness, and progressiveness among the studios that allowed great films to be made by some of the best directors the United States ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (some being the violent death of great figures from American political and cultural scenes, racial struggles, the rise of the 1960s counterculture, increased violence and violence) . the death on the streets ...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare, be different and create fun and intelligent films. Coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skilful cinema, following the parameters of war and adventure films, and at the same time subverting them with their fluent reflections on the value of life, the reason for death, or the ethics of movie. war. It is also a passionate work, made against all odds, narrated in the 1991 documentary "Hearts of Darkness: The Apocalypse of a Filmmaker"; a film that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam War to get to the screen. Coppola challenged the formula of the classic melodrama found in two Vietnam films made simultaneously, "The Huntsman" and "Coming Home", or in others as "Platoon" and "Casualties of War," before Vietnam became the starting point for making products of any genre, such as horror in "Jacob's Ladder," or comedies like "Good Morning, Vietnam" among the most respectable. Coppola had the courage to face this economic and political conflict as the background of a quest for answers to the issues faced by any man every day of his life without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war.
