I read the other reviews here about this movie before watching it. If you have read them, you will know that they are almost all negative. I really do not understand this. I admit it's too long (need about half an hour to speed up a bit). Music is often inadequate. But, strong performances from Ford and Thomas are really enough for that. With all his fame as a movie star, I forgot that Harrison Ford really can act! This role as a man who has settled on a lie is remarkable. I find it quite believable that he wants every detail he can so he can see what was real and what was wrong. Thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception. Their initial denial that leads to confusion and then inner calm is tremendous. This movie will never be on anyone's great movie list, but it's not that bad. Glad we waited to see it on video, but worth the $ 3 or $ 4.
