One type of western that I like very much is when the seemingly weak, who is reluctant to fight and respond to the challenge of the strong, finally decides that there is no other way. There is a great moment in this film when John Parrish (Glenn Ford) enters the hall and decides to face the Wade Matlock sniper. It's the kind of scene that makes the audience cheer. In my opinion, The Violent Men is a great western, I would rate it among the best. Makes great use of the wide screen, a spectacular scenery of the mountains. Women have a crucial role to play. Caroline (May Winn) is engaged to Parrish, but you feel she is just using it as a means of getting out of there and moving to the east. She wants him to sell the ranch no matter what the price. Martha (Barbara Stanwick), is tired of helping her crippled husband Lee (Edward G. Robinson), but she will do anything to have an ever-larger ranch and more power. Meanwhile, she's cheating on her husband with his brother (Brian Keith). His daughter Judith (Diane Foster) is seeing everything that happens, but feeling powerless to react, because she does not want to hurt her father. Parrish unites all the small farmers and uses the strategy that he learned in the army to go against the Anchor ranch. As he had warned Lee, "Do not make me fight because you will not like the way I fight."
