I liked this movie. That's pretty much all I can say about it. Lou Gossett did a good job, although I'm still very disappointed with him after all the Iron Eagle movies. And even though I was smiling inside when the first main teenager dies (I will not give it for free), it was done in a nice and appropriate way. Almost everyone in this movie does a good job, so check it out! It's one of those movies that I found very cheap so I bought it, and I recommend the same.
