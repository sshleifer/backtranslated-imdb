* May contain Spoilers * The first time I saw this movie was when it was replayed on video when I was about 8 years old. Now I'm 17 and I still watch whenever I have a chance. "The Aristocats" was a cute-heart movie that I fell in love with right away. I loved the songs, especially those that the kittens sing at the piano. In fact, I even sang at a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it very much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the most beautiful cats I have ever seen. The Allied cat had a great voice! <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when the kittens are playing the piano. That part is lovely. I also enjoy your journey home. It's incredible. This is one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen and one of my favorites. Everyone should see this. I give this film 10/10 stars.
