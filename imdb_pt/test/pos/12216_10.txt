Surface is one of the best shows I've ever seen. NBC is so stupid to cancel a big show like this and, worst of all, leave it incomplete. NBC or another person must give Surface a minimum of one more season before it can be completed. It's as if NBC gave you a book to read and in the middle of it they decided to take it away from you and then the end would never be discovered. I just want to see what happens to everyone and, more importantly, see what happens to Nim. I think I can say this with confidence about the majority of Surface fans, we want to save Nim! Nim took away all our hearts, and then NBC only cuts them in two. Come to NBC, just give Surface another season!
