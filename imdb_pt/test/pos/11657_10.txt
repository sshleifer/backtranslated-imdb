The biggest effort, in addition to the best cast ever set in a movie by director Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn in the front row. Someone said that this movie is good because directed and written by Tim Robbins, but I convince you that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon gave me a truly superb performance that I exclaimed my heart. Your performance is so real! No doubt about it that this movie is rated 4 and 3/4 of 5!
