** HERE ARE SPOILERS ** Summary: Macleane (Miller) witnesses an assault of Plunkett (Carlyle) that went wrong. Plunkett's partner is shot (and killed), but only after swallowing a large ruby. Plunkett and Macleane meet in the graveyard when they both try to get hold of the ruby. Unfortunately they are caught as grave robbers and sent to prison, but not until Plunkett has swallowed the ruby. Ruby is the key to freedom and, once free, forms a partnership in stealing. Macleane is posing as a gentleman and finding out who is worth stealing, and then simply stealing it (and stealing it in style). But Macleane falls in love with the niece / daughter (?) Of his first victim, the lady Rebecca Gibson (Tyler). And Mr. Chance (Stott) is out to get them, and his methods are not very pleasant ... Comments: A good action with a taste of comedy and adventure. Carlyle and Miller make a good team, with a lot of friction and friendship. And then there's the relationship between Macleane and Rebecca Gibson. The scene with the ball is very good, especially the use (anachronistic) of the song. In addition to these interesting characters, Cumming does the best of all, Lord Rochester. Both the character and the acting are stellar and are among the best in the film. Overall, the film works great, a good balance between story and special effects, action and comedy. Great fun. <br /> <br /> 8/10
