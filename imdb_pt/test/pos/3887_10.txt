Garlin is undoubtedly comedian and comedian of a comedian for whom he is looking for a good time. His first film, which is entirely his own creation and production, tells the story of a troubled Chicago actor, James Aaron, with whom Jeff obviously identifies himself. He juxtaposes James wonderfully with Paddy Chayefsky's "Marty" and Jackie Gleason's Poor Soul as he exposes James's dilemmas with a series of real-life actors who are Jeff's friends, many of whom are Second City alumni. <br /> He uses with pleasure Sarah Silverman's diametrical cuteness and absurdly absurd humor to exemplify how, despite common sense and talent, the contentment of life can often deny inflexible frustration. Bonnie Hunt gives a captivating performance as a romantic interest. <br /> <br /> Do not let a simple story fool you, the characters and the conflicts are well thought out and true. Those who follow Garlin's career and understand that his humor is based on telling reality with humor, not necessarily creating fiction that can easily be invented, will appreciate his story of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Surely we will see Garlin working much more as a director and writer with other talented intelligent comic actors who take on the great challenge of making life funny.
