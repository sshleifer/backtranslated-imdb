Personally, I do not really like black and white movies, but there's something magical about that movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). "Liz" writes a magazine column about how she is the 'Martha Stewart' from Connecticut. Of course, she's lying. This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr. Yardley, asks her to host a NAVY sailor for Christmas. In addition, Mr. Yardley, who will be alone at Christmas, invites himself to the farm for the Christmas party. From there, things just go crazy. Since the film is set on a New England farm, the film has a warm holiday feel. In addition, the characters are hilarious. Mr. Yardley is always shouting orders, and Liz's friend, Felix, is always shouting "Catastrofe!" when things go wrong. Finally, the movie ends as a Christmas movie should end; a gay fat man laughs and shouts "What a Christmas!" <br /> <br /> In short, no matter the age, you will love this movie.
