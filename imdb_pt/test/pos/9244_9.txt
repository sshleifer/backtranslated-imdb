I found this an entertaining account of the challenges that an independent filmmaker could encounter (something I never thought about). The movie managed to keep my interest all the time and I actually laughed out loud more than once! I'm not a filmmaker, so I do not know anything about the technology, but I found it well-edited and flowed smoothly telling the story. As a legal warning, I contributed to this effort after providing music for the soundtrack, but I was not involved in the creation of this movie and could not tell anything about Repo Man except that I remembered to see it back when I did not I'm really a sci-fi demon). I liked the movie comparisons made from punk rock to punk rock. My wife went with me to see the movie and she knew nothing about it before and we had a lot of fun.
