I found the movie Do not Look In The Basement very good, with some great characters. This is a young psychiatric nurse named nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) who will start working in an isolated mental asylum. While there, she encounters several different types of characters, including Dr. Geraldine Masters, who is in charge of the asylum after the owner of the hospital, Dr. Stephens, is killed by one of the patients, hitting him with an ax. My favorite characters in the movie are Ms. Challingham (Reah MacAdams), a very funny old lady, Allison who is a nymphomaniac, and Sam (Bill McGhee) a young black man who walks all day seeming to be in a world of his own all the time. The film was a low-budget film, but it was still a great movie. I know it was in the 'Video Nasties' list back in the 80's, but the did not think it had a lot of gore blood, despite having some disturbing senses in it great movie RECOMMENDED !!!.
