Kramer vs. Kramer is the story of a marital breakup and the consequences of it. They can be devastating for partners and even more so for a smaller child who, in this case, is played by Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about Kramer Vs. Kramer, is the greatest force as a movie. It is the way that parents Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep are presented to the public as whole people, with many sides in their nature. Although the film is tilted toward Hoffman and more about his relationship with his son, he is not presented as any kind of saint, nor is Streep a completely black villain. Hoffman is a career-oriented man in the advertising game. He practically ignored the dreams and aspirations of his wife, it is still a big shock for him when Streep says that love is no longer there and she wants to leave. She also wants to be a mother, at least for a while. <br /> <br /> Hoffman and Henry do the best they can. The pressure of being a father and mother causes Hoffman to lose his job and have to pay a smaller salary at another agency. At that point, after more than a year, Streep decides he wants custody. <br /> <br /> Both parents are convincing witnesses and declare their case beautifully, but in these situations, the tie is always broken in favor of the mother. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won their first two Oscars respectively for this film, she in the category of Supporting Actress. I'm not sure how these things are decided, Streep gets less screen time than Hoffman, if that's the determining factor. The film focuses on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his evolutionary perception that he has his share in guilt over the failure of marriage. As for Meryl, it is the choice of a Hob for her, as for many women, to balance a career and motherhood. The conflict in your psyche registers for everyone to see on the screen. Dustin Hoffman may have won this Oscar in part for the same reason that Spencer Tracy took his first, by performing the impossible task of not leaving a scene stealing child stealing the movie. Kids with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and Henry is great because he appears as a real kid, not a Hollywood kid. I wonder if Hoffman saw Captains Courageous and saw how Spencer Tracy dealt with Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could have done much worse than the Spencer Tracy channel in his performance. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs. Kramer also won the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and Best Adapted Screenplay. It is a clever and compelling drama about disengaging adults and trying to best deal with themselves and their children. Do not miss it if it ever gets transmitted.
