Being both a fan of Dario Argento and a fan of the Phantom of the Opera, I was dying to see his first version of the story, before Dario Argento's "Phantom of the Opera of Dario Argento". The film is simply fantastic, up to the plot, which here is one of the best of Argento in a coherent story. The way he transforms a classic romance story into a scary terrorist is simply fantastic. The film has a nightmarish feel, which helps to keep you on the edge of your seat. The colors have never been better in an Argento movie since the "Suspiria" of jaw-dropping. The murders are smart and bloody, all made in the trademark style of Argento. The thing with eyes in this film is just unsettling, and made some much better than in the splashes of Fulci. The acting is like that, but once you've seen the movie more often, you better understand the motivations of the characters and get used to it. My two biggest complaints about this is the use of rock. I think it was a clever idea to mix beautiful opera fragments with heavy-metal, but it's not very well executed here. The ending is VERY disappointing, which is the worst thing in the movie, seeming to echo Argento's previous "Phenomena," but done terribly, he just did not need to end it that way. The same thing happened in the director's version of "The Exorcist." I wish they would keep the original ending. But it's still a fantastic film and really a must-see, even if it's only for the memorable murder sequence of Daria Nicolodi.
