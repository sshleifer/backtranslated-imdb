This is one of my favorite T.V shows of all time, Rowan Atkinson is simply a genius !, and it's only fair that I chose this to be my 1000 review! I can not begin to tell you how much I love Mr. Bean, he is the man, and what strikes me, is how he comes out of these incredibly difficult situations, and he is always so creative, and Robyn Driscoll also deserves praise! he is also a genius! My favorite piece he did is the Amazing Adventures of Mr. Bean and while all the rest of them are amazing, this continues to be my true favorite, plus I wish the show would not stop so soon! Each episode is brilliantly written, and they were all masterfully directed, plus each episode is a classic in my eyes!. This show is incredibly popular, and I can definitely see why, as it is possibly the funniest show of all time. All character actors played very well, especially Robyn Driscoll and Matilda Ziegler (as Irma). This is one of my all time favorite TV shows Rowan Atkinso is simply putting a genius and an incredibly talented (possibly the best!) Comedian, and it's just fitting that I chose this to be my 1000 review f you did not see it show, quit what you're doing now and check it out, you will not regret it, trust me, it's one of the best TV shows of all time, and I'll continue to watch the show again and again, I'll never I get tired of it! , Mr. Bean Rules !. 5 out of 5
