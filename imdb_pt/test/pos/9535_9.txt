That brings back so many childhood memories. (I'm not old, I'm 19) It's wonderful. Trains, old house, fallen runner, really scary land slip (well is when you're 6), drama whether children can stop the train, or will it collide? This is a kid's movie, no doubt, but offers great harmless bloodless guts / guns etc for kids. And there's Bernard Cribbins, which is cool. 8/10
