Do not listen to what the critics have always said about this lovely little movie. Madonna is great at this clever comedy. I worked in a video store for several years and suggested this movie to many customers, no one ever brought it back and yelled at me for telling them to rent it. Everyone always liked it. It really is a great movie for kids too.
