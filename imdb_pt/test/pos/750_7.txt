I personally have a crush on horror movies that are set in hospitals and nursing homes, so I had a good feeling about watching this "Do not look in the basement," even if its reputation is dubious. Well, it turned out I was right! That's great, useless entertainment with a pair of efficient shocks and delightfully absurd characters. You have to, of course, look beyond the values ​​of bad productions and completely illogical plot, but if you can do that (and if you're a fan of that kind of horror, that's an essential quality), you'll be rewarded with a " video-nasty "in which blood and insanity form the main elements. The cute young nurse Charlotte arrives at a remote sanitarium where she should start her new job. She discovers that the doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the substitute Masters doctor seems reluctant to accept the new arrival. Life inside the sanitarium is quite peculiar, with patients running freely and each door is kept unlocked. After a series of bizarre events, Charlotte discovers the horrible secrets the institution hides .... The first 10 minutes (pre-credits) are great and the climax completely crazed. Everything in between is virtually unsurprising or tense, but you wait patiently because you feel the ending will be fun. Asylum patients are lunatics, but I love them anyway. Some of my favorites include the former judge (who still speaks exclusively in legal terms), the suspicious army sergeant and the old lady delirious. "Do not Look in the Basement" is a fun diversion, especially recommended for fans of the 1970s trash film, sick dogs and other types of scum. The lunatics took over the asylum, yes !!
