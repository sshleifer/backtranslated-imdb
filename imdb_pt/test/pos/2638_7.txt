_The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_, and _The Wild Life_ falls short. <br /> <br /> Some other stan wrote the above comment. Of course Wildlife is not a Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the 80's flamboyance par excellence. However, Wildlife is nice if you are not upset about irrational movies being foolish movies (especially when you know it's supposed to be an irrational movie in the first place). Scarface's little Latin is in this movie and he's direct disrespectful ("I have Visa ... Masterrrrr Charrrrge !!") The Colonel also makes an appearance ("Legal Process ..."). RIP The Colonel 1931-1997. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worse than a 6 compared to other genres, btw. No worse than a 7 in terms of other adolescent comedies of the 80's. It has a lot of the feel of a Cameron Crowe movie. Only staniels gave a 5.
