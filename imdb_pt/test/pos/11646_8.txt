Just to clarify, Matthew Poncelet was not a real person, but a combination of characters from two murderers who were convicted and sentenced to die for a murder of two teenagers. <br /> <br /> I read User Comments and they react as if Matthew were real. The character is based on a mix of two assassins, Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie (who murdered separate people) and the murder itself was based on what Willie committed. The conflict of both Willie having someone present and both parties swore that the other one killed is worked out in history as well. <br /> <br /> Prejean's approach is unique in that she is not only ministering to the condemned as they wait for her death and help them take responsibility for their actions, it also reaches the families of the victims, help them know that the convict actually felt remorse for what they did - effectively helping both parties. <br /> <br /> Everyone posting here seems to have strong beliefs about the death sentence. It is not my place to say that it is right or wrong - in theory punishing death with death does some kind of karmic sense, however much denying a person the freedom for the rest of his days, though expensive, makes more sense to me - getting stuck in a small room 23/7 (with an hour of exercise) for the rest of her days being reminded of the cruel thing that they seemed a more appropriate punishment - they are technically alive but denied to live. Let's say someone killed someone so they could get out of the responsibility that the person they killed demanded (like Susan Smith killing her poor children by pushing her car into a lake). I find it ironic that they did not have this "freedom" they wanted and would now have to spend the rest of their days in prison. <br /> <br /> Prejean's argument comes through the story very well. She has my respect, she can find that balance, she is not supporting a killer, she is guiding them to accept what they did. If they did not feel some kind of remorse, they would not ask for spiritual guidance. <br /> <br /> Ona final note, when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix for killing his son, the parents of the girl who was also murdered mumbles something about why he did not apologize for his death. I think the point is that throughout the movie, Poncelet denies killing the two children. There are doubts in Prejean's mind that he made the two deaths - there is a friend who was convicted, but not to death - my thought is that Poncelet killed the boy Delacroix and the other man murdered the girl - hence Poncelet took responsibility for what he did . If he had been responsible for the girl's death, he would probably have apologized for it too.
