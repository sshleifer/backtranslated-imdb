I saw this movie at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival in the theaters of the Palace, and I totally changed it for the first five minutes. Thank goodness for a film that ignores all the junk we often see in Australian movies that seem to revolve around a) race b) gender and class) in favor of er ... I dare say .... good good cinema . The producer, a shy and slightly eccentric guy named Alex Frayne, presented his film, made with a bunch of his close companions to the town he spent much of his childhood. Apparently, he spent much of last year traveling the world with the film, mainly in Europe. The world the film creates is both brilliant and artistic, not only due to the strange and bewildering editing style, the gothic characters and the surreal feel of time and place that draws viewers into their nightmare realm. <br /> <br /> producer returned to Q + A afterwards. Someone asked what his inspiration was - he replied "South Australia." Listen Listen! Another asked him what a "day in Alex's life" meant. He replied that he drives an old Ute, that he has breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant that he jolly well eaten in the last 8 years! and that he plays the piano that helps him think. He does not drink and plays cricket once a week. So the question-and-answer session ended abruptly because of the upcoming film screening - so my thinking is that for the next festival, they need to extend post-movie sessions.
