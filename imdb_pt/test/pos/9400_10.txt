This movie is on my list of 20 best comedies. This is a truly unique movie. To the reviewer who said "I must be really missing something" - you're correct. You're missing out on something. If you do not have the sense of humor this movie requires, that's one thing. But do not do a bad review because you think it's "crazy" but not meant to be. Loony is an appropriate description of what you want to be and what happens. I laughed much more often and much more intensely in this movie than in most other funny movies. Michael Almereyda brought out the best of his cast in his first major film, for which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Place. Crispin Glover, as usual, is absolutely brilliant in a perfectly inexplicable way, and some of his funniest lines have already been said in this film. Glover is clearly the best comic actor working now. Harry Dean Stanton puts it in an excellent comic book performance. William Burroughs is amazing in a small role. Dylan McDermott was ideally released, and Lois Chiles is completely excellent. <br /> <br /> All of the above are perfectly funny in their own perfect way, but this is one of Crispin's best performances - up there with his performances on River's Edge and Willard. If you are a fan of Crispin Glover but somehow neglected this movie, you need to stop whatever you are doing and see it right away. <br /> <br /> But remember to relax first, and maybe have a beer or something. This is a great movie, but it is very unusual, and I recommend being or inducing an appropriately silly state of mind before you see it.
