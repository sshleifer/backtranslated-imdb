"Jaded" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a city trying to escape her past. While there she meets two lesbians and after a few drinks the two decide to have fun. But one of the girls takes things a little too far and rapes her while the second girl holds her. She is discovered on the beach where the incident takes place the next day and is taken to a hospital. After that, we spent the rest of the movie watching her trying to take down the two girls and at the same time learn new information about who she is and where she comes from and a little about her past. <br /> <br /> - Director and co-writer Caryn Krooth does a great job with this movie considering its low budget uber. It's handy and sometimes looks like 16mm, but it fits the film since the story demands a tough look for it. All the actors do a good job with what is given to them and there is really nothing to complain about. The highlight of the film is, of course, Carla Gugino, who discovers everything in this film. She is actually more naked in this movie than she is in "Sin City". Christopher McDonald is also in the movie, but his character is kind of nonsense, but it's fun to watch. I did not really pay much attention to the song, since it does not really draw attention to itself, but it does work with what it has. The movie is rated R and it's for good reason. it is very sexual and very graphic at times. It's essentially borders on soft core at times, but the sex scenes are required for the movie, so it does not seem like it's there just for the sake of being there. While there is a nonsensical scene in which we see Chris McDonald, the scene was a bit pointless, but not a big deal, I guess. The only flaw in the movie is that we can not see the trial in court after everything we've been through in the movie. It's like having sex and not having an orgasm or something <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the talented Caryn Krooth has never made a movie since. This is a highly talented woman can do great things with a very small budget. I really hope she gets back into the game soon because she's an incredible director. Jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema, instead, what we have is a nice movie that shows a great director in training. <br /> <br /> - Hide the kids and close the curtains, you do not want people to think you're watching porn watching this movie.
