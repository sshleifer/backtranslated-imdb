This show is really good. Like all shows on TV, it has its good episodes and its bad ones. <br /> I read where people compare this show with Married with Children, and I suppose it's a similar show for the new generation. However, because of what was expected and allowed on TV in the days of Married with Children, this show was taken to great extremes to show that it was actually a television show, and should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> War at Home has the luxury of being a little more realistic. Parents talk to each other as real-life parents usually do, saying one thing to their children, when they will turn around and do the opposite. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the content can be considered controversial. But I think this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty. Like it or not, there are lots of families out there like this. <br /> <br /> Each episode teaches a 'valuable lesson'. It's just that sometimes the lesson is that you will not find a perfect solution to every problem a family can encounter, and sometimes the solution is to choose the lesser of two evils. We all know that in some cases as parents, the only goal you can have is to keep your kids away from big problems, and expect them to learn what is right and wrong. <br /> <br /> I respect the writers for trying to keep the show faithful to life, rather than having some magical end as the Cleaver family always had.
