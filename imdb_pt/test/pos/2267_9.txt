2005 was one of the best years for movies. We have had so many wonderful movies, like Batman Begins, Sin City, Corpse Bride, A History of Violence ..... Coming, we also have Brokeback Mountain, King Kong .... But if this year the only great movie that came outside was everything is lit so we would not lose all this year brought. The first film as director of the talented Liev Schreiber is a delightful, touching and moving drama that also brings one of the best roles of Elijah Wood. He is perfect as Jonathan, a curious man who heads to Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather in World War II. Liev Schreiber, who also writes the film, conducts a masterpiece with memorable scenes and (many) funny quotes. This here is a genuine mix of comedy and drama, bringing a movie that will be commented years from now. A serious Oscar nominee, Everything Is Illuminated is a powerful, original and, why not say, enlightened. But there is one thing you must remember when entering the movie: leave the normal behind. This is special .------ 9/10
