The video opens with a scene from a horror movie, in which a man proposes to his girlfriend. He begins to tell her that he is "different." When the full moon rises, it turns into a werewolf. He then chases her through the forest, and just before attacking, we are taken into the theater. Inside the theater are Michael and his girlfriend. She is too scared to watch any longer, so they leave. When they leave the theater, he begins to provoke her. ("It's almost midnight, something evil is lurking in the dark ...") Michael then sings and dances on the street with his girlfriend. This scene shows Michael's ability with the camera. He never acts "conscious" of his presence, as many other artists do. As they pass through the graveyard, the graves begin to open ... When they reach an alley, they are confronted with a horde of undead. Then we see the horrified face of Michael's girl. Who would not have a horrified look if their encounter turned into a zombie? Yes, he becomes one of the undead. (A very bright and brilliant, however.) He and his fellow zombies then begin what may be the best-known dance choreography of any music video. To tell you more, it would end. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite music video ever! You do not want to miss it! I give it a 10/10. (Yes, I know you can see the curtains on the back of the sound stage, and the werewolf looks kind of tacky by today's standards.)
