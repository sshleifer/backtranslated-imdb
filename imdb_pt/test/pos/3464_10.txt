If you want a movie with all the range of emotions, look no further; dramatic and funny, and scenes of painful emotion; I can guarantee with certainty that MANY few will be able to see this hot and VERY human movie without shedding a tear from time to time. The performance of the two leaderships is difficult to believe; you would swear that the two young people actually suffer from Muscular Dystrophy (Rory) and Cerebral Palsy (Michael); simply, two of the best performances I've ever seen; these are two very believable characters as well, and you never have the feeling that things have been "thrown" for dramatic purposes or to evoke sympathy. In the DVD release as "extras" they have "deleted scenes" (including an alternate ending) and an "extended party sequence"; why these clips were not included in the final film is difficult to understand, since they fit perfectly with the rest of the film and are by no means superfluous. But without reservations I can strongly recommend this movie to anyone; one of the best I've ever seen.
