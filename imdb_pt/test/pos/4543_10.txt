For fans of Chris Farley, this is probably his best film. David Spade plays the sarcastic and cynical yin perfect for Farley's "Baby Huey" yang. Farley achieves comic genius scrawls in his monologues, such as "Let's say you're driving down the road with your family ...", "Jo-Jo, the circus idiot, with a very new pet, ( its possible sale)) "speech, or the sale of" Glue-sniffing Guarantee fairy "brake pads. The sentimental moments of the film contrast sharply with the pranks of Farley and Spade. Even after many screenings, it's still fun to see Farley dump everything he had on paper. "Richard, WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?!?!"
