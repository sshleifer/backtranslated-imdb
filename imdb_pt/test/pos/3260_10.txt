Many years ago I saw this movie (on television, maybe?) And I loved it. So I decided to rent it on DVD the other day to see if it still resisted in my estimation. That happened. <br /> <br /> Located in Sydney's notorious King's Cross district (where prostitution, drug abuse and sex shops thrive), it tells the story of "Jimmy" (played by Heath Ledger). Jimmy is a young man ... maybe in his late teens or close, who does not have a stable family history. He is on the fringe of society, and works as a 'tout' for a sex club (encouraging people to enter the store). He is aware of an underworld figure called "Pando," who is a local figurehead on the Cross. It is Jimmy's hope that he will be on Pando's radar and enter with him ... a shortcut to upward social mobility, he hopes. <br /> <br /> One night Jimmy meets the beautiful young Alex (played by the lovely Rose Byrne). You just know that a love story will unfold between them. That night too, Jimmy is contacted for the first time by Pando (played by Bryan Brown). Pando has a "job" for Jimmy. It's the 'foot in the door' that Jimmy was waiting for! Revealing much more would spoil the many surprises that this movie has reserved for the viewer. Stylistically, if you like Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie movies, you should be in tune with what to expect ... twists and turns and black comedy comedy. <br /> <br /> What's so good about this movie is its '-ness'. It is not a mere imitation of Tarantino or Ritchie, but a genuine Australian contribution to the genre. <br /> <br /> One fascinating aspect of this movie is how it all fits together. Sometimes you are introduced to characters as you wonder what the hell they are doing there. In the end, all these "loose ends" come together beautifully. It's like a Moebius celesteid strip. <br /> <br /> One highlight of the film is Bryan Brown's Pando character. Pando enjoys puzzles, and it's fun to watch him play with his teammates. It's the little details revealed about him that are so enjoyable ... his musical taste to begin with! <br /> <br /> From the Heath Ledger movies I've seen (The Dark Knight, 10 Things I Hate About You) This may be your best role. It was not taken with "10 things". If you are a fan of Heath Ledger (Ledger recently died, a tragic and accidental death), this is a chance to see you in your biggest role in Australia, I think. There's a great chemistry between Ledger and Byrne in this movie - so, on one level, it works like a good love story. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have a bit of the horror of Tarantino and Ritchie's underworld movies, but it has some adult themes ... scenes that surprise you with its coolness and beauty. In that sense, it's not an ideal movie for very young viewers, but it's not a movie where panic dogs get excited about it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must say that it's great that Australia can make such great films. Usually, the kind of film that my country does can be a little cheery. This film has strengths where many Australian films have weak points ... that is, it has a great story, great acting and a great script. We need more popular and quality movies like this to be made here in Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. Other Australian films that I have loved include: Breaker Morant (10/10) Mad Max 2 (10/10) My Brilliant Career (not reviewed here by me yet) Proof (nr) Devil's Playground (nr) The Year in which My Voice Failed (nr) Bad Boy Bubby (The Big and the Dark Comedy) The Dish (An Excellent and Charming Comedy)
