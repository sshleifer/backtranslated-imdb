Imagine that episode of "Dragnet" where Friday and Gannon enter a typical 1970s hippie inequality lair, but instead of giving everyone a lecture, they "get some." That's "Joe" in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> This movie of a working-class fanatic and a rich guy who just killed the drug dealer's boyfriend dated terribly and most of the supporting acting is buzzing, but it's still interesting to watch. Peter Boyle, then about 35, plays Joe (the fanatic), and he looks like James Gandolfini. In her film debut, Susan Sarandon plays the daughter with flushed eyes, and although she does not necessarily insinuate her future greatness, you can not take her eyes off her.
