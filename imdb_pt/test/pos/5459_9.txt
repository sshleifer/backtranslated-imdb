Late Shift is a great book, I read the book several years ago, and I was paralyzed by the cruel debauchery that happened when Johnny Carson retired and Jay Leno and Johnny Carson tried to take their place. When the movie came out, I got a VHS copy of the movie and after reading the book recently, it's hard to say which one I like the most, because they are quite equal in the amount of information it conveys. The two protagonists, John Michael Higgins, and Daniel Roebuck, two actors I've never heard of before, and whom I've never heard of, interpret Leno and Letterman convincingly, despite Letterman's rejection of his portrayal of being poor. They play the parts very well, although many people look for an imitation of the two. I was not so interested in that. History is what counts. And that brings me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates, playing Helen Kushnick, is this movie. She plays this evil bitch of a character so menacingly that you realize how this woman can control herself, much less a national TV show. Damn it! There should be a sequel !!
