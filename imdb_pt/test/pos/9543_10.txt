I avoided this movie when I was a kid because I thought it would be annoying, not fighting or shooting, cops, thieves, cowboys or Indians. It was definitely not a cool movie to like. So I did not see CRT until I was twenty years old and I found one of the most beautiful and captivating movies I've ever seen. All actors deliver the characterizations perfectly and each emotion is drawn from the viewer scene to the scene. Filming and directing are deceptively simple, but they seem natural and have drawn me completely into the story. My two favorite scenes are Bobbie's birthday party and the scene on the station's platform near the end, directed and edited to perfection. The quality and phrasing of Jenny Agutter's voice when she calls, 'Daddy! My father!' the emotion of the spectator. Tears are popping into my eyes when I think about it. <br /> <br /> This adaptation is not just a movie, it is a precious piece of art, and it is the perfect example of what all filmmakers should be. striving to achieve the creation of an emotional experience.
