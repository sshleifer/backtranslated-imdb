When I saw the trailer for the first time, I have to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection. But after hearing about it, I decided to buy it. When I bought the entire collection in a box set, it was absolutely what I wanted to see. It was very funny, and the characters were cool. The favorite characters of the show are: Marion, Carrot, the Haze Knights, Big Momma and Dotta. I also enjoyed the opening and closing songs. The show also has some great voice talents from Tiffany Grant, Jason Douglas and others. But nevertheless, this show is one of the greatest. So if you want to see something cool. So this show is the only one.
