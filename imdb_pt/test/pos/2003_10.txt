(Possible? Spoilers included, but nothing critical given away.) <br /> <br /> I just watched this classic low-budget movie on video, and was knocked out by the energy level present on the screen. All actors are proud, especially John Daniels, should see another of his films. Not only does this film have great acting but it manages elegant sequences like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see shards of glass falling into a pool that erupts from the impact of fallen man, I love the slow way. in motion was used in the movies of the 70's, dreamy and hypnotic. Legit and witty black tastes emit large liners while slimy bits of white trash come to unpleasant ends. I love this, my rating 10/10. If it ever goes out on DVD, tell me for a purchase.
