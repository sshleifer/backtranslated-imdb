This movie would be particularly fun for anyone who has been in the film industry, especially in any indie capacity ... those whose heritage includes a cinematic introduction may not appreciate it so much. I am difficult to please in the category of documentary. This doc is different - his delight comes from a realism of indie punks from filmmakers who are a joke to be around and watch. If you've ever wondered what it is like to be in movies, in front of or behind the camera, or if you've worked your way through the indie world, sometimes painful and difficult but rewarding, you will surely get a kick out of this movie.
