I like the show, but the writers beginners, come into action! Stop dragging and continue. You have a great concept and could be so much more. Miles (Jenkins) is great and acts like a child that age should act in the situation in which he finds himself. Hey, be creative with the creatures, they can have telepathic abilities or other powers out of the world. The children's actors in the series are very good and convincing. Miles's parents seem to be a little out of the way of what's going on, but develop that, come on! you have a great seed here and there may be a new twist to the next season with many new characters and creatures and all kinds of science fiction stuff. If they could do a series about a witch then you should be able to create one of these creatures and children.
