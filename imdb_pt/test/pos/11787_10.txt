after my daughter was born in 1983, I needed to lose weight. I tried the 20 minute workout and I was hooked. I lost about 50 pounds. was the biggest weight I've lost in my life. I can not believe this show is forgotten. it would be a blessing if you started a cable channel strictly for workouts and included the 20-minute workout. I think this was the best training video ever made. I wish I could buy it somehow and somewhere. the routine was easy to learn and you tried hard. the training they have today is very complicated and difficult to learn. please do your best to put this video back in circulation. I pray that it will be a blessing to all who see and use it.
