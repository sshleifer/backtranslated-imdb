Great artists, they always suffered while they were young. I could mention Mozart and Beethoven, but that's not the point. <br /> <br /> This film was made by HG Clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in the legal professions. <br /> <br /> Its main star is Louis Jouvet, who studied and practiced as a pharmacist before becoming "The Greatest Actor" and also director of the Theater of France before and after World War II. Both had health problems. Clouzot had tuberculosis as a young man, Jouvet had heart problems and died in a theater. <br /> <br /> Such events shape the character of men (and women, of course). One can even say that today's artists are so poor because they have never suffered and fought for their lives. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the biggest of Clouzot's films. "Salaries of fear" is higher in "suspense", "Diabolique" also has more "suspense" and a better plot and is more about "female evil". <br /> <br /> Quai des Orf√®vres is more human. Clouzot was falsely accused by De Gaulle's entourage (mainly Communists and Jews) of collaboration with the Nazis and banned from making films until De Gaulle left the government of France in early 1946. De Gaulle returned in 1958 as president. The main characters are all good souls: Jenny L'Amour can act as a "putain" on stage, but she is not a "prostitute" (dictionaries make synonyms of these words, but they are not the same), loves her husband, and refuses to slight "advances of his (supposedly lesbian) friend Dora, the photographer." Maurice the husband is jealous and timid but escapes from the scene of the crime. He is a coward, because he fell in love with a woman and traded an eventually more sophisticated career for love .. Antoine, the detective (played by the great Louis Jouvet, basically a stage actor, presents himself in this French "Gray" noir, as well as EG Robinson in "Double Indemnity") shows a talent for pseudo-criminals, tenderness for a black son (?) and compassion for the true perpetrator because he remembers that the father cleaned the latrines in the castle of some nobles! <br /> <br /> Clouzot was able to slap the face of and an actor to put him in the right frame of mind, but deep down he was very human. <br /> <br /> I have your horoscope in front of me. He had Venus in Sagittarius, which means sincerity, devotion, charity, and altruism. For those who do not believe in astrology, my sincerest apologies ...
