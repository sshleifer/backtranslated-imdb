I watched this movie for the first time at the Istanbul Film Festival in 1994. It was so good that I took some friends with me and went to see him again in the same week. The characters are very well played and the humor here and there is incredible. It sure is a very powerful gay film. Some scenes make you feel like you're watching an episode of Friends with much more sophisticated lines. I think I'll put it on my VCR and watch it again tonight ...
