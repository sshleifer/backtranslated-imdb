As an English teacher, I enjoy films that do more than tell a story. Good movies, like good literature, make you think, reflect and anticipate. This movie made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses prefiguration, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also like the fact that, despite the choices the characters make in the movie, their choices do not look as teeny or criminal as the other movies I've seen. The acting is very good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other. Excellent soundtrack, with songs you do not hear on the radio. It's a compromise with life / movie spontaneous travel that deserves more than just a second look.
