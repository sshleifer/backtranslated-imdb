I admit that the first time I managed to catch Sci-Fi's "Sci-Fi Prime" was last week, but despite the fact that I was a big fan of Sliders coming to experience, Farscape is now easily my favorite of the four . Unlike most modern science fiction shows (including, regrettably, the two new Star Trek series), this show can be fun without appearing to be a reason for MST3K.
