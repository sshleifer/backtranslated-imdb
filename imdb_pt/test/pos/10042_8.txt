The saving grace of this movie is your mood. Playing with its star's strengths, Warner Brothers released its version of General Custer as an arrogant, arrogant and irreverent playful with a romantic vein and an unexpected lineage of idealism; was Robin Hood once again, and Flynn flourished on paper. All his best action images made use of his talent for evil and comic timing, and this was no exception. <br /> <br /> She also benefits from the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland, despite an earlier deal. to break the partnership; the strong-minded part of Libby Custer plays a better role than the sweet kinds of love interest she had grown tired of playing for the studio in Flynn's later films, and after seeing the script, he specifically asked Havilland to be cast for could do justice to the part. In this final collaboration, she puts all of her considerable acting ability into what is essentially an adventure film, and the chemistry of the screen is rekindled - for the first time, she and Flynn have a chance to develop their characters beyond romance initial. The Flynn / de Havilland couple and the comedy plot provided the durability of this film, when most of Flynn's other Westerns-kept with such affection. by the contemporary American public, though supposedly not by its star - have long been forgotten. The action scenes are rather shallow (despite, ironically, the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges) and the villains of the play end up becoming the same people who were horrible for our Hero. on his first day at West Point, and so continue to frustrate him throughout his career. It narrows down the list of castles, but it's a bit morally convenient. <br /> <br /> However, these are largely irrelevant arguments for a movie that has never set out to be more than an exciting piece of entertainment. Energetically aided and aided by an excellent group of supportive players (including Anthony Quinn in an almost speechless role as the Sioux leader), Errol Flynn makes his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal: charming, embarrassed looks, unexpected sweetness, flicker malicious, flash point indignation, cheerful companionship and pure high octane charisma. He is a reckless buck, but you can not help liking him. And it's hard to leave without the melody of "Garryowen" threading his way through his ears for many days afterwards. <br /> <br /> This is one of Flynn's enduring successes; It also contains a surprising amount of good acting among the fun, and is a movie worthy of being remembered.
