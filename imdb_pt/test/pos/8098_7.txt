Being a big fan of Charlie Chaplin, after good vibes after seeing the first 'The Gold Rush' and then 'City Lights', I was eager to see 'The Great Dictator' as I was told that this was undoubtedly his best movie. I was also intrigued by the fact that it was a talkie; my first, Chaplin-wise. The beginning is typical of Chaplin and a blatant proof that when it comes to sound, the Chaplain can cut it off while not only depends on the music to set the mood and make the conversations; it's funny, well timed, and the slapstick elements, like dropping an anti-air gun, are well connected to jokes. It was good to attract the viewer with this "classic" Chaplin aperture and at the same time begin the storytelling of the characters getting to know each other. What was also well done was how Hitler is deceived. Any scene involving Hitler or 'Hynkel' in this movie, was funny and so far; makes you think back as you know exactly who it is spoofing and creates an internal reaction of some kind. The way the English mingled with the simulated German during the dialogue scenes is further evidence of Chaplin's ability to adapt to the talkie era. My favorite joke was the five-minute speech Hynkel gave, only for the English translator to translate it into a few words; making you think of footage of Hitler, you may have seen a speech at some point in your life and, indeed, laugh at it. <br /> <br /> Historically, the movie also has some things right. Hynkel is seen taking his picture with children; something that Hitler did for recognition while manipulating the media, but here, Hynkel is seen yawning and acting bored; stabbing Hitler's subaltern technique of conquering the German public through sympathy (Oh, he hugs and kisses children, he must be fine!). The film also receives a fantastic premise from a Jewish civilian reinstalled in the ghetto among all the transvestites that are going on, but with the catch that he is oblivious. Films like 'The Pianist' and 'Come and See' are two good examples of Nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people who today, we can all look back and nod our heads while in the late 1930s when it was filmed, the fact that he has had the cruelty and be exploiting it makes it even more surprising an achievement. Chaplin has been able to replace guns and batons with tomatoes and pans and still removes it. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about the movie, however, was the fact that it had settled into a real narrative after opening. . This slowed down the film and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas a bit. The film began to suggest stories and sub-stories. These included the barber and the female neighbor falling in love and the supposed destruction of Hynkel's palace, while none of them was actually developed. The "beard for the woman" and "whoever has the coin in his pudding does the action," the jokes hinted at these plots, but in the end they ended up materializing into nothing more than excuses for rampant jokes that were disappointing. <br /> <br /> During the final stretch, The Great Dictator gets a boost from the fact that the Italian dictator is introduced, which adds life and excuse to comedy to the movie. It is a treatment that we see them discussing and more low-level tactics are explored when Hynkel tries to "dominate" his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (though, they are humorously frustrated). Despite some weaknesses in the pace during the middle segment and the fact that I feel the message at the end was a little forced in the throat, The Great Dictator is waiting to see today, but that's only because he took the gamble to explore things that no one really knew they were there.
