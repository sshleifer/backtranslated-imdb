Wesley Eure is the young inventor Brian Foster, who invented a new security device to fight crime, in the form of a robot dog, the holder "C.H.O.M.P.S." (Means HOMe Dog Protection System). C.H.O.M.P.S., which was modeled after Brian's real Rascal dog, can do almost anything; it has higher speed, strength, x-ray vision and the like. It's just the thing to save the security company from its boss Ralph Norton (Conrad Bain). Of course, a slimy competitor, Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants the advantage, so he tries to get his hands on the secret. <br /> <br /> That's the kind of thing that's so hard to resist. There's a lot of bullshit (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons play a great pair of idiots), an optimistic attitude, an engaging cast and enough good laughs to keep one entertained. Disc-style energetic music becomes repetitive, but it is undeniably captivating; the story is straightforward and the dogs themselves are absolutely adorable. In a completely weird but side-splitting twist, there is another dog in the movie (called "Monster") whose thoughts we actually hear; both his dialogue and the interpreter's voice are invaluable. In fact, he even uses some mild swearing and his last words close the film on a positive final note. <br /> <br /> Eure and fluffy Valerie Bertinelli are very young and their veteran support cast plays the material with all the enthusiasm they can muster. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis and Regis Toomey also co-star. <br /> <br /> A rare live action theatrical venture for Hanna & Barbera's cartoon creators ('The Flintstones', 'Scooby-Doo', 'The Smurfs' and so on) "CHOMPS" is pleasantly silly. I know you left me with a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> 7/10
