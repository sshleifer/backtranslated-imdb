I'm surprised at the amount of negative reviews about this movie. If you do not like this movie for what it is - a silly and exaggerated story - then you are simply reading too much. This film is a classic tale of a mafia woman trying to escape "life" and the problems that follow her. Michelle Pfeiffer is the 80's shirt, which is an uncertain and uncomfortable wife, while Matthew Modine is an anal cop who falls in love with her. The plot is mostly predictable and cutesy and Mercedes Ruel steals the show as the Queen of the Mafia Wives. If you are not looking for something very dynamic and complex, this movie is absolutely fun and a cult classic of the 80's. You will not be able to stop watching if it starts.
