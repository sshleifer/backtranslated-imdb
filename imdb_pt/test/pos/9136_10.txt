I decided to write a comment about this incredible movie, because here in IMDb is quoted as John Woo, a mediocre director who made some decent films in his pre-American years, but totally ruined his reputation for his latest US-made film. plan to redo it. Well, here are a few reasons why it's one of the dumbest ideas for a remake of all time: The plot of the movie is plain and cliche by today's standards, but what makes the film a masterpiece is acting through the four leaders, Mellville's sole direction, cinematography, music and his style. There's no way any director can do this movie today, it's impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in today's movies. John Woo made a more or less decent movie that lent Melville's Le Samourai - The Killer, but remember, it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive (in wages), but cheap (in deeds of merit) actors. So what I'm saying is that this is one of the biggest movies ever made, along with another Melville movie - Le Samourai. Watch. And even if the remake is done, try to avoid it before seeing the original great first.
