Great movie! Oh yeah! Full of energy, full of fun, presenting our generation, our alienation: a hymn to positive thinking despite this world we live in, a tale of a great party, a tale of a bunch of friends who desperately need to do something at the end of week and the only thing to do is the club. But fun and extasy keep the boredom away! Very funny, very grotesque in some points, well filmed ... and great soundtrack!
