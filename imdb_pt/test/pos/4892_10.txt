I've never seen any work from The League until the beginning of last year - although, when the channel jumped one night, I caught the end of a three-episode series. But last winter I fell in love with the show and its dark, eccentric and sometimes downright sinister characters. So when I learned that they had made a movie in which the show's creators knew their own characters, I could not get the DVD fast enough and almost tore it from my mailman's hands when he handed it to me. I was so excited to see what the Gents did and how they did it. <br /> <br /> And it was excellent! From the beginning, where Jeremy (Michael Sheen) is terrified by Edward, Tubbs and Papa (Dyson, why did not you play? He is perfectly capable, as the viewers of the infamous Highgate House of Horrors know!), To Berenice shouting yet another of his flock, to Geoff, Herr Lipp and Hilary discovering that they are characters, which is a great scene. The scenes of 1690 are very pleasant, with the Gents turning their hands to more characters and a whole new plot. The turn of David Warner as Doctor Pea is fantastic, lightly camping and very funny. The League has always been brilliant at mixing humor with sadness and emotion - and the climax of this film where Herr Lipp is struggling with the idea that he and the other residents of Vasey are just fictitious people who never will be able to change who they are or their purpose - and to witness how that is ending it, it is really sad and beautiful to watch at the same time and it really shows the talent of the Gents - something for which they are terribly neglected to this day . <br /> <br /> And then you have that clever ending - where you sit in wonder - with the beautiful theme song of Joby Talbot being played. And you know you liked a very clever and funny movie.
