A movie for mature and educated audiences ... <br /> <br /> I saw "Random Hearts" in a preview shortly before its North American release. This romantic drama was a real treat. I'm sure this story will not be a cup of tea for everyone, especially considering the somber premonition of the movie. But the photo has some very uplifting strengths in its favor. The all-time box office drew Harrison Ford ("Star Wars", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "The Fugitive", "Ar Force One", "Patriot Games") of his game as the tormented and desperate Home Affairs Officer, Dutch. Ford's subtle and subdued performance shows the reach he achieves with class and determination as he brings audiences into his world of loss and betrayal. This is the perfect complex role and a very different kind of movie for Harrison Ford to gratify the screen among his action blockbusters. The following year, Harrison Ford returns to action, first for director Robert Zemeckis ("Forrest Gump", "Back To The Future") in his summer 2000 thriller "What Lies Beneath", and supposedly at the end of the year in adaptation The sum of all fears "by Clancy. 'Fears' will be the third appearance of Harrison Ford as CIA agent Jack Ryan. <br /> <br /> Director Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa", "The Company", "Tootsie") has a supporting role in this feature. a political advisor to Congresswoman Scott-Thomas. It is a very strong and energetic portrait for Pollack. Sydney Pollack is not only a talented director, he is also one of the most believable, natural and charming actors in the world (see "Eyes Wide Shut" as well). Kristin Scott-Thomas ("The English Patient," "The Horse Whisperer") shows that you do not necessarily have to be eccentric or mundane to be considered sexy. This is one of your best movies, and it gives a tremendously crafted and smooth performance that works as opposed to the toughness of Ford's quiet man. Subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot involving the investigation of Ford's character about police corruption.Look for a creepy and effective attitude of the actor " Heat ", Dennis Haysbert, who plays detective George Beaufort, the obstacle to be overcome in the Dutch investigation into police corruption. <br /> <br /> The rest of the support cast is wonderful. whose long-awaited role for a film) shows that he is one of the best actor-characters, and Bonnie Hunt, who I find extremely solid in this production, steals most of his scenes with that wonder bear movie., charming smile like Wendy Judd. <br /> <br /> The technical side of Pollack's thriller is top notched. From Dave Grusin (Pollack's "The Firm") with perfectly surreal jazz notes, to Philippe Rousselot's razor-sharp photograph ("A River Runs Through It"), to the crisp editing that keeps the film fresh despite the film's sad premise . <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good piece of mystery, well-paced storyline, story-based characters and romance, all in one. This is a great story about betrayal and forgiveness. It also features one of the most surprising, yet poignant and certain finals to be controversial for a Harrison Ford movie in recent times. "Random Hearts" is definitely one of the best movies of the year. <br /> <br /> (*** 1/2 of ****) or (8.5 of 10.0)
