As Salinger's "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" ends with the suicide of a prodigy, this movie begins with the death of high school legend star Matt, who shoots himself on the head with a revolver after the opening scene. But Matt Travis's death serves as a key to opening the door to another prodigy, his brother Tim, who has never in his life seriously cared about the question, "What am I going to do?" <br /> <br /> When he finds his brother dead, with his head broken like a watermelon, the Travis family begins to vomit their secrets one by one. The film focuses on Tim. He is a victim of bullying, domestic abuse, family alienation, heartbreak, sexuality issues, and friendship. Tim reveals his wounds through physical bruises, but these are not the only injuries to his person, as we slowly realize, while the script painfully reveals the origins and outcome of Tim's scars. Everyone who loves him hurts him. Hirsch interprets the character very well, revealing frame by frame in the visual expression of his body, a series of conflicting emotions within the soul of a child that no one seems to hear or know very well, not knowing and not knowing of its depth. soul and prodigious talent. <br /> <br /> Two brothers sharing a doobie, wrapped in a red playground disc, Spinnable, Tim asks Penny, "What am I going to do with the rest of my life?" The scene is framed in a familiar and recurring image of the film: the comfortable playground where Tim obviously feels at home, filmed from a panoramic view, because with each character Tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself, and we we see these intimacies moments in which he shares the red saucer, filled with children's graffiti carved in pencil, from above. Penny tells him, "Well, the secret to life's success is to find something that you love." And you have to do it for the rest of your life? you'd better hope to hell you're good at it, because if you're not, then you're probably going to fail. " This simple line of advice from Penny serves as the central theme of the film, the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure. Why does a person have a talent that he can not stand, like Matt, who hated the attention his swimming fame brought, but no one notices Tim's talent? nobody ?? why does anyone bother to ask him? Neither do we. The movie makes us realize that we ourselves have not met Tim as well as we thought when we met this handsome, sad guy; In our intimate understanding of Tim, as we move forward, we are reminded that not all are as they appear to be. This is the other side of the movie, the failure of who should? parents, friends, teachers? who? to perceive and see the gifts of the people they say they love. Not even his mother Sandy, played by Sigourney Weaver, sees Tim's gift, despite his love for his son. Weaver does a skilful job of a middle-aged woman struggling with her own inner demons while randomly attempting to play the roles of domesticity and support. When Tim is found to be bullied at school, she attacks the boy's trailer, threatening his life, "You can tease, torture, drill, drive drunk with me, I can forgive you." Hell, I can understand that, I'm a good Christian, you know, I can forgive and forget, but you mess with my son and let God Himself come down from heaven to protect you, because as long as I live and I will survive all of you I'll wake up and go to sleep at night only dreaming of ways to turn their insignificant lives into hell on Earth. "After throwing a paper cup at her mother's face, she looks around the trailer and, looking at the two, the boy and his mother stunned" good trailer "and leave as quickly as it came. Weaver scores on his ability to match the visceral intelligence that is acid and witty. And Tim's father, played by Jeff Daniels, is blind to who his son is, treating him like a stranger, not to mention his family that he took time off from office, spending his days in the city park, apathetic, a soul sculpted. and sleeping on Matt's bed, stuffed into his high school jacket. Jeff Daniels does a great job in making us believe that he can be both a bastard and a lovable one because, we grew to see that even an inept dad can show his love for his son. In an emotional scene, Tim confronts his father. Just when you think Dad's going to hit him, he grabs for him to hug him. Not letting him go, he tells Tim, "I'm your father and you're my son and I'm here fine, but you have to talk to me. I do not know how to do it myself." It is at this point in the movie that a father tells the son that you have to tell me what is happening inside you, you have to tell me who you are; I want to know who you are. It is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment, the visual movement of Tim, angry and lonely, until his father embraces him while he breaks and cries, revealing the emotions hidden under his shell. Tim experiences this cleansing moment with his father as a catharsis, especially when you consider the mistreatment, manipulation, disrespect, violence and betrayal he received in the long year the film covers. I recommend this movie.
