SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's a fun mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is light and the sequences of action, although well staged, are not so exciting. But I laughed. Very. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the lines, De Niro makes us laugh with an expression or grimace. This film will receive a reception RUSH HOUR style from critics. Do not listen to them. If you are a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you will like this movie.
