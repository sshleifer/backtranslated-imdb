Lloyd Hamilton was one of the most imaginative (and funniest) of all silent-movie comedians. Why is he totally forgotten? Unfortunately, the original negatives of a large percentage of his films were lost when Fox's depot burned in the early 1930s. Hamilton was not handsome or graceful like Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd; nor was he elegant, like Raymond Griffith. And unlike Harry Langdon and (again) Chaplin, Hamilton did not attempt the sympathy of the public. <br /> <br /> However, his films were very popular at the time of their original release, and remain hilarious today. Oscar Levant once claimed that he asked Chaplin if there were any other comedians he had envied, and Chaplin instantly called Lloyd Hamilton. The character most often portrayed by Hamilton on the screen - a naff, with meticulous gestures and a duck walk - was later adapted by vaudeville comedian Eddie Garr (Teri Garr's father), and later adapted by Jackie Gleason as his TV personality. 1950, The Poor Soul. <br /> <br /> "The Movies," under the pseudonym Roscoe Arbuckle, is one of Hamilton's most innovative short films, and it's hilarious. First we see him as a country boy, saying goodbye to his family outside his cottage, on the way to the big city. Then it moves away from the house, and we see that it is in the big city with the traffic growing around it! <br /> <br /> Eventually, our hero ends up in a restaurant (uncredited, but it's the Caf√© Montmartre). in the center of LA), where all movie actors eat between the takes. There's a funny joke when Hamilton's character comes across three actors in costumes and makeup like Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt: that joke would have been funnier if the impostors were more like the originals. Finally, our boy sits at the table, hoping to find a celebrity. For sure, getting into the restaurant and sitting at the next table is a big movie star ... none other than Lloyd Hamilton! There is a very well done double-outlet - the union is almost invisible - when Lloyd Hamilton as himself greets Lloyd Hamilton as the country boy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Hamilton's peak of creativity was very brief. . He began his film career in rough films as half a double act (Ham and Bud, next to Bud Duncan), and had a brief and brilliant period of stardom in shorts during the period of final silence. The sound films were not kind to Hamilton, and he was quickly pushed into the cast on some early talkies. Then he died young. Fortunately, 'The Movies' is quite funny and a splendid introduction to the unique style of comedians. I'll rate it 7 out of 10.
