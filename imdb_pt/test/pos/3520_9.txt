Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the horror film. The backwoods slasher began basically with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning and Madman. Just Before Dawn is one step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher movie. Cinematography is beautiful. The performance is top notch. The heroine of the movie is not your typical 'final girl'. Constance is a killer girl, but when it comes to the primitive instinct for survival, she is a step back. Not until she saves her life and her boyfriend, does the primordial notion of survival come into play. There is a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the hidden sexuality of the final girls - coinciding with the will to survive. <br /> <Just before Dawn is not for everyone, but for the slasher fan, it's as close as you can get. The killer (s) is very menacing - Almost like a game to maim and kill anyone who crosses their territory. The final scene is a bit out of order. For the first time, it may be a bit shocking. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the backwoods slasher. Even non-slasher fans will find something to like. The scenery is scary and makes someone feel uncomfortable. The death sequences are not particularly bloody, but I'm not sure if the film needed blood. Look!
