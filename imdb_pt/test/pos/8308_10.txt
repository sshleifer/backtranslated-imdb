What a shame if you give this movie a low rating. How could you not like a movie that has Doug McClure, Peter Cushing, silly rubber monsters, fights (and for the guys, that woman who was the villainous henchman in The Spy Who Loved Me and one of Sinbad's films of the years 70, not using much of who my mother said "She was not chosen by the color of her eyes"), lava, silly wigs and a crazy Victorian drill machine much like the one used in the old Thunderbirds series? Whoever watched this movie and watched was for the wrong reasons. It may suck, but it's definitely crap. They do not do as they used to, they sigh ......
