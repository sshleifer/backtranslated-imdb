Anastasia: Anna's Mystery was a two-part historical full of stars based on Peter Kurth's book, Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson. It keeps historically very beautiful, the names are changed, etc. But stick to the real story very well. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom do very well as Russian royalty, Tsar Nicholas and Tsar Alexandra. What was in my mind were the very short portraits of Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. In short, it was a very elegant production, with good performance. I was quite impressed with the production values ​​when it first aired on NBC at the end of 1986. It also starred the good German actor Jan Niklas, who had previously starred in another Russian epic NBC, Peter the Great. <br /> <br /> I felt that Part 2 jumped some important details of Anna Anderson's trip to America. It is also important to know that in 1986 little was known about Anna Anderson's story. At that time, it was not known whether her claim to be Grand Duchess Anastasia was genuine. In the late 1990s, more was known and Anna Anderson now has a reputation for having been a fraud. <br /> <br /> Too bad that networks are no longer producing movies made for television like this.
