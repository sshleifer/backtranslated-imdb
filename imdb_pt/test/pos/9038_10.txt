This film was filmed, filmed and premiered in Oxford, Miss., The hometown of W. Faulkner, the location of the 1948 book. Most of the extras were local. I was in Oxford and that changed a lot. This movie features Will Geer as the sheriff, he was later blacklisted. It was the writers and actors of social dramas like this movie, and Grapes Of Wrath, who were targets of the HUAC a few years later. I do not remember if the actor who plays the young boy Mallison (Claude Jarman Jr) did something after the TV series Centennial (1978), but he was great in this previous film. And do not miss Elizabeth Patterson, who later played in Little Women.
