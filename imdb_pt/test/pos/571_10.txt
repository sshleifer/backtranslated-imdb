I do not need to say much about how good this documentary is - it's really an incredible part of the true storytelling. The story is quite simple: a white elderly tourist is murdered by a young black man in Florida, and the boy who is arrested is mistreated and brought to trial only with the public defender and his family on his side. It is very captivating, and the public defender is a joy to watch in all your human ways - you can not help but pull for the triumph of justice, and the end fills more than you might expect from a true story. <BR> It's a shame most people have not seen this documentary, but we hope you find a way to watch it. For those interested in race relations in the United States, and the actual working of the law and the legal process, it is worth your time and effort to find this documentary. I give a 10.
