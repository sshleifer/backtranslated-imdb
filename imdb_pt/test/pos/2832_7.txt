Overall, it is hoped that this movie is better, but it has enough flashes of intense power to be worth it. Peck made this film during the same period in which he did The Gunfighter, before seemingly deciding that he was a monument and not an actor. A feather! He was an excellent actor, perfectly willing to face characters who were not very friendly and to do them extremely well. The character he plays here is directed and, when necessary, relentless. Given the mission assigned to the character and the "men" with which to do so, these characteristics are essential. <br /> <br /> Without being a spoiler, think of this movie as one of the first examples Dirty Dozen Genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film is a little left-handed, but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth telling. It contains a good job of all the characters actors and even Barbara Payton has a reliable performance. <br /> <br /> This is not displayed on television, so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy. . Continues! Give it a night. That's worth your time!
