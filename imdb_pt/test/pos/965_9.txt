SPOILER ALERT !!!! This was my son's comment about the movie, which he wanted me to post. He wrote that, I swear. <br /> <br /> With Malcolm in the Middle, Frankie Muniz, and Nickelodeon's Amanda Bynes, they will show the deal. They join actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's essay on Big Fat Liar and made it to the movies. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) have to go to Los Angeles to retrieve it. Jason's father does not believe he wrote this essay. So every time they see each other, Jason asks Wolf (Paul Giamatti) to call Jason's dad because he wants his rehearsal back. Wolf does not make the film, but the president of the company does. In the end, Kaylee and the family see the film, Made by Wolf Pictures and based on a true story written by Jason Shepherd.
