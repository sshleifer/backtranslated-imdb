I heard about Begotten for the first time when a girlfriend of mine picked up a section of "cult classics" from my local video store. She knew I liked dark art films, so I rented it and brought it home. It stayed on my TV for a few days and then I put it on the VCR before going to bed. I thought maybe I'll see how it is first, then devote more time to it the next day. What followed was that it really woke me up. I sat through the movie and loved it. After going through the final credits, I watched again. Only after seeing the final credits do you have an idea of ​​who is who. Once you know you can watch it again with renewed appreciation. Do not listen to the people who rip this movie. It is not for everyone. If you are someone who does not like to read subtitles than this movie is not for you (not that there are subtitles, there are no dialogues). If you are someone who actually owns Rush Hour 2, then this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> This movie is truly original and inspiring. It does what other movies never did. It seems nothing more and is bolder than anything out there - from 1989 to the present day. You can say that everyone involved in the production of this film really loves the art of what they do and understand what can be captured in the form of cinema. <br /> <br /> If you want to be "entertained," then the movie is not for you. However, it is pure escapism in some extreme form and in film form. It's as if someone wired wires in my head and recorded one of my worst nightmares. But this nightmare makes sense if you actually sit and watch the pictures, dissect the actors' actions and not sit there, playing your guitar passively, but watch and do not blink. <br /> <br /> People compare with Eraserhead. but Begotten is so much more. I'm not joking when I say it's my favorite movie. It is an important, visually stimulating, mechanically inspiring and hypnotic film. One review I read about this is very true, "No one will go through Begotten without being tagged."
