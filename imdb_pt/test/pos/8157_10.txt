Excellent performance by Mary KAy Place, Steve Sandvoss, Jacqueline Bissett and Rebekah Johnson. Superb story that takes you to the movie, emotional but carefree. I own this movie, and everyone I shared with him loves it. Great for mixed company, 18+ crowd. <br /> <br /> Nice production, not a cheap budget, well organized and keeps your interest. Uses newer ideas for flashbacks, and at one point keeps the viewer at the edge of their seat. <br /> <br /> No matter what kind of life a viewer is in, they will buy one or more views in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'd love to see a sequel!
