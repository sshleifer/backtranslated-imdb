My dad had this movie as an 8mm reel. I loved it when he pulled the projector, put a sheet on the wall and played Gerald McBoing Boing. The thought of a child communicating through sounds fascinated me. <br /> <br /> Nine years ago, my son was diagnosed as autistic. The doctors asked me questions about my son, like "How does he communicate with you?" I would respond, "Have you seen the cartoon, Gerald McBoing Boing?" I would love to have a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his educators, that's how my son sees that he is world-wide. <br /> <br /> I recently spoke with a digital transfer specialist who pointed out the most personal 8mm films. it did not contain sound until the mid-70's. I think I was very lucky to have experienced the sights and sounds of Gerald McBoing Boing in 1972.
