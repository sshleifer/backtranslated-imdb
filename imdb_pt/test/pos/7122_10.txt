This film brilliantly captures the atmosphere of a group of D & D. While watching, I could not help noticing how characters vividly reminded me of me and my friends from games to the point that they literally act the same way as us. Including the quarrels, the quarrels, the inner jokes, leaving the Master mad. ALL. <br /> <br /> It has everything. Jokes that made me cry, action scenes that even filmed on low budget, I found strangely too. The story is straightforward and without surprise, but it does not matter, since the best part of the film is to see the characters react and interact with each other and with NPCs. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you're playing D & D RPG or similar, I can not emphasize this enough, WATCH THIS MOVIE, beautifully captured the spirit of D & D.
