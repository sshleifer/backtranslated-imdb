Reviewers who have complained that this film has no plausibility or have construction problems are missing the point. This is a wonderfully camp novel, with a lot of fun, gypsies! Dance, gypsies! music that both sends exotic love stories and celebrates them. Ray Milland, with wide buttons, plays a fun role for a Dietrich with black hair, tattered scarves and tons of jewelry. The character's eagerness to feed and care for him more closely resembles the good German hausfrau that Dietrich was offstage than his vampire roles. With the censorship in place, it became clear that they share a caravan only in platonic terms, with Milland fighting against Dietrich's advances with a remarkable determination for a heterosexual bachelor who can be killed at any moment. Her only excuse is that she sniffs, so maybe a stuffy, boring English can actually be postponed. <br /> <br /> In the small role of Milland's young companion on his secret mission, Bruce Lester adds a note of camp. a different type. We are told at the outset that he is worshiping Milland and, in fact, prefers to flatter him. When, after separated, he meets Milland, now turned into a brown-skinned gypsy with an open waistcoat, his brilliant appreciation of disguise further suggests that not only is Dietrich romantically in love with Milland. Despite the characters and sequence of wonderfully improbable events, Milland's growing love for Dietrich and his acceptance of the non-rational aspects of life is quite touching. And when, on his last night alone before escaping, he says that each of them now contains half of the other, the two have become one, and then the darkness falls, I think we can assume that the censor decided to pause them! One goof - at first, Milland, who is supposed to be English, refers to a lieutenant, using American pronunciation. (The English say "leftenant.") As Milland was British, he must have said it that way because the American filmmakers feared that the American public would get distracted and confused with the British style.
