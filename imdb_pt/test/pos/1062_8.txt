Due to the roles he played in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signior Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, Former Superintendent Grodman, Earl Fosco, Titus Semple), surprised many of his fans to learn that originally Sidney Greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the West End and Broadway. He was usually such a total villain or serious actor to the public that his comedic talents were ignored. In fact, he actually made four comedy appearances (a parody of his villain portraits with his villainous partner Peter Lorre in an apparition). His best film appearance in a comedy was probably that of Alexander Yardley magazine editor in "Christmas in Connecticut" (though his autocratic soap mogul and half crazy in "The Hucksters" is the second closest). Despite some problems with the script, it's a good movie, and is usually revived at Christmas time. Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes a column in the American Housekeeping magazine for Yardley, where she gives home cooking tips and recipes. She is Martha Steward's 1945 version, with the exception that Steward is a cook and housewife, and can guarantee the opportunity to test and test what she stands for. Stanwyck can not. His culinary recipes are those of his friend Felix (S.Z. Sakall), a gourmet chef and restaurant owner. The house she describes as her home (a model farm in Connecticut) belongs to her unofficial boyfriend, the architect John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner). Gardiner really would not mind marrying Stanwyck, but she is not quite ready to consider a final engagement with him. <br /> <br /> When the film starts, an American is shipwrecked with the Nazis. This is Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor. He spends two weeks on a raft before being rescued. Feeling the value of advertising, Greenstreet decides to grant Morgan's desire to have a genuine, old-fashioned Christmas in Connecticut. He basically tells Stanwyck that she will have fun with Morgan and himself on his farm for the holidays. Stanwyck is unable to explain that the columned image of herself (complete with her ability to flip-jacks and raise a baby she allegedly had with her husband) is a lie - if she is fired, as is her immediate boss Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne). In a moment of depression, she accepts Gardiner's marriage proposal, and then Gardiner discovers that her Connecticut home is transformed into a "real" Stanwyck home and herself and "her baby." Of course, apart from postponing Greenstreet's curiosity, Stanwyck and Morgan find out they're falling in love (much to Gardiner's disgust - he actually expects Stanwyck to still marry him). The complication after the complication occurs, like the lies lie, and how the neighbor's babies succeed the neighbor's babies, before Greenstreet begins to wonder if he's missing out on anything. But it's a comedy, so everything works fine. Even Greenstreet, in conclusion, is amused by all the madness - his celebrated laugh mirroring Santa's for a change. This is not a classic comedy, certainly not a great but fun enough for the season to be worth watching in December.
