This is truly a kung fu classic. This movie seems to have influenced martial arts movies for decades. The background music of the Spanish guitar, competing schools, incredibly high heels at roof edges, catching spears, cheating at tournaments, secret training of an exotic karate technique, patience and perseverance themes and more were copied by many later films like "The Karate Kid" (1984), "Hero" (2002), "Kill Bill Volume 2" (2004) and "Kung Fu Hustle" (2004). <br /> <br /> I feel lucky to have seen this movie for the first time in 1972, shortly after it was released, just before the kung fu movies became mainstream and before Bruce Lee became a household name. I saw him with two friends of mine in a theater in downtown San Diego, frequented by sailors, and although scenes of bright red hands and torn eyeballs laughed, the audience was clearly coming in, as were our small group. It was a very memorable movie for me. Decades later, I could still remember several specific scenes, even after I had forgotten the title of the film. This movie is special to me now because one of these two friends I first saw him with (Kenneth Lee Hines from Kitty Hawk) has passed away, so this movie serves as a reminder of that day together before we take the judo and lessons of karate in subsequent years. <br /> <br /> In relation to kung fu movies, I would rate this movie as 10/10. But since I have to keep the biggest movie audience in mind, I'll more objectively evaluate how 8/10 due to obvious technical flaws. I just recommend that neophyte viewers consider these technical failures a proof of their vintage nature and authenticity, and then happily enjoy their testosterone-laden chaos.
