I took one more look at this movie and still consider it very good. Chloe is one of the few hardcore stars that really can perform. She occasionally appears in soft core like "Body of Love" and "Lady Chatterly's Stories" on Showtime. I thought Nicole Hilbig was also fine with her beautiful body and charming accent. Too bad she's not in more movies.
