A real surprise. Not exactly Disney's family entertainment. Some violence, a lot of tense moments and a great story, based on facts. The theme of "Night Crossing" is, determination wins. Never losing sight of their goal, two families from East Germany risk everything in their daring balloon flight to freedom. The story is distressing and comforting. Time is not on their side. The East German Police are approaching and the outcome is far from certain, until the end. If you are looking for good nighttime entertainment that does not contain limited nudity and violence then I recommend "Night Crossing". It's pure entertainment. - MERK
