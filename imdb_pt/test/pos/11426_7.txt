Seeing Laurel without Hardy in a movie sounds weird, but it's fun anyway. It is a well-made parody of what has become a classic silent film and shows Stan's talent very well. While his photos with Oliver Hardy were great, these early solo efforts gave him an idea of ​​how skillful he was in his craft and how great he could have been if he continued in the tradition of Keaton and Chaplin as an individual star on his own. The dance sequence with his real life wife on the coffee scene is the best part of the picture, and has some pretty funny parts to accompany Laurel's excellent dance moves. And the climax of the bullfight is a jewel, because even the bull takes a fall. And I like the irony in the scene where he's buried in hats and appears wearing his familiar felt hat Laurel and Hardy. As much as I love the Laurel and Hardy team and feel like there's never been a funniest comedy duo on the screen during its heyday, it's good to see them alone from time to time (check out THE FIGHTING KENTUCKIAN that Hardy did with Duke as another good example.)
