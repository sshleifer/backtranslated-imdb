I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character is, but that's why it's called a "big fat liar." Even if this kid escapes to Hollywood, it does not give kids the idea that they can. Also, it does not do this just for fun or to get away from anything, it does it to regain confidence. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was just a big ad for Universal Studios because I liked how it gave a view of how it is for kids who do not know how cool it is to make movies. <br /> <br /> It has good music and fun characters. This family / comedy is totally fun for kids and parents. Has real-life humor, excitement, and difficulties like lying. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Big Fat Liar" sends a moral: do not expect to lie to be easy.
