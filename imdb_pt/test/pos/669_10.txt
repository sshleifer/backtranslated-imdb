the fact that there is such an uproar is ironic, since the aim of the program was to highlight how the media treats such "taboo" subjects as pedophilia. the scenario of the essay, the suits, the presumptuous presenters, the men in the scene shouting about things you can see behind them, the useless graphics and cgi statistics, the whole thing was a satire, a very very funny satire. the way the phone book celebrity will say absolutely anything if his agent says it will be good for his career ("there is no proof of this, but it is a scientific fact"). It may be hard to watch (with milly dowler and the cambridgeshire girls, as well as 9/11), but satire should be a challenge, and we should not be afraid to face the blistering media frenzy and headlines just because it is a sensitive subject. As this show has failed to win any TV awards for its intelligence, observation, courage, acting and thought, the provocation is shameful, but as you watch, this will show you, not at all surprising.
