You've seen yourself watching a movie or documentary and having to shout things like "No! Do not do it!" Not? Well, it's time for you to do it. And, of course, DEEP WATER is the one to start. <br /> <br /> The story is based on that of Donald Crowhurst and his entry into the first yacht race around the world to be held by individuals in 1968. This word "individuals" is important as men departing to this almost suicidal escape leave alone. Most men are well known in England's maritime communities (where they launch from), but one of them is the "Dark Dark Horse," and his name was Donald Crowhurst. Fighting financially, Crowhurst enlists a sponsor who can take all of him if he can not at least try to go through much of the race. He could take his house, his property, everything. Crowhurst now stands between a rock and ... well ... deep water: either try to race with an unproven ship and an unproven captain, or lose everything you own. which was significant since Crowhurst had a wife and several children). You'll notice the term "unproven captain" there as well. Not only was he not proven, he had never been out in the open! Did I mention suicide? Flick between pre and post race footage, and those of Crowhurst's friends, family and acquaintances of today, Deep Water are united with mastery. Initially seen as a poor wretch who went over his head, the film gradually shows Crowhurst's limited choices after months and months in the water. Your ship is leaking. Equipment breaks. Psyche stretched to the breaking point (and beyond). Crowhurst finds himself lost in a successful unsuccessful internal struggle. It is also interesting to see the psychological breaks that other runners have in dealing with solitary confinement aboard their respective ships. <br /> <br /> The wave-like emotions you feel when you watch this amazing documentary can make you a bit sick (not unlike trying to get the sea legs). And you'll probably be frustrated with the choices made; perhaps as frustrated as poor Crowhurst. <br /> <br /> The ending is also incredible, as we can see the ship Crowhurst sailed, sitting deserted and rotting on a Caribbean beach ... not unlike others. things that seemed deserted and rotting at the end of this poorly thought out run. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
