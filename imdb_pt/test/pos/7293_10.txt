All I have to say is that this movie is the bomb. You'll cry when you see it. I mean, this is a reminder to everyone how hard and easy it is to fall in love. He remembers the days during his youth when you were carefree and everything that was bad for you was washed with a single kiss. Even though I'm still a teenager, that's how I live my life. When I'm with that right person, everything that was negative in my mind was erased. So, I give this movie a 10 for its sincere message and touching plot. Actors Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein I also give a 10 for having a pretty face.
