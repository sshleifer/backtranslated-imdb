Joline (Heather Graham) married Carl (Luke Wilson) and about five hundred and a few days later, Carl is very depressed and leaves her, hoping to "clear the fog" in their lives. Joline faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life, and decides to look for Carl in Texas. She is greatly supported by her brother Jay (Casey Affleck), who knows her on the Mexican border. There, Joline finds the confused Carl and realizes that she can not change her decision, while Jay meets Carmen (Patricia Velasquez) and begins to date her, and in the end "life goes on". This film is very unpredictable, having a very different story. I believe it is an independent production. In some parts, it's a bit slow and boring, but there are certain dialogues that make this movie worthwhile. I liked it, and my vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Rebels to the End '(' Rebels to the End ') <br /> <br />
