We do not know why this extraordinary film was never officially made available on DVD ... Anthony Quinn's performance alone makes this a must-see. There are relatively few films in which an actor identifies so deeply with his character, a phenomenon always unique to us moviegoers. <br /> <br /> But Quinn's powerful portrait of an innocent Romanian, literally dragged out of his house and everyday life by forces he can not understand, is just part of what makes this movie great. The script is based on a book published in Paris by a Romanian priest who fled his country's Communist command, and the film manages to delve into a little-known area of ​​Eastern European history. Told as a succession of Kafka-esquire twists and turns, the misadventures of Johann Moritz (spoken openly and honestly, without any political correction currently so precious in Hollywood) are in fact a compliment to the lost innocence of the Romanian people. It is diabolically ironic that this compliment is signed by a French director, working with the American money of an Italian producer and supervising a multinational cast led by an extraordinary Mexican actor. <br /> <br /> I saw VCD mentions of this movie in several Asian Internet shops, and I was fortunate to take ownership of a digital recording of this film, broadcast on the British version of TCM. But it's a pity that "The 25th Hour" is nowhere on the upcoming DVD release map of MGM studios.
