Maybe I'm partial because the F-16 is my favorite fighter plane - although the F-14 is probably the second or third - but I liked that movie. The sequences (Iron Eagle II and III) do not measure performance and plot, but the first - along with the Top Gun - has excellent flight quality and music, plus plots and reasonable performances. II and III clearly have much less of a "flight budget", but their main drawback is plot and action. I suspect that the relative fame and popularity of Iron Eagle compared to Top Gun is almost entirely a reflection of the fame and popularity of Jason Gedrick compared to Tom Cruise. Another advantage (for me) is a very brief appearance of Shawnee Smith. 7/10
