WrestleMania 6 took place on April 1, 1990 at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. <br /> <br /> Match 1: Rick Martel vs. Koko B. Ware - For what it was, a very solid match. Koko has always been quite popular with fans, and at this point Martel was still recovering as a jumping talent. In the end, Martel is able to hold the win in a very memorable match. <br /> <br /> Match 2: The Colossal Connection (Andre The Giant & Haku) (c) (with Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan) vs. Demolition (Ax & Smash) for the WWF Tag Team Championship - At this point, Andre's health was really horrible, so his performance was nothing special. The crowd is 100% pro Demolition in this game. In the end, Haku is arrested and we have new doubles champions. After the game, Andre puts Haku and Heenan and turns to what would become his last WrestleMania. Match 3: Earthquack vs. Hercules - Very short game. The dominant jumps were really popular back then. REST IN PEACE. for the two men in the game. John Tenta (earthquake) passed not long ago and even with Hercules. In the final earthquake pins Hercules to victory. <br /> <br /> Match 4: Mr. vs Perfect Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake - The very first good game of the evening. REST IN PEACE. to Curt Henning (Mr. Perfect). Really solid back and forth action from both these talented guys. In the end, Brutus gets the win thanks to great support from his fans during the match. <br /> <br /> Round 5: 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper vs. Bad News Brown - It's not a technical classic, but a nice fight for WrestleMania. Piper comes out half black / half white at a pretty classic time. In the end, both guys fight for a double count with no clear winner. <br /> <br /> Match 6: The Hart Foundation vs. The Bolsheviks - Complete squash match. The Hart Foundation wins an easy win. Amazingly, WWE used to have a tag team division. <br /> <br /> Match 7: The barbarian vs. Tito Santana - "Heenan Family" by Bobby Heenan trades best in this game as The Barbarian leads the win against Tito Santana. Not memorable, but good to come back and watch years later. <br /> <br /> Match 8: Randy Savage and Sensational Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire - Great match between intersex teams. Dusty Rhodes wears the uncomfortable polka dots for the ring. In the end, Rhodes and Sapphire win the victory over "The Macho King" and the sensational Queen Sherri. <br /> <br /> Match 9: The Rockers vs. The Orient Express - Surprisingly, another game of doubles. Tag wrestling used to be much better during this time period. A young Shawn Michaels and his partner Marty Jannetty suffer a loss in this match for the Orient Express. <br /> <br /> Match 10: Dino Bravo vs. Jim Duggan - Duggan gets a decent reaction despite his American Patriot trick. Bravo, a member of Jimmy Hart's group, arrives in the ring with Hart and Earthquake. Although he has support, Duggan takes the win. <br /> <br /> Match 11: "The Man of a Million Dollars" Ted DiBiase (c) vs. Jake "The Cobra" Roberts for the One Million Dollar Championship - The First Biggest Main Event Of The Night. Roberts was extremely over with the fans. Match was pretty good for what it was. DiBiase is able to win a count in Roberts. But Roberts ends up owning DiBiase's money and distributing it. <br /> <br /> Match 12: The Great Boss Man vs. Akeem (with Slick) - The sad attempt of a man to be an African dream called Akeem. A really short game that needed some more time to develop as a match. Boss Man wins with a slam. <br /> <br /> Match 13: Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka vs. Rick Rude - Heenan comes to the ring with Rude for this game. Snuka, was never very good at WrestleMania. He always seemed to be on the losing side. After 5 minutes, Rude wins the victory over Snuka. Combat 14: WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior - Named as "The Ultimate Challenge", we got some interesting promos from both men in the early evening. The match was actually very good, given that people tend to think Hogan can not fight. A lot of near falls actually have the crowd and people watching at home for it. In the end, Warrior wins the win at Hogan and wins both titles. A stunned crowd watches as Hulk Hogan suffers his first loss at WrestleMania.
