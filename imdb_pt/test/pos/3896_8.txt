William H. Macy always does a good job. He never seems lazy and never seems to prefer to be anywhere else. In short, it is what more actors should be. "The Slight Case of Murder" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to make two more films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap). <br /> <br /> Television films have long exaggerated actor, bad cinematography and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to watch a TV movie that does exactly the kind of movie that was created. To tell a little story (not a simplistic story) that does not require large-screen viewing. <br /> <br /> "A mild case of murder" is light, entertaining and a great watch. <Br/> <br /> 7.6 of 10
