AWWWW, I just love this movie in pieces. Me and my cousins ​​really enjoy this movie and I'm such a HUGE fan !!! I hope they bring the TV series on DVD soon. Come to mention, I have not seen the TV show in a long time. Such a gem! Where I come from Australia Chipmunk Adventure is known only to people in late adolescence and adulthood, which is kind of sad because young people do not know what is missing. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are Ace the ones I love most Rock n 'roll boys and girls, Diamond Dolls and the music that will make you want to cry my mother. <br /> <br /> This movie will sure rouse the young and old START THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE TODAY !!! 10 out of 10, an excellent movie.
