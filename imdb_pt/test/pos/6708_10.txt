By far one of the best science fiction films out there. However, you need to have multiple views to understand the concept of the film and be able to appreciate not only the special effect but also the main plot of the film itself. It's my own feeling that this movie had such bad reviews because no one had time to watch the movie the way it should be seen. He has a few moments that you want to rush through, but they are few and far between. Hooper, who directed TCM 1 and 2 along with a remake of INVADERS FROM MARS, and THE FUNHOUSE does their best work here. Great score, good acting and great effects make this a movie to add to your collection if you get the chance to see the widescreen version on DVD, highly recommended for anyone who is a science fiction fan.
