First of all, by the time I wrote this review, I had read what Kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not a real movie. I mean, I'd pick a good Deniro movie myself or play a videogame any day. But, man, what are you talking about? Now that I've got it out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaptation of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name. What's weird is that this was released three years after the movie's release. Whether due to a time of slow development or simply laziness, no one really knows. At least, I do not know. <br /> <br /> The game allows the player to play as the four main characters of the movie: Jen, Shu Lien, Li-Mu-Bi and Dark Cloud (whose story is a secret bonus that is unlocked for separate gameplay. ) All four of these characters have fighting styles based on how they fought in the movie. However, true eye drops are evasion moves that allow each character to avoid the onslaught of an enemy attack in the most impossible and challenging modes of gravity that were first shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is obviously based on the story told in the movie. The story of the game is told using CG movies and spoken in a subtitled Mandarin language (A little twist, considering I preferred the foreign language range of the movie over the dubbed). The story will expand what could have happened to the other characters during the movie and even (no real surprise, since virtually all video game adaptations have done so) changes what officially happened in the movie to make the game have more action . I never thought that Jade Fox would go so far as to really go and get hired henchmen. <br /> <br /> The real bonus to the story is the ability to decide how the game ends. What if Jen had all the ingredients to heal Li-Mu-Bi in her possession? What if Jen had not retrieved the comb? What if Li-Mu-Bi had not recovered the green fate a second time? Your actions will decide the outcome of these scenarios and the fate of the characters in this game. This is truly the best feature of the game. <br /> <br /> However, after all, it also shows some flaws. Enemies often tend to become a nuisance after a while and the angle of the camera tends to be fixed at the most useless spots. Not even the special features (which are unlocked after winning the game) are good enough to even forgive such difficulties that are forced on the player. <br /> <br /> If you loved the movie, you might like the game. However, this game is the only way for you to immerse yourself in a playable version of such a beautiful and incredible movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, you could have chosen a Deniro movie.
