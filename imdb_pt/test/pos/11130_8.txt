High school. Years and decades later, some look back with affection, others with embarrassment. But few find it easy to forget. It is one of the most critical phases of our lives, when the changes come quickly and furious, whether they are ready or not. They are no longer children, they are not adults yet, irresistible forces torment us, pushing and pulling us in all directions. <br /> <br /> "Fame" did its best to capture this turbulent and chaotic period for the cast of young characters. For the most part, he did it. He snaked, but it seemed like a slice of life. This film occupies a special place in the hearts of the class of 80. We had just said goodbye for a decade, and then at the end of three or four years of challenging and sometimes difficult schooling. We were going into the cold and cruel world, leaving home to college and then to unknown parts. As we approached our watershed event, this newly released movie was like a two-hour yearbook for us. We could not escape the title song on the radio. We were up there on the screen. Those were our friends, rivals and classmates, as we had faced our own dreams, frustrations, successes, and failures. <br /> <br /> It is especially touching for those who attend any other elite New York high school class. , especially Stuyvesant, Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like the kids here, we were considered the best of the best. We did not have auditions, but rigorous entrance exams. Perhaps even more than the children of the Performing Arts, we hoped to change the world, though they did not necessarily become famous. Like them, not all of us did it. But the atmosphere of the pressure cooker provided extraordinary camaraderie and esprit de corps, not unlike the "Hot Lunch Jam" in the cafeteria. On our own graduation day, our spirits rose almost like the jubilant crescendo in the exciting ending. The film appropriately leaves us in a single triumphant note at the end of "I Sing the Electric Body," pointing to the incredibly bright and unlimited future and all the promise he made. <br /> <br /> "Fame" could not have been defined anywhere else. This story would never have worked in a small or suburban school. Los Angeles has a stronger identification with movies and television, but NYC is a mecca for all the arts. Home not only for what was then called PA, but also world-renowned Juilliard, NYC is a cultural center unmatched by any other city in the world. It is also a time capsule from the rest of the city at the time, showing the weakness and dirt that was endemic to a New York city still struggling with the fiscal crisis that had almost led to bankruptcy. But above all, it showed the vitality, since silenced by the incursions of Giuliani, Disney and tourism. <br /> <br /> What I would not give to be young again. But with "Fame", at least I can remember how it went.
