If you put Seinfeld aside, this is the best comedy of all time, no doubt! Just Great! <br /> <br /> "The King of Queens" has just finished his eighth season of domestic bliss. Set in the working-class suburb of Queens, New York, the program follows Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), a friendly deliveryman, and his wife, legal secretary Spitfire Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), as they explore the daily challenges of love. life, family and marriage. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie deal with the day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and allow us to laugh at ourselves. Their love for each other ends up leading them to every dilemma they face, whether it's Doug's fixation on food or Carrie's obsession for expensive clothes. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie also have to deal with the third parent, Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in his basement. His constant presence and often bizarre behavior increase his daily adventures. Doug and Carrie came across an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and keep Arthur happy on his regular outings with gullible hiker Holly (Nicole Sullivan). Doug's friends, Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine) complete the cast with their "face" humor and diverse perspectives. <br /> <br /> In a way that evokes "The Honeymooners," the king of queens finds inspiration in everyday life situations. Last season, alone, Doug "lent" Carrie to a deacon without a wife to help out at Thanksgiving dinner; the Heffernans suffering from the hassle and financial strain of fungus damage to their home; and Doug and Carrie struggling to copy a couple whose photos of a more adventurous life than that of Doug and Carrie accidentally took home. We also watched Arthur become jealous of a new dog Holly added to his route, and Doug discovered that his overprotective parents replaced his childhood dog, Rocky, three times in the back. The series shows James's incredible physical comedy, Remini's wit, and Stiller's unique comedic presence. <br /> <br /> You can not ... You must not miss it!
