I'm a big fan of Lonesome Dove and all the books in the series and I love the movie. I was happy to see that they did away with the Comanche moon. I have been a longtime fan of Steve Zahn and was looking forward to seeing him in a serious role. I personally think Steve Zahn did an incredible job of recreating Gus. I can not think of another actor who would have been better. He has the voice, the mannerisms, the pronunciation of the word, all for a T. Granted, no one could hold a candle to Robert Duvall like Gus, but I think Steve Zahn did a great job. Karl Urban acts the same way in all the films he has been in, so he made a good game for Woodrow Call. As for the movie itself, yes, it's a bit cheesy, but can you really beat Lonesome Dove? No, I do not think so.
