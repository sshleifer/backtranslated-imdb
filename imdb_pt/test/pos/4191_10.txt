This totally overlooked masterpiece is about the Monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie (Head), and that everything they do or say has already been written in an (invisible) screenplay that they seem to be following. Head was written by Jack Nicholson, Rafelson and Peter Tork during a three-day LSD trip in a suite at an expensive hotel in Hollywood. The other three Monkees only acted on him. <br /> <br /> They fight it in every way, doing things that are not in the script. They deliberately clean their lines, leave the scenes, rip the scene, punch other actors for no reason; and finally commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. <br /> <br /> For example, in the flashes of a psychedelic party scene, if you watch frame by frame, you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and the camera operator, deliberately shooting into a mirror. He is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being filmed in a studio with actors who suddenly abandon the character and leave in the middle of a conversation when the director shouts "cut"! <br /> <br /> Monkees, however, never abandon the character because these characters are who they really are. This ends up being the core of the Apocalypse coming soon. <br /> <br /> At each turn, they realize that their increasingly bizarre actions were exactly what they should do in the scripted film they can not help being. You say they went crazy and walked through the sky (what ends up being painted on paper and hanging on the ceiling like the background of the scenery)? No problems! Hey, hey, they're the Monkees, and those crazy guys just kidding! <br /> <br /> In the end, even their deaths did not set them free. That's how the movie should end, and their soggy, motionless bodies are fished in the river, placed in another box, and piled into a movie studio depot until the characters are needed again for another studio production. <br /> <br /> This is all the more poignant that the Monkees really are fictional characters who have forced themselves into the real world. They did it through the power of their songs. <br /> <br /> Ironically, near the end, Peter Tork has what he correctly sees as an extremely deep revelation that solves their problem, but unfortunately no one listens. <br /> <br /> Peter realizes, "It does not matter if we're in the box (the movie)." It means that it does not matter if the will is free or illusory, and that "the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur ... You need only let 'now' HAPPEN, as it happens," without analyzing or evaluate or judge whether the experience is "valid" by some abstract definition. <br /> <br /> When you can not even tell the difference, it will be free or not, no matter - tying the Discover if you are the "real" you are just a waste of useless time. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at a very important moment in my life. I was trying to figure out how to escape being just "that nerdy and frightening nerdy girl," thinking intensely instead of just having fun (that is, sex) as everyone else did. But the revelation in Head broke my self-imposed recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson, Nicholson, or Tork will ever know. <br /> <br /> For decades, I watched "Head" and wished I could thank Pete. <br /> <br /> Was this a good movie? <br /> <br /> Uh, how about, how ... <br /> <br /> <= <YES> ==
