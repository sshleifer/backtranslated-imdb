I've always loved "Gone With The Wind" and have seen it several times. However, his ending left me not only "hanging" but depressed, with a sense of hopelessness. Finally, in "Scarlett," Ripley led us to a very plausible and satisfying ending ("beginning") of the original story. <br /> <br /> It follows that someone of Scarlett's obvious intelligence (as originally written) ceases to be a child. Although, like most people, I fell in love with Scarlett in GWTW, I got tired of her insipid infantile insipidus to the point of exasperation, and I was disappointed that Mitchell did not show Scarlett using this obvious intelligence to try to grow emotionally. Luckily, someone finally did. (After all, is not that annoying immaturity that conflicted with her beauty and intelligence exactly why Rhett finally gave up on her?) I think Ripley did a great job in describing this long overdue process, and Whalley-Kilmer did a great job of portraying him. Joanne WK has all the fire, exuberance and clever brilliance as Vivian Leigh did, and she certainly is at least as, if not more, beautiful. There was, is and always will be only a Clark Gable However, if I had to choose an actor among the thousands to whom I was exposed to portray him in his biography, it would definitely be Timothy Dalton. Dalton has the same elegant charm as Gable, which is essential for Rhett's character. I can not imagine anyone else coming in. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were superbly cast and the only actors who could have played Scarlett and Rhett. I think both his performances did justice not only to the older actors but also to the spirit of their characters. <br /> <br /> I liked the whole cast. Julie Harris was her delightful presence and Jean Smart was a lovely kick! Even the character of Ashley was very well interpreted by Stephen Collins, and the progression of its relationship with Scarlett was totally convincing. <br /> <br /> The story got a little complicated in Ireland, but life is like that after all, and I still found it amusing. <br /> <br /> All in all, I enjoyed the fruits of Ripley's imagination. I wish I had written that! <br /> <br />
