The only reason why The Duke Is Tops, one of several "race movies" made during segregation times, would be noteworthy today is because it premiered the movie of a 21-year-old singer named Lena Horne. She plays Ethel Andrews, a singer who has to leave her mentor producer, Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) in order to get in the big time. Davis, however, has to pretend to have taken the money for his services in front of her so she does not feel sorry for her. He then joins Doc Dorando (Lawrence Criner) for a series of medical programs across the South. Meanwhile, in New York, their new producers bombarded a great moment because they did the whole show instead of simply the specialty act. Davis discovers on the radio and offers his services as a producer and band leader to bring his list of other specialty artists, many of whom make one of his few or only appearances in the movies here, for his chance at a great time with Ethel next to he. Guess what happens? While the plot is the kind you've seen in thousands of other musical films during this time, the fact that this was done for a particular audience makes this one of the most fascinating features I've seen during this Black History Month. Horne is singing well and it is interesting to see her so young before her professionalism consolidates later in her career. Among other supporting players there is an unconfirmed, according to IMDb, appearance of Lillian Randolph, Annie in my favorite movie It's a Wonderful Life and sister of Amanda Randolph I just saw in the musical short The Black Network, as the woman with sciatica who complains about not being cured after taking Doc's medication before Duke explains it's on his feet! And as a longtime Louisiana resident, I'd like to take note of two players here in this movie: Joel Fluellen of Monroe as a tonic client and Marie Bryant of New Orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax. So, just by Lena Horne, The Duke is Tops worth seeing at least once.
