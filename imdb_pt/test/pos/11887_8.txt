This is one of the great modern kung fu movies. Many of the comments seem to miss the point that the comedy is based on a rather subtle contrast, sometimes (at other times in your face) between ancient and new China. Kara Hui, for example, is called a country hick and gets into trouble whenever she tries to adapt to the new, but in the end she saves her families by honoring dresses as an old-fashioned heroine in contrast to Hsiao Ho's modern military style. Gordon Liu seems to have played the role of laughter while playing his serious persona monk with silly wigs and a guitar. The final fight is simply fantastic and ends in a defeat for Johnny Wang instead of death. Kwan Yung Moon should be mentioned for his great game of a thug with 'invincible armor' - just fantastic. And Kara Hui does some great acting and fights. A great movie.
