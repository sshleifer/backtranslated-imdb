This BBC series is excellent. I am not a paleontologist, but this series offers the best historical representation of dinosaurs I have ever seen. 3D animation and animatronics are very good and make you believe you've traveled back in time. The BBC deserves a pat on the back for such a good series, as has Tim Haines, who must have spent a lot of time making this series aired.
