This is a cut above other films of the genre: genuinely suspenseful, clever, brilliantly portrayed and visually stunning. Yes, the plot can be confusing - but that's partly what makes it so good. Watch twice, if you can. You will have almost as much to watch it when you know the turnaround than watching it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Do not be put off by the fact that this movie comes from Korea, a country not very familiar to most Western audiences. While there are elements of the film that are culturally specific, the underlying themes are all universal - guilt, anger, loss, madness and retribution. All these are treated superbly by Lim Su-jeong as Su-mi, the main character. Also worthy of special mention is Yum Jung-ah, which offers a deeply chilling and disturbing performance as the stepmother. <br /> <br /> Although it has its scary moments, this is not really a horror movie, as most people would imagine. It is more a story of psychological suspense with an element of mystery. It grabs you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end - and possibly beyond!
