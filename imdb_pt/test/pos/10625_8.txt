Overall I found this movie to be good: outstanding acting with disturbing scenes (some essential, some useless) and weak in the second half. CONTAINS SPOILERS The movie is divided into 2 parts. I thought the first half of the pianist was great. We meet Erika Kohut (wonderful Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher, and we are introduced to her world. She is single, struggling to find her space against a tyrannical, overprotective and borderline mother. We understand that she has lost or rarely experienced love as a physical + emotional chemistry: she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people, releases her sexual tensions in sex shops, such as voyeur or sadistic self-mutilations. This first semester is very clinical and builds an incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> Next comes Walter, a handsome young man, extroverted (played superbly by Benoit Magimel). Although he begins to feel the coldness of Erika at first, he seduces her and slowly destroys Erika's fortress. He loves her deeply, but she needs him to satisfy his sadistic desires. Then, when she is about to fall in love with him, he becomes disgusted with her world and, in the end, we discover that Erika is unable to love or feel anything (especially since Walter is portrayed as someone impossible to love). This is the second half of the film, very touching when we see Erika's inability / inexperience to love lead her to self-destruction. This second semester seemed less dominated by Haneke, and sometimes had scenes that were not credible (that is, very shocking) that paradoxically diminished the drama. <br /> <br /> Of course this is a rough movie, at least in the French version. : You see pornographic sex shop sequences, audacious mutilations and sex scenes. The much talked about fellatio scene between Magimel and Huppert was very good, I thought, and it is fundamental to understand Erika's unhealthy relationship with love. As for the actors, Huppert is wonderful throughout the film, Magimel gets better and better to perfection, and Girardot (the mother) is excellent. <br /> <br />
