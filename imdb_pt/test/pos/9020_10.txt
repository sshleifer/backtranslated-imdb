I saw this movie a week ago and had to convince my friend to come with me because this movie seems to be getting such bad reviews. Of course it's not 'Human Traffic' or 'Lock, Stock ...' but it's not a flop. I think the fact that there are so many great movies at the moment means that it was ignored, but it should not be. I believe that you strive to do what you want to do - have fun for an hour and a half and make us happy and content. I'd rather go and see that 'The Mummy', which looks annoying. And no, I'm not a teenager. Do not listen to the critics, Star Wars fans have not heard. This movie is worth seeing, just to see Lacey's beautiful Luke and Rupert Penry-Jones. Go and see!
