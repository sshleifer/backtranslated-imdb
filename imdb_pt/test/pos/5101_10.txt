I wish I had been exposed to it for the first time in a movie theater when it was first released, as some of the commentators had been. It really is a treasure. To be fair I did not see any other version of Goodbye, Mr. Chips and neither do I. For me, this is a perfect version. I first saw TCM years ago and never forgot it. I had the pleasure of watching it with my girlfriend yesterday, although I recorded it from TCM days before. There were parts of the movie we were both eyeballing about, it's really a touching movie. <br /> <br /> And should not that be what the movies are? <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful, the movie was beautifully filmed. The performance is top notch. And the story is delicate and timeless. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite movies of all time.
