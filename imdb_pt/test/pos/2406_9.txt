I wish the series had not ended so soon. Although the performance may not be the greatest in the world, it ends on a positive note and teaches viewers moral and values. Hilary Swank did a good job portraying a high school student who lost her parents, etc. Miyagi was great as was the previous 3! If you are not in the happy ending, this movie as the previous 3 series is not for you. On this day we live you can not see enough about the bad guys getting what they deserve and the good guys coming out on top. The Bible teaches that good will always triumph over evil. That is exactly what happens in this. It's a great family movie. Please see if you have not already.
