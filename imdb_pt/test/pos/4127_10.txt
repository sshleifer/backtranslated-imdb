This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy kind of music. The movie has some sad parts, but mostly music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly continued even with her pastor, her parents and the Nashville record producer told her no. Buddy Holly did not give up on what she liked. I did not know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie. I was at the Surf Ballroom where he played for the last time, but I did not pay much attention until I watched this movie. It's an amazing movie with lots of fun, so stand up and watch this movie.
