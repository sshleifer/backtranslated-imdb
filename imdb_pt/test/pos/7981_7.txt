This movie is where the Batman franchise should have stopped. Although I admit that the ideas behind "Batman Forever" were excellent and could have been easily noticed by a competent director, as it turned out, this was not the case. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Warner Brothers executives were disappointed at how dark this second Tim Burton Batman movie ended. In addition to the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of his subsequent decision to turn the franchise into a tribute to the 1960s TV series, I can not understand how "Batman Returns" can be considered disappointing. It's true that it's not exactly the same as the first movie - although it fixes all the minor flaws in style found in "Batman," a weaker writing that divides the antagonism between not just two but three characters who invite to dislike comparisons with Keaton and Jack Nicholson's masterful pairing as the Joker in the first film. However, for all of this, it remains a wonderfully dark film, true to how Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying. Michael Keaton returns as Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, interweaving with Max Schreck, new wealthy tycoon, Christopher Walken, honored as a silent German actor in the 1920s, Oswald Cobblepot, crime partner, Penguin (Danny DeVito in makeup brilliant that reminds Richard III of Laurence Olivier) and Selina Kyle. , the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), to whom Wayne novels like him and as Batman. The four directors present excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while Keaton and Pfeiffer together explore the darker side of dual identities. <br /> <br /> There are some intriguing concepts in this movie. About the only weakness I can really point to is a certain weakness in the script in some places, which I think is mainly due to how this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply is not enough time to properly explore what is happening. <br /> <br /> However, this is a great movie. I recommend seeing this in conjunction with the first, and then crying over how good the series could have been if it had continued under Burton and Keaton.
