This is probably one of the best French films I've seen in a long time! This "pastiche" or parody of spy movies is very well done and will make you laugh from start to finish. Some references to the world today are very subtle. The whole Moroccan context of the film must be understood in the light of the current French culture / environment. That said, all the jokes and - apparently - shocking observations that could have been understood as such because of this context are allowed and accepted because this is a parody. I was told by my sisters who had seen this movie that I should go too and they assured me that I would have so much fun, and indeed I did! If you liked the old 007 movies with Sean Connery and also like movies like Airplane or Hot Shots, you will be delighted. I just hope this movie is released on DVD in the US ... Wait and see.
