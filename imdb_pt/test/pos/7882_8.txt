Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local pub. Joe (Peter Boyle), a fanatic who is getting drunk there, at first takes it as a joke, but then the story is confirmed on the evening news. Instead of calling the cops or something, Joe decides that as the guy killed a hippie, they must be like spirits! He blackmails the man to become his friend. At first the film seemed harsh and critical, but, as it turned out, it became a rather complex picture of today's society. Yes, I think it exaggerates a bit, but in fun ways it does not really diminish the power of your messages. Susan Sarandon debuted in this movie, and it's a shock to see how beautiful she was for about 23 years. Worth seeing.
