Take a young liberal idealist Christopher Boyce (Timothy Hutton) placed in a secret classification in a government front company because of the position of his father team him with a drug dealer Daulton Lee (Sean Penn), who is sought by the police and you need a new source of income and you have a recipe for spying. Sean Penn played the punk drug dealer with a certain froid, probably of a particular verisimilitude with such daring types. The bravery that Penn carries with him in all situations is unique; he even suggests that the Soviets use drugs for him. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie several times and every time I see something new. It seems to me that a major problem with US espionage organizations is their endogamy, which leads to hiring an obviously inadequate candidate for temperament and inclination for a government-owned company. <br /> <br /> I remember when the Falconeer escaped from prison and led the authorities in a wild chase. I see that despite the escape, he is now released. Too bad the Soviets are no longer around to accept the unfortunate! A Full Cherie!
