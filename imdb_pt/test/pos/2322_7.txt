Start a little slow but give it a try. In the spirit of the "Wackiest Ship in the Arm" and the "Pink Sub" this movie is about a not-so-orthodox group involved in not-so-orthodox methods to fool everyone. Rob Schneider is invaluable as an LT who takes himself too seriously, resulting in a failed riot attempt and "pirate" crew making him walk on the board. In contrast, Kelsey Grammar (similar to Cary Grant) takes nothing seriously except work. This movie is more about lines than plot. From the fisherman "beered up" in the port of Charleston to the "whale" decoy, his antics took me by surprise and I laughed out loud.
