I grabbed my attention on Netflix Instant Play because it was only an hour and a half long (it's coming at 4 in the morning here) and because it's Norwegian, I wanted to keep up with Dead Snow and see what else the country offers at the international cinema now same. A fun and deliciously ironic prank, this film features a man, Andreas, who is sent to some Purgatory in a Brave New World city where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste, nothing smells, and even sex loses its appeal. Taken to the brink by his lack of common sense, he feels almost ready to kill himself. After a hilarious failed attempt at the latter, Andreas tracks a man with similar complaints and the two discover a small, vagina-shaped hole in a concrete wall from which the music emanates. The two try to cross to see what is on the other side, tracing a little light they can barely see. But of course, in the land of fantasy allegory, desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end Andreas's attempt at freedom and sensuality. <br /> <br /> Jens Lien and his team create a simple and straightforward style. move forward to the story, one that flows well with their themes and moves on just enough of a pace to avoid delays. The similarities in other similar science fiction are not worth listing, but still the film has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some very creepy ones. I like the limited but effective use of blood in this movie, some stuttering and flogging that will make your heart stutter more than The Passion of Christ simply because it is so out of place in the grayish mise-en-scene. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a trusted actor who feels physically out of place, which works very well. Despite the fact that the concept itself is nothing to write about, everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
