Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are not for people who were born before 1980 or after 1989. Most of these people would not appreciate the great things that are the cartoon of the 80's. The fact that Rainbow Brite was turned into film is a Guilty pleasure for many of us who remember watching the TV show as a child. Granted, much of the dialogue is quite fun and silly, and the plot is non-existent to useless, but it's a really cool movie though.
