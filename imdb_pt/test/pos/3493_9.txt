Ali G's show was really amazing - he was such a stupid rapper, but no one he interviewed realized he was just faking. Sasha Cohen is actually a very smart guy who pretends to be stupid so he can get really honest responses from people ... And that's very funny. So I did not expect the movie to be good, because it was all done - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of the whole show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Of course it was stupid, but who cares if you can not really lock up the safety with a car battery, like someone said? It was not to be a realistic documentary ... And it's not like the show, it's totally different, but that does not mean it's bad. When I finished watching, I was totally impressed, but now, when it was some time, I realized it was not that special, but it still deserves a nine - well, at least for what it should be.
