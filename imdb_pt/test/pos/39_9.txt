Since I first met the Divine Mrs. Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee's "She's Gotta Have It," I was sold in the line of this gifted but terribly underrated actress. She received an Emmy for her portrait here and saying that it's deserved is a masterpiece of euphemism. <br /> <br /> Here she simply shines as the guiding force and hand in her community. This was especially poignant for me as I grew up in this same time frame. The production detail was phenomenal and evoked woooooooooooooo wonderful memories of life and times during the 50s and 60s and of women like Ms Merkerson portrayed. She was complete and skillfully accompanied by a hot and hot cast with performances that would be enjoyed over and over again. I first saw the name of Macy Gray in the credits and I was discouraged. His performance was so good that I did not even recognize it until about a third of the way. I am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a sense of another beautiful era in African-American culture that is made with great taste. Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but infinitely more attuned to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that ultimately, it is about the choices we make and the extent to which we accept responsibility for those choices. <br /> <br /> This is a dignified and elegant presentation of African-American life and is certainly destined to become a classic. You owe it to yourself as part of your collection. <br /> <br /> I recommend it.
