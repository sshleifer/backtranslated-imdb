Beware, My Lovely came on TV on BBC2 recently during the night, so I put the video to record it and I was glad I did it. <br /> <br /> A man finds a dead woman, so he escapes, so he is not to blame for the murder and get a job as a handyman at a widow's house, but she does not know what she's doing here. It turns out that this man is a psychopath and a possible killer. He begins to torment her and locks her in the basement. He then cuts off the phone line so that she can not get help from outside. A boy who regularly makes purchases for her realizes that something is not right when he goes out to shop. Eventually, the man leaves, acting as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> I can see why Beware, My Lovely received an X certificate when it was released in theaters. Some of the scenes are quite unpleasant for this time. I also thought the man would do something to the boy too. <br /> <br /> The cast has an excellent performance by Robert Ryan as the psychopath, Ida Lupino as the widow and is joined by Barbara Whiting and Dee Pollock as the boy. <br /> <br /> This is certainly Robert Ryan's most chilling performance I have ever seen. A must see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
