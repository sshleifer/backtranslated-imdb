Very good "Precoder," starring Dick Barthelmess, who, in a way, reminded me of "Only Angels Have Wings" by Hawks (1939), in which Barthelmess also starred. This film was directed by conductor William Wellman, who was responsible for the aviation reference Silent picture "Wings". <br/> <br/> <br/> Barthelmess plays a diabolical plane pilot, who is guilty of an aviation accident. Later he meets and falls in love with the beautiful Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess's brother appears on the scene, a triangular relationship follows. <br /> <br /> "Central Airport" has many exciting moments and some exciting and touching scenes as well, thanks to the great chemistry that develops between Barthelmess and Eilers (which, in my opinion, in this film closely resembles the actress Dorothy Mackaill). Tom Brown is good as Barthelmess brother, fresh from his success in Wyler's "Tom Brown of Culver". <br /> <br /> Great special effects, good flying acrobatics, fast paced movie; at all, very fun. Do not lose when TCM goes to air again.
