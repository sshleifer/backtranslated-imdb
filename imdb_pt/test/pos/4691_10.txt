I have great memories watching "Robin of Sherwood" on TV as a kid (but I guess I just saw the Michael Praed episodes for some reason). And recently my brother bought the new DVD boxes released from the complete series. It was great to see you again, and it's the best of all the Robin Hood movies and TV series. The cast is great, and the places mixed with Clannad's music add that very special feeling. I personally think Praed is the best of the two Robins, but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series. Ray Winstone, Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie are great in their roles as Will Scarlet, The Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisburne. It's a shame that a fourth season has never been made, and I also heard that writer Richard Carpenter really had plans to make a movie after the events of the series. Robert de Huntingdon (Connery) could have finally married Marion (Judi Trott), or maybe Herne the Hunter, could resurrect Robin de Loxley (Praed), and he could take revenge on the sheriff. As mentioned before; if the producers of "Robin Hood: The Prince of Thieves" had been clever, they would have got the cast of "Robin of Sherwood," and made the film for some sort of sequel to the series. As Ray Winstone puts it on the DVD bonus material, it would have been great to see them as old, as in "Robin and Marian" by Sean Connery. Who knows, perhaps we will show more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. Anyway, now we can watch our favorite series again and again!
