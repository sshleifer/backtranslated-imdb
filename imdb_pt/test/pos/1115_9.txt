I saw this at the launch of Accent Underground with the short films. I found the movie at first boring and old fashioned and hung up after the first hour - I was a little drunk and tired. <br /> <br /> I went to bed, and no kidding I had a nightmare about this movie within half and hour of falling asleep. I could not stop thinking about why, so I got up, turned on the TV, loaded the DVD, and watched the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Well done, Alex Frayne, sir, you did Implement your movie into this old, cynical videographer's head, and that takes you seriously. Then 10 out of 10 for you. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I love this film, but it has had a lasting impact, despite its shortcomings and low budget, etc.
