Obviously, the responses here were written many years after the movie's release and can not be considered in context. In 1980, in post-labor England, this movie was very funny. We were glad of something to laugh at and Rising Damp, with his friendly mockery of a full social stratum, was one of the best British sitcoms of his period if not always. That impressed almost everyone, and in true British fashion, we laughed at Rigsby in ourselves. The US had nothing to play in that kind of mood because self-deprecation was not fun for our overseas cousins. Leonard Rossiter was one of the best actors in England, on stage, on TV and in the movies. Their commitment and professionalism were second to none. Richard Beckinsale was, in spite of being a young man, a perfect comedian for Rossiter and should, by all means, be classified as a great success of all time. If he had not been so young, I'm sure he would by now be classified as one of the greatest actors in British comedy. Frances De la Tour found her best television moment at Rising Damp, and for me, she never quantified her undoubted ability with additional roles. If you have not seen the movie at the time of its release, you are not qualified to comment, simply because you can not understand why it was funny, the mood of the moment.
