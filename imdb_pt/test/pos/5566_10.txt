This series is greatly underestimated. Like many others, I found Farscape after the series was canceled. He bought Season 1 and was surprised to find a cleverly written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense, romance, wit, and, of course, science fiction. Right away, he won 10 because it was the first series or movie to satisfy us as our hero - and every alien he comes in contact with - speaks English! Okay, a few others skirted the issue, but Farscape did the best. The point is that writers pay close attention to detail to make the program as believable as possible. <br /> <br /> With so much bad programming out there, it's a shame that fun and balanced series like Farscape does not get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production. While we enjoyed the four seasons and, fortunately, the four-hour miniseries, maybe we could make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.
