I saw this mini-series for the first time as a kid and although I'm not a kid anymore, I still love it !!! Professional copies are hard to find, however, when it's on DVD, it's MINE !!! =] <br /> <br /> Great cast, wonderful plot and lots of action, romance and even a bit of well-placed comedy. I am not a historian by nature, but I love this masterpiece of historical fiction!
