This is an amazing film: a romantic thriller with a complicated but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot, brilliantly enhanced by the use of recurring visual motifs. Everything in it is beautifully filmed: the women, the apartments; but more amazing is the devastating juxtaposition of images, almost all the scenes have echoes of others. This is a story told in light, in color, in many almost parallel. Every time I watch, it fills me with pleasure. <br /> <br /> The acting is also great. Romane Bohringer is amazing as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: everything about her changes with her mood. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role in his part in La Haine; but not less excellent: shifty and friendly at the same time. And Monica Bellucci - oh, Monica Bellucci, well, in other words, she plays (is?) The most perfect woman in the world. There is a small scene of about three-quarters of the way where she does nothing but smile; still in that instant, says more than hours of Hollywood trash. <br /> <br /> You can not do justice to this movie without at least mentioning the superb and sequential climax: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle in turn. But if one moment captures the brilliance of this work, it is the scene at the beginning of this fabulous end, whose perspective has been provocatively placed before us throughout history. However, when the time comes, he is treated so delicately, so briefly, so cleverly, that, in reflection, he makes you choke. Only a baffling director of confidence would dare to underestimate this vital point. But trust is justified. Cinema does not come much better than that.
