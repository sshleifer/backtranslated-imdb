This movie is based on the actual story of the Iowa housewife Lucille Fray, who had breast cancer after the birth of her tenth child. Realizing that the state would take the children from her ineffective, alcoholic husband, she spent the last year of her life traveling the state to find new homes for each child. A great script - which still lasts 20 years after it was first made. Growing children, many of whom had not seen each other since her mother died in the late 1950s, were reunited in "That's Incredible," before the film was shown in 1983. Barbara Stanwyck won the Emmy for Best Actress in a TV Movie or mini-series, but during her acceptance speech, she struggled to release Ann-Margret for her moving performance.
