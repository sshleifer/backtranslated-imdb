John Cassavetes is running away from the law. He's at the bottom of the pile. He sees Black Sidney Poitier as his equal and they quickly become friends, forming a kind of alliance against a bully of a foreman played by Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> As someone who worked with me in a warehouse The younger I can tell you that warehouse fights, complete with drop boxes and heaving hooks, are as realistic as possible. I've been in such fights, though no one has been killed. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Sidney Poitier's widow is a variation of Shakespeare's Shylock: "Am I not bleeding?" This is an anti-racist film, which at the time was very necessary. <br /> <br /> All three main characters - Warden, Cassavetes and Poitier - are superb, with Warden being the most prominent of the three.
