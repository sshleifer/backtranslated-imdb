This is like the first of Ma and Pa Kettle's films. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show on anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the old daffy on the train ... god she was ALWAYS old; she was in "Desk Set" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents". His new house is also a co-star here - it's the home of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa does not care about. I love the joke of painting. Keep an eye on TOM ... he starred in "Nanny & the Professor". Unfortunately he died very young ... curiously, his last role was in the series "Death Cruise". weird. Directed by Charles Lamont, who not only directed several of Kettle's films, he also made a lot of films from Abbott and Costello, so he must have known a thing or two about comedy. Fun story, simple and simple humor. Even the release date was April 1, 1949. The story begins by showing us what are retrograde and campestre (the neighbors are even Native Americans), but as the story progresses, we have sympathy and respect for them.
