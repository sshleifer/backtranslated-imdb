Years before prenuptial agreements became a regular thing, Ernest Lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they are the basis. Bluebeard's eighth wife involves Gary Cooper as a multi-millionaire who lives on the French Riviera who has been married seven times and now marries Claudette Colbert for number eight. But Cooper is a good sport about it, he always establishes himself with his ex-wives for $ 50,000 a year, according to an agreement they sign before marrying him. Sounds like what we now call a prenuptial agreement. <br /> <br /> Of course Claudette wants more than that and she thinks Cooper takes a completely different approach to marriage. She would like the real deal and is willing to make some considerable efforts to get it. <br /> <br /> Bluebeard's eighth wife has some really funny moments, the original meeting of Cooper and Colbert in a men's shop where Cooper is insisting that he just wants pajama toppers and Colbert looking for only bottoms. And of course, my favorite is Colbert dragging and blackmailing the detective Cooper sends to spy on her. Herman Bing has the best supporting role in the film than the fumbling detective. <br /> <br /> I've always wondered how in the old days Hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are not French a movie like that. Of course Cooper is an American and Colbert's cast is the only one of French origin. Although David Niven is charming as ever, having him as Frenchman is ridiculous, he is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the Eighth Wife of Bluebeard is a nice film and a great example of what was called the 'Touch Lubitsch'. in the old days.
