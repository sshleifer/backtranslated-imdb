I have no idea what the budget of this movie was, but whatever it was they made it work! I've seen movies that spend 100 times the amount (Pearl Harbor, anyone?) And sucked 200 times over. This movie has it all. David "Makin 'It" Naughton in the lead role as Adam, an ordinary college student who gets involved in a game called Great AllNighter "directed by Leon! This guy is a" genius "with nothing better to do than show up with an elaborate game for a lot of people play, but he does not just choose his friends, he has a team of athletes, nerds, chubby, ordinary kids and, of course, the Flounder team who are the "bad guys." -and-white, there are lots of shades of gray, Adam is not the unselfish hero without fail, treats Alex P. as trash, and Flounder is as it is because of his father's pressures and a cranky stomach.The jockeys play dirty, but the same goes for everyone! This movie rocks! The scene at the PBR factory? Classic! "Johnny's Obese Male Child?" Can you write a better track? This stuff is Jerry Gold! GOLD! Maybe I'm from a different generation , but I love movies that seem forced, but still have roots It never happened ... but it could happen. e-Gypt .... EEEE .... Easter Bunny .... Easter Parade! Oh, and watch a young Paul Rubens still working on that Pee character. PS Devra Clinger was / is hot! She must have been a bad actress not to work in Hollywood anymore. SEE THIS MOVIE!
