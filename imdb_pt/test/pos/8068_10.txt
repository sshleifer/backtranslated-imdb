While it may seem a bit bizarre to see a 32-year-old actress play a 12-year-old girl, Mary Pickford soon makes you forget the incongruities and just enjoy the fun. <br /> <br /> Mary is a street kid in New York City with her own lovely gang of mischief makers whose attention is engaged by the older William Haines (he was 25 at the time and was on the verge of his stardom in screen). <br /> <br /> Giving too much of the plot would not be fair. Just that Mary is so much fun to watch and shows why she was the first and most beloved super star in Hollywood. The production values ​​are very good, with many extras making the New York street scenes quite believable.
