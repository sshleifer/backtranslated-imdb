The happiest days of her life showcase some of Britain's greatest comedy talents of her day in a traditionally burlesque and high-class fashion. It's usually a whirlwind English behavior whistle tour with the girls-only school providing a great backdrop to the poignant happenings. Margaret Rutherford, Alastair Yes and - more especially! - Joyce Grenfell are all fantastic, giving us lots of laughs as they express their utter horror at what they are having to deal with. As the movie progresses, things get increasingly silly with the return of school for parents to be a good cracker point. <br /> <br /> At this point, I will give a special mention, again, to Joyce Grenfell and his wonderful character, Miss Gossage. She is so extraordinarily innocent, silly, apologetic and ineffective that she seems to steal the whole movie. She gives the film's best laugh when she flirts with a teacher ("Call me sausage!"). <br /> <br /> Although part of the film is slow or dated, and not always very engaging, it still retains most of its brightness and pauses for romance. Good for a silly and harmless giggle. <br /> <br /> 7/10
