Hey man, this movie is all about choices. Every time in your life you should choose something or just go through ... And this movie proves it! Of course, life is not really as beautiful as this movie shows ... does not actually show, but some may discover it. I am trying to say that it is full of pain, love and deep lessons to live. Aaron, the Mormon missionary is the true shepherd digging the beautiful thing deep down Chisthian, the guy who has the skin ... <br /> <br /> It's a great ending and you always believe in fate because it will surprise you one shift or another in your life as the Last Days ... <br /> <br /> Great deal, watch !!!
