As an independent filmmaker on Long Island, and having had two theatrical releases under my production / directing belt, I always knew how much I could learn from watching a FRED CARPENTER production, so I was fortunate to have his "Eddie Monroe." "My heart was for its characters, it's a story and it was totally won over by the end of the trick / commutation that took the movie's plot to fruition! sites have been beautifully chosen and the human emotions in their characters have brought a realistic connection with my connection with all the elements that Mr. Carpenter has used throughout the film for the benefit of him and his film!
