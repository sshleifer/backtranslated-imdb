In 1858, Tolstoy wrote in his diary: "The politician is not compatible with the artistic, because the first, to prove, has to be one-sided." This thought of a great mind is applicable to USA The Movie. The film can be read by those with a narrow focus such as a 90-minute strike from Bush, Cheney et. al. as well as the destruction of America as an uncontrolled imperialist force that will eventually be destroyed by its own madness and thirst for power. The more open viewer will take note of the recurring images and themes that make this DVD a proof of postmodernist thinking as the main character breaks into pieces surrounded by recurring images of the natural world in contrast to man-made constructions. ; towers, roads, video monitors, radio, vehicles. Above all, the menacing threat of wars that have been and are about to burn everywhere. War and rumors of war are what is created, destroyed and recreated on the screen, in our conscious world and in our unconscious minds.
