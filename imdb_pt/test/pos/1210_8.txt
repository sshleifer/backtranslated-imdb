This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that, I believe, is not the same today. The colorful characters - in their stereotyped dress - brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by society and overexposed. Wrestling had a bit of innocence back then. A kid could watch it without watching an episode of Jerry Springer. Looking back now (I was 5 at the time), although I love Warrior and Hogan, I think I liked Warrior more because of him. mystical Hogan was the brand hero who had an impressive public image. The Ultimate Warrior, on the other hand, was a masked man of few words - a hero out of focus for a different audience. <br /> <br /> This rivalry was as exciting as a child because of it. duality in me fighting for each fighter. I had a place for both of them. Because there was also bloodshed in this long and heavy battle, the stakes were high - at least for me as a child. On a similar note, because of Hogan's defeat, it made him more human - I remember feeling sorry for him. <br /> <br /> All those thrills at stake in the young soap opera have made Wrestlemania VI one of those things. Great time to witness this game.
