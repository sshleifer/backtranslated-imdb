I recently watched this movie and decided to comment on it. <br /> <br /> The best way to watch this movie is do not expect what you've seen in the past by Miyazaki. Miyazaki is known for his work on Spirited and Howl Castle. well for western viewers anyway. Both films were similar to each other, but at the same time completely different. However Ponyo is a totally different type of story and animation all together. <br /> <br /> The story follows "Ponyo" a fish that has the face of a girl. After Ponyo flees from her home on the seabed, she finds a whole new world she has never met, and a new problem too, when she was almost caught by a fishing boat, she was rescued by a five-year-old child. age. boy known as Sousuke. <br /> <br /> The story follows the two and the pure friendship between a boy and a fish. Can Ponyo really stay with Sousuke forever? <br /> <br /> I feel that the film was inspired by "The Little Mermaid" and at the same time similar to "Tonari no Totoro" <br /> <br /> the film is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this movie. But the Characters a fish and a little boy, so how much do you expect to learn about them? the film is set on what seems to be 3 days, I think that's why the film is so short. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I hope you like this movie too
