I really loved this movie and spent several years trying to get it. It is not available and has not been on TV for many years. I liked it and the songs because they had something different to say and made you think how each person looks at something from different perspectives. Too often we do not appreciate something we have until we are no longer there. <br /> <br /> My 12 year old daughter has just discovered the song and is delighted with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the movie so that she has the opportunity to see. (Oh, I'd love to see it again too!) <br /> <br />
