A mixture of 1970s drug humor, along with the parody of medicine and the classic plot. As I always said about this movie - if you do not understand - you're very lame ... Classic lines like (parapharsed) "I have this erection and it will not go away no No matter how many times I do it.You're a nurse, What can you give me for that? "Nurse replies" All I have is $ 5 and my wedding ring ... "Great soundtrack. The classic "Hyde has nothing to hide". It remains surprisingly close to the original plot - not that the original remains in the way of a joke ... I have not met anyone with an IQ above 115 who does not find hysterical. <br /> <br />
