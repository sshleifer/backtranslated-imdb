A fantastic film, and very forgetful. Gary has never been so handsome, and Ingrid is prettier than in ANY other movie. If you do not believe, just watch the movie. Every member of the cast is wonderful; the love scenes between Gary and Ingrid will make your wrist race! The story is great, the script is Oscar. Do not miss this movie !!
