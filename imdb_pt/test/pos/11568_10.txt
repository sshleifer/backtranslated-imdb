After the success of "Muppet Babies", Warner Brothers attributed "Tiny Toons". But instead of making Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and all the rest of the Looney Toon gang kids, they created new animal characters who were children with distinct personalities but personalities who nevertheless mirrored their predecessors. The links included Buster & Babs Bunny (no relationship, which became his gag or slogan), Plucky Duck, Hampton Pig, Dizzy Devil, Shirley 'o' Loon, Elmira, Montana Max, Furball, Sweety, Perfecto Prep, and the original Looney Toons were released. The "Little Toons" lived in Acme Acres and attended Acme Looniversity, where the Looney Toon gang worked as mentors for the younger generation in and out of the comedy. <br /> <br /> During the show's run, several pot shots were made in the Bush SR. Administration, pop culture, and along with several other gags and spoofs. Buster & Babs undoubtedly the main characters in the series, as mentioned above, were similar to Bugs Bunny in some ways, but they also had their snails of different personalities and comic styles, namely, Babs's tendency to pass on to anyone and everyone, while Buster, capable of being a great idiot, often played the straight man (or common rabbit) with the antics of Babs. Plucky Duck was a virtual copy of Daffy Duck (not crazy Daffy, but egomaniac Daffy), with an ego almost as big as Daffy and an obsession for overshadowing Buster & Babs like Daffy with Bugs, although he usually fell. face to face in his attempts, but he remained strangely affectionate. Hampton was an even more timid version of Porky Pig, and he had the ungrateful job of playing Porky to Plucky's Daffy. Shirley, the blonde girl of the duck, was a girl of the type new age valley, that Plucky entered and exited of phases of mocking or disputing his affections. Dizzy was the devil's purple version of Tasmania. Furball was the silent Sylvester and Sweety was the pink Tweetie bird. There was also the purple skunk that craved a boyfriend and the versions of Wile Coyote and Road Runner. Evil was defined in the form of Montana Max, a rich kid who was always willing to make money or make people's lives unhappy. There was also Elmira, a troubled animal lover that everyone feared. And then there was Godo Dodo, a strange creature, who had no clearly designated species except that he was from "Wacky Land" or something. <br /> <br /> Pop culture references included Batman. Michael Jackson, Vanilla Ice, Dances With Wolves, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Supergirl, Fast Food, The Ten Commandments, Twilight Zones, Saturday Night Live and even the Simpsons, among others. Not only funny, but also managed to be warm and touching, something that is successor "Animaniacs" never hit. Also followed by "Taz-Mania".
