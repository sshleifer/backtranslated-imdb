An especially delightful film for those of us who saw it when they were young, because after all it was for the young to watch - when you see it again as an adult, it is best if the pink glasses come into play. It was the first of 16 films. Jungle Jim and Johnny Weismuller continued to do for Columbia (in the last 3 movies he had to use his own name, since they lost their rights) after receiving the Tarzan sack for Sol Lesser. Johnny Sheffield also gave up playing Boy to become the Pump the Jungle Boy in a series of 12 films. <br /> <br /> Jim and his group make a dangerous safari to hunt down the secret temple of Zimbabwe manned by an obscure tribe of the devil. doctors who seem to have the secret of a poison that can also be a cure for polio. Edgar Rice Burroughs probably approved. After 16 years talking monosyllabically, Weismuller seemed embarrassingly uniting phrases, not that it mattered. In the rapid march we find many of the interesting, but usually playful inhabitants of the jungle barring the sinister crocodile and eating the protagonist with the leg caught under a branch and the surreal stampede of the elephants (filming squeezed in one corner of the picture). ). Skipper the dog and Caw-Caw the raven had many adventures, none of which became essential to the plot if you were concentrating! The biggest problem with the movie is the farsque climax, which can be exciting, but also, unfortunately, remind you of the end of a serial part? and the excellent original series was made 12 years earlier. Although personally, I would not have minded that in another two hours too! <br /> <br /> The only thing heavy on this was Weismuller; in many ways a nice children movie from the old days - not recommended for serious adults, so I love it.
