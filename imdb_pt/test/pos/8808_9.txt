I remember a time when the only thing that existed was clubs, pharmacies and parties. This movie came out a few years after I started going to nightclubs. If I had never discovered the rudest side of things, this movie may not have made sense to me. That night, when I first attended, with some friends, I was completely delighted. I've never watched a movie so close to the reality of where I was in my life at the time. Almost everything I could relate to in any way. There has never been a character I could relate to, but a combination of all of them in one form or another. My friends where no different and I remember everyone saying that they where we or us where they. We all went out together that weekend doing exactly what the team does at HT. We went down while we were watching and when the movie "came down" I remember coming down a bit more. It was really very depressing in our room during these "low points". That's what's so good about Human Trafficking. really beats the whole situation. <br /> <br /> It is a unique movie in the way it is not directed by plot lines, but then it is not completely directed by characters, although the characters are important. It always seemed to be based on situations. Situations as a group and as individuals. Each character is lost in life, for their own reasons. yet each of them responds to loss in the same way. work at any job to earn money to pay for the weekend and escape from it all. for them it is their holiday. But the reality is that you can not truly escape. Another situation they all have to face. <br /> <br /> Me and my comrades, where is no different from these guys. We all had our own things going on. Human trafficking helped us explain what we did not understand about ourselves. He does it in a way that does not talk to you. It made us feel like we were not the only ones like ourselves and that the lessons learned were many others coming from all over the world. It was not until my lifestyle changed from party popper to career that I would fully understand this movie. Nowadays I watch HT from time to time (as I just did), and reminisce about the old days. No other movie can do that. I was peter popper, I was jip travolta, I never went to land with my chosen family. I would have $ 200 on my back burner and I would wax the lot! Do not worry!
