Sweet, funny tale of a 17-and-a-half-year-old boy, controlled by an authoritarian religious mother and withdrawn father, and how he finds himself through his work with a retired, eccentric and tragic actress. Very well represented, especially by Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the role of the teenager well, showing that his talent will outlast the Harry Potter film series. Laura Linney plays her relentlessly rigorous mother without a hint of redemption, so there is no room to like her at all. But the film is a very entertaining film, made by the British in the style of likes Keeping Mum and Calendar Girls.
