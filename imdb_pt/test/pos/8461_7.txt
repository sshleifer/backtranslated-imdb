Christine Lahti (Sandy Dunlap) and Mary Tyler Moore (Holly Davis) worked well with soapish material, Ted Danson did his best with an ungrateful role of Chip Davis. The premise of this is that the friendship of the two women, a seemingly happy married woman and the other, a career woman who is aware of her biological clock. I found the relationship that the character of Ted Danson had with the single played by Christine Lahti, who is quite sordid. He behaved in a depleted way, but left two "widows" nestling in him, screaming. I found it revolting when Sandy told him that he wanted to break up after meeting his wife, he calls her saying that he misses her (he called his wife?). He behaved like a leap. Maybe he would have made a more interesting film if he had not been killed. Perhaps the two ladies had prepared and abandoned. I liked the friendship between the two ladies, but it was spoiled by what they had in common: the cad of a husband.
