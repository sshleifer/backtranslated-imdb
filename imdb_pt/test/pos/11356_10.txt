I think New York Times film critic Elvis Mitchell wrote the best review of an In the Mood for Love line when he said he was "stunned by a romantic spirit that's gone from the movies forever." How true are these words! Truly romantic movies are so rare nowadays, while movies that include lots of sex and nudity (which are often portrayed dirty and free) abound. So, given this cinematographic climate, Wong Kar-wai's latest film seems like a much needed breath of fresh air. In Mood for Love, this is the doomed novel between two neighbors ("Mr. Chow", played by Tony Leung and "Mrs. Chan", played by Maggie Cheung), whose spouses are having an illicit affair, as they try to " not be like them ". But after hanging out with each other on lonely nights (while their spouses are away "on business" / "caring for a sick mother"), they fall madly in love and must resist the temptation to go too far. Several factors are responsible for making In the Mood for Love a new classic among "romantic melodramas," in the best sense of that term. Firstly, the specific period of the film (ie Hong Kong 1960) is faithfully re-created to an impressive degree of detail. The clothes (including the beautiful dresses of Maggie Cheung), music (for example, Nat King Cole) and the general atmosphere of this film evoke a nostalgia of that specific period. Secondly, Christopher Doyle's award-winning cinematography, which is incredibly beautiful, creates an environment that not only involves its two main characters, but seems to emanate a romantic desire in each of its sumptuous and meticulous compositions. Make no mistake about it: Mood for Love was the most beautiful film of 2001. (It should also be mentioned that Wong Kar-wai's usual hyperkinetic visual style is (understandably) weakened for this movie, though his palette remains Third, there is the astounding score of Michael Galasso, who is accompanied by slow-motion sequences of, for example, Chan walking in his elegant dresses, Chan and Chow "looking" at each other as they pass each other on the stairs, and the other beautiful scenes that are recorded in her memory.The main score - which makes her instruments sound as if they were literally crying - is heard eight times throughout various points of the film and serves to highlight the sadness and the desire that the two characters Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung both perform terrific performances (Leung won the best actor award at Cannes) and they manage to generate real chemistry on screen. The above elements come together and work so well together to create a movie that feels timeless, "dizzyingly romantic" and, in a word, magical. In Mood for Love, perhaps more than any other 2001 movie, I remembered why I love "going to the movies." And I think it's about the biggest compliment I can afford for a movie. <br /> <br />
