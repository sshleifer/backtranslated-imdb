Slick, neat and well-done old school version of how a great international thriller should be done. Determined to preach a feared global terrorist who is known as "Charles the Jackal", Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, "No Limits", "Space Cowboys"), a CIA agent and his Israeli counterpart Amos (Ben Kingsley, "Gandhi "" Sexy Beast "), a noble naval officer Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn," Music of the Heart "), to become Carlos and use it in a daring plot to make the KGB kill the real Carlos because he led an offer from the CIA. Sutherland and Kingsley are good here, but the movie really belongs to Quinn here, who incarnates here (in a double role). Director Christian Duguay and director of photography David Franco provide another great asset of the film here with suspense as Hitchcockian and great visions of the world.
