Frank Sinatra has done so many great things in the entertainment world that it's hard to pinpoint how the best. If I had to name the best thing he's ever done, however, it would be his performance as Frankie Machine, the heroin addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved, just for the love of a good woman (uniquely played by babalicious Kim Novak) . The scenes of "cold turkey" between Sinatra and Novak are terrifying and touching. The film is almost perfect, in fact, from the charts of the title of Saul Bass to the innovative jazz track of Elmer Bernstein. It may not be the kind of thing someone thinks about in the '50s, but it's a must-see nonetheless.
