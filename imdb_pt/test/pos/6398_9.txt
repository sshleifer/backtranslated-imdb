"MY WIFE AND CHILDREN", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I have not seen all the episodes but I still liked it. There are many episodes that I liked. One of them was where Junior (George O. Gore II) got his driver's license. If you want to know why, you will have to have seen it for yourself. Before finishing, I would like to say that everyone always performed well, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend that you take it just in case it exits the air forever.
