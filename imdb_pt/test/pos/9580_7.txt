... the opportunity it gave me to look at Ireland's past was invaluable. <br /> <br /> I had the benefit of seeing this with my mother who came from Cork, and as we watched, we talked and learned a lot of how things were back then. Things like Deasy and Co. were a Cork Soda Company; how the rain really could destroy a crop; as farmers used to have to collect the crop; as in the dance halls women and men really had to stand by the opposing walls before the men walked forward and asked the woman to dance; on the bellows that kept the fire burning; how the priests actually called the church donor list and their donations and a little about the coin at the time (which my father helped by showing me a case showing the pence, shillings, and crowns that were used at that time legal in England too)). <br /> <br /> I did not pay much attention to how the movie was good, but I was grateful to have the opportunity to look back on a period of time that for some is Irish History, but for others including some of our parents and grandparents, it's just their childhood.
