I watched this movie for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before ... <br /> <br /> There are over a dozen stunning modern French films, from the last generation to the last three colors. trilogy and they are all special. This movie is one of them. A real treat with so many good things, from the homage to Hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in Romane and Monica. While Monica is very pretty, Romane is a very sexy woman and steals many of the scenes she inhabits. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why people think this movie is complicated because the scenes are a perfect blend of the past. and present, acting as a counterpoint to the remarkable journey of the characters, that the film simply flows and you barely realize that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left the film enchanted and bewitched. Like most French and European films, this story would never translate across the Atlantic, since no studio could capture the magic without strangling life with the Hollywood whitening common to most of the films lost in the translation . Americans make brilliant films, but not that kind ... maybe if they let someone like a young Polanski work on it, then maybe they would not totally kill an English version ... <br /> <br /> For those who do Do not watch subtitled movies you will spend your entire life in an ignorant happiness. For those of you who know how to read, you would be amused by the lack of movies like this ... <br /> <br /> I would describe this as Neo-Franco-Noir, but only to the critics who called this film elitist . . I think I saw him making an addition of four and twenty pies. He thinks Romane Bohringer is a type of French mayonnaise ... It's artistic in the way that Pulp Fiction is artistic ... but with savoire faire gaulish ... <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 with each see ... and someone has Romane's phone number ... she's the perfect French salad ...
