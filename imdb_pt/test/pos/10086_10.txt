"Tale of Two Sisters" has to be one of the scariest movies I've seen recently. In the end, there is no real supernatural element, despite what is expected to be expected throughout the film. The story seems to be about two sisters who, upon returning to their father's home after some kind of absence (later revealed as a mental institution), are forced to deal not only with a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bipolar picture. stepmother who attacks the youngest of the girls when the mood strikes her and says cheerfully that she prepared a special dinner at another time but with some presence still unexplained. Later it is revealed that the younger sister is dead and only exists in the troubled minds of her elder sister who could not save her, and her stepmother, who was insensitive enough to let her die. A lot about the strange family details is not revealed in the movie, but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and an uncomfortable suggestion of confusion. Definitely not the light of visualization; watch this when you really want to think about what you've seen. It's an infernal puzzler.
