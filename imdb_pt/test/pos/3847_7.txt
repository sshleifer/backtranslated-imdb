Walt Disney's 20th cartoon was the last to be fed back by the great man (he died in late 1966) and is generally not considered one of the best works. The main problem is that, apparently, the film seems to be the feline version of LADY AND THE TRAMP (1955) or 101 DALMATIONS (1961), both certainly more adored by the fans. and cat lover, I dug this reasonably lively mix in which a spoiled cat (dubbed by Eva Gabor) and her three kittens are thrown on the streets of Paris by the greedy steward of a wealthy lady (Hermione Baddeley). Fortunately, they meet a street cat (Phil Harris) who guides them on the journey back and is aided along the way by a feline jazz band (led by Scatman Crothers) and by two friendly and friendly dogs; Meanwhile, at home, Edgar the butler celebrates his supposed inheritance, and the mouse and the horse do their part to help their feline pet companions. Legendary presenter Maurice Chevalier was pulled out of retirement to sing the title song (which includes a French verse) and Scatman's band delights in a cheerful number, "Evrybody Wants To Be A Cat."
