Based on the best-selling novel "The Dismissal," The Missing Star, the latest film by acclaimed Italian director Gianni Amelio, is the story of the growing friendship between an older Italian maintenance man and a young performer he hires in Shanghai for be your guide by China. Vincenzo Buonovolonta is the Maintenance Manager of a steel mill in Italy that was closed and the blast furnace was sold to China. When Vincenzo (Sergio Castellitto) discovers that a control unit in the furnace is defective and potentially dangerous, he travels to China to find the steelworks where the piece was sold in hopes of avoiding a fatal accident. <br /> <br /> The film, of course, is about the journey rather than the destination to use a familiar clich√©, and on this journey we are privy to an engaging look in China with all its immense beauty and complexity, through of the great cinematography of Luca Bigazzi. The film takes us to Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongquing, Baotou and a trip along the Yangstze River showing the coastal areas that will be flooded when the Three Gorges Dam is fully operational, a Chinese megaproject that resulted in the displacement of 1.2 million of people. Travel takes travelers face to face with poverty, overcrowding of homes and children left to fend for themselves. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the relationship between Vincenzo and the translator Liu Hua (Tai Ling) who are known for the first time. Italy, where her impatience with her translations at a dinner party makes her lose her job. When he locates her in Shanghai, she works in a library and is resistant to Vincenzo's approach. Looking at her offer to help him on his travels in China as little more than a well-paying job, she reluctantly agrees to accompany him. Their relationship, however, grows as they move from city to city, their interpretive skills are in evidence to help the bewildered Vincenzo who does not own a cell phone. <br /> <br /> As they slowly open up, they expose each other's vulnerability and the film plunges into their past and present life and how they got into the current situation. We found Liu's son (Lin Wang) at his grandmother's house. In China's only children policy, he is one of the unwanted children who have been "hidden" since the boy's father left the family. Although the encounter between Vincenzo and the boy is casual, their relationship becomes central to the way history unfolds. Castellitto is an excellent actor (despite a desire by a young Enrico Lo Verse in that role). However, he is emotionally distant throughout the film, his expression rarely changing from a distant expression. Although Tai Ling brought a great presence to the role, his relationship with the much older Vincenzo never seemed real to me and the end seemed to exist only in a reality known as cinema. Although Amelio is one of my favorite directors, following the brilliant Keys to the House, Missing Star is a disappointment.
