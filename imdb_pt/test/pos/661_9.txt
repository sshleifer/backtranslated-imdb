Cheezy? Yes. Poorly filmed? You bet. Budget Zero? They proudly claim this in their posters. Brilliant anyway (or because of that)? For sure. <br /> <br /> This movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the teenage horror genre of the 80s: Characters with absolutely no depth, fitting into a stereotyped role that never escape for a moment ; teenagers trying to survive a murder by some mysterious force that disturbed doing something woefully adolescent; completely free nudity; impossible quantities of blood leaving the victims; slow zombies; great one-liners ... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket! This is not a complete parody like Scary Movie but more a tribute to the lost innocence of the horror films of the 80's ... when being scared and angry can also be fun, silly, sexy and goofy good time!
