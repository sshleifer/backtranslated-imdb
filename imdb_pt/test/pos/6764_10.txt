This is undoubtedly one of the funniest and funniest movies I have ever seen. I really liked the characters in the movie. They are all wonderful and bizarre in themselves. It's something I've never seen before in any movie. <br /> <br /> The story is almost uninterrupted from beginning to end. There are no boring moments. I was totally captured by the movie. And I thought the performance was great. <br /> <br /> So if you want to see a funny movie. You should look for The Green Butchers. A great movie. <br /> I give 10/10
