The premise of the story is quite common; middle family wants to get out of the rat race; wants to find the simple life ... then they move from Sherman Oaks, California to Lake Tomahawk; children in tow. <br /> <br /> The lake is beautiful, they rented an old house .... but wait; there may be something on the lake; people are being murdered, and no one knows how (no matter what). Gerald McRaney is excellent, a face familiar to Lifetime viewers; Valerie Harper is also good; since this movie was made in '88, maybe the writer should produce a sequel. <br /> <br /> You'll also enjoy Barry Corbin as the eccentric of the city, and Darryl Anderson as a deranged militaryman of Bruce Dern. <br /> <br /> While the plot of the story is a bit exaggerated; If you're a movie fan, you'll be reminded of similar "" "Psycho" "scenarios; ""Release""; as well as other horror stories of this genre. Multiple camera shots and sequences will give you a déjà vu feel. <br /> <br /> Sit down and enjoy yourself; if you do not take it too seriously, it's a lot of fun; and better than, for example, the most recent film: "I know what you did last summer"; it seems they made better movies in the good old 80's!
