I saw some of Mr. Boorman's films and did not like them very much. Not that they are bad movies, quite the contrary are good movies, but not content that I personally found amusing. However, I think that Where the Heart Is, despite being made to cater to the less savvy public of American art, is masterful as satire and as social commentary from the times when it was made. I had to replace this movie in my collection at least half a dozen times, since every time I lend it to someone I know I could appreciate their art on all levels, my copy fails to come home to me, lol . The last time it took 7 years to replace it, since it was sold out for VHS, it was never made as a DVD I know of, and I had to wait until one of the cable channels worked before I could record it, My favorite aspect after the social comment of the nail on the head are the paintings of Timna Woollard. I've been looking for 15 years to find someone or anywhere that could take me to where her work is available for sale. Or better yet, a copy of the movie's paintings without the final credits rolling over them. I have a room in my house that I dedicated to putting copies of his paintings, and no one seems to know if it was ever released as a coffee table book, or video aquarium, or as a documentary of his work. If anyone knows where I can get any kind of copy of Timna's work or where his studio is in England, please do not hesitate to contact me by email.
