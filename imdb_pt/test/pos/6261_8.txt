This is a cute, funny and lively movie. It's even better than the "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" - which is parallel, but does not reproduce. The story completes a full circle and leaves the theater radiant as the credits rolled. One hundred years after this story, we were so intrigued by the flashing images in a dark theater.
