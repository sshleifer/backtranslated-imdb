This film is about reality, the submarine war in WWII was not a precise and clean science. There were no computers giving exact details of the enemy, there was no precise instrumentation to 100% control the sub. Not all the staff went out to fight with a song in their heart, and a smile on the display. People with expectations of seeing a "beautiful war" in this movie will be very disappointed, ... ........... GOOD, they deserve to be disappointed, they deserve to have reality pushed into your face. <br /> <br /> The war is not clean, exact, fought by people about to break into music. He is endured by frightened, cold / burned, hungry and desperate people willing to do anything to survive. <br /> <br /> "We Dive At Dawn" is a great example of a desperate situation that requires desperate action.
