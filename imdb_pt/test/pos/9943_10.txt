Although many have mixed feelings about this latest Argento thriller, it still stands as another prodigal testament to Argento's cinematic brilliance. <br /> <br /> A young opera singer has her first out-of-school performance and suddenly finds herself obsessed by a crazed maniac. <br /> <br /> In a way, the Opera is like a modern giallo on the Phantom of the Opera mixed with all the glorious style and color that would be expected of Dario Argento. deliver. Argento makes incredible use of inventive camera techniques, recurring symbols (like those ravens!), Gothic atmosphere and truly horrifying sequences of murders. A scene, especially (involving a magical eye and a weapon), will bring down viewers from their places! In terms of history, the film also shakes itself with a strong suspense and provides an excellent atmosphere for the magnificent soundtrack of Claudio Simonetti. <br /> <br /> The cast does some satisfying performances. Cristina Marsillach is good as our protagonist. The late Ian Charleson does a good turn as a director, as does Urbano Barberini as a researcher, Daria Nicolodi as Marsillach's agent and William McNamara as Marsillach's unhappy lover. <br /> <br /> Opera is the last day of Argento, and perhaps the last of his great works. It's sure to please your fans and even create some new ones. **** of ****
