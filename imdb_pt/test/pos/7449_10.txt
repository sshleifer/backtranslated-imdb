What is there to say about this movie? This movie is simply beautiful. A feast for the eyes. Just as the game set the standard for 3D RPG games 7 years ago, this movie sets the standard for future CG movies. Many of you have seen the trailers and the incredible details in every frame and let me say that this movie does not disappoint. You can actually see the fibers in the Cloud sweatshirt. <br /> <br /> The music is also very good. The film contains several rearranged video game tracks that fans will definitely recognize and appreciate. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the film is its history. Not exactly a bad story, but this story is exclusively geared toward people who have played video games. First time viewers may sometimes feel lost, or may not realize the meaning of certain events. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone, even if you've never played the game because what we have here is a special movie. Watch and enjoy the beautiful spectacle.
