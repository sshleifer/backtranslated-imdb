While watching a modern worldly movie (The Runaway Bride) with my granddaughter (22 years old), she asked me, "Since you've been watching movies since 1938, what's the biggest movie of your life?" Boy! What a choice! It took me all summer of thinking and relooking a few moves before making my decision. IT'S "THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES". This movie has no flaws. It's a film in which each of the side characters part and dialogue is essential for the whole story. There is not a single part in the movie that can be left out. The young woman's attachment to her brothers lacking hands, the man returning home to young adults who grew up without him and with different ideas, the portrait of a young man whose only responsibility was as a squeeze push that became the leader of a group of men, and was awarded medals for his action. A woman who now needs to adjust to the husband who has life is far from her for years. The perception of the people who were in security guaranteed the abodes of the sacrifices that these ordinary men did in their favor. The look at the life of loving and living with a man without hands. Parents first look and react to their son's new deformities. A man used to make a life-and-death decision in an instant, having to return to the way he crawled through the loan structure of a conservative bank. This is not nice, tearing tears, strumming the heart. THIS WAS REAL LIFE! It could not have been portrayed differently. That, my friends, is how it was !! This could easily be considered a documentary. On this colorful movie day, please do not be turned off by black and white as it is one of the best B & W, editing and directing footage you will ever see. The cast was perfect. If I could, I would make it compulsory for anyone with history, cinema, creative writing, sociology, family counsel or psychology to see and report on this magnificent example of the art of filmmakers.
