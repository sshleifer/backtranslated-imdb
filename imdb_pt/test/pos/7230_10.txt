TROOP & JULIET - 10th ANNIVERSARY EDITION William Shakespeare's play Romeo & Juliet has been played hundreds of times on stage and in films. Sometimes literally following the original text (which is sometimes vague in the directions of the stage), sometimes in new interpretations, where the directors have chosen to show their own opinion on the piece. Some are good, many are mediocre. Lloyd Kaufman's film certainly stands out as one of the most original and modern versions of the bard's creation. It can be put into a decadent New York these days and replete with modern anti-social behavior, body piercing, breakup and eccentric. the sex (which, for the reader more than casual, Shakespeare himself was not avoiding), but at the same time remains incredibly close to the general feel and point of view of the play, which is a great effort. Kaufman wrote the screenplay with his co-director in the film James Gunn, who is now famous for writing two best-selling Scooby Doo movies, doing the impossible making a perfect remake of an already perfect movie with his Dawn of the Dead script and directing one of the best horror movies of the year: Slither. The groundbreaking vision of Lloyd Kaufmans 'direction, coupled with James Gunns' original and unrestrained writing, renders an interpretation of Shakespeare's play that perhaps not all will "get" immediately, but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique and highly important vision of a classic piece. With a script written entirely in the iambic meter, Lemmy's appearances of Motorhead and a forced and outrageous soundtrack watching Tromeo & Juliet are something no one will ever forget. In addition to its historical significance, Tromeo & Juliet is a treasure trove for movie lovers of all kinds. Not only for the screenplay of James Gunn, now a good influence on Hollywood while working from the inside, but also because it features an early part of the legendary actress Debbie Rochon. Well known to everyone familiar with movies that are made at lower budgets. The DVD's 10th anniversary edition adds to all this by including so many undiscovered gems that not only all the information one could desire about the movie itself, but also the experience of doing so is presented in ways that make it impossible to deactivate the movie. DVD, but also a very honest (and upsetting) appearance is given to the ways in which independent filmmaking has to survive these days. In many ways, the disc's extras are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given at Kaufman's film school, "Make Your Own Damn Movie." Furtermore's historical items from Troma's vaults, which include James Gunn, Debbie Rochon and all the other contributors to this masterpiece are included, and the film itself is in addition to looking better than ever accompanied by no less than four audio-commentaries , each and every informative, incredibly funny and all done for serious addition to the movie instead of the annoying and tasteless comments that are so common these days. There are new comments (one with Kaufman and Gunn together) but also what James Gunn did for the original DVD release, but that could not be included because of the honesty he demonstrates about other people present on this record. With re-imagining fans of some of the scenes from the film, a video diary of Lloyd Kaufman's visit to James Gunn's set in Slither and a visit to the two gathered at Eli Roth's birthday party and more, this is the best set all must own. Time you are a film historian, someone interested in interpretations of the work of the great Bard, a big movie fan, an independent film fighter, a fan of James Gunn, interested in learning more about making movies on a low budget, a fan by Lloyd Kaufman or anything else: this is the most important DVD-release of this millennium!
