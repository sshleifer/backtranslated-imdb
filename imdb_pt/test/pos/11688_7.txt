If you like this film, be sure to check out others directed by Hrebejk - you're ready for a treat. Unfortunately, this is not at its best, but still millions of times better than an average movie from conventional cinema. Explore relationships, especially abusive ones, has some powerful and sweet moments and great acting. Some inconsistencies, cliches, and empty moments spoil the overall effect. For the previous reviewer and his comments on the Czech psyche: an interesting approach, but I do not see this film becoming a Czech blockbuster. These people are badly spoiled by their filmmakers (check out Sverak's stuff too, Gedeon) and it's a little behind.
