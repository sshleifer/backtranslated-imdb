The songs are fantastic and the story is good. Like many other acting schools, mine has also produced HAIR. For most hair productions it is a golden opportunity to do nude but my production has been fully dressed ... I do not think full frontal nudity in a film or piece guarantees artistic quality ... And the creators of the film too . The film version is great, with classic successes following each other, letting the storyline evolve into the chilling climax. A great cast of actors, dancers and singers.
