I have wanted to see this since my French teacher recommended me more than forty years ago. Perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the restoration of the Criterion Collection DVD is impressive. <br /> <br /> In his summary, this film follows the time-worn script: a quartet of men carefully conspires a difficult theft from a bank vault. , the assault occurs, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the final death of all. Even if the footage of the assault is transfixed, it occurs early and is not in the center of the film. This film separates itself from the typical movie of assault, giving us insights on the personalities of the characters and their motivations - their plays, as much as a drama, as does a thriller. Relationships play an important role and a kidnapping is preached, giving us two movies for the price of one. <br /> <br /> John Servais plays the man of ideas Tony le Stéphanois (always referred to as "le Stéphanois") with such weariness of the world that he might have just come out of a Camus novel. Tony has just come out of prison and refuses to re-enter the life of the crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his ex-lover (who became involved with another man), where, as a punishment, he physically lashes her with a belt. . Luckily this scene happens off camera, but you probably will not forget it. After this sobering event, as there seems to be little hope of reviving this relationship, Tony meets two of his former partners in crime, Jo and Mario, and decides to join them in one last big robbery. They enlist the services of Cesar, a secure Italian cracker - played by director Dassin himself - and we're out of the assault. <br /> <br /> The assault ends without problems. But the tendency of Caesar's womanizing is a personality trait that ends up being fatal for all involved. However, we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he fell in love with, since there is a brilliant play in which she plays a sexy and cinematic-inspired nightclub act - it has to be one of the most memorable scenes of any movie noir <br /> <br /> It is established from an early age that Tony has a close relationship with Jo and his family; in fact, the son of Jo refers to him as uncle. I think it's partly to help Jo's family that Tony agrees to the robbery. The final scenes, where Tony saves the life of Jo's kidnapped son, partially redeems his most brutal and amoral deeds. But only partially.
