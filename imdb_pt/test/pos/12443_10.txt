From the golden age of British films, this is my vote for one of the funniest of all time. Shown yesterday at my Film Society for a sweeping audience, I was amazed at how the comedy went (made in 1950!). It's really a matter of time and inimitable performance from two of the best actors that Britain has produced: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. Adapted from a play by John Dighton, this farce is quickly manipulated by director Frank Launder. The plot is simple: a mistake of the ministry makes a school for girls in a school for boys. I'll always laugh when I think of this movie.
