How many movies are there when you see a movie like that? I can not tell them, but it sure looked like the filmmakers were trying to give me a hint. I was often reminded of other movies, it became a great distraction. One of the memorable lines borrowed came from a 2003 film - Day After Tomorrow. One line by itself is not all that bad, but this movie borrows heavily from so many movies that it becomes a bad risk. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie! Despite his falls, there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make him look smart. While lending a lot of other movies, he never exaggerates. In fact, you're probably going to find yourself lowering the hatches and pulling away the storm. Because? ... Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I was never a Kutcher fan and almost gave up on The Guardian, but he came out willingly. Costner carries the movie to the best of Costner's ability. I do not think Mrs. Robinson has anything to do with her success. <br /> <br /> The support cast everywhere played its part well. I had no problem with any of them in the end. But some of these characters were overused. <br /> <br /> From now on I can only pick up nit-pick, so I'll spare you from the wear and tear. Enjoy the movie, the parts that work, work well enough to keep your head above water. Just do not expect a good ride. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, but almost a 6.
