I have a little hobby of finding really cool photos out there that are quite unfamiliar - and then letting people know about them. This is at the top of my list for release this summer. This indie film (and I really mean indie - not Miramax, Indie's Fox Searchlight) can be easy to forget in the great maze of celluloid, but if you want something completely different - you have to check this one out. <br /> <br /> Basically, I thought it was great. I should have known from the DVD cover, front and back, that this would be something totally different, but, EVERYONE says their stuff is different to call you. Well, this really is totally different. It's in your face: beautiful and scary and unashamed of telling you to wake up. War, peace, September 11, poetry, even a mysterious type of music video set in an old "patriotic" music and a strange guy in a trailer. Need I say more? Just look at this.
