This little film brings back many memories, both in bad taste and lack, of what can and does happen when you are an active musician. The accommodations not so pleasant to the band, the management of the place jumping up and down telling you what to play, the sheer ecstasy of applause .............. Far from being ridiculous, it's actually very accurate in the way it portrays musicians, professionals or not, who have traveled a great distance to hold a season of shows in one location. There are those times when everything runs perfectly, there are those other times when you immediately begin to miss your partner and wonder what the hell you are doing so far from home. In the end, you have to do your best because there is no other way out.
