I read the last comment made on this film and I have to disagree absolutely and totally. <br /> <br /> See, I am of Portuguese nationality and even though this movie may say little to someone coming from Boston, it certainly says something to Portuguese and Brazilians, as well as immigrants everywhere. <br /> <br /> And why, you may wonder? Well, first of all, this movie deals with two sister nations: Portugal and Brazil. Brazil gained its independence in the early nineteenth century (by the heir of the Portuguese throne) and since then relations have improved greatly. <br /> <br /> However significant this may be, there is still a lot of prejudice. Because of the economic climate in Brazil during the 1990s, immigration to Portugal has grown massively. Veja, Portugal is not only a country that shares a language, culture and beliefs similar to Brazil, but it is also a gateway to the rest of Europe. Some people were thus forced to make the decision to cross the Atlantic and seek a better life and Portugal was the first logical place to try to immigrate. <br /> <br /> As with many immigrants, they received averages below the minimum wage and were treated as "dirt" - except that in that case, because the language is similar, they were constantly being made aware. <br /> <br /> Another curious thing about this film is the idea it conveys about how a man so knowledgeable in his own country's history was still trying to make a quick buck by exporting coveted national resources. . They are exactly the same people who keep Brazil in a constant state of development, since the country is well endowed with natural resources and could easily climb the economic ladder if given a fair opportunity. <br /> <br /> In a sense, this shows how colonialism still exists - Pablo representing the exploited people, Igor the man whose status of "noble" (or at least rich or "good") is assured by colonialist power foreigner who is represented by Kraft. <br /> <br /> If you have seen other Salles films, you will recognize this as a recurring topic - the struggle against oppressive power. I do not intend to teach or be condescending to teach history to anyone, but I found that this film was, symbolically speaking, very powerful. I'm not saying there's no room for improvement (as there ever is), but I think the last comment written on this was not just narrow minded, but ignorant hands down. <br /> <br /> One last thing to be said about this, I have to assume that you watched this movie with the eyes of an "American movie watcher". No harm intended by this comment, but I mean, "foreign" movies can not all be about "beautiful landscapes" - art deals with the problems of its time. You would not expect Otto Dix, for example, to paint all the lovely places in Bayern and the Black Forest ... Why should you expect a filmmaker to focus exclusively on the stage when he feels there are more relevant issues to be addressed? <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, do not judge movies lightly and with only two or three criteria in scope. This film is very interesting, his photography is very good and even the idea that the colorful black and white transmits goes hand in hand with what he deals with. I believe the image is purposely grainy ... as a reality, no? :) <br /> <br /> Watch and come to your own conclusions ...
