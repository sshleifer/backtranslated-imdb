It was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie. The director kept his focus on the main subject without venturing into secondary plots (the doctor's family or stories of other hospital patients) that are so typical of Bollywood assembly line products. He kept the narrative simple to understand and ensured that all actors were faithful to the characters they were supposed to portray. The grandfather's rustic manners in the clinic, the surgeon's cold, unemotional behavior, and the caretaker's zeal gave the film a sense of genuineness. I am also happy that the director has not been tempted to add music or special effects and reduce it to the level of Anand or Safar. Some scenes at the end of the movie, like the kid visiting other blind children and the workplace of a blind worker, and also the final scene in which the boy claps to the sound of splashes and chirping of the birds, surely leave his eyes misty . Many Bollywood players do not realize that members of the Oscar commission value the simplicity of the subject and the genuineness and brevity of the film more than glitz and glamor. Shwaas is certainly a better nomination than Lagaan, who dealt with a subject that was already beaten to death. No MPAA member is willing to suffer with 4 hours of drama and lots of music and dance. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing more director Sandeep Sawant's films in the future.
