Amazing, amazing, brilliant, excellent. These are the four adjectives that pop into my head as I begin to describe "The Kite Runner." The adaptation of Khaled Hosseini's book had already captured many minds; in fact, there are rumors that he himself burst into tears after watching the premier. I must say, before I even begin, that I read the book before seeing the advanced display of "The Kite Runner". So my judgment and opinions may be slightly biased. <br /> <br /> First, let me say, that even though in my opinion the book was better than the final product of the film, it is by no means a bad adaptation. I mean, for a two-hour movie you got the right answer. Things seemed a little quick in the last twenty minutes, but in addition, the book was successful. It has captured the minds and imaginations of millions around the world. The magic woven by Khaled Hosseini, to give us a sense of remorse of joy, sorrow, pain, and loyalty is perceptive in this adaptation. Especially in the first scene, when the young Hassan says, "If you tell me to eat dirt, I will. But I know you will not ask me." Such a touching line is destined to capture the hearts of many. The two young actors were brilliant, absolutely superb. Especially the boy who played the innocent but loyal Hassan, a boy who refuses to give up a kite he picked up because he promised his best friend that he would bring it to him only to be abused by big bullies who beat him and used him sexually, and then be rebuked by your best friend as a coward. The whole act is so touching that you can not help wetting your eyes. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is well placed except the last bit. The point at which Amir learns of his true relationship with Hassan and reads Hassan's first and last for him, when he falls into tears feeling helpless, lonely and with remorse, seemed a little rushed and felt that Amir was by behind a facade. In the book, Khaled Hosseini devoted about 10 to 12 pages to describe Amir's state of mind in that position. But this was rewarded in the penultimate segment of the film, when Amir defends Hassan's son, his nephew Sohrab, in front of his father-in-law commander. The end was well deserved and I'm sure it will be well appreciated. He felt the torch pass from one generation to another. <br /> <br /> Coming to the technical aspects. First of all, the acting. Just one word - Excellent. From beginning to end, the young Hassan and Amir, his father, his friend Rahim Khan. Everyone has been superb, especially the young Hassan. Secondly, the direction was amazing along with some brilliant camera work. The background score was also impressive. From the initial credit, to the final credit, and I especially loved the one in which Amir is in the mosque in Pakistan, the Western and Islamic merger, which made this extra special. <br /> <br /> definitely one of the best movies, and it's a welcome break from all those Iran-inspired movies that we've been floating throughout this year. 9/10 !!!
