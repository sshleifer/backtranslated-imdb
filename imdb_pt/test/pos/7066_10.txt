"Meatballs" is an ode to summer camp. Those of us who went to camp saw many of the scenes as we remember or wished they could have been. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray plays the senior boys advisor Tripper Harrison, who actually runs the camp. It reminds us of the funny legal staff member that everyone loves. Young campers gravitate toward you, and if he talks to you, you feel like you're family. This is one of Murray's best roles. He directs the film with his liners and ad-libs. <br /> <br /> Chris Makepeace plays Rudy, the lonely camper who is taken under the wing of Tripper and breaks his shell. <br /> <br /> The rest of the campers and film crew were also excellent. <br /> <br /> The overall theme of the film is the underdog overcome obstacles to finally win. From Rudy to Spaz to Camp and even to Tripper, the oppressed in the movie are the stars. The movie has a heart. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun and funny without being cruel or supersexual as some teen movies are today. The cast looks and acts like real people. <br /> <br /> Comedy and heart draw you to the point where, in the end, just like in the camp, you are sad to leave. <br /> <br /> In my summer camp experience, we had underwear with flagpole masts, mysterious flesh, trying to peek into the girls' hut, the lunatic stories with the hook around the campfire, and pulling people sleeping in their booths and putting them somewhere else. But we also had a dedicated camping crew that guides us to be the best we could be. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is CIT at night when they are canoing by the lake that sings a goofy song. The only line that shocks me every time is when Tripper is announcing light exits the night before Father's Day and he finishes "Tomorrow is Father's Day, and you should look rested or Morty will be sent to the state penitentiary."
