I am an avid fan of Julie Andrews and I first watched DVD - the Director's Cut version. I was very surprised by the fact that I was rated G. How did they get room scenes, a seduction story line, two striptease and war / shoot / blood acts on a G rating? Weird. I would rate the PG-13. <br /> <br /> Other than that I liked the movie. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The performance was great. The plot was a little weak, leaving gaps that could have been filled with a good dialogue. There were lots of "not talking, just walking" scenes for me ... I would have liked to see the relationship between Julie and Rock blossom, so intense love was more believable.
