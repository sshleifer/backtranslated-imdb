I just watched the Hallmark channel. I was surprised by John Denver! This movie was full of clichés, but this is to be expected (one made for the Christmas TV movie - come on!). The acting is as good as any of the 80's made for the TV movie. The story is, as I said before, predictable and cliché, but it's still good. If you are looking for an extravagant Christmas movie, it will surely scratch your itching. <br /> <br /> I was also pleased when I heard what happened in Georgetown, Colorado. It is a real mountain town west of Denver. Pretty cool as this is my home region. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of John Denver (I always thought he was very foney), but he was a decent actor. He is very good as the good old man as he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to watch it, then do it. I'm sure it will be back again in 2007.
