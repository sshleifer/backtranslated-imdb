She's the man was the funniest movie I've ever seen. I laughed so hard I was crying. It was also very romantic. Channing Tatum is absolutely beautiful and can really act. It sure does not hurt that he has some shirtless scenes as well. Channing and Amanda have incredible chemistry and were absolutely wonderful together. I love this movie. When you watch, make sure you watch the last scene deleted. It was a big mistake to cut this scene because it's one of the best scenes in the movie. I recommend this movie. Amanda was never more funny. And Channing is going to be a big star. This is just the first of many for this brilliant new star.
