The film with its unique set, minimal cast and direct photography (except for a few brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60-minute theatrical dramas so popular during the early years of TV. However, the suspense hangs over the poor war widow Ida Lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic do-it-yourself Robert Ryan before one of her humor swings to mate. And who better to play the troublesome part than the great actor Ryan. He was not very versatile - watching him rehearsal comedy is almost painful. But no one was better at hurt idealism (In Dangerous Ground) or the psychic pain of this film. Few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and imposing figure. <br /> <br /> Lupine's problem is that she's locked in her house with a gentle and gentle man at one time and furious at the next. The suspense comes from his various tricks to keep him happy while trying to escape. It's a nail-biter all the way. This is not one of Lupino's many "soulful" parts where she was so good. Instead, it's a role that many smaller actresses could have handled well enough. My favorite scene is with Ryan and the spoiled teenager Margaret Whiting. Ryan is already having difficulties with his manhood and what others are saying about him. Then, when Whiting comes in and finds Ryan-looking attractive rubbing the ground, she starts to get shy, flirting with her nascent sexuality. Sensing the problem, Ryan abruptly defends her - subtlety is not his forte. Outraged, Whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work "female labor". That does it. Until then, he was courteous and professional with Lupino, trying to get in a normal way. But Whiting hit his raw nerve. Now there is no way to pay when Whiting goes out the door, leaving Lupino to pay the price. It's a fascinating, cleverly done scene. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is one of the dozens of films produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when the public was moving away from these little blacks and whites. favor of broad-screen shows. What a pity. What an extremely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front. She deserves at least an honorary Oscar from a film industry to which she has contributed much.
