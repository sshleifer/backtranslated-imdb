As a Canadian, I did not know much about Whitlam's dismissal. I had read the Wikipedia page about these events, but it was about that. Earlier this year, when Canada went through a potential constitutional crisis (which failed, thankfully) that might have led to the intervention of our governor-general, Whitlam's resignation was mentioned in the press. In an effort to learn more, I ordered the DVD of this mini-series through eBay. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed with how interesting the bill was. As dramatic as the events were, this could have been a very annoying political drama. However, it was a very suspenseful miniseries. I was also impressed by how comprehensible it was, despite my lack of familiarity with Australian politics. It did not take long to find out who everyone was and what their roles were. <br /> <br /> That said, it is not a wholly impartial tale. Malcolm Fraser is certainly portrayed as a Machiavellian figure, who does not let anyone get in the way of his quest to be prime minister. Gough Whitlam is portrayed in a more noble, almost holy light. However, the actor who plays Whitlam channels the nobility in such a way that it appears more like pomp. I thought Sir John Kerr was portrayed in a rather nice way. <br /> <br /> I must warn people that the DVD is of very poor quality. I understand that it was made for television in the early 80's, but it seems that no effort was made to restore image or sound quality. It was very disappointing that no extras were added. A documentary, or even some interviews with the historical figures, would have improved the experience, but there is nothing. <br /> <br /> I recommend this miniseries to anyone interested in real-life events.
