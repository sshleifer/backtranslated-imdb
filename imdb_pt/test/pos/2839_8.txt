Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative films that was released recently. It was funny, but it also had many exciting moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear and the rest of the cast made their incredibly strange characters look real. The story took such a turnaround that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, check out Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when you leave!
