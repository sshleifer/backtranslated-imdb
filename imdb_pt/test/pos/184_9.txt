I watched this movie at TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) on its memorable 1957 launch in Toronto. I told my wife, who had not seen this before, to observe the exhilarating long trail, without cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris. In a hand frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls up and cranes (unintentional pun) on the street as it gets off the bus and launches between the tanks to cross the road. So I remember that, uncut, we followed her close to the fence as she looked, eagerly looking for him but did not find him. But we continue to follow Veronika as she examines the faces of tormented recruits and their emotionally plagued women, all the extras, and each a gem of Stanislavskian fascinating behavior. As, it is imagined, Kalatozov and his videographer Urusevsky created this extraordinary sequence. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the street from the tanks, the scene abruptly ended and cut scenes back into the apartment, before continuing with the soldiers and their families on the fence. It seems to me that this movie was not only restored but also reissued. What a pity!
