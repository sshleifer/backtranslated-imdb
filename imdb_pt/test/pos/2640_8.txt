Great party movie, following the adventures of Bill and Tom, two high school friends at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life the right way, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) takes nothing seriously except partying all the time. When Bill leaves his mother's house to live alone, he faces many problems, from his girlfriend to his brother and his owner. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moves in to keep the rent down, but he spends Bill's life upside down. This film is an uninterrupted comedy from beginning to end and is one of my favorites. The soundtrack features virtuoso guitar Edward Van Halen throughout the film, plus special appearances by rockers Lee Ving and Ron Wood. 70s Legend of the porn star Kitten Navidad also makes an appearance! Classic movie from the 80's worth several looks. Now all that needs to be done is a very early DVD release! If you liked this movie, take a look at "The Last American Virgin," which is similar to "Wild Life." I rate both highly.
