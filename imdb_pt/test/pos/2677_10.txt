This show is incredible! I love each episode. Carrie is a spitfire and Doug is a kind and sometimes an idiot. Arthur, Spence, Danny, Deacon and Carrie's Boss add a nice finishing touch to the show, tying all the funny moments, pee in the pants. In one of the seasons, Doug tries to leave Carrie drunk, because she is better when she is drunk. Beautiful husband, right? Carrie is not much better, when her boss needs an IPS driver to testify in a small case at her job, Carrie hesitates because she sees Doug as a goof around and does not want him to embarrass her, so she hires Doug's friend. Wife of the year. But who I think is the funniest is shouting Arthur randomly. He is hilarious and angry. Hey, you would be too if you had to live in a basement where the mold smells strange and makes you dizzy. This show is hilarious, and if you have not seen it then you have not lived!
