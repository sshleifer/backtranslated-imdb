I really enjoyed this movie and I think most of Lauren Ambrose fans as well. His character is much softer than his role in Six Feet Under and all performances are strong. I especially liked the way Emily's role, a mentally challenged sage, was treated. Despite some other misinformed user ratings, the role was accurately and clumsily played by actress Taylor Roberts. Also a highlight was Fran Kranz, whose natural ease complemented well the season's most seasoned actors. Although the direction had hit an obstacle here or there, it seemed that the only problems were with an underdeveloped script. What might have worked well as a play did not hold up so well on the screen. However, the lovely cinematography of Paul Ryan definitely makes up for it, as does the rhythm of the movie, which is surprisingly not slow. I recommend this movie to fans of six feet below and also fans of good acting and cinematography.
