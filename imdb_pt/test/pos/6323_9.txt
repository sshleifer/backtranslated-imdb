'Sleight of Hand' is my favorite episode of Rockford Files of the entire series. This episode shows a side of Jim Rockford that is usually overlooked. Namely, Jim is genuinely in love with a beautiful woman and is shown as a paternal figure to his youngest daughter. The woman is recently divorced and she and Jim have recently returned from a weekend getaway with the young man. Through a strange twist, the woman is discovered missing after returning home. Rockford's recount for his father, Rocky, about the events that led to the disappearance of the woman is reminiscent of Mickey Spillane's Mike. Hammer series from an earlier era. After much reflection and with the encouragement of Rocky, Jim is faced with the clue that leads him to investigate the disappearance with his habitual firmness. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Jim's girlfriend, Karen, unknowingly witnessed some mafia activity while they stayed. at the Buena Vista Inn. Crime bosses responded by killing Karen and replacing another woman in Jim's car. The impostor, apparently asleep in the back seat, had her leave immediately upon arriving at the house. Following are some cover-up murders and Jim goes on to his solution while suspecting the Los Angeles police department even when arrest warrants are issued. <br /> <br /> This episode evokes more emotional reactions than all the other episodes of Rockford Files. Combined. James Garner as Jim Rockford is seen at his most vulnerable time and still retains the presence of mind to pursue the case. This is personal to Jim Rockford. In this case, he is not hired to do a job, but he is trying to reclaim his lost love to save his life. Unfortunately, this is not possible, but Jim struggles to resolve his feelings, but it is clear that he will not soon overcome his grief. <br /> <br /> Despite the main story's appeal, many key issues are created but never answered in this episode. (1) What happens to the young daughter of Jim's girlfriend? (2) What did Karen actually see in the hotel that made the Mafia kill her? (3) How could Jim drive for hours with an impostor in his back seat without realizing it? (4) The daughter said that "mama did not come back with us". So why did not the girl scream or cry when she noticed that her mother was away during the long car ride? Regardless of these ambiguities, "Sleight of Hand" is the episode of Rockford Files that comes closest to being a tear.The tear.The suspense is compelling and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style that makes us feel the pain of Rockford.
