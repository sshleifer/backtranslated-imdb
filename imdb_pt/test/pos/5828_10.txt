Yes, this show had a lot of male frontal nudity and yes, over the years the plot lines have become exaggerated, melodramatic and very unrealistic, however, it does not matter because the show is great. You really get involved with the characters and all the characters, no matter how small or large, they are perfect. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine anyone but JK Simmons playing the neo-Nazi racist leader, nor anyone else playing Tobias Beecher except Lee Tergesen. The transformation of your character from Season 1 to Season 2 is incredible. However, the character MADE Oz Oz was CHRIS KELLER (played by Christopher Meloni). He had no relations with anyone else in jail except Beecher (well, except Ronnie Barlog, but that was only to make Ronnie stop playing with Keller's lover, Beecher). Their relationship transcended the sexes and Tom Fontana really made us care about these two and wants them to stay together. <br /> <br /> I loved Vern's weakness for his kids at the show and how Fontana made everyone's characters enjoyable. these heinous criminals we've grown to love, even Simon Adebesi. <br /> <br /> However, some plot lines were totally unbelievable and unrealistic: * A guy building a bomb on oz * Guys standing in a spotlight in their windows watching other men planning something on their mind - also above the top. Receiving drugs in oz * Everyone in the rehab group used or sold drugs and Sister Pete never helped anyone in six years. * People being killed in the gym, in the supply closet, and in the kitchen. * Nobody hurting Ryan's mother * No one fighting Cyril out of the boxing ring (except Vern, of course) * Two detainees with tools being left alone in the elevator shaft and one dying without investigation. * Karl Metzger (guard) is killed and no one investigates. * Governor holds all his press conferences in prison * All a detainee needs to do is say "I want to see Glenn" or "I want to see mcmanus" and they are taken to them without questions. * People die every week in Oz * On the outside, people kill someone and earn 20 years, on parole in eight, but if someone is killed inside, they go to the death row almost immediately * There are no paid staff on site kitchen, or the mail room - inmates run the two departments without asking questions * Aging drugs for inmates to replace with on-call time * Ryan has no friends or associates but never gets hurt, kills, raped or beaten. * Guys NEVER clean bathrooms when they go to the bathroom or vomit. * An NBA batter arrives in jail to recruit for an NBA player (yeah right). However, with all these flaws, this show is still amazing. It's horrible, brutal, sexy, edgy, raw and innovative. Dean Winters, Scott William Winters, JK Simmons, Christopher Meloni, Luiz Guzman, Adele (the guy who played Simon Adebisi), Eammon Walker, Lee Tergesen, Terry Kinney, mUms, Alexander Male, LL Cool J, etc, etc. Everyone is awesome and made the show worth watching. <br /> <br /> I recommend renting this on DVD. The sixth season leaves on June 9th (next month). The first five seasons are on DVD - watch them and watch them again with audio commentary. I loved the director's commentary with Chazz Palmentari. The sequence with Andy Schillinger running through the diner tables and then falling into the hole was an amazing, top-notch shot !!!! Congratulations! And Kathy Bates directing Family Business and the famous fight scene between Beecher and Keller - just incredible! Bright!!! This would have to be so strange for Meloni to play the private part of Tergesen in front of an icon like Kathy Bates in that scene! Wow!! You pulled it beautifully, pun intended! <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Oz: The Next Generation !!!! (as with Star Trek, etc.) C'Mon !!! Let's start!!!!
