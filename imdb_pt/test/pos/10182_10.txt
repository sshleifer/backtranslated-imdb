I was dragged into this series as sure as the sea would take me. Although it started slowly, I discovered that the realism in representing the ship, the variety of characters and the living dialogue keep me watching. The protagonist was destined to be challenged, grow and change on this trip and I wanted to be there for that. I was not dissapointed. The series took you from humor to tragedy and everything else, often in the same scene, the same breath. There was an abundance of emotional overlap, interaction and expression - relentless and compelling to watch. The ship's movement added an almost fanciful component to the many scenes, leaving the characters sick at one point and adding humor to the next. <br /> <br /> Edmund Talbot is a complex character, the kind we do not. see often. We can know where the captain or mr. Prettiman, but they are older men, established in their ways. Talbot was young and arrogant, still learning, testing himself, and being tested. He struggled to get along with others and made mistakes like a real person, but he had a heart that could be touched, which grew with each experience taught. I appreciate the excellent characterization; is very rare in movies and television.
