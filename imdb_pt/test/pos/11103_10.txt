There is something about true stories that makes them far more interesting than fiction. I think it's the fact that the truth has always been stranger than fiction. The Falcon and the Snowman tells the true story about Christopher Boyce and his friend Daulton Lee. Boyce (Hutton) is a former alter-boy and intellectual, trying to find an occupation that can support and entertain him. His FBI father is able to pull some strings and get his idealistic son to work in the defense department. Boyce has few responsibilities and seems to be complacent by drinking and playing with his co-workers. However, over time, Boyce begins to learn secret information that leads him to doubt the morality of his government. The idealist Boyce soon sees the illegal operations the CIA is carrying out everywhere in Australia. Boyce eventually decides that he will leak some of the secret information he knows, to the KGB. Of course, Boyce's mistake is the assumption that since the US is doing bad things, the USSR is the cool guy. Over time, Boyce and his drug-dealing friend, Lee (Penn), begin selling their secret information to the KGB. What used to be idealism, turns into capitalism and espionage. The strength of this film is the incredible performance of Hutton and Penn. Although one of them starts with the best of intentions, both will soon find themselves in an endless downward spiral. Great direction, music, everything. It's not just a great movie, but one of my all time favorites.
