I wonder if "The Outsiders" (Australian TV series) will be released on some DVD in the future? Is the song (Title Theme) available on CD? <br /> <br /> There were only a series of 13 episodes of this drama and it should have spent at least three or even four sets in total. The young German actor in the series was also on a German TV series called "Black Forest Clinic," which aired in the UK with the English dialogue superimposed on lip-sync. <br /> <br /> I look forward to hearing any comments from the TV industry folks on the above issues, thank you in advance.
