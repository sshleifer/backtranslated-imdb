I saw this great documentary at the International Film Festival of Santa Barbara. It's extremely absorbing and beautifully crafted, drawing you into the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most overlooked musical talents of the '60s and' 70s. While I was familiar with his best-known compositions ("One is the loneliest number," "Without you"), I learned about the brilliant writing and beautiful singing of this man. If you love music, you'll find a lot to lure him into his world, which unfortunately went out of control when his success increased and his past astonished him. As sad as it may be, he has been completely devoted to your family and you will be so happy to have met this man. The profile is effectively told through the very words of Nilsson and his friends and colleagues (a virtual Who's Who of Rock) who loved and respected him. Do not miss it!
