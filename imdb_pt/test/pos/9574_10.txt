This is the funniest movie I've ever seen. However, I laughed more in many movies. This is because the brilliance of the Best In Show is not in slapstick or one liners, but in sophisticated verbal wit and layers. The impromptu dialogue is so quick that you end up laughing not at every single joke, but only after a few jokes built on each other, each disarming your senses until the climax of the jokes and you can not help letting go. <br /> <br /> It's a well filmed movie, but what makes it extraordinary is acting. I was impressed by my first performance, but when I watched it, after learning that practically every scene is improvised, I was impressed. It was very nice to see the comedians work against each other, make jokes out of nothing and completely delve into their characters. <br /> <br /> I imagine the golden days of the Second City to be like this.
