El Padrino has just been released in Europe and is really kicking the butt. This film with its big cast - Damian Chapa (Blood Blood), Robert Wager, Jennifer Tilly, Robert Wagner and many more - is the best gangster movie since SCARFACE. A movie that everyone should see. 2 hours full of action with fantastic feats unbelievable !!!! <br /> <br /> THANK YOU JENNIFER !!!! We are looking forward to part 2 !!!! Does anyone know if there will be one? Stay up the good work !!! I loved !!
