Just ingenious enough to be plausible and still a lot of fun, this is a sheer slice of the 1970's (even the cops need bad haircuts!). Filmed in London, the plot of the former American convict who tries to be heterosexual, but is sent as an electrician to a bank in Mayfair, and then receives the screws of crime lord David Niven, and sees himself plotting the crime. I liked its simplicity and even innocence, this refers to a time when caper films, where just that, a caper and violence, were not part of the agreement. All in all you could do far worse than watching this: he has enough twists to give a bit of glamor and a cast that obviously had fun doing it. <br /> <br /> Well done and watchable.
