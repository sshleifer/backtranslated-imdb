Can a movie be very true to the book on which it is based? Judging from the 2007 adaptation of Khaled Hosseini's huge 2003 salesman, the answer is quite ironically "yes." Like many, I was fascinated by the book, an impressive first effort by the Afghan-American writer / physician. So obviously it was director Marc Forster and screenwriter David Benioff ("Troy"), who pay meticulous attention to the most significant details of the story within the 127-minute length of the film. However, the perfect tapestry of sincere events in Hosseini's novel often appears as episodic and truncated because Forster and Benioff are earnestly struggling to remain faithful to the full scope of history within the limits of time. Part of the challenge is how Hosseini has carefully used symbolic acts to provide a literary symmetry of then to what is essentially a three-act story, a technique that may seem a bit fabricated on the screen. <br /> <br /> However, filmmakers do the most important things, specifically giving the viewer an intimate insight into a hidden culture hitherto transmitted through the CNN newsreels, ensuring authenticity by having characters speaking in Persian Dari's language dialect Afghan and capturing the emotional entanglements of complex narrative. The first part of the film is set in 1978 in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion and eventual takeover of the Taliban. The focus is on the relationship between Amir, the son of a wealthy businessman named Baba, and the devoted Hassan, the son of his father's servant. Connected by their mutual love for the kite, the two are thick as thieves until a tragic event separates them irreparably. Unable to find the courage that comes so naturally to his father, Amir is crippled by guilt for not having rescued Hassan from an indescribable act performed by a trio of local bullies. Forster makes the ethnic tensions between the Hazara and the Pashtuns in Afghanistan particularly palpable. After the 1979 invasion by Soviet troops, Amir and Baba fled to the United States, where history retakes its history nine years later. Fremont, California, a suburban enclave of Afghan immigrants. Baba is reduced to working at a gas station and operating a flea market kiosk. Amir meets a local Afghan girl and gets married. This is the least interesting passage of the film since Benioff's treatment gives little attention to minor characters such as Amir's wife, Soraya, and more critically, Amir is portrayed by need as a reticent young man with a downfall to his self-esteem. The final section goes on for twelve years, when Amir, after the publication of his first book, is summoned back to Afghanistan, dictated by the Taliban, to rescue Hassan's son from the Taliban as a means of repairing his cowardice years before. There is a real suspense and fear generated in this part of the story, as shocking revelations and old acquaintances come back to haunt Amir during his journey. <br /> <br /> A British Egyptian-born actor, Khalid Abdalla (the leading kidnapper in "United 93") plays the central role of Amir as an adult, a challenging role since he has to convey a feeling constant shame and decreased self-esteem to the end. The other professional actors do better - Shaun Toub (the savior of Tony Stark, Yinsen, in the current Iron Man) as Baba's business partner, Rahim Khan, who holds the key to truth; Atossa Leoni quietly affecting as Soraya; and best of all, the Iranian actor Homayoun Ershadi who brings pride and dignity to Baba. Three young non-professionals were recruited from the Kabul school system to play the leading children's roles, and all are very good. Zekeria Ebrahimi is up to the challenge of the hardest part as the young Amir, and Ali Danish Bakhtyari is poignant as Soatab, Hassan's almost catatonic son. But it is Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada, with sad, moon-like eyes, who will break his heart like the young Hassan, especially in the devastating pomegranate-throwing scene. It is fair to say that his performance is on the same level as the young Enzo Staiola, in the classic "Bicycle Thieves", by Vittorio de Sica. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are well done, in particular, the clean cinematography of Robert Schaefer (convincing western China). substitutes for Afghanistan), Alberto Iglesias' evocative punctuation, and even CGI effects showing the kites in turbulent flight. The 2008 DVD has a solid set of extras, starting with an insightful commentary by Forster, Hosseini and Benioff, although some of their dialogues seem quite forced. There are two featurettes included - the first is the 14-minute "Words from the Kite Runner," which focuses on Hosseini's connection to the story and development of the novel, and the second is the 25-minute "Images from the Kite Runner ", a more standardized look behind the scenes of production. Completing the extras are the original theatrical trailer, a few previews and a Hosseini PSA on how to help Afghans during their current time of need.
