Although not for everyone, Crackerjack is a delight to watch, with the tongue firmly planted on the cheek. The sympathetic character of Jack Simpson, played by Mick Molloy, is fooling the local "bowlo" free parking and making a couple of dollars on the side, selling parking space to co-workers. When Bowling Club members need to raise some money to save their club, they call Jack to join the bowling team and play competition bowling. Filled with Aussie Charm, Mick Molloy's laconic wit is appearing through (he also co-wrote the screenplay) reminding this viewer of his previous work on Radio. Aussie Perfect casting with Bill Hunter as bowling mentor for Jack Stan Coombes, John Clarke (of fame games) as the ruthless businessman and rival bowling club owner Bernie Fowler, with Samuel Johnson as apartment colleague for Jack Dave and Judith Lucy as the weary journalist, Nancy. Initially, I thought only Molloy fans would like the film, but judging by the number of blue rinses coming out of the movies, this is a movie for everyone.
