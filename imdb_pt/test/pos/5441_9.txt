Robin Williams is a genius. One of the best comedians in the world. He really shows himself in this, making left and right jokes like comedian Tom Dobbs. From the previous one, it seemed like a little party of laughter. And it was funny. But there were many serious parts in the movie that I did not expect. I would describe it as a drama / comedy. But still worth the money to see, and I still thought it was almost everything I expected. Robin Williams is at his best, along with the famous Christopher Walken. They play a very good team in this movie and I was shocked to see how they could work together. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a lightweight movie.
