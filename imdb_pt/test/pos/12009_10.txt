I grew up outside Naila Germany (where they disembarked), every detail of the film was 100% authentic, the transmission lines they flied over, the nosy neighbors, the grandmother telling the children they could not watch West German TV, etc. This film brings back many good memories back to those who are European, a great Disney production ... The same German film has Klaus Lowitsch and Gunter Meisner using their own voices to translate the English-German version ... to the In the German version they also use Cookoo birds, a bird that is native to Germany as background noise so you know you are in Germany ... I showed this movement to many of my German relatives and they really liked this movie. made a balloon prototype that they had to give up because the materials they used were very porous and the other 2 balloons they used to escape. The burner problem was solved when they turned the propane cylinders upside down.)
