I'll tell you what was great. Dylan Moran is simply the funniest actor onscreen (and on stage) and with Micheal Caine as his partner is not bad, both are great to watch in a very funny movie. truth, not all the jokes come out, but it pays to stick around for the ones that do, but come on, Micheal Caine has a dress (all admission fees are worth it) and every time Dylan Moran is onscreen it's more like Bernard black film. the story is of two actors (Moran and Caine) who decide to steal money from a gang of gangsters by playing different characters to fool them, but getting out of this is a different matter. basically "the actors" is a great British comedy that was somehow lost by many, seriously if you are a fan of Moran (or want to see Micheal Caine in a dress) definitely see this
