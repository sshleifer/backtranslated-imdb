I loved this movie! Fantastically original and different! A solid, intense, hard-core and suspenseful movie that has the right touch of humor (obscure?). If you are tired of the typical, exaggerated, ridiculous Hollywood B.S. movies, how many big blasts and terrible and unreal shots at gun fights that insult your intelligence we take, then this movie is for you. Fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable, and solid performances from all the actors, not a weak character or performance in the movie. The film by Skip Woods is a breath of fresh air and I applaud his originality and his efforts, his film has the feel of a cross between a Quentin Tarantino movie and a Cohen movie (not a bad mix in my opinion). This movie grabs you by the throat and does not loose, there is nothing annoying or chewing gum about this movie. The only disappointment is that no one seems to know about it, everyone I recommended who thanked me and shared my opinion on this. This film is a welcome change / alternative to the traditional canned Hollywood trash that is being produced today, even with its great actor names, big bangs, special effects and huge budgets. It's a terribly wild ride, intense, violent, graphic, humorous and raw (I mean in a good way, no fake Hollywood cop here). Thanks to everyone involved in making this movie happen, you did an amazing job!
