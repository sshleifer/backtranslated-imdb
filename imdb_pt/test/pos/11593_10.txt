This small, calm and harmonious film becomes a masterpiece of human dignity. It is intelligently structured, filled with significant small details and important side plots. It tells the story of a man with great humanity without standing politically, but promoting life as a precious right (not an obligation) and underlining the right of the individual to choose. It enjoys the richness of different landscapes (mental and physical) and languages ​​(important detail). Excellent acting from each of the actors, especially unbelievable Javier Bardem. Your presence on the screen has such force that you forget that this is fiction. The film has a wonderful rhythm, is beautifully filmed and exceptionally directed. It takes a lot of talent to make a movie about such a difficult subject with understanding, humor and heart. Six stars out of five.
