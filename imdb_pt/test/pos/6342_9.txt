At the first glance of this mini ... I was a bit disappointed that Tommy Lee Jones and Anjelica Huston did not return to the cast. Both John Voight and Barbara Hershey did laudable work replacing very important characters by the continuing saga of this legendary Western epic. Cherokee Jack Jackson (Haysbert) played an excellent villain, and Louis Gossett Jr. was, as always, true to form with his excellent acting skills. <br /> <br /> The drama that seemed true to life in many scenes, including one of the best, where the brave shooting ended with Ranger Walker being killed made me feel like I was really in the movie. Return to Lonesome Dove was for me, almost up to the quality of the first in the series. The next 2 follow-ups with James Garner as Call did not do that for me. And that Lorena marries Pea Eye? How the hell did that happen? This was a total character mismatch. The first 2 in the series made Epic history, the next 2 did not have the same quality. <br /> <br /> Now if the first two could be remastered into Dolby Digital and an anamorphic presentation, the movies could be where they should have been like the movies today.
