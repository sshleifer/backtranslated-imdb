I usually do not comment on IMDB movies, but in this case I feel I should. I love movies, and I want to make them, and this movie is a perfect example of filming. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I saw on the small screen (originally watching the movie on AMC, I believe, and then on the DVD I just watched) that made me feel that sensation in my mouth stomach. This little gnawing sense that the director expects you to feel while watching the suspense. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon's performance is great, and Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas follow. I felt a lot of empathy for Lemmon, who is the character Jack Godell, just wanted people to hear his warning. <br /> <br /> But what strikes me most about this film is the lack of a score, and that's what makes it beautiful for me, too. In addition to the opening titles, there is no background music to increase the tension because none is needed. And while the credits run, white on black, in silence, this brings the issue home. <br /> <br /> I use the film as an example for anyone who says that music makes the movie. I think the film should make the movie and the music should only amplify it. But for the Syndrome of China music is not necessary to convey the realism and urgency described here. The characters portray all this much better than music ever could. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie, it's one of my favorites. If you like movies, you will not be disappointed. If you like more movie soundtracks, you might not want to give this a try.
