I love this movie and I recommend it to anyone. Damian Chapa and Jennifer Tilly played their roles perfectly. Only the characters only pull you into the movie. The direction was also magnificent. The most creative photos I've ever seen. I was stuck to the screen throughout the movie, not a scene was slow. The movie also has a lot of action-packed scenes, cars exploding, etc. The movie is just a masterpiece. If you like real entertainment movies, watch this because you'll always be on the edge of your seat. I put this movie on my top ten list because there's never a dull moment in the movie, and that's my kind of movie. 2 thumbs up, all the way up !!!!!!!!!
