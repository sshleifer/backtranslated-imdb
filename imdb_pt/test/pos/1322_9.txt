It took several previews to fully appreciate this movie. Initially, I was impressed by the stylized scenarios, but found the rest slow and bland. I thought such a sensational subject needed Ken Russell's treatment to get over it. I now think that forced restraint (put into production by the widow of Mishima) is an asset. Some of the most shocking aspects of Mishima's life are reiterated and dramatized by the corresponding themes of his novels. I think it helps to be familiar with the novels - that's what finally made a difference to me. I still feel the film in general could be a bit tighter and warmer, but it's genuinely unique and deserves a lot of attention. I love the fact that Japanese characters speak Japanese - not English. Philip Glass's score is mesmerizing.
