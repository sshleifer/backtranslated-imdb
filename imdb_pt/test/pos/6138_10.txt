I watched it on tv in 1989 and regret not recording it. I was very intriguing and full of suspense. It is incredible how events unfold and the past of this man reaches. <br /> <br /> The performance is top notch and the story is exactly what the title claims ... "twist of fate" ... but no one could escape from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie.
