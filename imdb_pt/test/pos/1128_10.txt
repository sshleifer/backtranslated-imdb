When I sat down to watch Greek for the first time, I was not expecting a show with complex characters, intriguing plots and impeccable writing ... but that's exactly what I got. <br /> <br /> The Greek follows several university students who are in the Greek system at the University of Cyprus Rhodes. Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus Rhodes as one of the leading scientists at Polymer Science, who aspires to be in a fraternity. His older sister, Casey (the center of the series and soon to be president of Zeta Beta Zeta, the most prestigious sisterhood on campus), does not exactly support his plans. In fact, none of her friends knew she had a brother until he set foot on college campus! In addition to dealing with the fact that her younger brother was forced back into her life, Casey's boyfriend, Evan Chambers (about to be president of the Omega Chi brotherhood) is betraying her with a new promise from ZBZ. (Rebecca Logan), the diabolical ZBZ president, Frannie, is pressuring her to stay with him, and she still has feelings for her ex-boyfriend Cappie (Kappa Tau). These characters join Calvin Owens (an intelligent and athletic friend of Rusty who is gay), Dale Kettlewell (Rusty's toughest Christian and his "possibly racist" roommate) and Ashleigh (Casey's best friend and confidant) . During the two Greek seasons (or four chapters), viewers are often reminded that college life is not black and white, but "grayed out from here on." Each character makes his fair share of mistakes, but each of them has redeemable qualities. Casey and Cappie have a complicated but beautiful relationship throughout the series. The friendship of Rusty, Dale and Calvin is not always perfect, but they manage to survive all the obstacles thrown at them. Even Frannie, Rebecca and Evan (the "villains" of the show) are shown as humans from time to time. <br /> <br /> Greek shows college students at their best, the worst, and the middle. It's a show that reveals the faculty as it truly is: a four-year adventure in which morals, beliefs and willpower are tested, compromised, and sometimes even modified. <br /> <br /> Greek has at least one season. left, if not more, before finishing. I can not wait to see where the characters end next. Greek is not your typical ABC family sitcom. If you want to tune into a program that shows the truth behind human motivation, Greek is the program for you.
