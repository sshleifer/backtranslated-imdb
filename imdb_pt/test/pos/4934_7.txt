This is a great movie! It's funny for everyone, even adults. We have Jason Voorhees / Leatherface as killer on this, along with other crazy characters. Very funny movie, for kids of all ages. Must rented this every time we went to the video store! Buster and Babs make a good pair and love the duck. He's probably my favorite character! I've never been big on the TV show, but this movie just brings back so many good memories. Must see for families, show fans, or anyone! Nice, no matter how small or old you are! RENT NOW IN YOUR LOCAL VIDEO SHOP! <br /> <br /> Q. NEED A DVD RELEASE!
