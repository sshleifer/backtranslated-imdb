We are taken to a convenience store where Nick is looking at coins in his hand, wondering if he can get the special, a 69-cent, 20-ounce cup of coffee that comes with a free batter. He decides to go for the larger size, which of course is more expensive and does not qualify for the cake. He tries to argue with the Indian official on the record, who holds his position. It is a question of principle with it. Well, Nick gets angry not getting his own way and continues to kill her. <br /> <br /> The tone of the story is set from the beginning. The people we're about to meet are not cool guys. There's Nick, his girlfriend, Dallas and his partner Billy Hill. They are drug traffickers. Nick decides to visit Casey, his friend and ex-partner in the crime in Houston. He wants to make one more deal and then go to Paris with the profits from the sale of the drugs he's bringing. What he does not realize is that Casey went straight. He is an architect, married to Christine, and wants to adopt a baby. <br /> <br /> Casey does not like her ex-friend bringing drugs into the house. He decides to get rid of things, washing them down the drain of the kitchen. The premature arrival of Ice, a pizza delivery man, catches Casey by surprise. This man was sent to kill him, but before that, Casey brings a weed to share with Ice, who has rap talent. <br /> <br /> It is at this point that Dr. Jarvis, the man of the adoption agency, arrives. Casey's application shows a two-year gap that he can not justify. Jarvis begins to doubt the prospective father. At this point, Dallas makes an entrance. She is a woman who asks blank questions, like when she asks to know if Jarvis likes to watch pornography. Jarvis, who is excited, ends up getting annoyed. Dallas decided to seduce Casey at all costs. There's a surprise in the store when Billy Hill comes on the scene and he does not like what he sees, filming Dallas in the process. Billy Hill also came out of Casey, but he is dominated. <br /> <br /> Casey receives a visit from Kasarov, who wants to get his money from Nick; in his absence, he will pull Casey. Kasarov gives a deadline and Casey makes the decision to be smarter than all those low lives. He has all the parties coming to his house at an appointed time and the different factions will take care of themselves. In the end, Casey has a better plan, which includes taking Christine for a stay in Paris. <br /> <br /> Never having heard of "Thursday" we were drawn to it because of the talent. Skip Woods directed his own material. This seems to be a movie with good intentions. Sometimes the movie resembles others of the same genre, not a sin of any form or form, which seems to be the main objection of the negative comments left here on the IMDb site. To begin with, "Thursday" shows a witty Skip Woods who wrote other movies, especially "Swordfish". The script is divided into chapters with suggestive titles, referring to the action. Denis Lenoir does wonders with most indoor photographs. <br /> <br /> Thomas Jane makes an excellent contribution to the film with his Casey. Although difficult to imagine, he overcame the difficulties and made something of himself. This actor, seen recently in the TV series "Hung", is one of the actors that we never tire of watching. Aaron Eckhart, with dark hair, is a welcome addition to any movie. He is an oily criminal who shows no redemptive qualities or anything like remorse and does not hesitate to involve his ex-friend in his scheme. James LeGros has nothing to do. The same goes for Paulina Porizkova, a wonderful creature that is just a distraction or a belated reflection to add a sexy angle. We enjoyed Glenn Plummer, who appears as Ice. He does an evil hearing on the phone. Michael Jeter and Mickey Rourke also appear.
