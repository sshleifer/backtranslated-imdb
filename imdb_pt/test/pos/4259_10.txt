This film had everything one could wish for when viewing it originally in the late 1960s. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes that occurred during that period - and were still in progress - in terms of movement Black Power, Vietnam, and the volatile movement that followed the post-war 1950s quieter. <br /> <br /> All this and one of the funniest movies, then or now. <br /> <br /> Looking at it a second time recently, I was astonished to find it as captivating as when I first saw it. Your mood is so funny, and your message is so strong. <br /> <br /> And by visualizing it now, you get all that, while at the same time you gain the additional pleasure of being a "period piece." and an excellent description of this historic and turbulent time.
