The writers of the lost have overcome. The end of the second season is even more painful and intense than the end of the first season. Locke's lack of faith resulted not only in spiritual consequences for himself but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal has resulted in a success for him, but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I do not doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge. This end left more questions than the previous end; and I can not wait for autumn. <br /> <br /> One note: What's the point of posting a review just to write all the spoilers? Where is the pleasure in ruining the surprise for everyone else? The current revision on this page is nothing more than a great spoiler party, poorly constructed in poorly readable English for the express purpose of driving someone crazy. Good job.
