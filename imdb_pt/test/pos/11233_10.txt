The Polish brothers are unique movie artists, and they really pushed the envelope here. A fantasy that has points in common with "Wings of Desire," "Northfork" tells the story of a small town of the 50's in the middle of nowhere that is two days away from being flooded and submerged thanks to the US government's desire to do a reservoir in the place where the city is. It's an ironic parable about loss and remembrance, featuring angels, dreams, premonitions and the most hilarious government recovery officials since "Repo Man." The performances are excellent, especially Nolte and Woods. I noticed by reading some of the comments that there are people who were offended simply by the fact that the Polish twins use elliptical storytelling tactics, and I mean, that's one of the things that make this movie so good: willingness to embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life. David Mullen's cinematography is impressive. Highly recommended; If you have suffered a significant personal loss, such as the death of a parent, I would even say that this film is necessary. Ray
