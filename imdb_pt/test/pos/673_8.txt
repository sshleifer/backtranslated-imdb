I particularly enjoyed Delly's review of this film and agree that Howard is not the only "damaged" character. Howard is ruthlessly "prepared" by the script, but there is no evidence that his former employer is actually dead or, if she is, that he has murdered her. Howard does not know and neither do we. In terror and confusion upon seeing the woman lying there, he runs. However, he never hurts Helen Gordon, no matter how angry he is. In fact, he reacts with horror to Helen's fainting and to the fact that he is holding a pair of scissors ... so he resumes his arrangement and greets the recovered Helen with the almost pathetic "I'm very tired now. I think he's going home" . Frankly, I do not think he's a psychopath. A sick puppy, certainly, but not a psychopath. <br /> <br /> The problem with Howard is that he does not have a real male identity. He wanted to serve his country, but his mental condition denied him a place in the army. He is singularly rooted and isolated: without a wife, without a girl, without a home (at least as far as we know). And it does the work of a woman - "Floor's are my specialty". Helen's niece mercilessly takes this pride out of her perfection, caustically exclaiming that she would like a man with a real job. Moreover, although he feels strongly attracted to Helen, he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass. He is incredibly powerless - can not fight, can not work, can not make love. <br /> <br /> Helen is justifiably terrified, however. She tries to connect to him, but upon discovering that he does not respond normally (that is, outside the comfort zone provided by her pink memories of her husband Ned), he involuntarily presses all Howard's buttons lying to him in his attempt to escape. <br /> <br /> Both characters, trapped in the house, trapped by fear, neuroses, anger and memory, deserve sympathy. I know the sudden ending disappointed some critics, but I felt good, since it offered a kind of release for the characters. Helen is released, I think, from the past. When Howard experiences his husband's army coat, Helen's angry reaction is enhanced. She no doubt feels that the "sacredness" of Ned's possessions has been violated, but, hopefully, her need to keep everything "untouched" was lost in the reality of her own struggle against danger. Maybe she can move on. <br /> <br /> Howard is also released - from his endless cycle of anger, hurt and violence. Whether it goes to treatment or to jail is debatable, but I hope it is the first. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Ryan and Lupino. I prefer "On Dangerous Ground", but that's pretty good too.
