"Saturday Afternoon" is one of Harry Langdon's best-known short songs, and with good reason. It's one of his funniest and best movies. The plot - as it is - is an old article: a drunken husband sneaks into the night with a friend and a few other girls. It's a solid and well-used comedy plot, but the difference here is Harry Langdon himself. His slow, ineffective, stunned and innocent character somehow fumbled in a marriage with a woman who feels he must be ruled with an iron hand, and he is only pushed to betray her because he can not say "no" to the exhortations of the sexy Vernon Dent and the girl's beautiful eyelash movement. <br /> <br /> It is a very adult problem to be played in such a helpless and childlike character. Harry does not want to fool, but he can not do anything about it. In a wonderful comic business, he can not say goodbye to his new girlfriend with a parting kiss: he maliciously pushes the kiss to her from below and embarrassed wipes his hand as if to punish her. The film is a three-reel comedy, ten minutes longer than the two winders that Harry Langdon had already starred in Mack Sennett, no more plot. Maybe it was even designed to be a two-reeler. This works very well since it gives him as much time as he needs to inject the slow reactions and confused glimpses and half-actions where he lives much of his comedy. <br /> <br /> He is in his best shape here, and the show is really the curious magic of Harry Langdon and his ability to take the comedy of almost nothing. His little smiles, his gaze as he manipulated the money he hid under the rug, children's attempts to get into the fight in the end. I think his comedy makes us recognize something fundamentally innocent and confusing in ourselves that makes us feel like the whole world is too much for us, but at the same time, allowing us to understand what Harry does not do (like the fact that women he brings to his friend to cheer him up after he thinks the date was blown are actually prostitutes) he obliges to realize with a little sadness that we are not so innocent anymore. His comedy is just as capable of making us say "Awwww" as it makes us laugh, often all at once. <br /> <br /> Here Harry wants to refuse to betray his wife, he means his wife, who sends some power in his relationship, he wants to fight the two men violent at the end of the movie, but it can not affect the environment so much, and sometimes we all feel that way. <br /> <br /> The film is directed perfectly by Langdon's frequent director Harry Edwards; moves at a rapid pace and never stands still, while at the same time gaining time and presenting the best effect of Harry Langdon's still reactive comedy. Vernon Dent, a frequent figure for Langdon, plays one of the roles here, where he becomes almost a comedy partner in his very effective pairing with Harry. The gags have spread in a way that gives the maximum effect as well, and Harry gets his own version of a Lloyd or Keaton style at the end. Here the comedy is not in Harry's great reactions to the danger of sitting between two moving cars, but in his slowness in accepting it. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious movie and a perfect example of comedy. one of the most original and talented comedians I've ever known existed.
