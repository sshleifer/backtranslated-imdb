I went to the movies in 1973 when the movie was released, I was 11 at the time. I remember how much I liked and wanted to live in Shangri-la, I was naive and young as I was. Recently I came across a video of the movie that I recorded on television a few years ago. I watched again and am not ashamed to admit that I still like it so much now as I did 29 years ago. I also like to hear the words of the songs because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of the guns did not hit our ears and if we looked at our reflection - we should be happy with what we see . This is what I call "I feel good" because I feel happy after watching it. Maybe I'm still naive, but that makes me happy and I'm sure it will make you happy if you watch with an open mind and have fun for what it is - a good family movie. I must be one of the few people who has this movie in VHS PAL video - and DVD (self-made). I recorded on DVD when the video recording of the TV was starting to get weak. I still watch from time to time.
