What's there to say about "Pink Flamingos"? It is beyond critics or even explanations because it does not aspire to be like any other movie you have seen. You will catch, or will not, laugh or roll your eyes in disgust (or both). John Waters is a strange filmmaker (putting it mildly), blending innocent, childlike humor with shockingly offensive moments meant for ... well, who knows what his intentions were. It's like a form of aggression, though funny. <br /> <br /> What makes Waters' humor so contagious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that may seem alien and completely familiar to the viewer. like the little rivalries that form the plot of "Pink Flamingos". Certainly everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point, but almost certainly the subject matter was not the title of "The Filthiest Person Alive". What makes the film a compelling sight for me is the way Waters creates self-contained and confusing environments and does not let you into the game immediately. The people in your movies are completely in tune with each other. For example, when Cotton tells Babs that she does not want to escort her into town because Crackers is bringing her "friend" to the trailer, Babs reacts with a smile of complicity and says to her, conspiratorially, "This shed is just PERFECT ... "At this point, we do not yet know that Crackers plans to take their" friend "to the shed to push live chickens into his naked body while Cotton watches orgasmically through a window, but this strangeness is totally banal and understood by the characters of the fictitious degenerate world that Waters creates. <br /> <br /> Another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and Channing, the deviant butler of the marbles. The first time we see them, Waters cuts from a scene in Connie's cozy office to Channing, down to the basement, where we see two women downstairs, one dead and one very lively and dead. Susan is not a shrunken victim, but is furious and abusive with Channing, jumping to launch a large-scale verbal attack on her jailer. Both have a strange understanding of the bizarre situation, and she is not as intimidated by her abduction as she is violently insulted and justly furious. She does not let go for a second while Channing is in her sight, and the two scenes that feature her delirious jokes are two of the film's comic highlights. Later in the film, when Divine and Crackers invaded the Marbles home and discovered their crimes of keeping women abducted in their basement, it represents the total lack of support Divine and his family have for the brand of depravity that the Marbles are favoring. There is something with which Divine is unfamiliar, a corruption planned by her newly discovered rivals, and she despises him. Also, while the kidnapping does not look like something Divine would think twice about, she is outraged that the girls are being held there and fortunately release them, savoring the revenge they face at Channing. At the other end of the specter of filth, Waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his distorted fantasy world and the "real" world. The first time we see Connie, she is depreciating a smaller character named Sandy Sandstone, who has never heard of Divine. Cookie, on the other hand, reacts with a hilarious assessment of Divine's title as the "dirtiest living", revealing that she also dwells in this world of unspoken and understood follies. <br /> <br /> Something must also be said for how players are in touch with their respective roles, especially Divine, who does not miss a note. Not once does he hesitate in the ridiculous costume and character he has received, and take the "Pink Flamingos" to a new level or oddity. People really believed that Divine was so in real life, and it's easy to understand why while watching the movie, you're not really thinking about the movie, you're thinking about these people who did it. Since they are actually doing the outrageous things in the script, you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentary. <br /> <br /> What's more, "Pink Flamingos" is not so much a movie as it is an event or something that happens to you. Even though its shock value has disappeared for me now (I say mostly because the scene from the hole and the chicken scene still make me shudder), I still find this movie hilarious and addictive.
