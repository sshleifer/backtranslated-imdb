This strange and hypnotic drama of Don Siegel / Clint Eastwood was dropped in 1971 and what a pity. A fascinating character study with some great women to Squint to deal with. Geraldine Page was one of our supreme actresses and is perfectly conjured. Young Jo Ann Harris is a daring seductress, and Elizabeth Hartman (who died very young) is undeniably repressed. <br /> <br /> A 7 out of 10. Best performance = C. Eastwood. Released the same year as DIRTY HARRY, that did not do anything to get good reviews. Look for this unless you're only into "Blast" movies. Very subtle and scary, this piece will stay with you.
