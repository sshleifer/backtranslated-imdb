I've tried to remember the name of this movie for years and years. Finally, I read something from today, 03/03/2005, which mentioned the name of Stacy Keach, and I remembered that I had seen a movie in which he was in 1974 at the Atlanta Film Festival, so I did a Google search for the movies of Keach. and found the gravy train. We should see Duddy Kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they failed to show it and replaced The Gravy Train. We were terribly disappointed that we were not able to see the very excited Duddy Kravitz, and we did not hear anything about The Gravy Train, and we have not heard from him since. <br /> <br /> However, I remember we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film, and as far as I remember it was pretty funny. I'd love to meet you on tape.
