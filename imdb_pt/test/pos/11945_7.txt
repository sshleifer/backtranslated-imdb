This movie is similar to "Better Off Dead" as it has some of the same stars. This is not so good. Granted it's pretty funny and nice, there's something about "Better ... which I like, a lot better." There are these guys going to Nantucket to spend their summer vacation there. guy who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant This guy really does not seem to like lobsters because in one scene he puts him in the boiling water and puts a stethoscope so he can hear him scream. from the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant, somehow this leads to a great boat racing clash, as in "Summer Rental", although it works a little better here and fits the plot a little better.Although what it is There's been some weird fascination with them? For the most part this movie laughed at a good clip, but "Better Off Dead" was still better because it was the first one and the jokes worked better.
