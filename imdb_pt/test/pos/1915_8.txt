What a trip down memory lane. <br /> <br /> Do not look for incredible plots, plausible plots or anything that looks like a quality movie. <br /> <br /> This is pure blaple at best. Outrageous clothes, unrepeatable dialogues, objectification of women, and the most sloppy cops you can imagine. <br /> <br /> This "Godfather of Rap" vanity piece, Rudy Ray Moore, that left us forever last week is the standard by which all blaxploitation is measured. <br /> <br /> You do not just see blaxploitation at its best, but have glimpses of your comedy genius, and see why your records were kept under the balcony.
