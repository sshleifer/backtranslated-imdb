This movie is a perfect action / drama / thriller picture, every scene you have sucked. I watched this movie and was amazed at how many talented actors were in the movie. Chap√£o Especially was great, he played his role perfectly. The story was made for these actors. The characters make the film so realistic. This film quite simply gets an A plus from me. Definitely watch this movie, compares with scarface but has a more in-depth story. This film not only gives you a good picture of gangster life but also gives you the characters emotions , and in the end you really feel for the main character. Watch this movie !!!!!!
