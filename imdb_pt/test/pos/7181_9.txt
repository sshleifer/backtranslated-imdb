The second film (not animated) about the only people who still refuse to surrender to the Roman Empire is even more hilarious than the first film "Asterix & Obelix contre Ceasar". <br /> <br /> Where the first movie received all the movies. laughs because all the cartoon characters were perfectly brought to life without losing their cartesque identity, this sequence (which is a separate story like all comics) is even better. Of course, all the ingredients you find in the first movie and in the comics are present again: Obelix is ​​still dying to taste the "magic potion" that gives the other members of the tribe huge powers, Caesar and the rest of the Romans. Empire is still enemy number 1, but some fresh and refreshing elements have been brought to the stage as well. <br /> <br /> It's not just very idyllic scenery (most of it plays, of course, in Egypt), but instead of repeating the movie. number one, a few extras were added making all kinds of references to other movies (Bruce Lee etc.). This is not all very new, but the unexpected combination of the well-known comic-book story (with almost the same title as the movie) and references to things that have absolutely nothing to do with Asterix & Obelix really works. So the film builds a tradition of comic book writers Goscinny and Uderzo, who did not hesitate to take Laurel and Hardy to the stage and even dedicate a whole story to Kirk Douglas. <br /> <br /> If all this does not convince you to watch this movie, I'm sure that Monica Bellucci playing Cleopatra will ....
