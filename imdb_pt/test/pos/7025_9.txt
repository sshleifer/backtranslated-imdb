I did not understand what that line meant ... I do now. I really did not want to see Dirty Dancing either. We rented it but never watched it - and today I did. And I thought it was a really fun, great movie that makes you want to get up and dance. Alright, it was tacky sometimes ... but it's still a great movie. I can not believe Jennifer Gray was 27 years old in this movie - my friend and I thought she looked like 18 or 19 - 20 at the most. I think this is attributed to his acting talent. And she really seemed strange at times. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can tell he is in his 30s and looks a little old. However, it is still very good. I love 80's songs, so that really impressed me, and the love story (yes, I'm romantic) was so wonderful. I really liked this movie. Exceeded my expectations!
