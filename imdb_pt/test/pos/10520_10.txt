These immortal lines begin the masterpiece directed by Jack Starret, "The Dion Brothers". The plot revolves around two blue-collar West Virginian brothers (Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest) who commit robberies in the hope of using the money to open a seafood restaurant !!? What follows is an adventure and many comic events happen. The action scenes are all top-notch and consist of some well-done shootouts. The last of which is absolutely incredible and occurs in an abandoned building being demolished by a demolition ball! The film was written now famous director Terrence Malick and features an early appearance by Margot Kidder. All in all, a great hidden gem from the 70's and easily one of the best action / comedy hybrids ever made. I hope you will soon receive a decent widescreen DVD release.
