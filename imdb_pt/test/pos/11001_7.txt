I enjoyed watching Squire Trelane around the crew in this episode, although after a while the whole thing seemed a little too long. Of course, the histrionics were kind of funny for a while, and the ending was a great way to put it all together. I think the problem was that I enjoyed seeing Trelane when he was full of bravado and fun, the fun seemed to disappear when Trelane became vindictive and unpleasant. Talk about a mood killer - going from the nasty but affable host to the guy sentencing Kirk to death! But despite this, the episode was enjoyable and was worth my time. For the tough Trekkies, this is a must-see, for others it's just a beautiful factory run.
