I saw this movie on the big screen as a kid and I loved it - brutes and everything. I recently found a copy in the video and checked it out again. Badly done, of course ... fun, definitely. It's still a fun punch. It's a lot more fun than the dull version of Disney ("Alive"). The only thing that "Alive" did best were the special effects. If you're a B movie lover, I recommend "Survive," not to mention all the other Rene Cardona Jnr movies ... and the Mexican wrestling movies made by his father (Rene Cardona Snr). "Survive" is too late for the special edition DVD treatment. Are you listening, everyone gentle, in Anchor Bay ...?
