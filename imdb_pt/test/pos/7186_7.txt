The French people are not known to be major film producers. <br /> <br /> Although his Amelie scored highs at the Oscars. Asterix et Obelix is ​​a very different film than I am accustomed to by the French. It's a great movie especially for kids. The only thing that intrigued me was that it was spoken in French and subtitled. Normally, with the films spoken in English (here in Holland), I do not have to read the subtitles. But with the French language, you just need to read to understand. The story is great with Obelix, who does not remember being fat, but there are also good details mostly in names like brucewillix and malcomix. You all know the history of comics and this movie shows everything else slide by slide of the book. Every thing is in it, from the braking of Sfinx's nose until the pirate's red beard loses three more ships. I would say a great movie for the weekend with the kids.
