I laughed out loud several times during this movie, although take a perfunctory look and you would think it was something completely different. I love the rhythm and the way it burns slowly in you when you are introduced to these incredibly beautiful pictures. Andersson gives us something else here. Show us something I have not seen since your last movie. He is compositionalally exceptional and through his method of securing the camera and allowing action to take place before us, it opens the door to humanity and we look for a place that reflects our own lives, our little lives. It's a powerful thing. It is the simplicity with which it allows events to occur, creating the opposite feeling of complexity. Everything in front of the camera is anything but simple. Andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary. I believe most scenes, if not all, are sets constructed from scratch according to their designs. I can not recommend this movie highly enough. For me he took me to a place and I left him having witnessed a world worn and beautiful, starched and afflicted, sterile and splendid. At the same time alien and family. This movie is brilliant and affirms life. I know because I came out smiling very well. It took seven years to do this. If he only made this movie, he would still be up there with the big ones.
