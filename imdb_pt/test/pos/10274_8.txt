So here's a little bit about how I watched this movie. As you probably know, this is the original French film, which was then redone (surprise surprise) by Hollywood as Wicker Park. Well, I avoided this movie like the plague when it was released, simply because, a) I knew it had absolutely nothing to do with Wicker Park, and living in Chicago, I did not understand why they called it - it was filmed in fricking Canada to begin! - b) I have a hard time making meaningless remakes, made purely because Hollywood thinks we are too idle to read some subtitles (I'm dreading the remake of Infernal Affairs, by the way) and c) I can not Stay Josh Hartnett, 'nuff said there. <br /> <br /> However, I came across WP on TV the other day, probably about half an hour, and I have to say initially, it made no sense until about half an hour from the end when it started to join. In the end, I was really surprised to see myself really involved, and then the end seemed so good - a perfect combination of history, passion and end with one of the biggest musical choices I've ever seen (I've heard? the plot of L'Appartement vs. Wicker Park and looking at WP, I still say that everything has to do with Chicago, but there seemed to be something about what I liked, so when I was connected again, I watched again - unfortunately, still I miss the first piece (I'm still to see!), and I still thought it was very good. "Heck, even Josh Hartnett looked good!" But I was curious about L'Appartement and wanted to see the reason for all this fuss. I waited and waited to get L'Appartement somewhere somehow Netflix let me down so I ended up getting a copy of some website in Ireland And I just watched it <br /> <br /> It's kind of weird, but it's a good freak. ico Great acting, Romane Bohringer is an absolute gem - sorry, but she acts Monica Bellucci off the screen in every scene. Vincent Cassel was a strange choice for leadership, but in the end it works. And I've seen Jean-Philippe Ecoffey in a lot of movies and I just love him - the scene where Alice leaves him in the restaurant and he just seems like someone told him that his puppy was run over was unbearable! But, I can honestly say, having seen WP and pretty much hoping that this was a scene for scene copying (since about 75% of the rest of the movie had been - maybe in a different order, but come on, the scene with the coffee in the glasses Word by word !!), you can imagine my surprise when I watched the end of L'Appartement !! I can literally say that I was impressed - hmm, a little like poor Lucien was at the cafe window! So be prepared, if you've ever seen Wicker Park and like to take a look at the original as I did, do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie because you'll be disappointed or excited about a piece of The History of French Cinema - an excellent example of how you can watch a movie, think you'll watch a happy ending and full of jumps and get out of the whirl in the opposite direction in the end. Definitely catch this movie. Oh, and while you are, maybe not too close at the same time, but on the way, take a look at Wicker Park, it will also surprise you.
