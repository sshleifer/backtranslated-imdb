It would be something to try to tell someone what Fata Morgana is simply about. Or maybe it is not: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film varied landscapes and locations. But this is just the broader blow. It is a feat that you give yourself or not. He enters the form of the world around him entirely, without a history, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, since his camera (filming in supposedly discarded films) wanders as in a pure travel script. One can even jump to this easy conclusion as he puts these immense landscapes, then moving to a rougher civilized culture (though not the 'normal' culture itself), and to a very abstract level to be able to convey properly on here . Sometimes it takes time to get along, close to a purity through the "creation" section, but a purity in how the parts are manipulated by nature or by broken machines. Soon the narration, readings of the Popol Vuh (which incidentally makes music for most of his films), with the gradual procession of really highly stylized photos adds a totally different level to it. It's a hybrid movie, and it's not easy, but the rewards are the ones that best approximate Herzog's idea of ​​"truth-in-the-making," images he has done throughout his career. <br /> <br /> You wonder if the pictures end the moment the second section, Paradise, drives the words spoken, or is the other way around. His eyes are moving along with stills and pans, and the text is close to being religious writing, but there are also musical choices such as bizarrely reserved singing and discreet classical music go along with Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith. I think each side ends up praising the other, and it still seems like it should not work. Perhaps this is the attraction for this, the chances of passing through desolate wastelands and the smallest stretches of race of any kind of civilized life (in this case, the desert shacks), which make it so fascinating. If at least in the cinematographic sense it is an indescribable wonder for the fan of casual photography because of technical molds, and some of the strangest images of any Herzog film. There are pots, there are long range plans, there are hand when driving through the cities, there is a bus a dozen miles away that via mirage seems just a couple, there are full close-ups of fire and a man holding a reptile and talking about the his radar (truly classic comedy of gonzo), there are people standing in fake poses, and a man and a woman playing inane music. But more importantly, it ends up feeling, at least to me, natural to the personal nature of the approach. <br /> <br /> I'm sure only Herzog would know for sure why he made this film, as opposed to the simple "how"; he was already filming Even Dwarfs Started Small, and he ended up going through many dangers to finish it. However, this is what makes Fata Morgana such an incredible feat - it will attract one, depending on what someone brings you to watch it. It is definitely disturbing but there is the temptation to want to see it again very soon, just to experience all the ideas and realities that have turned into strange vibrations (yes, the word 'vibes' applies here). It's one of the truly spectacular "art films" ever made.
