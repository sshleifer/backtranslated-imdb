I really liked this movie. Effectively combines mood, fantasy and some moments of terror with a solid effort of filming Higuchinsky. Bright visuals and a very unique story about spirals. My only complaints are that it had its dull moments and was not as daring as it could have been. Still, I give it a solid 8 out of 10. The US should take note of this and other good Japanese horror / fantasy films that have recently appeared and have them available on Region 1 DVD. In fact, Asian movies in general , has some of the best movies that have not been noticed by the American public because they are hard to find. I highly recommend that people look for these treasures, they are hard to find, but once you find them, you will be glad you did.
