This film, undoubtedly, is the clearest example of British humor that the Germans can not understand. One-liners runs wild in a movie that spawns one of the biggest film series in British film history (St.Trinians). The story of bureaucratic incompetence amid post-war trials allows Frank Launder to direct the maximum of talent from the entire cast. It's probably the only movie in which Margaret Rutherford finds her departure, in Alastair Sim, for a blunt characterization (she still wins). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis both deserve mention of Dighton's English label masterpiece and rigid upper lip under pressure. <br /> <br /> No fan of Rutherford / Sim / Grenfell would be without it in his collection. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83mins in length.
