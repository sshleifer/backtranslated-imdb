I need to tell you the truth. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because of Rose McGowan. I think that part definitely worked ... well, actually. However, the film was also very good. Some parts of this movie are really good. <br /> <br /> The movie also has great action. The mystery is very difficult to figure out and Rose [McGowan] does some "Oscar-worthy" acting at the end of the movie, but I do not want to give anything away for free. Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow are also great in the movie, along with some of the other stars. <br /> <br /> If you like mysteries, or action movies, or just like Rose ... I really think you'd like this movie.
