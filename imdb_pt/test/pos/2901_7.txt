This was the second Cinemascope show Fox produced after Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are corrected to go through Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first-class elements, beautiful photographs, lively soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the main acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the slave in one eye and the Polish actress Bella Darvi as the seductive Babylonian "Nefer." I think this movie is usually strong in the plot, which is rare for those great shows produced at the time. All in all, the film does an interesting and entertaining work of social commentary on what Egyptian society might have looked like.
