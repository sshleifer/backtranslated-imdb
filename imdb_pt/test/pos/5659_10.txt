Although it was a failure in theaters, mainly because Mylene Farmer, one of the three main stars of France did not have the first role. Fans changed their minds after that and were waiting for him on DVD. When it was released on DVD this year, it has tremendous success! The others failed was the slow pace and the incredible duration (3h) of the time (1994) that annoyed the critics. But melancholy history makes this slow and long. The moral of the film is that you can not escape the death to which you are destined. It's the same theme as in the movie "Final Destination" and makes it a gothic tale. The atmosphere is very melancholy.
