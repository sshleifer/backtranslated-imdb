I can not explain it, but I find this film not only funny but so enjoyable that I feel compelled to watch it several times, or at least when I had cable. I always felt it was a very poorly made movie, but maybe it's because I watched it in the movie. I plan to get a DVD of this movie to really take an honest look but more importantly just to have a good time watching. I liked the plot and idea of ​​the film and especially liked the cast. I always wonder if the cast likes to make the movies they are in and this is no exception. This film deserved a better fate than it received and Kelsey Grammar deserved at least one love scene with Mrs. Holly. Who would not? The characters in this movie were the kind of person I identify with when I was in the army and zaniness was accurate. Nice going troops.
