There have been numerous productions that speak of the development of the atomic bomb. Robert Taylor's film UP AND BEYOND (flag waving inter-service propaganda, if you believe that you think the Army Air Corps, in the person of Paul W. Tibbits, commanded the entire show!), NBC produced ENOLA GAY closer to the mark), and the BBC-TV series, OPPENHEIMER, with Sam Waterston in the title role. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY have the same approach as the BBC series, but expand it; avoids Manhattan Project's "Gee Whiz" technology and focuses on human aspects; the personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide range of mythical but rather typical people who were part of it. With reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, featuring an academic academic from Ivory Tower. who struggles to relate his contributions as a physicist to his inclinations to see the world in a wider social and moral context ... only to have this struggle overcome by a primordial desire for personal power and glory. In the DAY AFTER THE TRINITY, it became clear that Oppenheimer saw himself as a "superior being" by virtue of his vast and ample intellectual capacity. In the end, it was the fall of Robert Oppenheimer; he saw himself as a kind of "Philosopher / King," a moral and intellectual superior who could (and rightfully should) "wisely" prescribe what was best for the rest of the world. development and deployment of nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, wisdom does not determine the actions of nations or the direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom does not confer temporal power. When you try to exert such non-existent power (as Oppie discovered when opposed to the development of "The Super", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who REALLY have the power. <br /> <br /> I found myself criticizing Schultz's character in one way; Oppie exposes TOO up close and personal to the Manhattan Project, despite the doubts and fears that tore at his intellectual base. The real Oppenheimer would have to take a different approach; in the beginning, he would have to come to firm resolution that the project would result in a greater good. The ugliness it produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to achieve this final good, and should be ignored ... at least until the end of the project, when there was leisure to evaluate the gains and losses. Oppie clearly did so, and resulted in his controversial postwar statements that science already knew about sin, and that was a knowledge he could never lose. As the project went on, such considerations should be cast aside if he wanted to maintain his sanity. Because of this ambiguity, Schultz's character is a weak, frightened boy who could never have served as "Rapid Breaking Coordinator," as Oppenheimer did not officially nicknamed his post. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman's interpretation of Gen. Leslie R. Groves is fascinating, and a brave performance if possibly a LITTLE BIT on top. <br /> <br /> Groves was a civil engineer by training, but first of all he was a SOLDIER and a general to boot! He is accustomed to DEMAND that things go his way ... intensely driven, a dirty, spoiled-mouth child who makes a tantrum at the drop of a hat, who reveres his country and is not too proud to fall on his knees and pray. In other words, much like REAL (ie, not civil engineer) soldiers, otherwise known as George Patton! Grove's MISSION not only comes first, it's your only consideration ... feelings and egos be doomed except for your own, of course! Groves could not admit it, but he knew full well that he needed Oppenheimer; military post meant NOTHING in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds he had to assemble. <br /> <br /> Once again ... I have to criticize the script about this, and for the same reason. <br /> <br /> Actually, Groves already owned Oppie; if he did not, Oppie would never have been chosen for the job in the first place. The story speaks of MANY cases where other scientists, some as stellar as Oppenheimer, simply moved away from Groves' recruiting efforts. At one point Groves was so desperate that he proposed drafting the physicists he needed! Groves's attempts at maneuvering and controlling Oppie were unnecessary ... they only exist here as a dramatic device that really helps make the film's atmosphere quite ugly. <br /> <br /> Kusak's "Michael Merriman" is a composition of several real characters, but they are from a different time period. Several research accidents similar to the one described occurred in the search for POSTWAR weapons. Merriman's radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film, but that is, IMHO, necessary and quite accurate. People with weak stomachs will have difficulty dealing with the hospital sequences; they are all very real. <br /> <br /> The main idea that appears, but not enough, IMHO, is the great truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed up were young, idealistic and naive, as well as talented. Most were on their first out-of-campus tour. For them, the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale, without budget constraints or "excessive" bureaucratic oversight. <br /> <br /> It was not only his brilliance, but his youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb. <br /> <br /> There's a lot here to make the observer uncomfortable with the movie. Likewise, if you filter out Hollywood BS (there's not much of it really), this is probably a fairly accurate view of the interior of the Manhattan Project.
