The reason I think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion. From the script and the fabulous acting, you can tell that there is a story behind all the feelings that exist. You understand why the characters take certain actions and why they do not do the others. You can feel sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for all at once. You see humanity at its best and worst. You can relate to the characters because although you have never been in your exact situations before you see qualities and falls in them that you see in yourself. To some extent, this kind of movie keeps you thinking, but in the end this explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but also in the characters. I'm going to say that I've never cried so much in my life or taken so much from something. I beg you to watch this movie and bring meaning to the heart. That there is only one true thing and that is ... love.
