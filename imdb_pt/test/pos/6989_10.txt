Oh my gosh! This was one of the best science fiction films I've ever seen, and frankly I can not stand science fiction movies. <br /> <br /> Vin Diesel and his co-workers made this movie really fun !! <br /> <br /> I must also say that Vin Diesel is by far the sexiest and most talented male actor I have ever seen. Keep it up Vin! you are doing very well !! As for all other good works. I thought drama and suspense kept viewers really intrigued. again, great work to all and I'm rooting for you Vin. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> Alexandra
