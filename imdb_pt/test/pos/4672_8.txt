The movie is really good, does not use violence or sex, etc. to sell like other movies, but uses a really decent storyline (based on the original by Michael Caine) and some great actors to make a fun and action-packed movie. which I really enjoyed. One thing that made me enjoy this movie even more was that there were some actors that I really like, like Edward Norton (whom I last saw in the 26th hour, which I also liked), Jason Statham (transporter, too) and Seth Green , which I think is great, his role as Shawn Fanning's roommate, dubbed "The Napster," is hilarious and his hacking skills play a major role in the main theft, which revolves around a major traffic jam in Los Angeles. The car chases are really decent and the high tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive. I did not see the original, so I really can not compare it, but I really enjoyed it and I recommend this movie for everyone, it's not a movie where you need to like that specific genre, it will please everyone I felt good after that film, had a very good ending and was a lot of fun to watch. I give 8/10. Go watch!
