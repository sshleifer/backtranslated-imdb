The movie is about a girl who does not go to a fire just because she's sitting that night. Nothing strange about that, right? Until ... The phone rings. Until ... The phone rings again. And again ... And again. These are not some stupid calls. That's for real. If you want to see how the girl reacts, just watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Great atmosphere full of scary sounds. Very well executed by the young Camilla Belle, who got the lead role. I see in her a great potential to become a good actress. This is more than just a decent thriller, I have no idea why it is so underrated. Anyway, in my opinion this movie deserves more than just 4/10. 24% of all voters rated the movie as 1. Be serious, people. You could not have a better thriller for a title like that.
