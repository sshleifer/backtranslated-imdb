Images control this movie. The characters, though interesting, end up in the background. The first scene I remember is a black and white framed photo of the ocean, which then opens to full screen and colors. The bubbling of water gives way to a small casket that breaks the surface. The theme of the film here, being that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of the living. <br /> <br /> Water as a supreme consciousness, as a tool of God, is used here to force people to put their "houses" in order (Judgment Day). The dead should be counted and taken to a better place. Whatever has been left unsolved or unstable will be washed. There is no attachment to the past, a hidden reminder of what it was. <br /> <br /> This movie was compared to O, Brother Where Art Thou, and the threat of water and its use as a cleaning force is similar to this movie. What is different about this film is that the coming of water is knowable and then, again, the emphasis is on what needs to be done with the here and now. <br /> <br /> I agree that some of the scenes are reminiscent of a David Lynch's work. Take, for example, the dining segment with the deep and androgynous voice waitress. You get the same surreal feel of the scenario and strange character as you do with the speaker back in the Fire Starter scene. The difference is that Lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological processes of a problematic character, while this film seems to use surreal elements to create a moral message. Men in black suits can not have what they want - they need to be patient and accept what's available.
