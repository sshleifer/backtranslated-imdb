If you are a fan of Jackass, Viva La Bam or CKY videos, then you already know what you are looking for. But this is one of those rare events when a sequel is better than the original! And the man makes this movie pack an average low blow. But I mean that in a good way. It's the same kind of madness that defies death and grieves us, that we all know and love and expect from Bam, Knoxville and company. But this time with more laughter than ever! With Johnny Knoxville's insensitive tolerance for pain, Bam Margera's love for harassing his friends / family, and Steve-O's rude factor, you have a funny movie. The bar for the general stunts, chaos and chaos of the Jackass crew was lifted. Jackass 3? Doubtful, because it is almost impossible to improve perfection.
