This is a funny movie, there are not many of those. OK, the plot is a little disturbing, but very original. A teenager trying to stay with his dad because he is not around and almost sends him to jail because she lies to impress an older boy, how could that not be funny? Also, it's not the typical movie with teenagers. First remake that I saw, which is better than the original, the only problem with both: Gerard Depardieu. With another actor this would be a perfect 10 because he throws all the rolls in the same way, sucks. Another problem is that all women melt on him, this is not remotely believable, he is not attractive !, y had a rubber troll that was cuter than him, come on!
