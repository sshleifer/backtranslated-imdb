What makes watching and reviewing films a pleasure is when, once in a while, when you least expect it, a movie like The Cell shows up and takes off your socks! This movie is a superb horror that has everything you could want when you want to be scared of your nonsense. Without getting into the story, all I'm going to say is that it has a great start, middle and end, which keeps you on the tip of your seat while transfixed with the incredible special effects. The acting is good without being exceptional, but it does not matter because the subject and the way it is put on the big screen makes this one of the best horror movies I have seen for a long time. It's one of those movies you imagine starting as a novel, but saying that the credits do not look like an adaptation, so much credit should be given to Mark Protosovich, the writer. 9 out of 10.
