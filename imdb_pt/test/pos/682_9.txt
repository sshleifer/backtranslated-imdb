Beware, My Lovely is an experimental studio movie from the early fifties and was directed by a man, Harry Horner, best known for his stage projects. Robert Ryan plays a handyman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her. The problem is he's a psychopathic killer and he does not know that. Miss Lupine is an empathic soul and tries to persuade Ryan to do little. He is not the kind of man that compassion could help or heal. So we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well but one of them can not do well because there is something wrong with it. He suffers periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence, which he later forgets. <br /> <br /> Essentially the effect that Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and his prey, or in another sense a sadist. The public soon discovers that Ryan is a mad killer, but it takes a lot of time for Lupino. So we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupine do everything in her power to "win" Ryan, to make things work, to do the work, to move on with life. But going on with things is not in Ryan's composition, since he is incapable anyway, except for the rudimentary forms of normality, and once there is an opening, his paranoia is confirmed. As a study on mental illness, the film is not very impressive. What is superlative is to show the effect of major mental illnesses, with dangerous psychopathology in the mixture, and their effect on a normal person. In that regard, the film is realistic and compassionate, though relentlessly logical, as we know that Lupino can not "fix" Ryan, but we want him to. The result is that if one is willing, one can get extremely emotionally involved with this film, if one can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure. <br /> <br /> Horner shows us, gradually, the layout of the film. Lupine house, a gothic monstrosity that never looks like a house. We familiarize ourselves with staircase, kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which ones can not.
