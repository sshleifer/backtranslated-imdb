I like Dylan Moran from his work on Black Books, although I find some of his stand-up to be really indulgent in terms of long confusing gaps ... however I was intrigued to see this movie starring him and Michael Caine and curiosity the best of me. <br /> <br /> I was shocked. <br /> <br /> Dylan's vocal range and characterization of the different people he was playing in the movie were absolutely perfect, something beyond the skills of a mere stand-up comedian and really truly on a par with alec guinness, wounded john and the other great, truly he was skilled in his interpretation. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine was a very convincing prima donna and the British film standard The device of having an early child on hand to be overly wise and withered worked - the only aspect I really did not like was the unbelievable dash of the chemistry between Dolores and the tough man of the cockney gangsta played by Dylan. <br /> Moreover, it was great. <br /> <br /> I also like the non-police end where it ended happily forever, but with MC being beaten. Okay, it's not exactly what's being stuck for your goolies and gut kisses (which is what a real crime boss would do to you if you stole 50,000 pounds from them), but it showed at least a small measure of reality in the story. <br /> I liked the movie, and I would recommend it to anyone but I would also warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a little slow. If you insist, everything will come back. <br /> <br /> And with regard to oath, they are in Ireland. It would not be real any other way.
