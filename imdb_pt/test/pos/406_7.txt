You have to have a lot of patience to watch a movie with such simple and bland phrases that you wonder about the reason for all this upheaval when Whistling in the Dark opened for such an enthusiastic public greeting in the 1940s. On top of a few frail lines and common jokes, the plot is as absurd as the tales that The Fox (Red Skelton) tells its radio audience. You have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it. But then, this is how the comedy is unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But - if you're a true Red Skelton fan and enjoy a retrospective of how comedies were made in the 1940s - you can at least Enjoy the gracious cast that supports you. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Gray do well as their love interest and Conrad Veidt, as always, makes an interesting villain. One of his most entertaining moments is his reaction to Skelton, explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans. "I never knew that," he reflects, impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced. <br /> <br /> All in all, typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the jokes as they are. It is not always easy for a discreet viewer, since many of them simply fall from one side to the other, as many comedies of that time do, because the novelty of gags and one liners simply disappeared.
