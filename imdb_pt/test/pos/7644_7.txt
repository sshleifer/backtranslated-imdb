I watched this movie on HBO and had a great time. <br /> <br /> The director did a great job. I found myself totally absorbed in this movie once it started. The performance of Norman Reedus is legal. I expect more of his creepy movies. <br /> <br /> I was so absorbed that sometimes I wanted to get a gun from Norman and shoot that snake girl. He. I like the movies when innocent girls play with men with great cunning. The ending was what I wanted :)) <br /> <br /> This movie is full of twists and turns. You expect this, but something else happens. At first, those massive images cut out were really painful to the eyes. <br /> <br /> Although it was not shown when Norman Reedus changed the currency notes? Or am I standing in the refrigerator? :)
