Labeling this movie as a "lesbian love story" is as accurate as calling Pride and Prejudice a "direct love story." There's more to it than that. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character is a lesbian, but her story is classic: bildungsroman, a journey from childhood to adulthood, from sexual innocence to maturity, from personal blindness to self-discovery. There is a stylistic element of field in the direction of the film, but it is not an obstacle; instead, it serves to underline the staged and dramatic parts of the main character's life. <br /> <br /> Those who know Anna Chancellor of the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice will surely be surprised by it here. Rachael Stirling is stellar as the main character Nan, and Keeley Hawes is all wide-eyed goodness as her lover Kitty Butler. Chancellor may have the featured role, that is, in addition to Sally Hawkins, who plays Zena Butler. This film is not for the faint of heart, but it's not a pro-gay propaganda either. It's a real story, with real comedy and drama, an engaging storyline with compelling characters and worth watching.
