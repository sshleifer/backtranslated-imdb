A baron of evil land is holding water for a group of farmers in order to try to take their properties for pennies on the dollar. Along comes Singin 'Sandy Saunders (John Wayne), who saves the day for Gabby Hayes and his daughter, going disguised as the villain's newest gunman. <br /> <br /> The first of Wayne's sixteen films for Lone Star / Monogram Pictures, this tries to cast him as a cowboy singing, only with a voice obviously with red lips. The title card highlights your character as "Sandy's Singin", prompting someone to believe that this was made to be the first in a proposed series! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's ridiculous, but it's also really fun to see Wayne singing songs and firing weapons, especially when he does a bit ditty before shooting with the armed man Earl Dwire. Riders Of Destiny features a rare villainous role for Al "Fuzzy" St. John, who clowns around as much with the bad guys as he did a heroic companion, walking alongside Buster Crabbe and Lash LaRue.
