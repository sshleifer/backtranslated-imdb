I got this movie late night on TV, and was expecting a low-budget "masterpiece", I was surprised by a decent movie. Angelina Jolie's unique acting ability (or should I say, lack her?) Makes her perfect as an android, and the other actors, albeit terribly average, at least are not terrible. <br /> <br /> There is a plot; a very intricate plot involving conspiracies and the length a couple (a human, an android) will pursue his illegal romance with a "big brother" figure and an android killer in the mix. The production and sets, too, were much better than I expected. I have not seen the original Cyborg, so I can not compare it with much more; granted this movie is not Blade Runner, but as a guilty pleasure futuristic late at night, it's worth a watch.
