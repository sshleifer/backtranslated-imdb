Emilio Estevez, in fact, directed a good movie - who would think? I went through two previous films that Estevez directed - "Wisdom" (with then girlfriend Demi Moore) and "Men at Work" (with brother Charlie Sheen). They are bad movies - misinterpreted, directed, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor, but lousy as a director. I turned it into pure curiosity - he had a great cast and I had nothing else to do. Damned if he did not pull me in. <br /> <br /> This concerns Estevez returning from Vietnam to the home permanently marked by what happened there. His parents (Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen) and their sister (Kimberly Williams) try to reach him, but they can not. Something in Vietnam affected him deeply ... and he's about to explode ... A little long, but still very good. Much of the material is familiar, but the cast is so good that it makes it look brand new. Estevez is good, Sheen is great (and Estevez's real life father), Williams is playing and Bates is simply extraordinary - trying to keep the family together. It all leads to a powerful end that really surprised me. <br /> <br /> Worth catching. <br /> <br />
