This movie was very good, not great, but very good. It is based on a one man play by Ruben Santiago Hudson .. yes he played most of the plays. On paper it looks like a cast of stunts. Yeah, let's get all the black Hollywood guys together and put them in a movie. Halle Berry even produced. The only name I did not see was Oprah, thank God it would probably end up being like a Hallmark movie. Instead, this movie was not a sentimental mess. It was thrilling, but not untrue, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband, Pauline and the writer in question. The film revolved around the nanny universe, Mrs. Bill Crosby and how she lifted the writer and led the people. Now being a tired New Yorker when he said he got sick and old people and then we see them going to a mental institution to get a man, I'm thinking it looks like the sister has a medicare scheme going on. Getting people jobs and taking the medicare / caid checks But no, she explains to Lou Gosset that she only wants $ 25 a week and did not want the money ahead of time. I think this part was put into the movie just for us to upset New Yorkers, so we know she's not fooling the poor. (G) It was written by a New Yorker so he knows the deal (g) .. She almost looks angelic and looking through the eyes of little boys I can see why. She is married to a man who is 17 years younger and revolves around her. Terrence Howard was born to play this kind of play. He was good, but I would like to see him playing something different. Markerson, who plays Nanny, is also very good. But for some reason the person who stood out for me was a small role played by Jeffery Wright. Where's the man's Oscar? He has already won an Emmy and a Tony. He was in Shaft and he stole the movie. I did not even know who he was in this movie. He is a chameleon never the same. I've never seen him play a bad part yet. This was a 5 minute paper and he managed to make me laugh and cry. I've revealed the scene a few times ... once because I did not know who it was. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I saw her in papers before cheaper things. But she's so good here. I really know people who act like her. So it was very real to me that Macy Gray, who had one of the larger parts, was also very good. I was very happy they did not kill the nanny. I thought she was a lost case at the beginning of the movie. But she was able to go home and start her old routine of caring for people. There are women like this in most of our lives. People we can meet or even live. Thank God for them, I do not know how they do it all the time. I have a friend who lost 2 children and went through many things, but whenever I feel selfish I feel sorry for myself, I call her and she always makes me feel good. This film is a tribute to all these people. I just wanted them to tell us what happened to some of the characters like the armed man, Paulines boyfriend who is played by one of my favorite actors in The Wire, Omar, HBO's Rosie Perez, and Richard the lesbian and Delroy Beautiful. arm man, he was hypnotizing in another small role.
