Royal Rumble has traditionally been one of my favorite events, and I've been a wrestling fan for a few years now. The other shows may have better matches, but I always found the real match full of excitement. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the winners of any match, since I do not see It's fair to ruin the results in a review. I will comment on their quality. <br /> <br /> We have the pattern of four matches, and then the big rumble event. Two from Smackdown and two from Raw. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Edge open for Raw. This proves to be a good game of two talented guys. This is a correspondence I would recommend watching. It is difficult to summarize without delivering the winner. <br /> <br /> Next, we have the usual Undertaker against some big, nasty monster, whoever he is. Giant Gonzales, Yokozuna, Kamala ... well, this time it's Heidenreich. It is also a coffin match. Typical Undertaker Rate. See if you are a fan. I have to admit that I am, purely by the entertainment factor. It can hardly be considered as a classic wrestling game. <br /> <br /> The next two games are the title matches. For once, Smackdown manages to beat Raw. His title fight is very exciting and enjoyable, but with an anti-climax and disappointment to end it. The departure of Raw is a very boring and boring subject, which is a shame, since I'm a fan of both guys involved. <br /> <br/> Now the main reason why I love the event, the noise. It's very good this year. Arriving at the event we all had a pretty good idea of ​​who could win, and this might not be a big surprise, but, it's very enjoyable. There are the many common ways people are eliminated. There is the symbolic face that does not reach the ring, the participant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished, and someone is eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant. It has its usual ups and downs, and I loved the ending, in particular the entry of Vince McMahon. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this show. Not WWE at its best, but still good. Add to your collection.
