I gave this movie a 10 simply because of my obsession with Ingrid Bergman :) lol. I really think she was the best actress who has ever graced this land with her talent and all her movies are absolutely wonderful (even when they are horrible) because she is in them. If it were not for her and Vivien Leigh (as she had originally been wanted, I heard), I would have given a 9.0 simply because I love Viv, but probably not as much as I love Ingrid. And any other actress would have made maybe a 6. It's a good story, two crazy people falling in love in a society where it's bad to be bad. It reminds me a little of GWTW, except tied with a more intellectual attitude. Gary Cooper is very handsome as usual and of course his voice never changes the whole movie but hey Ingrid makes him look so incredible and bold and 20 times hotter than he probably should be.
