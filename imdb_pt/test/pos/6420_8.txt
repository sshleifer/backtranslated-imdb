In a bizarre experiment, an astronaut is abandoned on the moon while Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a troublesome translator living in Italy, wakes up from a nightmare about a lunar mission mixed with an old movie that scared her as a child. She also has no recollection of the last three days, except for a torn picture of the Garma hotel she finds in her apartment. Fired from her job, Alice goes to the resort island to try to piece together the mystery ... Often presented as a giallo due to her director (Luigi Bazzoni, FIFTH CORDON) and the presence of Evelyn . Stewart, Nicoletta Elmi and Klaus Kinski, PEGADAS is, in fact, a psycho-impulsive deliberately stimulated with touches of science fiction. Blurring the distinction between dream, reality, memory and films, the disturbing story is beautifully photographed by Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro with a soundtrack by Nicola Piovani. It also combines elements from films as diverse as MACANDO SOLARI, by Armando Crispino, and DEATH IN VENICE, by Lucino Visconti, in their depiction of alienation, isolation, hallucination and perhaps madness. The Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan, on screen all the time, makes a reduction of Carol Hammond in LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN, by Lucio Fulci, as Alice, a young woman involved in a mystery that makes her question its sanity. The places mirror Alice's unsteady state of mind; the out-of-season island of Garma, with its Arab influence and ancient ruins, is a lonely place, almost mystical, unwilling to give up its secrets. Evelyn Stewart has a bit in the beginning as a concerned friend Nicoletta Elmi and Oscar winner Lila Kedrova are hotel guests, Peter McEnery plays a handsome biologist trying to help Bolkan, and the ever-intense Klaus Kinski is "Blackmann" in the film - in-movie, "Footprints on the Moon". <br /> <br /> FOOTPRINT is a classic case of "Guaranteed 100% Euro-strange", but not for everyone. There is only one murder to the end, but you will not see the film approaching.
