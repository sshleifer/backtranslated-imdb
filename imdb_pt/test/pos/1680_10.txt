Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) may, on the surface, be described as a French variation of John Huston's seminal assault film, Asphalt Jungle (1950). The difference between the two films is Rififi (1955) pays a little more attention to the sequel to the theft. In addition, the police are not involved in the aftermath of the robbery at Rififi as much as at Asphalt Jungle. In the end, Rififi (1955) is, in my opinion, a slightly better movie than Asphalt Jungle (1950). Remarkable noir painting that defines the French cinema of the 1950s. Spartacus (1960) may have been the one who overthrew the infamous blacklist, but in my opinion Rififi (1955) was the film that began to dismember cinema. Hollywood's unbreakable blacklist. First film in five years for Jules Dassin, who was a victim of the McCarthy communist hunt from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. He received some kind of retribution when Rififi (1955) became a hit in France and Europe. So defying the poisoned Hollywood blacklist in an important way that probably inspired others to do the same. Rififi (1955) is the most important film of Dassin's career because he not only restored his name but also gave him a second chance to make films. <br /> <br /> Jules Dassin gave the film world and its ever-growing audiences masterpieces of influential proportions. His handling of the material is exceptional and the direction of the actors is impeccable. Build tense situations with precise skill. Dassin took a complete turn in the genre Film Noir directing his best and last Noir, Rififi (1955). It marked the end of Dassin's period in cinema when he was involved in taking pictures of Noir. <br /> <br /> Rififi (1955) is the number one film in an arsenal of more than thirty films for director Jules Dassin. A masterpiece in acting, cinematography, direction, editing and writing. It's not a movie to leave your place for a minute because there is always something memorable going on. As brilliant as anything from Jean Pierre Melville, who was a master of this type of film. Masterpieces such as Rififi (1955) are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in film history. <br /> <br /> The only fascinating aspect of Rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up part of the duration of 118 minutes. The main characters plan and execute jewel theft in the same way a movie director prepares for the pre-production, production, and post-production of a movie. It shows how difficult it is to steal jewelry in Rififi (1955) and why very few would do something similar. The fact that the scene hardly restrains a mess like in other assault films turns that scene into something even bigger. Up close, one can get to have a perfect sequence in a movie. <br /> <br /> The lack of unnatural sound in the historical sequence of minute theft puts you in a realm of absolute realism. Any dialogue or music could ruin any suspense and tension that the director is trying to create. The use of natural sound makes the burglary a rewarding experience of watching movies. Now, filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of the lack of confidence in the patience of a videographer. It maintains a level of consistency that never diminishes. <br /> <br /> Maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the sequence of the assault perfect. The director gets suspense in the wake of assaults that are rarely matched in most burglary scenes. Jean Servais and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with some discreet performance. Putting suspense on the stage is a task that few are able to do. The stealing sequence of Rififi (1955) reaches a hitchcockiano level of suspense and tension. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers in the years following Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) were influenced, if not inspired by it. An influential filmmaker was Jean Pierre Melville (original choice for the director of Rififi), who used variations of the sequence of the assault in Le Doulos (1961), and Le Cercle Rouge (1970). Another influential filmmaker was Stanley Kubrick, who made a film with similar themes in The Killing (1956). In addition, Quentin Tarantino whose debut, Reservoir Dogs (1992), was inspired by this film. Other influential film directors are John Woo, Michael Mann, Paul Schrader, Ringo Lam, etc. Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) is comparable to Bob Le Flambeur (1955) in many respects . One of them, Jules Dassin and Jean Pierre Melville, directed innovative films in Rififi (1955) and Bob le Flambeur (1955). Two, each film involves a criminal who plans and performs a bold assault. Three, Bob le Flambeur and Rififi end up fatalistically. Four, each film shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as the movie's big names. <br /> <br /> Part of the charm of Rififi are the colorful characters who surround the story, such as Tony le Stephanois, Jo le Suedois, Mario Farrati, and Cesar le Milanais. Most violence is implicit, but effectively brutal. The main characters, led by Tony le Stephanois, follow a strong code of outdated honor, remembering Sam Peckinpah and John Woo. Jean Servais becomes the role of Tony le Stephanois with his cynical appearance and tired appearance. Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) became one of my favorites by the time I saw him on the big screen from start to finish.
