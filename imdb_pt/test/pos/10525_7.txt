This intriguing movie lost (written by Terence Malick) stars Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest as two crazy Southern brothers on a mission to open a seafood restaurant. Margot Kidder has never been prettier and Forrest should have been nominated. Originally titled The Dion Brothers, this movie takes a violent ending is a pure joy! <br /> <br /> Where is this movie? I have been searching for 30 years. Keach was still great at the time and I'm surprised he has no cult followers (maybe yes). These guys are a crack-up with more ambition than brains, but totally loving guys!. A 7 out of 10. If you can dig it up somewhere, you'll have fun.
