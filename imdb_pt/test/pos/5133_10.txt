I must confess, I was surprised at how good this movie was when I first watched it. I had planned to see him in theaters over the summer, but I found it unpleasantly that he was gone. So I hoped he'd been removed from the theaters because it was bad. So today, I rented and watched and enjoyed it a lot. The speed with which events were occurring was questionable, could have been a little longer. I found it to be very true to the book, however, it left out some crucial parts: the true name of Mullet Finger, etc. I felt like I had not read the book, I would not have really understood what was going on. The acting was very good, another thing I expected to be poor, however the police officer, sorry, I can not remember the name of the actor, could have done a little better. After all, I thought this would be a really fun movie and would recommend it to all audiences!
