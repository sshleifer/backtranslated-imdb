Haha, what a great movie! Wayne Crawford attacks again, or rather, this was his first major attack, a delirious and entertaining kitsch energy ball maniac disguised as a psychopathic killer movie. In fact, it's a ** brilliant ** satire on post-hippie American culture in a country overflying, although the film has been filmed independently in Miami. It defies any type of convention device or studio-oriented plot that I can think of: SOMETIMES, TIA MARTHA DOES DIFFICULT THINGS may not be a technically competent film, but it's a small slice of American culture, made low cost by people who were Honest, ambitious, imaginative and had balls made of steel. It took courage, nerves and cunning to make this movie, which surprisingly seems to have stood the test of time. This movie is fresh, vital, alive, unforgettable and charmingly strange enough to recommend to anyone with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I unearthed it last year, during a period of time when I was fascinated by "star" Wayne Crawford (here advertised under the pseudonym of Scott Lawrence), a conductor of what can only be called regional film production, usually Class B. He is a writer, producer, director and actor, all in one, probably best known for the '80s, apocalyptic favorite NIGHT OF THE COMET. Here he plays Stanley, his pants wearing half a pair of truly wonderful characters, apparently homosexual killers, after knocking down a lady in Baltimore for his jewelry. Unknown screen legend Abe Zwick is completely convincing as Paul, who introduces himself as Stanley's Aunt Martha, the brain of the plot that persuaded Stanley to think that he committed a murder to secure his loyalty. Martha looks as feminine as the sailors at SOUTH PACIFIC's supportive coral in her coconut bikinis, but somehow no one seems to notice - or care? - that she is a he, has no visible means of income, seems to spend all day worrying about where Stanley is, and runs through the neighborhood in his bathrobe carrying a butcher's knife. Only in America ... <br /> <br /> As the movie begins, the two have just arrived in Florida and settle into what looks like the old house of Ward Cleaver, a TV house that is so lit up and projected clich√© like being surreal. During a memorable scene, Martha and an unwanted guest sit on the couch, talk about problems and drink Budweiser cans in what is one of the most mesmerizing and subversive sequences I have ever seen outside of a John Waters movie. Then there's Stanley, always messing around, since he's a hippie-covered mop with a patchwork quilt in his waistcoat who drives a psychedelic painted van that's as subtle as the Batmobile, drinks his milk straight out of the box, snorts drugs with blond bimbos and accumulating donuts in an old box of cigars for a quick snack. Opposites attract, I think. <br /> <br /> But Stanley also has one thing about not liking when the girls with whom he gets stoned try to take off his pants, and it always seems to be Aunt Martha's to get him out of the problem that inevitably ensues. The bodies pile up, an intrusive junkie blackmails them to use his house as a failure, Stanley's birthday cake is crushed, and everyone finds themselves at the local pizzeria before going to the wooden shed on the back property for a party of hookah where the girls dance in their underwear. Things get out of control when one of the neighbors tries to get too close to Martha, who naturally prefers to keep people at bay when they rudely invite themselves to a good conversation. And this is a woman who carries not just a butcher knife, but a loaded on her slide. Eventually, the strange pair finds themselves stuck in a body, a baby and a place to go, and ends up taking refuge in an abandoned movie studio where the technical team has undoubtedly borrowed the equipment used to make the film . I just hope they politely asked for permission first and cleaned up after themselves. One word, of course, must be said about the relationship of Stanley and Martha / Paul, since dancing on the fact that the two are at least suggested to be a homosexual couple would lose the main essence of the plot. We never see the two become intimate and, in fact, even if Stanley ironically refers to being "balled" in a scene, their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual. Certainly not a "gay" movie, with abundant feminine nudity and an air of misogyny of the 70's that also can not be denied. Stanley and Paul never consummated their implicit sexuality on screen, although the film certainly had the courage to do so if it were important. It's not, the story is not about their sex, it's about the bond they share and how strange it is. Not being gay, but being the distinct individuals they are, they are two of the strangest movie creations that have ever inhabited my TV set. <br /> <br /> The movie is unique. It was made for only a few thousand dollars in what appeared to be borrowed studio sets, occasional location work, and a couple of public places that they managed to put a film crew on when no one was looking. The dialogue is completely bizarre, mundane and deliciously esoteric. It's a movie that will take you by surprise, not everyone will like it, but for those with a taste for horror American horror / thrillers as the night god shouted, help me! I AM OWNED, BLOOD AND INCOME AND CHILDREN SHOULD NOT PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS, you have a winner here. 8/10: Normally I would say something like "It deserves a DVD restoration", but somehow I think it would ruin the film's sticky environment. And Wayne Crawford, sir, sir.
