Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenager who is vacationing in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy saves Serafine Pigot (the beautiful Julie Delpy) from committing suicide on the Tour Eiffel and has a crush on her. He does not know she's a werewolf. They go to a clandestine party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is injured and becomes a werewolf. He is told that the only way to become normal again is to kill the werewolf who attacked him and devoured his heart. This movie is a violent black humor movie. The special effects and soundtrack are excellent, highlighting the Bush band's music. I do not know why some readers compare this movie with the masterpiece "An American Werewolf in London". The stories have nothing in common (only an American teenager, werewolves and a city in Europe). Highly suitable for fans of werewolf movies and black humor. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "An American Werewolf in Paris" ("An American Werewolf in Paris")
