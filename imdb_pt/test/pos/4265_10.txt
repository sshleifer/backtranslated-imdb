Sometimes the news media seems to be run by a group of brainless reporters. In so far as they just listen to each other and report what others report. <br /> <br /> This documentary shows what can be found if more effort is put into the task of reporting something. <br /> <br /> True journalism must be to give people different perspectives on things that happen, so that they have a good chance to create their own opinion. <br /> <br /> This documentary, along with leading media reports, will help you with this. At least for me, it provided much relevant information about the purpose / motivation behind the frequent world protests at different political levels.
