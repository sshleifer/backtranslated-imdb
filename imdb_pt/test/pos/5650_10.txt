Fires on The Plain (1959) **** You do not see movies like this anymore. 'Fires on the Plain' is an incredible representation of the life of the soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army. Kon Ichikawa's masterpiece follows Tamura, a soldier with Tuberculosis, as he wanders through the Philippine landscape in the last year of the war. He is sent to the hospital by his commanding officer only to receive refused treatment and is therefore sent back. Your CO tells him to go back and if they refuse him again, his last order is to kill himself with his grenade. He is refused again, but finds himself with a bunch of invaders sitting outside the hospital. The next day they are bombed by American troops and Tamura flees, opting not to kill himself, and from there he wanders from one place to another trying to reach Palompon. He discovers that some men have eaten human flesh to survive, while others exchange as much tobacco as possible for anything they can get back. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with a silent sense of despair and desolation, with a touch of insanity. All we see are skin and bone, covered in dirt using ragged, ragged rags. Ichikawa uses his camera to capture some beautiful pictures of the destroyed landscape and the Japanese soldiers that run through it. Kon Ichikawa was famous in Japan for doing many comedies and satires, and there are times in Fires on the Plain that are quite hilarious. Take, for example, a picture of what looks like a dead man lying on his stomach in a puddle of water; a soldier walks but asks himself out loud if this is how it will all end, to which the man takes his head off the water and replies "what was that?" and then drops his face deeper into the pool than before. Another hilarious sequence involves a man finding a pair of boots along the trail. He takes the boots, replacing them with the old ones. Another man passes by and sees that pair of boots and trades for his old boots. The scene continues until finally Tamura finds the change point and examines the boots with almost no single one. He looks carefully at his and those on the ground, and deciding that the two are mutilated, he removes his and goes barefoot. The film is full of incredible scenes, one after the other. Like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ichikawa knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and impressive photos. There are many stunning photos of men on arid and empty plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on broken ground. There is another incredible scene where dozens of Japanese soldiers try to cross a road guarded by Yanks in the middle of the night, all crawling on their hands and knees as the camera watches from above. <br /> <br /> The film is named after the smoke columns that rise from the fires on the plains seen throughout the film. They represent to soldiers a little more common life; the lives of Japanese farmers at home burning corn husks. Their lighthouses of hope for normal life, however, are in hostile hands. <br /> <br /> The film caused a stir in its day with its graphic content. Much emphasis is placed on the horror of war, not only with the enemy, but within its ranks and itself. Kon Ichikawa's Fires on the Plains is an incredibly authentic, touching and somewhat disturbing portrait of the horror of the men who make up the lower echelons of the Imperial Army. The Letters of Iwo Jima by Clint Eastwood, although a very good film, does not even come close to realizing the horror of the war portrayed in Fires on the Plain. (Eastwood was undoubtedly influenced by the film, as he claims to be a fan of classic Japanese films.) Many war films show that war is a hell of a thing through the eyes of the victors. In Fires on the Plain, we show that war is even more hellish when you're losing <br /> <br /> 4/4
