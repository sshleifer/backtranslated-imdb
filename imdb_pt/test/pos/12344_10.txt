I thought One Dark Night was great! Deserves a 10! As for a statement made by a user, the dead were really zombies in this movie. A dead person brought back to life Is a zombie, regardless of method or cause of / to be brought back to life. The "zombies" in this movie are used to scare the girls, not to feed them, like traditional zombies. This film is a definitive star among the horror films of the '80s. Punctuation and atmosphere are very strange, and the audience is kept in suspense during scenes of the mausoleum. The acting is really compelling, with genuine expressions of horror in the sight of the undead. Although I enjoy all the zombie movies, this movie is a refreshing change from the typical movie "meat eater and zombie."
