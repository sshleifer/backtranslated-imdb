This set of DVDs is the complete 15-episode series of "Surface", a television show made by Universal in 2006. The total running time is 10 hours and 34 minutes, plus some bonus (deleted scenes, cast interviews , special effects). ). This was a relatively high budget show and much of the budget comes to the screen in the form of quality production design and special effects. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately 10+ hours is a long time and, as usually happens with this sort of thing, the overall quality begins to drop in later episodes. I found the first 7 episodes (Disks 1 and 2) extremely engaging and the rest a disappointment. "Surface" was produced, written and directed by Josh and Jonas Pate; and it seems they were surprised by the success of the series and unable to gather subsequent good enough material as they rushed to fill the order for additional episodes. It seems that additional writers were brought in later episodes because the characters (who were already the weaker part of the series) have no consistency with how they were played in the early episodes. The series has been canceled and although the last episode provides a conclusion, there are still many things hanging. <br /> <br /> It's basically a science fiction story about genetically engineered dragons; type of "Jurassic Park" and "ET" television mix. The story begins as a puzzle, as an unmanned Navy submarine is found drifting in the sea, boats on a Texas lake are sucked in by the whirlwind, a lighthouse in Africa is destroyed by a huge monster, etc. this wave there is a good amount of tension and suspense. A human element is introduced in the form of three American families, one on each coast and the other in the Gulf of Mexico. Laura Daughterty (Lake Bell) is a California marine biologist who discovers a strange creature emerging from an underwater thermal opening on the ocean floor. Rich Connelly (Jay R. Ferguson) is diving with his younger brother in the abyss when a similar creature drags his brother away (never to be seen again). <br /> <br /> Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins) is a Wilmington teenager who finds some strange eggs floating in the ocean. He takes one home where he bumps into an ET type dragon. He will spend the rest of the series trying to hide his strange pet from his family and local authorities. These dragons may look like lizards, but they are more like indestructible electric eels, firing electromagnetic pulses, causing lightning, emptying the sea of ​​fish and breeding like a flock of pink rabbits when they find a submerged outlet of boiling water. As long as it is uncertain whether or not they are intelligent, extraterrestrial or harmless, the premise is interesting. When you begin to suspect its origin, everything gets very tired and predictable. Jay R. Ferguson (an incredibly bad actor in David Hasselhoff's tradition) essentially plays Richard Dreyfuss's character "Close Encounters of the Third Degree," so you know that with a better actor and a better director , could have been an interesting character. You will grow and hate this character every episode. Unfortunately, what begins as three parallel story lines is soon condensed into two as Ferguson and Bell (a low-budget version of Sandra Bullock) are paired and involved in a series of moronic adventures almost as unlikely as the material "Jason Bourne "enters into itself. You expect holes in the plot and the need to suspend disbelief in this kind of show (which may even be a part of the fun), but your adventures are not only totally implausible, they are totally and utterly boring. There are three consecutive episodes that feature Ferguson and Bell together in a submersible that will leave you looking forward to the thrills of an all-day actuarial conference. <br /> <br /> Jenkins (Miles) is the strongest member of the cast and segments with his pet dragon (Nimrod) are often interspersed with Ferguson-Bell's annoying stuff to keep him watching. And these segments benefit from the presence of the beautiful Leighton Meester (of the recent fame of "Gossip Girl") like its sister Savannah. Apparently the producers realized the importance of this to their "adolescent" target audience and the only positive thing they did with the later episodes of the series was to present Linsey Godrey (Caitlin) as a "first love" interest by Miles. Just as Savannah's screen time slows down, Catlin gradually steps in. In retrospect, they needed a third plot to keep viewers engaged enough and it would have been better to limit adult melodrama in favor of a second group. young actors. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
