"Only the Valiant" qualifies as a good western. This cavalry of Gregory Peck against the Indian eater is a solemn suicidal mission without a trace of humor. Veteran director Gordon Douglas has done a dark and haunting epic outdoors with an ideal cast of tough guys under considerable pressure; even Lon Chaney, Jr., registers himself superbly as a mighty Arab soldier. Ostensibly, Colorado territory supporter Edmund H. North and screenwriter Harry Brown drew the script for filmmaker Charles Marquis Warren's stupid romance about a group of dogged riders isolated from any escape route Prevent redemptive killers from starting a devastating attack on defenseless white settlers. North and Brown prefer Warren's novel for the most part and last-minute revelation - when it seems like there's no way our heroes can survive another Native American attack - it's a hypocrisy! This turn of the century tale develops an effective claustrophobic feeling in the second half of the action. Douglas and company take studio sets and make them look convincing during the night hours. The black and white photograph of director of photography "Going My Way", Lionel Linden, imbues a dark look that accentuates his tension and atmosphere. Actor Michael Ansara, who later played the main villain in "The Guns of the Magnificent Seven," is extremely effective in a small role as the hated Indian leader Tucsos. <br /> <br /> "Only the Valiant" opens with over-voice narration by Army Joe Harmony. "This is my stamping ground.I am an army scout.I have had my work cut off for a long time.After this canyon there is the whole Pach√© nation.There is a plot of territory with the printhead Mountains they ran up the screen with a bottleneck.) They used to come out of the gorge killing everything in sight, then built a fort - Invincible Fort - and clogged the passage like a cork in a bottle.It was good for a while.But they ' "We are shown the burning remains of Fort Invincible with a dead man attached to a wall of palisade and a spear that protrudes from his belly. Captain Richard Lance (Gregory Peck of "12 O'Clock High") and his men booze and capture Tucsos (Michael Ansara), and Joe Harmony (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") wants to shoot him on the spot. Harmony points out that Tucsos is "the guy who started all this business". Captain Lance intervenes: "The Army does not shoot prisoners, Joe." Predictably, Harmony is amazed at this prospect. If you shoot him now, things will calm down.Without the Tucson shaking them, the rest of these Indians will be reasonable, as fast as they You can take him alive, you'll have every 'Pache in the territory that comes after him.We've had three years of it, you can stop it now.'As predictably, Captain Lance refuses to kill Tucson and Lance's decision to take the Indian back puts things into action. <br /> <br /> Colonel Drum (Herbert Heyes of Union Station) surprises Lance when he says he should have Tirei Tucson. As it is, they need to take the Tucsos to another post. Everyone, from soldiers to Joe Harmony, knows that taking Tucson to Fort Grant is asking to die. The Apaches are stationed in the mountains and the fort is under power. Meanwhile, we are introduced to Captain Eversham's daughter, Cathy Eversham (Barbara Payton of "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"), and young lieutenant William Holloway (Gig Young of "They Shoot Horses, Not They?") And they play a part in a major narrative complication. You see, Lance and Holloway both want to marry Cathy. Clearly, Cathy wants Lance. Colonel Drum refuses to let Lance take Tucson to Fort Grant because Drum can not spare Lance. Drum changes orders and Holloway receives the mission at the last minute and everyone is shocked. Lance never changed a request. In addition, Lance saw Cathy and Holloway kissing in public, and everyone thinks Lance reassigned Holloway out of jealousy. In fact, one officer remarks that rewriting orders is a possibility of rewriting the Bible. Predictably, Tucso escapes and the surviving soldiers and Harmony bring back a dead Holloway. <br /> <br /> Although Drum waits for a rescue column of 400 soldiers to arrive at any moment, Harmony points to Lance that Tucson will attack. Tucsos saw the fort and knows the lack of strength. Lance asks to take 6 or 7 men of his choice to the Fort Invincible man and prevent the Tucsos from riding a war party. The bottleneck in the mountains prevents the Indians from passing by; instead, they must go through one at a time. Lance believes his men can stop them until the distress column arrives. Drum gives him permission and Lance picks up the worst men. They all hate him and voluntarily kill him. <br /> <br /> "Only the Valiant" exemplifies the new military western race after World War II. This is not an enthusiastic and western John Ford cavalry. In fact, Lance's men want to kill him and this foreshadows the attitude of the troops during the Vietnam War, when they destroyed their own officers. Lance has the burden of everyone, except the few who know about the circumstances that led to the change of orders, putting Holloway in charge of the details. Black and white photography enhances the terrible nature of this Western. "Only the Valiant" equals one last Western position until the last minute. Allegedly, Peck hated this movie, but then this is not a western spit and polish in Technicolor. If anything, "Only the Valiant" lives up to its Warner Brothers origins. It's small but significant and it's dirty with loads of drama and nasty characters, practically a "Dirty Dozen" western.
