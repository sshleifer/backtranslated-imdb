I watch this movie without high expectations, I think everyone should do. It's a great TV series and of course we can not compare it to Gone With the Wind, but it's still good to watch. It's also strange to see a different Scarlett. Joanne Whalley does not play Scarlett with passion and fire like Vivien Leigh, but I think Scarlett has changed when she got older. Do not expect too much of this just watch but do not watch like: I think this would be awful.
