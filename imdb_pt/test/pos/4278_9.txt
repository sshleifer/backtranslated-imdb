I have to admit that I have a particular penchant for the humor and storytelling style of British films, although not all, of course, succeed. <br /> <br /> This movie made me think, and left me at the end with a discreet smile on my face. It is about developing character and relationships, truth and lies, and whether love sometimes simply is not enough. Some very discreet acting from all the participants, especially the two leaders, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. There was a lot of noise about Gosford Park, but with that piece I feel that Fellowes actually produced a better movie, although it was not a mainstream release. <br /> <br /> An intelligent mature story about real people who are undeniably flawed but also capable of acts of genuine graciousness.
