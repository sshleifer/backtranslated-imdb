I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I've always been passionate about Mrs. Hayworth's looks, so I thought I'd try. <br /> <br /> This may be the best showcase for the multi-talented Ms. Hayworth. She has never been prettier in a movie (with the possible exception of 'Gilda', where she is the sex symbol par excellence). Rita is more than assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy may be dated, but it's still a lot of fun. Kelly does one of her tour-de-force dances, dancing with the image of himself from a window. <br /> <br /> But Rita directs this whole movie. An excellent cast, with Otto Kruger and the always wonderful and wise Eve Arden, does not matter. <br /> <br /> Rita sings, Rita dances, all the time looking incredibly beautiful! The music may not have the classic, but the lyrics of most songs are pretty clever. <br /> <br /> I think this movie works better than 'Gilda', which I consider a flawed movie. To Mrs. Hayworth's credit, she also directs "Gilda," and Gilda runs any red-blooded madman. <br /> <br /> The film holds up well after all these years. Very sweet leg to the male audience is a good bonus!
