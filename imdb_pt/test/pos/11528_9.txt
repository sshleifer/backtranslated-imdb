One way or another, you can not get away from the basic message. The strong survive. Those who are psychically or emotionally sensitive, run away. They leave a hole in the lives of those who love them. A hole that is seen in its purpose as selfish. That's what Phoebe realizes in the end. Just before helping Wolf heal from his self-blame. She can accept the closure of her sister's disappearance. Beautiful European scenery. Much truth in this about idealism and addiction to the next great moment. For a moment, I thought of the Baader-Meinhoff gang that existed in the early 1970s. I liked this film because it reflected a time when I grew up.
