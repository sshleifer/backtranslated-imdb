This is a totally awesome movie! If you have not seen it yet, you should. Of course, the plot is slow to develop, the special effects are laughable, the acting is ridiculous and the action is poorly choreographed, but as the DDP wrestler would say; This is not a bad thing ... that's a good thing! Everything about this movie is hilarious, especially if you have the dubbed version, which has even worse actors. There are lots of laughter until the end, longing for the sequel, where the mummy struggles with women. So I give ten stars. Unless you are one of those "discriminated" and "smart" tasteful people, who only likes "high quality" movies of the highest caliber, I recommend this absolutely original movie!
