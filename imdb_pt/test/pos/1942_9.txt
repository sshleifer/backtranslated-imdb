Crispin Glovers' way of acting (and not just his) is tremendous. You really want to believe in him because his body language and performance fit the person perfectly. He gives Layne this extraordinary personality that makes this film cult. Like Feck, which role is very well done by Dennis Hopper. It's about choosing the right or wrong side, without thinking logically about the scene. Friendship is more important, and that is exactly what I think is what makes choices difficult. Rivers Edge allows you to experience this with serious tones and familiar mattresses. I really enjoyed watching. I saw this a month ago for the first time, but if you like a good 80's feel, this is the one you have to see. It's the same as I did not know it before.
