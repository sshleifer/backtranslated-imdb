When I first saw this movie, I thought it would be a terrible surprise, being directed by first-time director Liev Schrieber. What I've seen in the next 130 minutes has completely and completely changed my mind. Based on Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, Everything Is Illuminated tells the story of a young Jewish American collector (masterfully played by Elijah Wood) who is trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in World War II. He travels to Germany and enlisted the help of a 20-something translator, the club and his grandfather. This results in a rigid search across the country and they are determined to find what they are looking for. Filmed in some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world, Everything Is Illuminated offers tension between the translator and his grandfather and the help Jonathan needs to find in his prey. There is a lot of religious stuff too, since the grandfather refers to Jonathan as "the Jew." All in all, this is a movie that deals with meeting and loving family. I give this wonderful film, if not illuminated, a 10 out of 10.-Arjun
