One of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way the Tories or British American legalists are depicted, and the kind of glow given to their ardent support for King George III. In many ways, the American Revolution was definitely a family affair, as some of the more affluent colonial families were separated by it. If there is a strong criticism of this film, it is possible that the people in this story are a bit cooler than they were in real life. <br /> <br /> In some ways, Major Boulton's actions, played by Cornel Wilde, make him the less sympathetic member of the cast and flaw in the plot. It seems to range from being a prickly type of patriot to being a type of "anything to the cause". This film focuses heavily on the notions of personal honor and personal prestige that were an important social "norm" in that day and age. <br /> <br /> In its subtext, the fact that about twenty-five percent of the colonial population was decidedly pro-British is covered up as well. But the strength of the Conservative element is obviously not vilified, although the good doctor is about eighty-five percent of the upper class (to steal a beautiful phrase from the Flying Circus of Monty Python). Anne Francis does a lot with a very fine part of the script, and this stands out. She was a good choice for the woman of divided loyalties, a "girl" who was far more modern than the social conventions of that day could have allowed - had there not been a life-and-death struggle going on. One good aspect of the film is the way the rivalries of American revolutionary leaders degenerated into jealousy and how these personal conflicts almost sabotaged the whole revolutionary effort. All in all, the main characters are very well designed, the secondary characters are not just human "props" and the fighting scenes are believable enough to take the dramatic action. <br /> <br /> This is a great spy movie. It is not a great historical drama, but rather satisfying. He ranks a seven largely because Cornel Wilde is so deeply immersed in his role, and does so well, and because Anne Francis makes the most of his support effort. <br /> <br /> The color printing used in the Turner Classic Films. It was very clear too, and so it was a nice presentation on this important point. <br /> <br /> I hope it will run again soon.
