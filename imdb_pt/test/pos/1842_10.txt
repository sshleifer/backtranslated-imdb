Incredible movie! Great combination of talents! I'm a big fan of David Duchovny and he's great in this movie! I would love to see you in more movies of this nature. His talents are definitely underutilized and there's a lot more to offer than "Agent Mulder" (although I'm also a huge fan of this series), Anyway, I want to see more of him. He is easily the Cary Grant of our generation. If you have not seen this movie, you MUST! Great love story that shows that love never dies ... is with you forever. Minnie Driver is great and how can you go wrong with a cast containing Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Loggia and Mr. Belushi? This movie received no awards, but it deserved one. Great job Bonnie Hunt! ** By the way ... the soundtrack is great too! **
