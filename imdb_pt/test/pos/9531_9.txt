Railway Children were on TV again this weekend, and I'd forgotten how good it was. <br /> <br /> If I have a criticism, it is that the episodic structure sometimes shows a little too clearly, there being little narrative flow from sequence to sequence. The charm and beauty of the film is such that it matters very little. <br /> <br /> I will not revisit the comments of others, plus add my vote for the final scene on the platform as possibly the most emotional scene in British film history: as an old cynic going through middle age quickly I too can not even think of that moment without being hit by a serious case of "I have Something in my eye." In fact, it's not just something in my eyes, it moves things inside me too, with that beautiful happy pain we sometimes feel. <br /> <br /> And Jenny Agutter was exquisitely beautiful in this movie, standing with one person. foot in childhood and one in young women, and bringing qualities of both to the portrait of a girl having to grow very quickly. <br /> <br /> In addition, a quick applause for Bernard Cribbins. Considered primarily as a lightweight actor, he deftly created a Perks of Great Mankind.
