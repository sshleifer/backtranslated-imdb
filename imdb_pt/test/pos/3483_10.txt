Michael (played by Steven Robertson) has cerebral palsy and lives a quiet and bland life at Carrigmore Residential Home. When a newcomer to the house, Rory (McAvoy), befriends him, he goes on to show Michael how to live beyond disability. Although, or perhaps because of Rory's incapacitating incapacity (unable to move everything except his head and a few digits in his hand), Rory is fiercely independent and extremely rebellious. His affection for Michael's silence and reserve is spectacular, and the two soon leave the nursing home to create lives in the outside world, where they recruit the help of Siobhan (Romola Garai) as care assistant. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the jewels of the year! Much like last year in America, the film goes from being extremely funny, to harrowing, moving, disturbing and truly moving without once appearing sweet saccharin. Knowing exactly where to pull the heart strings, and where to just let the story, and characters, do their thing, O'Donnell has created a wonderful movie that tells everyone to look beyond the surface, and see what's inside. /> <br /> The real strengths of the movie come in the main actors. They are so convincing your characters that you truly believe they are disabled. To still be able to convey humor and sadness over the already great performances is incredible. The two really seem close friends, and as the story unfolds, you care about them completely. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best examples of this year's film, telling a very relevant story in a simple way. If this movie does not touch your heart then you must contain pure ice inside.
