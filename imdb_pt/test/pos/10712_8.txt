Although this is a low budget movie and clearly last minute, it has a certain charm that is difficult to identify. I usually believe that it's writer Grant Morris, who, despite the distorted plot, injected a fantastic slice of humor, very absent in many of today's box office. Definitely a must see for a Sunday afternoon laughfest. Speaking as a true single girl, and very skeptical, this movie did not particularly inspire me, but it ignited a small flame of hope for a love life. Not my beloved as much as the love life of my somewhat crazy neighbor who lets his hamster sleep in his bed with her. She can find someone.
