It is generally accepted fact that Marcel Carné's 1936-1946 films are masterpieces and it is considered polite to say that the rest are mediocrity. This is an unfair opinion: at least two of the latter are eminently watchable: "Thérèse Raquin," the best postwar work, and "les tricheurs" (the tricks). There is a strange evolution from Prevert's golden hour to "les tricheurs": in "enfants du paradis" "quai des brumes" or "le jour se lève", true love is thwarted by villains . In "les tricheurs" true love no longer exists: we deal with a bunch of young people who do not believe in anything; falling in love would be incongruous to this youth. Adults are not the villains: Mic's brother and mother are gentle people, but she's beyond his command. Very few adults show up anyway. <br /> <br /> For two hours, the characters continue to play, dance, listen to jazz records (a song that is not yet part of bourgeois culture), and drinking a lot. When two of them find out they care about each other, it will be too late. <br /> <br /> The cast is very good, Laurent Terzieff as an existentialist skepticist and Andréa Parisy as a rich child are the highlights. On the other hand, Pascale Petit and especially Jacques Charrier (who married Brigitte Bardot in the same year as "les tricheurs") do not have the ambiguity that their parties ask for. They all smile, very sweet and pleasant to be believable. <br /> <br /> Strangely, "les tricheurs" was labeled "nouvelle vague"! You know what the priests of this film school (like Godard) think of Carné, it's a really good joke. But this disenchantment you feel throughout the film is really disturbing.
