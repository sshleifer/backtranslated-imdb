I really only watched this movie because it had Rupert Grint (which I knew as Ron from the Harry Potter movies). I've never really enjoyed Rupert as an actor until this movie. I loved the whole movie. Rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious and quirky movie. I think the movie could have been good without the sex, but it worked out somehow. I can not wait to see more of Rupert's films in the future. Julie Walters also did an incredible job. In the Harry Potter movies, she has a very small role, so I was not sure what to expect from her either. But she was as wonderful as Lady Evie. The part where she swallowed the key was absolutely hilarious. Overall an amazing movie.
