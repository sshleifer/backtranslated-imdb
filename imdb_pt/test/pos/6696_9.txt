As with some of the best movies and series, I stumbled on it by accident. It was late, a storm was in full force outside and I was sitting comfortably on the couch when I passed a channel that was about to show one of the episodes. I intended to watch only a few minutes while waiting for the commercials to end on another channel before returning to some sitcom or other. About an hour and a half later, I remembered my determination and was so glad I did not do it. Needless to say, I made sure to see all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> John Hannah was brilliant at almost everything I saw him and he does not disappoint here either. All other cast members do a stellar job as well. My personal favorite (besides John Hannah, of course) is Gerard Murphy. <br /> <br /> The only negative side of this series is the limited amount of episodes. Only 8 with JH himself and 1 with another person. I would love to see McCallum back on the screens, though it would have to be with JH!
