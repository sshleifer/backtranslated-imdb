Let's be fair: there are NO RULES for script, so I'm not going to say that the movie MUST be something different than it is. I just state my opinion. OK, I really enjoyed the script, the way things are told and the characters are introduced. However, I think that when a piece is matched to the silver screen, maybe you can try to fit that other media. Since this film was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the piece, it is not surprising that the film was theatrical. It's the man's first movie, for crying out loud! What I'm saying is that there are parts in the film - like the city of Nordestina, which resembles slightly the set of "Today is Mary's Day" - that it seems like we're not in a movie theater. We're in the theater! The lines are spoken very formally, the characters are moving choreographically, and the whitening is clearly intended for a stage. Of course, maybe that was the intention, but this has already been done. On the stage. Wonderful things were done by adapting a part in a movie - the beautiful "Closer", for example. When I went to see this, however, I did not feel like I was watching a movie. But overall, it was a good one, worth seeing. It's a good love story, funny at times and sad for others. My vote is a 7.
