I've recently seen episodes 1-4, and now I can not wait for 5 and 6 to be available! (I heard they are coming soon.) The Commander's log seems destined to become a cult hit among college audiences and everyone else with a taste for quirky comedy. It is obvious that the budget was small, but the care with the elaboration of the script is quite evident. In fact, the simplicity of the show allowed me to appreciate the writing and acting more. Bowlsby is a master of rebate ... I just wanted to be able to remember all the best for later use on unsuspecting co-workers! Let's just say that if you do not like the Commander's Log, I personally will see to it that your underpants get stuck!
