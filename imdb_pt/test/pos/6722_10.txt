Daisy Movie Review By James Mudge From beyondhollywood.com <br /> <br /> On paper, "Daisy" sounds like the dream of an Asian filmmaker to come true, led by co-founder of "Infernal Affairs" Andrew Lau and starring by daring favorite of all girl, popular Korean actress Jeon Ji Hyun. Unfortunately, despite the talent involved, and the fact that the crew flew around the world to film in Amsterdam, the film turns out to be a little disappointing, being a romantic drama that dwells in misery and self-importance. The plot follows Hye Young (Jeon Ji Hyun), a rather naïve Korean girl who lives in Amsterdam, spending her life working in her grandfather's antique shop and making portraits for tourists. One day, she begins receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer, whom she believes to be a mysterious man from her past who once built a beautiful bridge. One day she meets Jeong Woo (Lee Seong Jae, also in Holiday and Public Enemy), who, unbeknownst to her, is actually an Interpol agent tracking down Asian criminals in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> With Hye Young supposing that Jeong Woo is responsible for the flowers, the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship. However, it turns out that the man who sends the flowers is actually Park Yi (Jung Woo Sung, from "Sad Movie" and "Muse"), a killer who works for a Chinese crime syndicate. Inevitably, the love triangle becomes tragic and the two men end up facing each other as poor Hye Young tries to discover which of the two is the love of her life. <br /> <br /> Although "Daisy" is ostensibly a love story, it has the feel of a funeral, with a slow, somber rhythm and a plot that adds to the misery. Half the duration of the film is occupied by scenes of characters looking anxiously through the windows into the rain, with silence interrupted only by self-pity episodes of narration. Director Lau seems to be under the impression that the film is a heavy tragedy of Shakespeare, rather than another dark story of love between a real man. As such, the process has a rather pretentious air, despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely around the blatant cliché borrowed liberally from the likes of "Fulltime Killer" and John Woo's classic "The Killer." Nearly every aspect of the movie is filled with anguish, with the three main characters suffering as if the weight of the world were on their shoulders, and steadfastly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations. Park Yi, in particular, as the kind of overly emotional and socially retarded killer, so beloved by modern cinema, is mildly ridiculous, from his incompetence at work to his hysterical attempts to discuss Impressionist painting with Hye Young or his propensity to cultivate flowers. This languid passivity makes the central novel of the film a bit hard to swallow, and Lau's attempts to evoke the sense of fate that unites the characters are more of a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Jeon fans Ji Hyun should note that his character is much closer to his role in the supernatural drama "The Uninvited" than "My Sassy Girl" or "Windstruck", and as she tries her better to pull a few crazy faces here and there, his performance is certainly more subdued. <br /> <br /> The film benefits from brilliant production values, and Lau makes good use of the Amsterdam scenery, playing in the contrast between the gray, almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the countryside. Unfortunately, it tends to use excessive slow motion for some of the emotional scenes, which when combined with some of the postcard visuals give the film the feel of a perfume advertisement. There are some surprisingly violent action scenes, although they are few and far between, and although well staged, seem to have been cast as a belated reflection and little more than lifting the wrist briefly. <br /> <br /> Despite her faults, "Daisy" contributes to an engaging vision, and history clings to almost in spite of herself, mainly because of a morbid fascination for not seeing which of the Hye men Young will finish, but to see who will die in her arms. The self-indulgent melodrama works well enough to mark all the right boxes for the genre, and the film works perfectly well as a nice and bright novel. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that the DVD features the cut of the director. of the film, which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version, which not only adds 25 minutes, but reorders some of the scenes, making the narrative less linear. Although this new version is perhaps very long, it is certainly superior, for without these changes the film would certainly have been even more conventional and would have undergone an even darker character development. <br /> <br /> Wai Keung Lau (director) / Jae-young Kwak (screenplay) CAST: Woo-chung Jung ??
