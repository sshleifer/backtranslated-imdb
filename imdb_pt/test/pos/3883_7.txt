James Aaron, a chubby actor who lives in Chicago, is a man who loves to eat things that are not good for him. This is clear from the outset, as Dick, a friendly shop employee, advises him to stay away from junk food. Aaron, an actor working in Chicago's Second City, is an unlucky love man in the love department. He still lives with his mother, a brave lady who encourages him to go out and have fun. James has another job in a kind of Candide Candide, where people are prepared for unusual situations, such as surprising a mechanic and saying that he is the father of a daughter he has never met. <br /> <br /> On the day he meets his friend Larry he learns about casting for the remake of "Marty," his favorite movie. Being a big man, he clearly identifies himself with the character in the film. In many ways, James's own life resembles that of Paddy Chayefsky's creation in the photo. He wants to try the role because he knows he can do the paper justice. <br /> <br /> One day he meets Beth at a soda fountain. James likes the woman, who one day invites him to shop with her for underwear. He ends up having sex with her, thinking they have a cool thing, but Beth has another surprise when she says that the reason they went to sleep was because she never did it to a fat man. After being disappointed, James stumbles on an attractive elementary school teacher who seems to share his love of jazz. In the end, we watched James fulfill his long dream of starring in a theatrical production of "Marty" in a nursing home. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin, who is a man of affable character, shows a talent for the kind of comedy associated with his friend Larry David. Although both men differ in acting styles, their view on James Aaron is right about money. As a director, he has done this before, although this is an original concept he should follow. <br /> <br /> One of the assets of the film is the people involved in the project. Sarah Silverman impresses by taking Beth out. Bonnie Hunt underestimates her role as a school teacher for good results. Mina Kolb, is seen as her mother, a role she played in "Curb Your Enthusiasm" with excellent results. Director Paul Mazursky is also on hand in a minor role. Joey Slotnick, Tim Kazurinsky, Richard Kind, David Pasquesi, Larry Neumann Jr., Gina Gershon and the rest of the cast make valuable contributions. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin is a talented man whose next effort will be welcome. your fans.
