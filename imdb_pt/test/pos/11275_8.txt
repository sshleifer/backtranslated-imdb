First of all, this is an art film and a good one at that. I loved the presentation and the way it was filmed. Very cool. Certain scenes were some of the most graphic horror sequences I have ever seen. This movie scared me, not out of suspense or shock, but because I was afraid that I would soon see something really scary. This happened in some places, but mostly in the beginning. This movie also dragged and the 74 minutes seemed long. However, if you are on film, you have to see this. To this day, I have not seen anything like it. 8/10
