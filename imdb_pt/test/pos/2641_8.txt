While I keep his predecessor, "Fast Times At Ridgemont High," as a standard to which other teen comedies should be compared, "The Wild Life" is one of the best-known films of the time - and a worthy sequel, if you can call it it. I believe his slogan says: "From the creators of FTARH, something even faster." This is definitely true. Although it may not have the depth of the first, which addresses issues such as first dates, teen sex and abortions, "The Wild Life" is nevertheless a great movement. It's pure chaotic fun, especially due to the over-the-top character of Chris Penn, Thomas Drake. If Spicolli was rich in cocaine instead of marijuana, he would be Drake. Eric Stoltz, in his first major role, is great as Bill Conrad. Both characters work well on each other. Think of a younger and younger Odd Couple with an 80-year-old gloss. Out of them, there are so many other great things about this movie that are worth mentioning. Lea Thompsom never looked prettier, especially during the scenes of her work at the donut shop. Jenny Wright is just delicious and fun to watch. Rick Moranis plays a great nerd / pervert who is dying to get into his pants. Thomas Drake's wrestling companions are hysterical, especially Benny, the little Puerto Rican guy, who says some pretty memorable lines. One in particular that he screams for a night at a strip club put me on the floor the first time I saw him. That's saying something! Finally, the movie ends with one of the best 80's movie party scenes ever. Be aware of the special appearances of Ron Wood, the Rolling Stones, Leo Penn (father of Sean and Chris Penn) and a random Michael Jackson at the party. Play a score for none other than the man himself, Eddie Van Halen, and you can not go wrong. For Van Hagar fans, keep your ears open for riffs that would be found on albums like 5150, OU812 and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. <br /> <br /> If something interrupts the movie stream, it's a small subframe. involving Randy Quaid as a burned-out Vietnam veteran. It seems out of place and unnecessary. Other than that, it's almost perfect. If you're a fan of careless but fun 1980s movies and have not yet seen this, you're into something special. RENT NOW !!! <br /> <br /> - Credits say that Cameron Crowe has a tip as one of the cops in the film. He's got his back during the scene because I still have not found him. Someone please help me.
