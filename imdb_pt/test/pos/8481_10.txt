Jamie Foxx is absolutely Ray Charles. His performance is simply brilliant. He owns the film, just as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Balls of Fire." Indeed, it is difficult to remember that Ray Charles's part is being represented and not interpreted by the man himself. Ray Charles is legendary. He is well established as a musician and the music is deep, complex and innovative - even more innovative than I realized before watching this movie. The film must make new fans of a young audience who can get into it knowing little about their music. The life of Ray Charles provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes far beyond just being a movie about a musician. I confess I knew very little about the man's life until I saw this movie. I was impressed by Ray Charles's courage, strength and innovation as a man and musician.
