The English are a bit too bad, the Scots are a bit too heroic. The dialogue is overly dramatic at times, and the transitions between scenes could be smoother. <br /> <br /> Still, "The Bruce" has the feel of being authentic, if not polished, <br /> <br /> story ... even though it is a game with some important facts. Sandy Welch is not Gibson or Branagh, but he's a great supporter. Bruce. And Brian Blessed chews the stage in delightful villainy like Edward I. <br /> <br /> Although he does not have the budget needed to make the final battle truly impressive <br /> <br /> , they still organized an impressive crowd for the English and Scottish armies. It is, according to the filmmakers, "the largest reconstruction filmed of the medieval battle ever held in the British Isles." <br /> <br /> Allowing for some flaws and shortcomings, the film still makes a compelling portrait.
