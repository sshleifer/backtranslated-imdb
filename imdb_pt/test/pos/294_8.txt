It bears the tone of voice that recounts the book in the jungle of Vietnam and the wild gaze of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity around Colonel Kurtz (I do not say Marlon Brando because after watching the documentary, "Hearts of Darkness" , I am skeptical as to how much credit Brando is owed for this quality). The tone of voice I'm talking about is shocking and dramatic, without being arrogant: "Everyone gets what they want.I wanted a mission and, for my sins, they gave me one." They sent her with room service " . It is indulgent without being narrow and alienating.

Sometimes he goes right by you without even saying a word, and sometimes he takes you by the collar and says" did you know that? 'if' is the middle word in 'life', if you can hold your head while everyone around you is losing theirs "and then" I mean that he is a wise man, he is a great man; I should have been a pair of tattered claws running across the floor of silent seas. "(The first is Kipling, the second is Eliot.
