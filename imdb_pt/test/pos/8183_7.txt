Quite a production of the director telling the story of Emperor Qin's ambitious plan to unite all the kingdoms of China. Some great characters, scenarios, costumes and scenes. However, I was not impressed with the film in terms of the actors' ability (which was good I appreciated the Marquis) or his looks (although the mass of troops was extremely impressive, if it were a real man that is a lot of extras!) . <br /> <br /> I've seen Li Gong in other movies and she's always great. Good piece of the period, I think, but not to judge the true historical accuracy of it. Good movie and I thought the 2 1/2 + hours is not a problem. <br /> <br /> Evaluation 7 of 10.
