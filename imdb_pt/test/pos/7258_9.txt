I do not want to write much about the movie, but basically it's an action / comedy with a bit of romance in about two men who come together in unlikely circumstances and become road men together. Fantastic performance from Robert Carlysle and everyone else involved. A brilliant 'baddy' that really makes you hate it. Some great comedic lines - in fact, loud laughing, incredible action and a great plot. Choice of music and ambience all fantastic, basically brilliantly driven and brilliant written. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good British movie or a good bit of action, I do not know why the movie never took off, I thought I did not have as much recognition as I deserved. If for nothing else, watch this movie for one of the greatest finals of all time. Not to give anything, but this really is heart pounding!
