For all viewers who saw "The Cure" would agree with me on this comment that is an excellent film and is very moving. Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro confirm their star status in this film, along with Dexter's mother (Mazzello) Annabella Sciorra. <br /> <br /> When I first watched The Cure on TV, I did not know what to expect, but as I watched this masterpiece, it was soon clear what it was all about. Dexter, an 11-year-old boy suffering from AIDS, sits around his yard playing with his toys when one day he meets his neighbor Eric, who at first is a little strange to both boys but soon became good friends . <br /> <br /> During the movie, I wondered what would happen to the two boys, as they made me think. I wondered how the hell they were going to get to New Orleans, sitting a door with a sea biscuit under it pulling an inflatable crocodile from behind. There were other great scenes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> But the part that hit me was the part where Dexter's health began to deteriorate. You just could not help wondering if he would succeed, but in the end you find out. I thought the first joke they played, that Dexter was really dead obviously he was not, dude with me. But when they play the third, something is very wrong. Dexter does not get up to laugh or show any kind of laughter. At that point, the victim of the joke soon announces that poor Dexter had died. In that part I lost. I closed my eyes, and from that scene on I was crying. You just have to. As the end approaches you begin to understand the loss of Eric and then the movie ends with a cool note with the Dexters shoe slowly floating in the river. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was excellent. There is laughter, adventure, emotion and sadness. When you put this in the blender you have a great, must watch movie. Peter Horton did a great job directing this movie and I believe he is certainly one of his best. But for now, I'll try looking for this DVD movie, if it exists. Once again an excellent movie that will take you on an emotional roll.
