"Here On Earth" is an amazing and romantic story about Samantha, who has both childhood and health problems. As his love for his current boyfriend, Jasper, disappears, his love for Kelley blossoms like a new spring flower. <br /> <br /> I found this film very touching, very warm, very romantic and touching. I enjoyed every bit of this movie ... and that's very rare! I highly recommend this movie to all movie lovers! This is a movie you will not want to miss !!! : D <br /> <br /> By the way ... if you're a very sentimental person who cries easily while watching movies, BRING KEYBOARDS !!! On the other hand, it was a really good movie !!! Very romantic ... and surprisingly good !!! : D <br /> <br />
