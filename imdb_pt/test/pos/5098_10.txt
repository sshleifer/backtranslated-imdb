I love this movie because every element of it is nothing less than excellent. I'll quickly praise some of them. Peter O'Toole gives us one of his great performances by becoming the definitive Mr. Chips. Petula Clark, has a beautiful voice and is perfect as Katharine. The director was able to bring the story to the screen in a new way. Combine this with fantastic and creative cinematography, editing, writing, etc., and you'll get a movie that shows the good quality of your production. I can not praise the well-planned camera work enough, it moves us up and around, zoom in and out, giving us the best views and letting the sites become part of the scene. Petula Clark's last song, 'YOU AND I,' has only 3 beautifully composed long takes, and in this 2-second era, I can appreciate the extra care that everyone involved had to give to make the scenes perfect. The music is great, and the songs move the story as they should. Leslie Bricusse is one of my favorite composers. Listen to these songs, how could anyone not like them? This is a very romantic story between two people close to middle age who meet, bring the best to each other and it lasts until the end of their lives. Excellent values ​​of production, acting, camera work and music make this movie worth watching.
