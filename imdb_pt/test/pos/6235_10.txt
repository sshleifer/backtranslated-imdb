Let me just start by saying that Tourist Trap is a better movie than 99.9% of the horror movies that have come out of Hollywood lately. If you do not believe me, see Darkness Falls or They. And it's certainly better than any of these direct releases to videos like Stab, Bleed, The Pool, and so on. One of the big problems with the Tourist Trap movie is that it is never really found an audience. When the film was opened in 1979, it received a PG rating by the MPAA. Anyone who knows horror movies knows that a PG in a horror movie is usually the kiss of death for the movie. (Director David Schmoeller talks about this problem in the DVD comment track.) There are exceptions, such as Poltergeist, who also received a PG rating. However, there are big differences between Tourist Trap and Poltergeist. Tourist Trap was not a big budget Hollywood movie like Poltergeist nor was it produced by Steven Spielberg. That alone was enough to ensure Poltergeist's success. (Still for those of you who have seen Tourist Trap, you're going to scratch your head as to why the MPAA rated this movie PG. The 'heart-bursting' scene alone should be enough for the movie to be played with the rating A. How about the pipe in the back with the blood dripping?) I have to admit that when I was young, I looked at a copy of Poltergeist on the shelf of the video store, I caught it, I saw it was classified as PG and put it back on the shelf in favor of a rated R movie instead. Years later, I finally saw Poltergeist and realized what great movie I missed by not renting a PG horror movie. From then on, I would never judge a movie based on its rating again. This is most likely to have happened to Tourist Trap. People, like me, with Poltergeist, will probably forget that in favor of the R movie. Most likely, it's a teenager too, to which most of these types of movies are directed. Friday 13th was not masterpiece, but did pretty well at the box office due to the fact that it was rated R and was heavily advertised by Paramount at the time. He found his audience and made enough money to generate several sequences. When you look at the staff, Tourist Trap is as good as Friday the 13th. The same thing could have happened to Tourist Trap. We could have seen Tourist Trap 2, 3, 4 and so on. Regarding the film, Tourist Trap is a fun horror movie made with an extremely small budget but is well represented, well run and well done on many levels. Chuck Connors is a riot like Mr. Slausen and gives the best performance in the film. A special credit must be given to the composer Pino Donaggio, whose soundtrack to this film is really what sets him apart from others and gives his strangeness. The music in the scenes surrounding the mannequins is especially scary. Donaggio has worked on the horror film Carrie and many other films since Tourist Trap. He has done exceptionally good work in movies and continues to make movies to this day. The weakness of the Tourist Trap is that there is never any explanation of Davey's powers. Maybe that's how it should be. He only has them, and we must accept this to make the film work. We've accepted it to some extent, but the script has incidents like Davey's making the phone ring in the store while he's in the basement of the house. In that case, Davey is limited in using his powers? Can he make a phone ring in Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is its scope? These are things that people who did not care about this movie would probably point to flaws. Others would accept this as a mistake. I accept. There are not enough questions like that to hate me. This is a horror movie. We should not be forced to read much about it. Many people call this movie "mannequin to kill". I assure you that no dummy kills anyone in this movie. The mannequins are controlled by the power of Davey, who uses them as a weapon. This is a common misconception about this movie. Some people have a problem with mannequins and some even say they are simply silly. I think they contribute to the total strangeness of the movie. Global Tourist Trap is a good rental of fun. *** (of 5)
