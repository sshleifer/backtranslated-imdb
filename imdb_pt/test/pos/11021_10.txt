This film really is worthy of being seen - Robin Tunney stands out and Henry Thomas proves that he is one of those rarities, the childish "actor" who grows and becomes a real actor. The characters are perfectly drawn, and in the wrong hands because of their depth, they could have been unconvincing - but all the actors are simply amazing. The cast of this film has to qualify up there with that of "Girl, Interrupted" (both films coincidentally star the brilliant Clea Duvall). The music scores and selections fit perfectly, and there are many actions to prevent the movie from becoming just a character study. If you want the story, you will not find it in this review, but I'll tell you that the climax will haunt you for quite a while.
