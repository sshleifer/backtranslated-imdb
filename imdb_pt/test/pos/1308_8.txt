This movie is titled "Junior Pilot" here on IMDb, but "Final Approach" on Netflix. Who knows! The film is a delight both for young audiences and for adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to watch this movie through the eyes of their own youth. For the adult, the story is quite predictable and perhaps banal and melodramatic; Whereas the story may seem new and creative to young people who have not seen or read many movies or books with such a plot. <br /> <br /> In any case, creators of the film must be credited, particularly to the film. director James Becket and director of photography Denis Maloney for making this film more entertaining and visually interesting. The cut-aways to the fantasy thoughts of young protagonist Ricky are hilarious and also delightfully filmed. <br /> <br /> The young actors give evenly convincing performances, apparently quite invested in their roles - silly as many scenes are. Jordan Garrett plays the protagonist "Ricky" very well, having excellent camera presence. Jeffrey Tedmori creates a deliciously smooth and sensitive "Shashi" that, out of all the ridiculous things, feeds on spicy sauce. Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley give solid performances as well. <br /> <br /> As is typical of his always good acting, Larry Miller creates a solid fatherly figure around which the world of children, the real part and the fantasy part, revolves. Compared to his father figure, the other major adult roles seem to be superficial and one-dimensional, purposeful and humorous to be sure. <br /> <br /> This film is a simplistic story aimed at young people, of course, but it is quite entertaining, perhaps repeatedly for the target audience, but also for at least a view by adults who retain the ability to see one film of this kind from his formerly young perspective.
