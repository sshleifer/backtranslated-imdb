Eisenstein was not only one of the greatest directors of Soviet films, but one of the great masters of cinema, between Griffith, Murnau, Ford, Hitchcock, Welles and others. One of the biggest things in all his films was the very personal editing, and in this film is exceptional. This was his first sound film and the use of the musical score of the great Russian composer Serge Prokofiev following the battle is a perfect contrast between music and image. Watching this movie is like watching a class or class at Cinema, something that many movie directors can not afford. I never get tired of watching REAL CLASSICS like this movie. I hope that, in the near future, more people will recognize a great work of art.
