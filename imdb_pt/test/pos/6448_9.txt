I read the above review and I can not believe it! Of course it's a children's film, it's an adaptation of a children's book !! This movie is easy to get, try play.com or amazon and it's very easy to win a copy! The jokes are hilarious for children and adults, and the adventure is clean without violence! It is completely suitable for children of all ages! The songs are fabulous, but rather repetitive, but that's what kids need and while watching, my little ones are heard singing "hi hi cocalorum" all night! They loved it, a story of innocence and friendship! Very lovely and worth seeing for kids and adults of all ages!
