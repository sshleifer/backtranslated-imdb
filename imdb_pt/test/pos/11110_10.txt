Fame, I think, was the best movie I've ever seen. In a way, it was funny and dramatic, but that's what makes a movie. It's true that it has some loose ends, actually a lot, but I still think it's a great movie. Some of the funny things happen in the audition at the beginning of the movie. I find it hilarious when the girl tries to play O.J. Simpson in "The Towering Inferno" and Raul / Ralph go to every art department saying that her father was great at everyone. He says his dad danced with the Rockets and left Ralph in his tap shoes. The Rockets, as far as I know, are made out of women. And the tap shoes were just regular shoes with bottle caps on the bottom. Also the guy who read Juliet's lines in Romeo and Juliet's play was funny. One thing about the movie that excites me is music. I've never heard anything like this !!! My favorite song is "I Sing the Electric Body" and the second is the song song "Fame" itself. Irene Cara has a great voice and is a great actress. I like the way the film focuses on many ethnic groups. He showed all kinds of people that currently exist in what is now called the "La Guardia School of the Performing Arts". This film showed the triumphs and essays of many young artists, including Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Coco, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary and Liza. Everyone had difficulties but they followed the way. This movie could have been added in about 30-45 minutes (before graduation), but it's still my favorite movie no matter what!
