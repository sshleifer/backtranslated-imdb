Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human lover until the perverse butler Edgar, with his eyes on a great heritage, decides to dope them and to take them out of the scene. How can these fragile creatures deal with the unknown landscape and the streets of Paris? Only by finding the irrepressible street cat O'Malley, a raw diamond with romance in his heart. After they experience the vast dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar receives his fair desserts at the wrong end of a horse. As always, it's really the voices and not the animation that's the heart of Disney's magic: Phil Harris is brilliant as O'Malley, Eva Gabor as Duchess is ... well ... Eva Gabor; but perhaps the most memorable twists are from Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who turn the old Napoleon and Lafayette dogs into a couple of fried Southlanders. Their scenes with Edgar and the musical numbers with Scat Cat and his band are classic. The most impressive thing to see The Aristocats now is how deeply Disney's animated style has changed since it was at the forefront in the 1970s. Perhaps the nostalgic and dated feel is only the result of being exposed at Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are more futile. (pity) and the animation and the overall rhythm are much less frenetic (sometimes a relief) than in more recent efforts such as Aladdin.
