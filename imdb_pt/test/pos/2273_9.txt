I just saw "Everything is Illuminated" at the Telluride Film Festival. This is a truly remarkable film. Very emotional, funny at times and moving. Bring your handkerchiefs! For those who like a movie that brings tears to their eyes, I remember the finals of "Babette's Feast" and "The Notebook". The stories were completely different, but they had the same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes, just like the movie did. <br /> <br /> No spoiler here. The summary is, as described by IMDb, the journey of a young man to Ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is in English and Ukrainian (and Russian too, I believe). This allows for some wonderfully linguistically based moments as a character interprets, more or less faithfully, for the English speaker in the group, depending on the circumstances. <br /> <br /> The setting is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful Eastern European influences. Make sure you get the credits for the final song. <br /> <br /> This is the debut in the direction of Lieve Schreiber and is well made. I give this movie a 9, one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I highly recommend it.
