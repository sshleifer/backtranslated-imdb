The first half hour of "Homegrown" was quite boring and non-absorbing, but as the film progressed, so did my interest in the characters and the plot. Several scenes are really scary and you're afraid of the main characters you really cling to. The story is about three people hired on an illegal marijuana farm hidden in Southern California. They witness the murder of the farm owner, Malcolm (John Lithgow), and they take the herb to themselves. The three hands of rather simplistic farmers are soon drawn into a scary world of local mafia and interest, while all the while trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive. While the film had several flaws and a slow start, it was worth it. 7/10 stars.
