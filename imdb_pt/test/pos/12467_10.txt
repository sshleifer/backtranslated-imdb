Beautifully shot, acclaimed director Hugh Hudson (Chariots of Fire) creates a story that brings the whole legend of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke and Tarzan of the Apes to life with reverence and dignity, and with a scope hitherto unseen in Tarzan's films. Christopher Lambert makes his debut as the young lord, raised in the wild by a female gorilla after his parents die in Africa. He later returned to what is for him an alien world, the class and privilege, he feels totally out of place. Once he learns what happened to the monkeys that created him and his world, he realizes that he must return. A sad but triumphant story told against a backdrop of fantastic views. This is one of those movies that is a must for any Cinemaphile collection.
