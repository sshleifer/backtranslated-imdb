When it was announced, the "King of Pop" died at age 50, a month before starting a series of live shows at the O2 Arena in London, which caused a huge shock to millions of people around the world. He was and always will be one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry, and he will miss it a lot. I decided to remind myself how wonderful it was to watch what is considered by many not just the best Jackson video (and possibly music) but the greatest music video ever made by director John Landis (An American Werewolf in London). The movie begins with Michael and his Girl (Ola Ray) having his car broken, and after giving her a ring, the moon leaves and he turns into a werewolf. We then see Michael and his girl watching this movie horror movie, she's scared and leaves, and Michael soon follows her, singing the iconic song. Soon comes the voice of Vincent Price, and zombies begin to crawl out of the ground and open coffins from the graveyard, and Michael and the Girl are obviously surrounded. She walks away, and Michael becomes a zombie, and with all the other creatures they do the iconic dance, before he returns to his normal state, at least for the chorus. The girl runs to the house almost frightening, blocks the door, but the zombie Michael still manages to cross, and when he touches her, she screams to see Michael say "what's the problem?" The movie ends with him taking her home and looking at us with evil eyes. Michael Jackson was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 6 on The Ultimate Pop Star, Thriller was number 4 on the 100 Greatest Albums, and this video was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. was number 1 in the top 100 pop videos. Very good!
