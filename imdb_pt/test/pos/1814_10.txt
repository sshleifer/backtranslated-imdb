We still love the movie and the soundtrack to "Valley Girl". I owned it on video for eons and wore the original soundtrack. I have several friends with whom I come together and we have "80's Raves" - parties where we meet and play music from the 80's and shoot "Valley Girl" on the big screen - and we're all in their 30s now. We have an AMAZING time. <br /> <br /> It's all good fun, like, you know?
