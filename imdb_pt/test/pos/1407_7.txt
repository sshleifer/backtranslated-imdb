I found West Point a nice movie, although I doubt I'd watch it again. The performances were compelling, with William Haines as another unpleasantly entertaining young man who had his regret at the end of the film. It's hard to believe that stardom has called Joan Crawford less than a year after this movie was made, as she seems a bit awkward at times. <br /> <br /> I would like to apply another comment about Ramon Novarro's "Huddle" (1932) for this film as well. There is a great movie waiting to be done here, but there is something missing. The background and integration of the Corps were well used, but I was less involved than I thought I would be. Maybe the character of Haines has gone too far, or he has been too guilty. His "repentance" did not seem genuine enough; and what kind of message sent him to perform every move in the last minutes of the Army Navy game? Where is "the body" in this? He could have taken the other ten men off and let him do it all on his own. Besides, I very much doubt that the weak and insignificant character of William Bakewell had a counterpart to real life at West Point. <br /> <br /> All this aside, the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring. It is a good look at the daily practices of an honorable institution. Thank goodness that tradition still means something at West Point as well, unlike the insipid "traditions" of Ivy League schools, only partially engaged these days. <br /> <br /> As for the score: it was appropriately martial. But there was an overuse of snares. Using them to knock on the door, scene transitions, and ALU, as well as in more than half the scenes, has become somewhat tedious. This greatly diminished the viewing experience. I was ready to say "I GET THE POINT ALREADY". <br /> <br /> So enjoy the movie, but do not expect too much emotional involvement.
