My original title for this review would be "End to disappoint, triumphs in the cinema". But I really thought about it on the way home. It is not the fairy tale that most of these films are, it is different and although its ending is at first disappointing, it slowly sinks and reaches the core in a satisfying tone. The plot follows a man named James Aaron (Jeff Garlin of Curb Your Enthusiasm, who also wrote and directed) an actor who lives in Chicago with his mother and deals with his obesity and his inability to find someone to love. <br /> <br /> Yes, it sounds corny, but experiment with elements that make it unpredictable, and actually make you wish it were longer. The ending came abruptly and made me say "is this it !?" But once it starts charging its price, it really makes you smile. <br /> <br /> He has many tones of seriousness, but do not be afraid, because it is also very funny. Some scenes offer a huge chuckle, and those who have seen Jeff Garlin's stand will recognize a couple (especially when he gives a career-day speech to his niece's grades and kindergarten bombs). It starts with a rather serious note that you do not expect, but the following is very funny, fun and quite moving too. It's the kind of movie you keep watching and you always enjoy it. And as I said before, while the ending may seem absurd in the beginning, once you have time to think, it is a real joy.
