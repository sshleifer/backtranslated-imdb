As I type these comments, I'm watching a DVD of that movie I just received from a direct mail reseller, and I'm finding this to be remarkably well, with strong characterizations, plausible situations, and well-staged action scenes. It's been a good 45 years, maybe 50, since I've seen HELL BELOW, but the only scene that made a deep impression on me was the scene of Sterling Holloway's death, which several other commentators mentioned here. . I have not come to this scene yet at this screening, but I can guarantee what other comments have said: once you see the scene of Sterling Holloway's death in this movie, you absolutely will never, ever forget it. Judging by the intensity of the film so far, I expect the scene to live according to the memory - as unquestionably one of the greatest death scenes in movie history. The film is worth seeing only at that moment, but even without it, it would be a top-class submarine drama.
