In one of the best feature films of Charlie Chaplin, he places the Little Fellow in the trenches of World War I, where he brings his intolerable politeness and endless patience to the grueling work of trench life where troops lived for months before finally go over to overtake the enemy and, generally, to death. It takes someone Chaplin's ability as a comedian to make something as gloomy as the trench warfare in such a brilliant comedy, but the irony he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> All the best of Chaplin's films, short films and other, this is packed with bright and memorable scenes, like the scene in which he marks the deaths with a piece of chalk on a plate in the trench , erasing one when he gets his helmet fired, the scene where he and his companions are sleeping underwater, the opening of the beer bottle and the lighting of the cigarette and of course the overtaking of the enemy. All these scenes are shown, reminiscent of the most wonderful scenes of Chaplin. This should not be missed!
