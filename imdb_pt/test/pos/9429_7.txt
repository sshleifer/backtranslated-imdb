In Universal's series of modern Sherlock Holmes stories with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEOPON is not one of the best movies - although it's fun. I think the problem with that is that much of the movie "duel" between Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty (here played by Lionel Atwill) seems to delay the real point of the Professor's work. <br /> <br /> Moriarty appears in three of Holmes's films with Rathbone. In THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES he was played by George Zucco, who gave a true delight to the love of villainy for his own sake to the role. For my money, Zucco's performance as a teacher was the best of the three (there is even a brief comedy moment in his performance when he is disguised as "Police Sergeant" at the end - as if preparing to sing "The Policeman's Lot "Gilbert & Sullivan"), followed by Mr. Atwill's performance - more on that later, finally, there is the intellectual Moriarty of Henry Daniell in SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE LADY IN GREEN. Daniell, but his clashes with Holmes seem to be a tedious boredom for him.He prevents him from completing the main plan.In the stories in which the Professor appears, he really feels that Holmes is an enemy who will remain a danger while alive. However, because of the intellectual tennis game between him and Rathbone, Rathbone (in his autobiography) really felt that Daniell was the best of the Moriartys movie. If Zucco captured the love of evil in Professor, and Daniell seemed to demonstrate the tired Oxford Don (in the stories, the professor is a well-respected mathematician whose volume on the binomial theorem had a "European fad," and who wrote an intriguing book, THE DYNAMICS OF ASTEROID), Atwill demonstrates Professor as a pragmatic entrepreneur. First of all, he sold his services (apparently) to Nazi Germany. That never happens, but it is presumed (since that is before the Nazis start collapsing) he thinks they will win the war. Secondly, he is not a fool. When Dr. Tobel (William Post Jr.) showed that he is a state of near physical collapse due to the torture of the Moriarty gang, the Professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who are helping Tobel because he is a scientist as good as Tobel and would be able to mount the pump site. Somehow, I can not see Zucco making such a sensible decision at the moment, and if Daniell had to do it, he would seem annoyed that there was yet another delay in his plans. <br /> <br /> By the way, one trick used throughout the Holmes series about the teacher is how to get rid of the movie from him. If you read Holmes's stories, Moriarty appears as the villain three times: in the last story of MEMOIRS SHERLOCK HOLMES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE FINAL PROBLEM"), RETURNING TO THE FIRST HISTORY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE") and the last of the four novels (THE VALLEY OF FEAR). It is amazing how much mileage the teacher has come out of so few appearances (he is mentioned in two or three other stories as well - in passing). But because of his fate at the Reichenbach Falls in "The Final Problem" and "THE EMPTY HOUSE," we always see him fall to his death. Zucco falls from the White Tower on Tower Hill. Daniell (more imaginatively) tries to escape from Gregson and the police, but is shot when he jumps, and injured can not hold the wall of an adjoining building. Atwill (here not seen, but heard) seems to fall into a trapdoor he planted in an escape tunnel). It's really tedious after a while to see the Professor always fall into those movies. One turns to Gene Wilder's (admittedly comedy) SMERTER BROTHER from SHERLOCK HOLMES, where Leo McKern is a wonderfully eccentric and villainous Moriarty (complete, finally, with an Irish accent), who is not killed in the end, but just came out pondering - in a rowing boat - about how his careful schemes did not work. I liked it a lot more. <br /> <br /> The use of the "Dancing Men" code here, such as the use of "Devil's Foot Root" in DRESSED TO KILL, carries a part of a mystery of a tale. "THE ADVENTURE OF DANCING MEN" appeared in THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, and deals with a client of Holmes whose wife has received strange and suffocating messages in this code. Charles Higham in his biography THE ADVENTURES OF CONAN DOYLE suggests that Sir Arthur may have picked up the code of a magazine game in the 1870s, but we really do not know. The code is basically one of the substitutions of letters for the figures of the dancers. The story of the tale is dramatic, but deals with a triangle. The only innovation in the film is that Tobel makes a slight change that confuses Holmes and Moriarty. <br /> <br /> The movie will entertain, but I still think THE HOUSE OF FEAR, SCARLET CLAW, and SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH are better movies.
