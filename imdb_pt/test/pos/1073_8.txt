Mondovino is a touching and rewarding documentary. in the wine world there is a huge difference between the large wine cellar and the small wine cellar. it is not just the size of your vineyard but also the amount of money and power you have. If you have enough money to put ads on the wine viewer and hire one called "wine except" then it does not matter the size of your property. also in the business world today wine often has to be mass marketed and suited to the taste of people. which often means filtered wine from its source. Mondovino shows the commercial side of wine in mega-producer Robert Mondavi, and Michael Rolland, the wine expert who shapes wine to the liking of today's critics such as Robert Parker, who is also part of the film. now these men are not evil or wrong, because they have done very well for the wine. but they have power on a large scale. as we all know, power corrupts. Mondovino also shows small wine producers such as Aime Guilbert from Languedoc and Hubert de Montille from Volnay in Burgundy. These wine makers are not starving, but they know like all the great wine producers that is about where the grapes are. the best example of this is explained not by a winemaker but by a Haitian man working for Neal Rosenthal, the wine importer. the area where the grapes grow is the terroir that matters, which a guiding hand who knows that makes an important real wine.
