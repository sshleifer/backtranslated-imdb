Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady ... it's hard to be articulate about something so good. There is not a character you do not enjoy watching instantly - Myronex "Putney, there are problems in the dark room!" "My name is Rufus." The lines, discarded to the left and right, are classic in themselves, remembering Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialogue is not of the variety of stereotyped lines. "Putney, Myronex called you in bad taste!" "My organization is pro-integration ..." "Where's Lopez? He's in my head." "They do not sound bright until you hear them in the context of the scene ... This movie is going to eat your brain, it's good. I've read comments by calling this racist movie that could not be further from the truth.All scenes are golden, from the commercial Etherial Cereal to the Brothers meeting in the Black Room to that amazing trumpet in the final scene. - Genius.
