ATTENTION: Potential Spoilers Ahead! <br /> <br /> "Steven Spielberg introduces Tiny Toon Adventures" has always been one of my favorite growing up designs (heck, it still is). And this movie perfectly captures everything I love in the program and puts it in full format. Beautifully animated by studio Tokyo Movie Shinsa (WB outsourced all projects of "Tiny Toons", and this was the best studio to handle the show), the film begins at the end of the school year at Acme Looniversity, the renowned cartoon college where Buster and Babs Bunny (no relation) and their teenage toon colleagues learn from the masters of lively madness, the Looney Music. After the last touch, the movie is divided into five different portions. Buster engages Babs in a water fight that culminates with a dam and a gigantic wave, sending Buster, Babs and Elmyra Byron's dog downstream on a picnic table turned in search of adventure in the south. Plucky Duck tells Hamton Pig and his family to let him go with them to HappyWorldLand, "The Happiest Place in the Western Hemisphere," but he has to endure an excruciating car ride and the threat of a hitchhiker wielding a chainsaw. Elmyra's cat, Furball, finally runs away, but she's not disheartened ... not when there are too many "aminals" to play at Acme Safari Park. Fifi la Fume spends his summer hunting his heartthrob, movie star Johnny Pew, hoping to get an autograph. Of course, the hotel he is staying in is almost impenetrable. And Shirley McLoon mounts a fortune on the Acme Acres Boardwalk ... and leaves her guard on her day off when Fowlmouth takes her to watch the horror movie "Skunkophobia." <br /> <br /> All this story lines are hilarious, and some even overlap in the end. The only complaint I have with this movie is that it does not make full use of the Tiny Toons list - Dizzy Devil and Mary Melodie have only one scene, Gogo Dodo appears only at the beginning and end of the movie, and Montana Max, Sweetie, Calamity Coyote and Little Beeper are nowhere to be found. Still, they are excusable failures in a perfect movie. This movie is very rare today, since it is over 12 years old and has never been released on DVD, but I suggest you track - anyone who is a fan of Warner Bros. animation, whether classic or contemporary, NEEDS watching this movie.
