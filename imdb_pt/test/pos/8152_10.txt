For an independent film, it scores well with reasonably high production figures and a great cast. The acting is uneven, but the plot is compelling. We could have used a little more development of Wes Ramsey's character, but hey, the guy's fun to look at, though! Mary Kay Place and Jacqueline Bisset are like icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that it was controversial at its launch. It presents a less than flattering portrait of the Morman Church and its relationship with gays. Although, like Brokeback Mountain, it is about tolerance and accepting one's life, I have found that it is more successful in conveying a positive message. It was more moving, too.
