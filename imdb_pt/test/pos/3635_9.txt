In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antonio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who has been crying uninterruptedly for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love with Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen-year-old who dreams of seeing the world and becomes an actress. Antonio promises Karina to bring the world to Northeastern Brazil, and once in Rio de Janeiro, she participates in a tabloid television program and promises to travel for the next fifty years in the future or die for love with a deadly machine she invented. Fifty years later, Antônio (Paulo Autran) tries to fix what was wrong with his travels. <br /> <br /> "The Machine" is one of the best Brazilian movies I've seen recently. The refreshing and original story is a poetic and magical love story that will surely thrill the most skeptical and difficult viewer in a single novel. The direction is excellent; the script is incredible; the cinematography and the colors are magnificent; the cast led by Gustavo Falcão, the icon Paulo Autran and Mariana Ximenes is fantastic, with wonderful lines; The soundtrack brings some beautiful Brazilian songs that highlight Geraldo Azevedo and "Dia Branco" by Rento Rocha. If this movie is distributed overseas, please push me and rent it or buy the DVD because I bet you will love the story that will bring you to tears. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Machine? The Fuel is Love" ("The Machine? The Fuel is Love")
