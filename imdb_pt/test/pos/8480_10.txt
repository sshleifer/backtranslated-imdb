I am so happy when I watch at all times the (Ray) movie for 21st century potter Sidney (Jamie Foxx) who played this role as evidence of his brilliant ability as an actor to take his position alongside great actors in Hollywood for his golden support for the strong skills of African American actors at all times and periods for his eternal work as evidence for the eternity of Ray Charles as a great proof for his legendary appearance at all times by his success to win the Oscars as a (best actor for the lead role) one (better mixing sound) between real and cinematographic scenes about Ray and Jamie as a mixture between two copies of Ray and (the ray of 2004 acted in the person of Jamie Foxx) It was good for the director to choose these songs to be adapted with dramatic scenes in the movie crashes to enter the atmosphere of success in corn legends with legendary films in Holly wood since 1893 so far and her cleverness to choose Sharon Warrne in his role of Ray's mother, which she achieved in this role by brilliant analysis to the core of her character that Ray's mother was the turning point for him on she grew to be independent in himself to take his place in this world and to be iconic in his talent as (Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington) and at the end of this film, receiving his honorable report of Gerogia and his decision to take his song (Georgia in my mind) the national anthem for this states that he made his promise for his mother to be alive by now for his legendary songs and brilliant life.
