"The Devil in the Dark" is William Shatner's favorite episode. It's also one of my favorite episodes. The program is pure Star Trek because it deals with one of the main themes of the series: respect for other life forms. I do not think anyone can have a clearer example of one of the program's most interesting ideas. In this episode, Kirk and his team have to face a monster that is killing miners on a distant planet. The story is an excuse to explore the right humans have to destroy creatures that are a vital part of the environment. Today's concerns about environmental causes make the program more relevant now than ever before. It is extremely well written and executed with enthusiasm by our beloved cast. A memorable sequence involves Spock joining the monster's mind. Too much tension between Spock and Kirk (they want to solve the problem using different methods) increases the fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy do some of their best work here.
