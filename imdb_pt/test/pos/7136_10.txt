I would like to order this film for the women in treatment. I feel like this is a great movie for them to watch. I can not fine that it was not I've been on ebay and any other website to order this movie. Now I'm asking you for help refining where I can oder this movie or what to do to get one. I'm going to love to show this movie. Yes, I was like this movie and many people here in treatment to see how people can change lives and move on. I think Markie Post made that move very well, she's a great actress, I love her movies. and if you have any other movie about addiction I'd like to order them from the women's and men's treatment center so they can see other people go through what they go through.
