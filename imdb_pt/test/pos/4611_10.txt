This is a great example of uninhibited cinema at its best. Richard Greene (doing good on paper) searches for his two missing friends to take him to the Black Forest domain and to the castle of Earl Bruno (Stephen McNally), an enemy of the past he has never seen face to face. The incredible movie has so many amazing elements combined (for once) into a single movie - a crocodile hole; a clumsy mute (played by Lon Chaney, Jr.); an astute physician (played by Boris Karloff); a leopard hunt (very well done and very atmospheric); a love story; a castle; a sword fight; a sadistic count of an eye and its two evil accomplices (played by John Hoyt and Michael Pate !!!); an intriguing background story that makes the film even more interesting; and more!. Jerry Sackheim's script does not get involved - make a film that is extremely recommendable for those who enjoy unlimited cinema with a touch of horror and atmosphere.
