I do not pretend to be a big fan of Asterix, having seen just another film adaptation and read only two of the comics, but this was a superb film anyway. I only saw the English version, and found the voices to go perfectly with the characters - Brad Garret as Obelix and Sean Astin as Justforkix especially. The story itself was both interesting and truly funny (especially the contradictory endings of names - all viking names end in "af", while all Gaulish names, of course, end in "ix"), with a bit of romance in it (I though) reinforced the story, despite weighing the global production with unnecessary cliches. <br /> <br /> The plot is this - the viking chief, Timandahaf, is tired of invading villages and then finding them emptied. He then consults his "wise man," Cryptograf, whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs, and Cryptograf tells him that "fear lends the villagers' wings." Taking this literally, Timandahaf believes that fear actually allows people to fly, and initiates an expedition to retrieve the "Champion of Fear," an expedition that, of course, takes him to the Gallic village where Asterix and Obelix live. <br /> <br /> The two are currently very frustrated - Vitalstatistix's cowardly and pacifist nephew, Justforkix, has been entrusted to them so they can train him to be a man, and the boy is making little or no progress . When Justforkix unconsciously confesses to being "afraid of everything" in the presence of Viking Olaf, he is the "Champion of Fear" and is kidnapped. Asterix and Obelix are sent by Vitalstatistix to go and rescue Justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son back home. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is a great movie with few flaws beyond cliches and sometimes flawed dialogues. I liked it, despite the fact that it was not true for comics.
