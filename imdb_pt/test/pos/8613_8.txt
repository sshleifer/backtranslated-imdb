Sex is Comedy, although not directed by a fantastically imaginative plot, focuses effectively on the relationship between film director and crew during the filming process, while successfully addressing the dynamics of human relationships and more specifically the issues and problems encountered by actors involved in filming sex scenes. The director, Jeanne, appears prominently everywhere, for she is the one who carries the plot forward in the place of a narrator and gives us countless little pearls of wisdom to think about. She is a social commentator, relating to her assistant and others, the problems she encounters with her new male leader, associating him with a male stereotype. Does your ambiguous relationship typify anything about human nature? the tendency to be inconsistent. On the one hand, the two seem close; when he is not in sight, she claims to hate him. Jeanne also addresses her male pride, perhaps in a feminist take on things. The taboo of what constitutes obscenity is raised: the content of the sex scenes is not considered obscene, but beautiful, because it is the falsehood that constitutes obscenity - that is the justification of the director. This is, however, doubly ironic, for the film we watch is itself a construction within a building. <br /> <br /> There is more to this film than just relationships, of course. Watching this movie is not simply a matter of analyzing it with the aim of extracting some meaning. You can delight in the natural lighting that permeates the film. This makes it realistic and believable. Sometimes a static camera is used in a heavy composition and sometimes the camera looks shaky like a home movie. If you are looking for something fun to watch on a Sunday afternoon that is not too heavy but still lets you think: this is it.
