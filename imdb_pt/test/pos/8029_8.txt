When I heard that Donald Sutherland (Jack Shaw / Henry Fields) was appearing in this movie, he instantly told me that this would be a good picture to watch. Most of Sutherland's photos are full of action and suspense and he can play a rather cruel character and can also be quite charming and gentle. In this photo, Jack Shaw did his best to be a good guy and a bad guy while training a naval office to become a spy who had to change his whole identity and become a different person at night. There are many car chase scenes and many stunt situations that I would not want to perform. This naval officer lived in a pretty community with his wife and was a father but you would never realize that fact until the movie reveals his horrible background secrets that he had to keep from his family and friends. Good espionage film and great acting from all the actors.
