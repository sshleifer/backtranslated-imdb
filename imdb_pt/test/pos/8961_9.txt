I do not know exactly how accurate it is with this movie, but I can say that I was completely entertained with this movie. The character of the blast, played to perfection by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, was one of the most unique and fun characters in recent history. this film was informed, but managed to avoid preaching to the public. it made me laugh, it made me sad, it made me feel alive, and happy to be spending time watching the movie. does not take time to understand what is happening and takes you to a roller coaster of genuine human emotion. I thought you knew about my story, apparently I did not know anything! I give this move 9 out of 10 and recommend it to all adults and young adults and young at heart, but not young. but once they're allowed to watch movies rated "r," make it a priority.
