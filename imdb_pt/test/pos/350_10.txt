Since 1981, Nintendo has made great video games like Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would look a bit boring after 20 years. Games made by Nintendo never seem to get boring because they are always adding something new. It was from the arcade games to the Wii and I heard there is a new version of the Wii scheduled for release in 2011. What makes Wii games so different is the fact that you're doing something instead of sitting on the couch by squeezing buttons. <br /> <br /> And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be released in 2010.
