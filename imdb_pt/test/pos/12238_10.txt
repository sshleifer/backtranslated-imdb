Basically, a captivating, chic, and stupid $ 1.50 version of the handsome underground creature of the '80s, "The Boogens," is an unpleasant, squirming monster that makes an instant meal of any unfortunate student around the notoriously out of bounds Gold Spike Mine. His assortment of intrepid, intrepid, hard-working minions - a hard-working chief of mine, a cute, but insipid, blond geologist, alcoholic, inexplicably Aussie-accented (!) Tempered my hand, no dobus, handsome, cheerful and arguably the most annoying character in the uniformly annoying band, a nerd writer and aspiring eyewear who is prone to speak in flowery and melodramatic expressions - walk through the dark and uninviting cave in search of gold. Of course, these intensely unbearable imbeciles discover that the supposedly abandoned mine is home to a deadly, ugly, multi-tentacle beast who, over time, has honored the graceful fashion of B-flick and proceeds to mistreat the group one of each turn. Directed, co-written, coproduced and co-edited with a stupefying lack of grace by Melanie Anne Phillips, she acted with discouraging dismay for an unnamed cast, still more marked by a lethargic rhythm, a dramatically sinuous, obscure, ill-lit narrative, cinematography, a pseudo-John Carpenter synthesizer brand trembling and redundantly shaky, and an indefinite thing that is only glimpsed quickly at the end of the film, this extremely clumsy, amateur and therefore very tasty The terrible candidate to be more careful commits all mistakes of the bad movie to qualify as a true stink of four stars.
