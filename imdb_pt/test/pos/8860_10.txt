Remake of the 1951 classic "The Other World's Thing". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antarctica. They are invaded by something out of outer space - it devours and completely duplicates anything you choose. It starts out like a dog, but it loosens - and has the chance to duplicate any of the men. So no one trusts anyone else - they are isolated - the radio is destroyed - their helicopter too. What are they going to do? <br /> <br /> The 1951 film made it just a great superhuman monster. That movie was scary. This is also - but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material - the novel "Who Goes There?") And it's scary in a different way. The film immediately begins with Ennio Morricone's extremely strange punctuation setting the right tone and - when the Thing is attacked - the amount of blood is impressive. There is blood and parts of the body flying everywhere - arms are plucked, heads are released, and - in the strongest - a man is first devoured by Thing. The bloody effects are the FORTE and real nightmare stuff. I do not scare easy, but I had to sleep with the lights on when I first saw this in 1982. The effects of Rob Bottin are simply amazing - how that picture got with a R note is beyond me! <br /> It also has a very scary feeling - bloody aside, it is very suspenseful. You are not sure who that is and what Carpenter's direction and punctuation really increase the tension. One complaint - no one receives distinctive personality traits. The actors just stay straight and say their lines. This is boring ... but the movie still works. <br /> <br /> This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982 - competed with the "E.T." and many critics complained about the amount of blood and no female characters in the film. He is now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see ... for strong stomachs. It's NOT a date movie! <br /> <br /> A fun note: When this was released, Universal sent a note along with all the impressions of the movie. They suggested to the theater owners that they play the movie in an auditorium near the restrooms. They feared that people would be so disgusted with the violence that they would need to be near a facility to vomit!
