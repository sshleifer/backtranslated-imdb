"Americans Next Top Model" is the ultimate reality show! I had fun 99.9% of the time watching. I kept my eyes open all the time. (Well, I blinked) It can be sad, funny or addictive. (mostly addictive) "America's Next Top Model" left me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also in more than one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope you get more fan and grow to be a success series! It's great for just about any age so everyone can have fun! :) <br /> <br /> Also, if you watched the program before, did not you notice that Tyra has a different hairstyle every time in the courtroom? She's going to have a short, curly week, and then a long, straight one the next.
