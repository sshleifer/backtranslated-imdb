I was about 14 when I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the movie as much as the songs that I went to the movies several times to see again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learned the songs by heart, just as I did with "The sound of Music" (which people hardly know about in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-proclaimed critics, whose comments are published, is that they do not have a romantic soul and do not see the film through the eyes of a teenager. Maybe he's a fan of Ingrid Bergman, but I was happy with Liv Ullman. Could Ingrid Bergman sing and dance? What was so good about her? Perhaps the critic did not like it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses, since he sees a great similarity between Liv Ullman and Bill Clinton. It was the idea and story behind the film, philosophy, which was the most important and interesting factor and a musical in color, just made it more fun and enjoyable without harming the intellectually attractive aspects. It's a pity that many other films with so-called great actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are completely boring in comparison.
