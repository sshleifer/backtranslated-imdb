This film can be likened to "comfort food" for the soul. Anyone who has tried and tried to save a relationship could relate to this movie. So many parts are so hilarious and so many parts are so painfully true. It is not perfect in its production or even in its dialogue, but the story is unique, that says a lot for modern "romantic" comedies. Luke Wilson is insipid at best, but Heather Graham does an exceptional job in my opinion. Try it - despite the ordinary DVD cover. Joline brings many issues to our self-service culture. It asks us if the commitment is really to the other person or to ourselves. Truly, we are ourselves. Keeping promises (from wedding to scrapbooking to friends) is a great feeling. Again, our word is nothing but a cloud of smoke. Joline is like an alert. We must be aware of our words and commitments, they mean more than we think. At the same time, we should not commit to someone who is incapable of doing the same.
