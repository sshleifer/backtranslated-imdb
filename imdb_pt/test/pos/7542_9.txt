A very funny British comedy from the mid-1950s about a school for girls. The girls are involved in pranks and chaos, bathing, smoking and playing. Alastair Sim plays director Millicent in a glorious role of rapping, as well as playing Millicent's brother. A female police officer goes to school in disguise to see what is happening. This movie is funny, have great visions and Alastair Sim is great. Just a classic Britsh comedy, lots of fun and not too exaggerated. Joan Sims and Sid James, stars of many Carry On films, play small roles, but this movie is about girls. It generated 3 sequences and a new version. Watch and enjoy where it all began.
