I have to confess that I know some of the involved, I was in the forerunner of The Planet, Evil Unleased, however, this was over 10 years ago and I had lost contact with them. It turns out that I was watching BBC Scotland News and a play about Scottish cinema, this mentioned and showed clips from the planet and comments from its director Mark Stirton, this led me to order a copy of the movie on DVD. Now for the movie, the acting level, writing, directing and sfx is there with some of the best around, OK, it's not Star Wars, but I've seen many Hollywood products that are much inferior. It's very strange to watch a movie spoken in my local northeastern Scottish accent, but that soon passed. <br /> ^ Light spoilers ^ <br /> <br /> The Planet is based on several science fiction classics; Star Wars, Alien, Pitch Black, Forbidden Planet and Predator, a handful of the merchant crew of a space shuttle survived their attack and was destroyed by unknown ships, they escape to a desert desert planet, one by one they are killed by invisible invaders, ships only passenger, a mysterious prisoner also arrives on the planet, a battle ensues as the crew struggles to survive. <br /> <br /> The Planet is a brilliant sci-fi movie that makes sure it hides its limited budget, well done to Mark, Mike and everyone involved, I look forward to your next job.
