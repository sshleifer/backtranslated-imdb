This movie has less attention than "League of its own", possibly because it has only one "name" star. But while female professional baseball was only eight years old in the Midwestern city, Japanese baseball is a much larger entity, both in financial subscriptions and popular support. That alone would make the movie better. "Mr. Baseball" shows the facts of the Japan-ball life: the regimented crowd, the deference to the referees, the pressure of business owners on managers, the extreme conservatism of the game - and none Hot dog player is welcome. <br /> <br /> It also addresses the isolation that any gai-jin - but especially an American athlete, not the most versed people in foreign cultures - feels Dai Nippon. And the Japanese, on the other hand, do not feel comfortable with foreigners and show in various ways ("the gai-jin strike zone," claims an American player, "bigger than a Buick"). <br /> <br /> The script may not have won any awards, playing once again on the theme "redemption for the best game", but I found it a lot nicer to watch than the "League". Definitely recommended for those who want to see another angle in this great sport.
