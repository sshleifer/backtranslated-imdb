My favorite show of all time! Yes, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first passion I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny, except when I wanted to be serious, and just a big show in general. But since we could not afford to be with Nick, I could not see any episode after February 1996, and maybe that would make me think more about the show than it should. For me it's more the epidemic (now it does not look right!) To have to say "Goodbye" to someone you love, and know that you will never see them again. And I still think, because as far as I know, there are no plans to release this on DVD so soon ... yes, life is bad! I figured this out for sure (though you might find a strange episode here and there ... but I also never liked the pirated copies of things). <br /> <br /> So enough of my sad life: (most children in 7th grade do not need powers as Alex manages to get them through life (unrealistic - for sure) but, again, how many cities have a super-evil chemical factory that is willing to do anything to "Progress at ANY cost" Gee this show was fun to watch! Although I agree that the diaglouge is a bit more developed (and even a little politically correct My favorite parts were when kids would have some reason to break into the factory (a videotape or something) as a children's version of "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six" (which years later I got hooked on the series for probably by same reason) almost! the factory "security" team who is desperately trying to find the "child of the accident" ... very bad guys (at least when I first watched the show ... they look more likeable to me im now.) I feel a little sad for Larisa Oleynik, not sure if she cares about that kind of role-flipping her ... but that's what I will always remember her. <br /> <br /> Oh and BTW, the actor who plays Aaron Peirce of "24" is here too as a school coach or something .... very cool! Maybe he can get the producers of this show to get Larisa next season of "24". I only say because Jack Bauer is my other TV hero and I would love to see things cross-over, lol :). Both are in California so I'll keep dreaming ... I can see now, "Leave me alone with this suspect for a few minutes ... no, I do not need a car battery"
