My wife and I endorse all the positive comments below, made by other members of IMDB. While this is not box office success, it has a special charm of its own. Genuine and heart-warming. <br /> <br /> We saw this on video, at the end of a long day. We were very tired and in bed. Normally, in a situation like this, my wife falls to sleep in a few minutes, that is, unless it's an exceptional movie and this kept us entertained until the end. <br /> <br /> Maybe the younger teens and twenties would not like it, but for the rest of us it's a real gem! Look!
