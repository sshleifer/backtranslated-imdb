I believe this movie was made for the not-so-princely sum of 8,000 pounds, but that really did not show up. There was nothing amateur in production or acting, the characters were brave and real, and the place could be any deserted area of ​​the world, rather than a not too hot beach north of Aberdeen. The actors were easily accepted as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, deserted and unexplored planet, none of them seemed to be particularly friendly to one another, but they were willing to fight to keep themselves and their companions alive. There was no great explanation about what was going on, which can be really invented, so much of the plot was left to his imagination, like The Big Empty, which was a movie that I also liked. I found that I was very enthusiastic about most of the characters, there were some moments that might not have been fun, the men were so common that you felt like them, and the climax and the end of the film were quite touching. I think Mr. Stirton and his team should be very proud of themselves, I've seen worse films with a budget of millions.
