Recently, I was fortunate to see "The Kite Runner" in a small theater, surrounded by experienced moviegoers who knew how to enjoy such a masterpiece of such sophistication. With all the controversy surrounding the central scene of the film, I expected a rough and violent piece. But the way Mr. Forster dealt with the delicate matter was touching and moving, indeed. Even if the credits in the film indicated China as the main location for filming, I could swear that I saw Kabul in every scene that was to take place in Afghanistan. The acting, by non-professionals and professional actors, is excellent and the cast is magnificent. So this is a movie that I would see again and again, because although it is undeniably sad in its subject, the masterful way it was done awakens all new hope in modern cinema.
