Swift's writing really has more in common with Kafka and Orwell than with fantasy and adventure writers, so it's curious that Gulliver's Travels have been considered a children's novel. Lucky kiddies! <br /> <br /> The same applies to this movie. There have been some really terrible versions of this story, which must be why people are reluctant to look at this version. I mean, it's a TV movie and it comes from Jimmy Henson, so how should we expect anything but cuteness? <br /> <br /> Look again - beauty appears in the strangest places. Kids love this movie enough to go through all three hours of it, but it also takes time to hit Swift's somber view. I hate special effects, but here they are used to carry the story forward rather than simply dazzle us. Please note that the producers have taken the trouble to recruit classic actors like John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole, who perform their eccentric roles to perfection. <br /> <br /> Dramatically, the romance between Gulliver and Glumdalclitch is touched and poignant as well as funny (she's a girl but twenty times his size). The frame-story has a theme about absent parents with whom many children will relate. And the part about Gulliver in the asylum presents an element of horror that deals with the abuse of authority (apparently derived from "Bedlam" of 1964, of Val Lewton, another forgotten masterpiece). The VHS is always spinning on the bargain for a few cents, which is an insult to the many great artists who put that thing in order. I encourage the public to recognize a good thing in making this film and to inspire others to watch it. Although it has a lot to offer children, adults will find that it fits well with classics such as Aguirre, Brazil, 1984 and other fantastic works.
