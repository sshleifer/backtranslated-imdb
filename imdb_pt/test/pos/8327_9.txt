If you have not seen this, you should, on DVD. I can not believe how much I enjoyed it! It's incredibly realistic and believable. It is true that much of this is speculated, and I would like to have known more about what was speculative and what were proven facts (there are not many of them), but it handles everything very well with the theme "Cruel Mother". It will remind you of the nature programs you've seen on Animal Planet and on the Discovery Channel, only the animals here are dinosaurs. They act naturally; they eat, they kill, mate, play and fight for survival. You will actually find yourself cheering for some of them and against others. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the effects are excellent. Sometimes they will seem a little too much with CGI, but then you will see them at a different angle that makes them appear more realistic. In some cases you will be really convinced that you have seen a dinosaur. My favorites were the Coelophysis, the raptors, the diplodocus, the iguanadons, the allosaurus and the Arctic bipeds. I was very disappointed with the T-Rex, however, which seemed a little computer generated at times. <br /> <br /> In any case, you should definitely see this production. It's educational, well done and a lot of fun. For what it is, it's an A!
