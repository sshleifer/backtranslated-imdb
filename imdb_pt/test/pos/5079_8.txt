I liked this movie. I saw him in a crowded house at the Toronto International Film Festival, a day after the gala opening that must have been successful. The director, Gavin Hood, should be present for today's show, but unfortunately his twins were born only a few hours earlier, so he had to fly on a return flight. '2 births in 24 hours' was how he joked about it. <br /> <br /> Surrender refers to 'extraordinary rendition' - a term by which suspected terrorists in the United States can be sent without the legal consent of their parents. to the prisons abroad to be questioned and detained. <br /> <br /> It is quite predictable - an innocent Egyptian-American man unjustly accused of being a terrorist "disappears" as he moves from South Africa to Washington DC. He is sent abroad while the wife at home (Reese Witherspoon) struggles to find him and free him. But what makes this movie special are some good choices in storytelling: 1) a human touching story of what's going on where a suicide bomber blew up; 2) the humanity of a CIA agent trying to understand and be honest with what is really happening; and 3) the chronology of storytelling, which makes it a tight and tense tale that moves and shakes at the right moments. Ah - relief! And a mix of emotions that revolves around as the story struggles for an end. <br /> <br /> All-around strong acting with Meryl Streep as a prominent shrew.
