Jimmy Stewart brings the story of Charles Lindbergh to life as he almost recounts the entire movie as it crosses the Atlantic. Well edited with flashbacks about Lindeberghs life. Franz Waxman's score is brilliant and gives the image a heroic feel. One of the best roles of Stewarts and this movie can be displayed multiple times. Look for appearances by Murray Hamilton (the mayor in the movie JAWS) as Bud Gurney. Comes on DVD 8-15-06 with the release of a few more of Stewart's classic movies. I consider Jimmy Stewart the greatest actor in America and I never tire of seeing him in any movie I watch, watch this photo and you will agree.
