Swift's socialism and pacifism come against all odds in this well-made remake. (You know there's no hyphen after "well." Fact.) He knows bellicose miniatures, socialist giants, philosophers headlong into the clouds (literally) and pacifist horses that rule Yahoos - almost Neanderthal humanoids. (Where did "yahoo" come from?) We also met the psychic Dr. Bates, the devoted Mary Gulliver, the sweet and devoted son Thomas, and the complete cast of a truly horrible 19th century hospice. Suspension of disbelief comes easily, and our 7 and 12 year old girls liked it as much as me and my husband. Sorry for the length, IMDb requires 10 lines.
