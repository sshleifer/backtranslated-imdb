I went to see this movie because Joaquim de Almeida was in it. Joaquim had a relatively small role, so it was good that I liked the movie by itself. In fact, I really liked it! <br /> <br /> The film revolves around two characters, Albert and Louie. Albert is a shy, reserved type, and Louie ... well, Louie is not. The story revolves around Louie's request to Albert to let him go to Albert's house for a while. Louie just got out of jail. <br /> <br /> Albert and Louie have known each other since childhood, and of course when they do something together, there are problems and it is Albert who always takes the blame. <br /> <br /> The action of the film is based on the adventures of Louie's visit. On The Run is a chronicle of crazy and crazy situations. However, Bruno de Almeida and the writer, Joseph Minion (After Hours), do not always take you where you expect to go. There are twists and turns that add depth to this movie. Of course there is a lot of comedy, but here too there is a lot of subtle humor. <br /> <br /> There are also some good performances here. Albert is played delightfully by Michael Imperioli. He's getting pretty familiar these days from the HBO series, The Sopranos. Louie is played by John Ventimiglia, who imbues his character with a lovely and childlike quality. (No matter what he does, you're only going to love Louie!). <br /> <br /> Both actors excel at their individual characters. With Imperioli, you'll want to hug him and take him home to Mom. Ventimiglia, well, you will not know whether to slap him or take him home (and NOT to Mom!). <P> <br /> <br /> There are also other outstanding performances. Rita's character is played by Drena DeNiro (yes, Robert's daughter). The public loved her. Talking to others who saw the movie, it was fun to discuss whether it was Albert or Louie who was their favorite. But everyone loved Rita! <br /> <br /> Is this movie perfect? No, I can not say it is. I've often wanted the director to have a bigger budget to work with. There were some scenes that called for more budgetary freedom. (Give this guy a decent budget to work on and I believe you'll see a movie that will make you stand up and notice). <br /> <br /> The final sequence was a bit of a budget victim. However, budget or no budget, the final screen capture, in my opinion, brought together the talent of actor and director in a memorable, emotionally effective scene. <br /> <br />
