This was such a beautiful movie. Such an incredible performance from Joseph and Brad. Very innocently written and executed. Unmissable !! I cried my eyes almost throughout the movie. This is a movie that every family should sit with their children to watch, this teaches us a very important lesson in life and how we should approach the cruel subject of AIDS, how we should teach our children how to deal with it. and the people around you. Not just with AIDS, but with any terminal illness. I had not even heard of this movie until I rolled through t.v. one day and happened to cross it. I recommend everyone to watch this, just do not forget your box of tissues. More movies should be made like this. Extremely exciting.
