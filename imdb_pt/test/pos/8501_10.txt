Denis Leary can actually be funny and clever at times and is always nice but that takes the cake! This show showed the genius of Leary. <br /> <br /> Work takes place in New York. Leary plays Mike McNeil, an intransigent detective who is married, has an occasional drug problem, and has a girlfriend. McNeil has a serious attitude. So much he's dripping. The venue is filled with funny, interesting and friendly characters, as well as McNeil. An excellent cast too. Every episode of this show is really funny and addictive. The linings of this show are everywhere. You will stay in points after listening to them and still laughing at them a few minutes later and then a few. The cases in which the district deals are something more to stripper nuns, a situation of bathroom hostages, and more are exaggerated. This show was too good. It could have grown legs to last many more seasons. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: A great show. I miss this expensive show. Every episode of this show is great. You get really laughed ... a lot. ABC made a big mistake in giving the ax. Too bad Leary did not revive the cable show. Still, I give this program one of my biggest recommendations. Truly one of a kind show.
