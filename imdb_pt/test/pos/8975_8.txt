Aaron Sorking raises the same questions that Shakespeare did or does. How could they know so much about the inner workings of palace life? Here, as in The West Wing, Sorkin opens surprising doors that are hardly a shock, but seem to confirm our worst fears. Everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for the lives of so many people. A bloated Tom Hanks tells us, in one way or another, that things can be manipulated with semi-pure intentions, but without weighing the consequences, and Julia Roberts, in a blonde hairdo from the south, reminds us of the powers hidden in the racks The subject is serious, but the treatment is light, smart but light. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the invisible middleman, steals every scene he's in, just as Charles Laughton did in all the films he's been in. The dialogue is fast, but not fast enough not to find out that this is not ordinary comedy. The seemingly casual rhythm, full of humor and teasing, grants another badge of honor in Mike Nichol's collection.
