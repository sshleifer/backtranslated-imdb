This movie is the best horror movie I have ever seen. the acting is terrible and the plot leaves a lot to be desired, but the puppet gave me nightmares for weeks. Seriously, if you have small children, do not let them see it. Of course I'm a bit biased because of an irrational fear of puppets and dwarfs. also a double body cameo by the guy who makes me verne troyer. and some free nudity, a must-see in any low-budget horror film. all other horror films will be judged forever in my book.
