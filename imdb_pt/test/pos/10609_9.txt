I had no expectations (I've never seen previews for "Marigold") and enjoyed the characters, contemporary music and the crisp dance in this upbeat movie. Although 98% of the dialogue is English (great for me), I would like the DVD to have subtitles to help in some of the quickest moments in which the character's accent can be difficult to understand. I would not judge this film against Bollywood movies, but only on its own merits as entertaining entertainment (a musical music film). <br /> <br /> I am addicted to Ali Larter as an actress (and her interviews in the bonus material indicates she is a good person). I've watched this movie several times (it gets better every time).
