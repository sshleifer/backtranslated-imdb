Before that was shown on MTV or VH1, it was in my local theater, playing just before the main movie. I remember this short film more than the movie I saw that day. It was the first time I had a musical movie like this but I will tell you that seeing the big screen from a 35mm print in a dark cinema gives a much better impact than seeing a trimmed version and scanning on VH1 in Day of the Witches.
