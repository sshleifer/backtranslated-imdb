I had not heard much about this movie except the national award and the Oscar entry. It's a Marathi movie, I can not make the orange apple in Marathi. But when I saw the movie playing DD1 on Sunday night, I got stuck. Now I am not the judge of cinematic techniques and acting skills. But I watched a good number of films, of various genres, and for an ordinary viewer, I recommend this movie. The sensation is very earthly and realistic, although there are some melodramatic moments. Here's how to feel human. Lately I have not seen any movie, it touches the heart, especially in Hindi cinema. the greatest achievement of the film is when the boy returns home. The camera moves to reveal the child, wearing sunglasses, having lost his eyes, the child hears the other children splashing in the water and starts clapping. I gaped. And the two hours I spent watching the movie - very worth it :-)
