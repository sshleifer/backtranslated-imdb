I finally got to see this movie ... after so many years of anticipation ... <br /> <br /> I was so curious to see if this movie is as bad as some people say .. /> And my opinion is that this movie was not bad at all, on the contrary, it was AMAZING ... <br /> <br /> I liked every second ... from start to finish ... /> <br /> The actors were great, they sent me the feeling that I was living the story at the same time the movie was playing ... <br /> <br /> The landscapes were so beautiful was the film was filmed ... and this enchanted me .. Also the music was extraordinary and I have nothing <br /> <br /> to disapprove .. <br /> <br /> I think the plot was very original , I do not think I saw a movie like this ... <br /> <br /> It's a shame that it's not recognized all over the world .. bad for those who did not have the chance to see it. I give this movie 10/10
