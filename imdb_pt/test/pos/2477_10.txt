Well, I appreciate this movie, even if it sometimes becomes too much for a stereotypical situation. I do not understand at this point if the "Punishment Park" existed in the past, but I think the question is not really here. <br /> <br /> You have to look at this movie in a different way. It shows how much violence you can find in our world. It reminds us that we live in a world that is led by violence and that no one can escape it. If one refuses to "take up your responsibilities," then you will be cast out of our society ... Our whole history is made by wars, we must never forget that. In fact, it is only when we finally accept the truth that perhaps we can change and understand that our "intellectual abilities" have improved. So we could use them to find other ways to solve our problems. <br /> <br /> In two words, this movie is a must, maybe it will help us to accept the truth ...
