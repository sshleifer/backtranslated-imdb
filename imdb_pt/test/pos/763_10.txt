This movie is a great movie. The film shows so many themes in an incredible movie. Driving lessons centers around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17 year old who is maturing. The film continues on how Ben is tired of his dominant mother and how he just wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie, with whom he makes a very special call. The two make a trip and in the process Ben finds himself and what relationship he and Evie share. This is the movie you watch alone or with another person. No matter what, you will all feel what Ben goes through in the movie. It's a very exciting movie that just makes you wonder if your driving lessons were as emotional or as long as Ben's lessons.
