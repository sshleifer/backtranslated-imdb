Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema, and it's way better than I expected. Those people who say they are neither scary nor funny have a point, it's not that big. But one should keep in mind that everyone involved with the film is quite amateurish, so it's basically an inaugural journey. And comparing this to the other Sinan Çetin films, like the first-class junk "Propaganda," this movie is very good. <br /> <br /> One thing that SHOULD be said: deals with the lives of college students. Turkey VERY realistic! It's just like that! The scenes that are to scare are a bit cheap and hollywood. Most of them, even if not all. But that scene from religion class made me laugh in tears, and Emre Kýnay plays the best part of this film as a religion teacher. <br /> <br /> It's NOT a waste of your time, go and watch! You will find this fun, especially if you know Turkey enough to relate to the school life of the young Turks.
