Now, of course, this is one of the lighter stories Bruce Willis has ever known, yet he's still playing. I really like the style of Bruce and persona, I did not love everything he's ever been, but he brings it to the 'Big-time' for me in most of all his film efforts. <br /> <br /> The story begins ..... It is power, confidence and style with a capitol 'S'. He drives a Porshe who lives well in a palatial estate with a great view of the fair city. This is Russell Duritz. He is an image consultant for those who are on top or rising to it. His acclaim, he is Russell Duritz, he knows what it takes to do so. It seems like, as life is going fast and grounded, there is a problem, an intruder in your home, the alarm has been activated! <br /> <br /> Russell can not figure out (at the moment) what is happening to him. It is different and yet it is somehow familiar. A small boy, who looks exactly like him. As their lives run against each other, there seems to be a reason that is screaming at him: "You have unfinished business to care for now!" <br /> <br /> Amy the girl supporting the story is probably the best balance he has ever seen and has in his life. She works with him, holds her "ego" and yet she is in love with Russell. Very much. With Rusty's past 'me' now in the picture and speaking a mile a minute, singing very late at night, all that was key is becoming like jelly! Willis is fun, egocentric and sometimes out of his head in this lovely modern Disney classic 'The Kid' and to add his little heavyweight kicker Spencer Breslin is a perfect complement to this sparkling childhood story for adults and back to the adventure of childhood. Chi McBride is an inspirational supporting character as he is the heavyweight champion, teaching 'little' Rusty as a box to defend against the bullies on the playground. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a true winner of a film with Lillie Tomlin as Russell's assistant and secretary. Originally I saw this in 2000 and years later, with equal pleasure. This is a brilliant family comedy that has a super ending that will warm the hearts of any highly recommended Disney fan (*****)
