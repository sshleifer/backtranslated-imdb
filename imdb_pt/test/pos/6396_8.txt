My wife and kids are a good and funny series that really shows the concerns and problems that happen most even in the best families. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle (daddy) is a man who is always trying to stop his life. children to do teenage things like partying, drinking, loving or making love. When they do something wrong, he's there to fix them (by the way, he loves to make bad penalties). Janet 'Jay' Kyle (mother) has a strong personality and rarely agrees with her husband. . She understands that her children are teenagers and like to do "wrong" things, unlike Michael. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle 'Jr' is a dumb guy who believes in everything that other people say. At the beginning of the series, he is such a cool guy and tries to be like his father, but lately, I do not know why, he becomes a really dumb guy and he starts to be a troublesome guy. At the end of the series he falls in love with Vanessa and becomes father, or should I say, an idiot father who does nothing right. <br /> <br /> Kady Kyle is a typical teenager who loves to party, kiss and kiss. beverage. She has many problems with her parents because they invade her privacy a lot. She has a boyfriend named Tony who is Catholic and afraid of everything, so we can not understand what makes her go out with him. I remember an episode that they are prepared to have sex, but Michael Kyle scares Tony by claiming that sex is very dangerous and deadly, so he decides to protect himself until he is married. <br /> <br /> I continue this is the best series of my life and I still watch every day after 3 years, so I recommend it to all of you - especially for teenagers.
