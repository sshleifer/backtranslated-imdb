Valley Girl is an exceptionally well made movie with a great cast. Even though the dialogue is a little dated now, when the movie was released, it was really cool. To this day, I know many people (including teenagers) who can not form a sentence without using the word "like." This is undoubtedly the legacy that this movie will leave. A rating of 8 was given for this, as the most excellent film.
