Soderbergh is a fabulous director, but nothing he could conjure up could defeat the incredible cast he has assembled for this zenith of sequels. Clearly, he knew that from the beginning. The term "star vehicle" has traditionally been used to refer to a film that is built around a star. What this movie does is rescue a whole herd of Hollywood hot photos and make them shine even brighter than before. The last scene says it all - all stars sit with NOTHING happening and NOTHING being said. We can only watch them socialize as if it were a reality show scene where George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Don Cheadle are just leaving, being themselves. So the story is not important - at least it's not where the greatest pleasures of the movies come from. If you want a clever assault movie, it's best to be 11 years old. But if you look at the star excites you, it will make your day.
