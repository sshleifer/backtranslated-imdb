'Boogie Nights' uses its protagonist, Dirk Diggler, as a metaphor for a decade's accumulated celebrities in America's shameful past, which was made up of an unexpected increase in pornography, resulting in an abundance of corrupt young people. His main character lends traits to a variety of genuine actors, engaging in many illegal affairs that were involved by Hollywood celebrities and often exploited by the press. It seems like the tall tale type that can appear in an E! True Hollywood Story special. Drugs, sex and violence - the American dream. But what goes up has to come down, and the bigger, the harder it gets. <br /> <br /> Dirk Diggler's dreams are huge, as is another valuable asset in his body. Dirk's real name is Eddie Adams, a Californian who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives a great talent to every individual on the planet, and his gift is quite unusual. After breaking up with his mother, Eddie leaves the house and meets the despicable Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), an adult film director who offers him work. Eddie eventually becomes a big porn star, representing the leading "actor" in most of Horner's films. With new success, Eddie is informed that he needs to invent a new pseudonym for himself, and so Dirk Diggler is born. Eddie / Dirk himself is based mostly on infamous porn star John Holmes, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with "Wonderland" starring Val Kilmer. 'Boogie Nights' is arguably the best of both, proving that pornographic films can be done without disgust from your target audience: regular moviegoers. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 1977, an era of artistic artists. pornography - filmmakers really believed they could compensate for the low points of censored features by adding deep stories and a hypnotizing atmosphere. In a way, the director of the film - Paul Thomas Anderson - implements a very artistic approach of the project, resulting in a free and artistic film about a period of American history in which the pornography was really gratuitous and artistic. Anderson's style is so deep and so distinctive that we soon feel as if we are reliving the era firsthand. Not a moment passes in which we are not convinced of the time interval approached in the film. <br /> <br /> Not everything was happy on the set of 'Boogie Nights'. Before filming, Anderson approached Reynolds repeatedly, begging him often separately to play the role of Horner. Eventually, Reynolds agreed but claimed that the film was horrible and the worst part of his career, publicly denying it, before being nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and then shut up. A year earlier, Anderson had suffered title contests over Sydney / Hard Eight. He preferred the last title of his film, and New Line Cinema thought the former was more marketable. He essentially lost the battle, and Anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time by inserting the words "boogie nights" into his film through the mouth of a character. <br /> <br /> The cast of the film is one of his films. aspects. Paul Thomas Anderson goers are here, as are a whole slew of top-notch newbies. To name a few of the best known stars: John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Heather Graham and Julianne Moore. But the entire film essentially borders on Mark Wahlberg, like Eddie, who is surprisingly convincing in his role. Wahlberg, previously known for his singing career and disappointing in Hollywood, has all the necessary features to portray such a character. This is your best role to date. <br /> <br /> Anderson knows how to captivate his audience and take full control of every scene. When Jack Horner meets Eddie for the first time, Anderson cleverly uses stars in the background, a sign of what's to come, and the hidden symbolism is as sharp as possible. The opening scene is three minutes, a long trail following Jack and Amber in a nightclub where most of the characters are introduced for the first time. That reminds me of discussions about shooting shots in Robert Altman's 'The Player' - works so brilliantly in Boogie Nights, and it's the first indication that Anderson knows what he's doing behind the scenes. His style is accelerated in Martin Scorsese's vein, where the shots are fast but never seem rushed. Incidentally, Anderson makes reference to two classic scenes of Scorsese - the closing speech of the mirror of De Niro of 'Raging Bull' and the nightclub scene of 'GoodFellas'. Anderson is a young growing director who is remarkably mature in history and direction, despite his age. While his first feature film, 'Hard Eight', was remarkably wise and poignant, 'Boogie Nights' is even more so. <br /> <br /> The Boogie Nights began as an endeavor of love by the account of Paul Thomas Anderson. Having filmed the extraordinary Hard Eight in 1996, Anderson's film is pragmatic to such an extent that it almost seems genuine. Boogie Nights invigorates us with its free content, occasionally bordering on pornography, but it is much more sophisticated than this crap. It is a wonderful and brilliant modern masterpiece that is as explicitly stupid as it is wild and stylish. Arguably the best Anderson film and one of the biggest - and most important - projects of the last decade.
