Having just watched Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on the YouTube-linked Saturday Morning Blog, I used those same sources to watch a remake done in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks. The colors, compared to the previous black and white, are actually used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band players plays a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and draws the other or when dances with the another with part of the one that's gone - are as funny as the previous short. It gets a bit repetitive near the end. Still, it's worth seeing Skeleton Frolics for any fan of animation who wants to compare this with the previous Silly Symphony.
