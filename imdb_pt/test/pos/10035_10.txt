The film is excellent. One of the most noteworthy things is that Flynn's performance is superb. This is worth emphasizing, since he was often ridiculed as an actor by Bette Davis et al. <br /> <br /> I remember the scene where Flynn leaves Arthur Kennedy drunk to take him to his destination at the Battle of the Big Horn. The cool, calculating look on Flynn's face in doing so is extraordinary - far better than the much-praised Spencer Tracy or many other stars could have done. <br /> <br /> The other thing to note is George's excellent performance. P. Huntley Jr as Butler's own "Queen's Own". It's disconcerting why he stopped making movies shortly afterwards - someone would think he'd have been hired for years as an actor.
