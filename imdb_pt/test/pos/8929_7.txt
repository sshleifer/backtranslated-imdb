"Eighteen" (2004) tells the story of Pip Anders, a depressed and extremely cynical young man who distances himself from his dysfunctional upper-middle class family and lives on the streets of Vancouver. On his 18th birthday, he receives a cassette tape and a player from his recently deceased grandfather, reporting his memoirs of his own 18th birthday, spent serving with the British army in France, trying to help a mortally wounded comrade avoid capture by occupation. Germans. While Pip listens to the tape (Ian McKellen provided his grandfather's voice), we see the scenes he describes as flashbacks, alternating with daily scenes from Pip's life as well as more recent flashbacks filling in the obscure secret of why Pip left home and finds it impossible to trust someone who is good to him. An ambitious second film by writer / director Richard Bell ("Two Brothers"), with a polished look, excellent photography, well-stereotypical characters (with gays and heterosexuals equally treated) and laudable efforts in emotionally and physically demanding roles of some talented new actors (especially Paul Anthony as Pip and Brendan Fletcher as his 18-year-old grandfather). There is also a notable change by Alan Cummings as a priest who tried to help Pip, and a small supporting role played by Thea Gill ("Queer As Folk"). The complex story - in the director's own words, in his commentary on DVD - aims to conduct a "vortex of emotion" pushing Pip to his breaking point, and this is certainly done. My only criticisms are that the overall effect is too schmaltzy or artificial for an audience to identify, much of the very artificial and predictable support (and final) dialogue, and the direction needs to be sharper in order to reduce sloppy overcoming . some scenes. I recommend, 7 stars out of 10, including extra points for a remarkable effort.
