I could see this great movie at Fantasyfilmfest in Berlin and when I left the theater I felt like I was being drugged * g *! I actually saw many movies and there are only a few that I would call perfect like Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Subconscious Cruelty is now one of them! Half the people who attended in Berlin left the room and I can understand this absolutely because it can be a real shock to someone who lives in their perfect world day after day dreaming their dreams without thinking of the horror in our life. planet in our life! I do not think I have to describe the story of the movie to you because of the people who have written on this page! It's a movie that shows everything and more !!! You get 10 + 10 points !!! It would be nice if you, who also saw you in love, write me an e-mail! So far I have not found anyone as impressed and satisfied as me !!! Finally sorry for my bad english-I'm not a person studied (und das ist auch gut asi !!! :-)))))
