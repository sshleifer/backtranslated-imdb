This was a great show ... I do not remember much about it, but I remember watching and loving it. I remember the mother and the father. I really like Grandma. She was like a grandmother you really could not appreciate until you became an adult. She was very knowledgeable and without nonsense. My favorite song on the show was Sardines in the Morning. (which may not be the title) I remember after seeing that show and listening to that song that I went to Cleveland Ohio to visit my cousins ​​and me and my sister sang this song so much that the moment we left all my cousins ​​singing also. I would also love to find this on DVD.
