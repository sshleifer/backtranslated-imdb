What hurt this film is everyone and his Aunt Matilda is comparing it to his illustrious predecessor, which will always hurt any program. If you consider this as a Western, it's a good show. We find out how our characters in 'Lonesome Dove' end up in the situations in which they start. (For example: why two Texas Rangers, who live on adventures, end up in a dead city? performances are very good, and we see exactly the same mannerisms that the characters will have on the road. The actors did a great job. Cinematography was superb, and although music had not reached the legendary score of nearly two decades past, that was an impossible task, and it was still fine. <br /> <br /> It also helped that we have three episodes that you do not see in a miniseries anymore. Heck, it's totally impossible to see a two-part movie these days. <br /> <br /> Fans of the West, rejoice!
