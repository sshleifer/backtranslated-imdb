This movie is one of the best memories I have since childhood. Having always loved Tigers, my mother took me to see him. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely incredible. It's one of those movies that leaves a lasting impression on you. The image of tigers running through the snow with all the spraying is still in my head about 25 years, not many movies have managed this, as other reviews have said the photography is impressive. A must see. I've also been looking for the movie for some time without any luck. Checking Amazon from time to time does not reveal anything, not even listed. If anyone knows of a source, please contact me or post here.
