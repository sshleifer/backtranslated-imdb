If you distributed prizes to the world's most depraved and disgruntled movies, Japanese cinema would be clean: the movie theater scuttles the floor with most other competitors, the most extreme examples being absolutely sweeping and tasteless, nauseating. Guts of the bizarre strangeness and misogynistic sex. Guts of a Beauty is a great example of such great dirt, offering viewers over an hour of total debauchery and gratuitous violence that culminated in some very insane J-splatter Kindness. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a young woman named Yoshimi, whose search for her missing sister took her to the hands of some nasty yakuzas, who proceed to rape her and shoot her. full of strong drugs called Angel Rain. After the bandits have finished having fun with the poor woman, she is able to escape and runs off to a nearby hospital, where sexy psychologist Hiromi (Megumi Ozawa) tries to help. However, the disturbed and confused Yoshimi ends up throwing herself from the hospital roof, turning into a watermelon as she hits the floor (at least what looked to me!). Seeking to avenge Yoshimi's death, Hiromi lures Higashi, a member of the yakuza, into his office, and, while masturbating, hypnotizes him to attack his fellow gang members. After Higashi is happy with a knife in Yakuza's HQ, he is severely beaten and stabbed, forced to tell about his encounter with Hiromi, and then hacked into small pieces. <br /> <br /> The psychologist is then captured. by the gang, subjected to a forced buggy spot (while simultaneously being forced to give the head to a yakuza slut), and injected with Angel Rain, after she promptly carks it. The gangsters then place their body in the trunk of their car, along with the remains of Higashi, ready to be discarded. <br /> <br /> Before they can leave the corpses, the super-drug has an unexpected effect on Hiromi. : she returns from the dead like a hermaphrodite monster with a penis full of teeth and a voracious cut, and, determined to take revenge, begins to kill the yakuza one by one; this leads to some memorable scenes of outrageously bloody splashes, including a messy head sweat, a man being choked by the monster's dripping vagina, and a woman being screwed to death by her giant, creaking penis. <br /> <br /> You can probably tell from the above synopsis that this is a crazy and confusing thing, and probably not for the taste of the most sensible people, but for those freaks who have long grown tired of mainstream cinema and are already well-versed in Asian excess, Guts Of A Beauty should prove to be amusingly entertaining and devious. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.
