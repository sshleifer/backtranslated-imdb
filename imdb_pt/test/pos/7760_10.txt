Suzumiya Haruhi no yûutsu (The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) may at first glance make you think that this is just another comedy / drama of lively school. Well, it is not! The setting is just a school environment. This is a comedy, but very clever, with a lot of sarcasm. And the characters have a psychological sublimity that is almost in the same class that can be found in the works of Ingmar Bergman. The episodes are airy, it seems, out of order, that is, the pilot is actually episode 11. This makes it possible to present small clues to the next episodes. The show is an adaptation of Nagaru Tanigawa's popular novel series on Haruhi Suzumiya. <br /> <br /> And the story then? As in all episodes, the story revolves around Haruhi Suzumiya, who tries to ease her own boredom by embarking on adventures. Haruhi has no interest in ordinary humans, and actively seeks out aliens, time travelers and espers (people with supernatural forces). To find this kind of people, she has formed a club that she calls SOS-Brigade (Save the world by overloading it with fun: Haruhi Suzumiyas Brigade). With the exception of Haruhi, the other members of the SOS brigade are Kyon. He is the true protagonist of the show. It is from his point of view that we follow the story. He simply sat in front of the room when Haruhi had the idea of ​​forming the SOS Brigade. He's pretty skeptical of most club activities and tags, just to make sure Haruhi does not go too far, and he's the only one in the class Haruhi likes to talk to. Another member is Yuki Nagato, who is the "indispensable silent member" and is also the only remaining member of the Literature club, a room that the SOS Brigade occupied in pursuit of a free club. She does not care if SOS-Brigade uses her club, as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books. She also participates in the activities of the brigades. Mikuru Asahina was "voluntarily arrested" by Haruhi because the club needed a Lolita-looking mascot for anything suspicious to happen. She usually acts as a clerk for clubs. The last member is the always smiling Itsuki Koizumi, who happens to be the "mysterious student transferred" (meaning that he transferred two months to the semester that Haruhi considers qualified as mysterious). Haruhi thinks that all members except Kyon are randomly chosen at school, but they really have an interest in her.
