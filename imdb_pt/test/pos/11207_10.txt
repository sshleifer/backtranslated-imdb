For those who are like me and are accustomed to watching and enjoying high budget Hollywood movies on huge screens with an audio surround, this movie seems so far away. However, I was surprised at how close it can be to any human while I watch. It is so natural that you feel that no one wrote a scenario or no one directed it. You're the director and you're writing the scenery while watching. For me, the time I spend watching a movie is the only time I go to another world. This movie is the first example for me that shows that it is not always a must to watch millions of dollars of budgeted movies, surround audio features to go to another world. This movie sends you to another world (or perhaps makes you come back to yourself) without millions of dollars in budget or technical capabilities. I felt like I was reading L'etranger de Camus.
