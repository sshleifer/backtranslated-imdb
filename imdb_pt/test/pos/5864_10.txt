I remember this movie as the other person who commented said. I recorded about it, but I would like to have it now just because it had to be one of the worst movies of all time. Funny, in a very bad way. I remember that the slogan in the box was "The Ultimate Frontal Lobotomy". I got it from my mom, who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst movie she had ever seen, so my mom said "My son will probably love it". and the woman gave her just to get him out of his possession. I later recorded it, of which I regret it. I also remember that the "corck screw" thing was one of those ball collector things ... the cone-shaped things yellow, with a red "button" at the end, and when you hit the red thing, it sends a ball flying. Well, they used that with a crank at one end and a corkscrew at the funnel. When the assassin killed, they showed him approaching the "weapon" and then cut what appeared to be raw chicken and fake blood on the victim's head. I do not know what else to say about this "jewel" except that if you like bad movies, it does not get any worse than that.
