Situated in and close to a poor working class town in the mountains of rural Italy, it is a story of madness. The landscape can be quite picturesque, but here there is a madness hidden behind the mask of a person who looks outwardly normal. This person kills little children. <br /> <br /> In style and tone, this film resembles Dario Argento's famous Italian giallos, those fascinating whodunit horror movies, except that the Argento films are much prettier. Still, Fulci's "Do not torture a duck" looks competent, with some interesting compositions and lighting. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night increase suspense in a sequence in which one of the "ducklings" is vulgarly alone. <br /> <br /> In a sequence, the blood is a bit exaggerated. But this is not a horror movie. A legitimate theme strengthens history. And this theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious illusions of people who practice voodoo or black magic. <br /> <br /> Many red herrings make it difficult to solve the puzzle if the viewer does not take on a director's agenda. Do not dismiss someone who may not seem suspicious. The twisting near the end provides a good unfolding. However, in a midway scene, a line of dialogue could have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of whom is the killer. The end of the movie takes place on top of a mountain with the wind whistling in the background. We see flashbacks to clues and get insight into killer mentality. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the widescreen projection of the movie. But the background music is effective, and ranges from startlingly scary to inconspicuous jazz, to Italian indigenous songs. Acting is usually medium, although in some cases, it is a little overdone. <br /> <br /> Although not as visually brilliant as the Argento gyms, "Do not Torture A Duckling," however, is a great movie that contains a thematic plot and enough of a puzzle whodunit to interest the majority of viewers who like thrillers and murder mysteries.
