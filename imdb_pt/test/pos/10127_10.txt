Radio was a very good movie, and honestly, I never cry in movies. But that got me pretty close to tears. This really caught me when Radio's mother died and he just did not leave the room. I felt very sad about how, if you were mentally retarded, you would not really be able to understand death. I really liked the movie, and you have to see it.
