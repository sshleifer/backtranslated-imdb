City Streets is incredibly modern technically speaking for a movie made in 1931. Nor could it be hypnotized, fascinated by the powerful magnetism of Gary Cooper, galvanizing the public's attention. The plot is quite elaborate and clear. The scenery, decor, are exceptional in every detail. All the actors are above average. I keep guessing how the director and his staff, including editing, sound, lighting, photography, could have been so brilliant. I could not find a glitch, understanding that the scenes on the road (rough ride) with the big movie screen in the background were the best they could get in 1931. Despite everything, I found this movie excellent and very lively thanks to Gary's charisma Cooper.
