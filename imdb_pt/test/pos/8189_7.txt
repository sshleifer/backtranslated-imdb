Chen Kaige lost his sense of rhythm. I envy the Europeans and Americans who can watch the film without following the dialogue with their ears because it is painful to do so: slow, abnormally heavy and overly deliberate. But Westerners, on the other hand, suffer from the poor quality of the translation of subtitles, which manages to lose all the subtlety and double meaning that make a careful study of the film so much fun.
