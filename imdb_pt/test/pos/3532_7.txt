I was putting off buying this since its release on DVD? on the one hand because I was a bit disappointed with the director's other two horror titles (SQUIRM [1976] and BLUE SUNSHINE [1977]) but also the fact that the film itself would have been slightly trimmed Media Blasters / Shriek Show 2-Disc Set! I now happen upon it as a rental and am I glad that I did? because, not only is it superior to previous efforts (at least in this preliminary assessment), but I also found the film to be one of the best imitations of MASSACRE DA SERRA DE CADEIA DO (1974). This factor, however, only helped me remember that I still have to check another example? The Wes Craven classic, THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977), whose edition of the 2-Disc R1 from Anchor Bay I bought some time ago, but, after all, Halloween is fast approaching ... <br /> < (was filmed in the forest and mountainous regions of Oregon)? with many effective frissons, but fortunately, not much violence (even if the last of the villains is despatched in a very outrageous way!). The young lead cast here (one of them played by the son of Jack Lemmon, Chris) is not as nasty as the ones we normally find in this kind of genre? despite giving in freely to the antics we associate with teen films and which, in general, persist to this day! George Kennedy appears as a nice patrolman; although he does not have much to do, his characterization is decidedly enhanced by making him a lover of animal and plant life. Also notable among locals is the well-known actor Mike Kellin in a cool role as the drunk who first comes in contact with the murderous duo of the narrative? his warning to teens naturally goes unnoticed, but he is later able to take Kennedy to them. <br /> <br /> The hermetic family that teenagers find in the forest, then, turns out to be hidden in a skeleton. your closet. While one of the girls displays genuine curiosity in the presence of the intruders, is the rest openly hostile to them? and, in the case of the corpulent and rude twins, suitably creepy (one of them is even prone to maniacal laughter during his attacks); at some point in the narrative, the Archer even offers an interesting explanation as to the nature of his aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior.
