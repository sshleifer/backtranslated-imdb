This was one of my favorites as a child. My family had the soundtrack of 8 tracks !! It took us years (until I was 20) to get a video of the movie (my dad recorded HBO or something). Every summer, when we go to the beach (my mother, brother, sister and me), we lie on the beach and sing all the songs in this movie !!! LOVED IT!!!
