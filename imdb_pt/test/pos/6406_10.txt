Key West, for a very short time, was "TV nomination" for my family. I'd stop by Red Lobster and pick up a Party Tray for the night I was in. The irony of the situation was that I was working for a Fox affiliate at the time, and everyone at the station was furious with them, not renewing the program. Everyone in this cast was excellent. Fisher Stevens ... perfect. Who could not help but identify with an "ordinary man" who dreams of being a writer in Key West? Jennifer Tilly has always been remarkable (and she is a fan of a Texas Hold'em player). You can still find the pilot episode on YouTube. I wish they would post the hurricane. This episode alone should have earned an Emmy, just like the rest of the cast.
