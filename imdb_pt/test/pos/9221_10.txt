I loved it, but I'm an 80's kid. I loved Rainbow Bright all my childhood. I do not know if the little ones these days would be very interested in the show, mine was not. (But okay, I bought it for myself anyway. I just brought the little one so the guy in the box did not look funny to me.) I love non-violent drama, and colorful scenery. It reminds me of a simpler time before the cartoons had more violence than our local news can legally show. :) Although I might be just a bit biased about it. After all I was Rainbow Bright 6 years in a row for Halloween ........ I wonder if they make a bright rainbow fantasy for adults. I laughed a lot.
