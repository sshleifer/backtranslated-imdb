Black Scorpion is Roger Cormen's Batman. Which is cool and has a lot of cool stuff in this movie. Like the Breathtaker being a cross between Doctor Doom and Darth Vader, this is cool. The mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the Mad Hatter. The Cormen B-movie style is all this dog that is not always a good thing. There are plenty of acrobatics and yummy to make any happy action fan. This movie, the good out weighs the bad. But if you are not one for the comic books, then I advise you not to watch Black Scorpion, however, if you like comic books like movies and do not care if it has already been a comic book before. So check out the BLACK SCORPION, because for me I give 8 STARS.
