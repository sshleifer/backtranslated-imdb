What the hell do people expect in horror movies nowadays anyway. Does it have to be something horrible like "SAW" or is it just crap ... ??? Now, I do not pretend to be an expert, but I'm about 47, I've seen and I have literally thousands of movies, and I honestly think that this director really gave this film a good, sincere effort. Believe me, I was getting ready to cringe as soon as the dialogue started, assuming it would be awful and I was pleasantly surprised. It's no Mamet script, for sure; but Come on !!! with all the HORRIBLE trash out there, ESPECIALLY in Horror, I found this was CLOSER at the top of the pile than most. <br /> <br /> The director has used many intelligent and organized camera angles; the soundtrack was excellent and melancholy, perfect for the environment needed for this type of film. The editing and the timing were very good. And he did not resort to the worn-out clich√© of excessive slasher violence; for example ***** SPOILER MINOR ***** During an absolutely delicious and totally free (but tasty ..., uh, I mean taste good) bare shower scene I totally expect it to be cut and chopped; but, INCREDIBLY, we just started to enjoy its heavenly beauty and that's it ***** END SPOILER MINOR ***** In addition, the tension was built very well, leading to a very ambiguous end, where you do not have sure of what it is. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; We see the doll actually talking to her, but in the video recording we do not. In addition, the mother sees Pinnochio moving and being quite unpleasant; so are both the mother and daughter mentally ill ... ??? There is also the original 'killer' and what the mother had imagined about a possible influence of Evil. But even with all this, we still are not sure who was doing the killing ***** END SPOILER ***** So, in spite of everything, I believe it was a good, strong and sincere effort to create some good old-style Full Moon style and with MANY restrictions on violence. And no typical SLEAZE thrown in for no reason (just the lovely, innocent, beautiful shower scene, which I'll remember at the end of my days ... :) Compared to the absolute MINDLESS drivage out there, a DEFINITE, STRONG 8 / 10 !!!
