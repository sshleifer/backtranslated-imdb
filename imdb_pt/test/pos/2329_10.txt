I love military comedies (Sgt. Bilko, Stripes, In the Army Now, Major Payne) and Down Periscope is hilarious but has a heart too. <br /> <br /> The Stingray SS-161 (The USS Pampanito was beautiful. <br /> <br /> Absolutely beautiful, a work of art came to life. <br /> <br /> So it was a diesel sub engine, so what? I learned that the USS aircraft carrier Ranger (which meant The Enterprise in Star Trek IV), a huge ship, was 'conventionally moved', which could mean that the Ranger was also a diesel. Favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Buckman , this can is on the stingray from Korea! <br /> <br /> This may expire in 1966. Buckman: (Pick up your finger and proof) <br /> <br /> Pascal: Buckman: That would be a problem. <br /> <br /> This story, perhaps a little tense, seemed plausible. <br /> <br /> Winslow respected Dodge and seemed to care about him, so he wanted to give a chance at Dodge. He gave him a battered Balao class submarine, but still able to navigate, and assigns him the task of using the diesel submarine to flee the Marinhorn to nuclear and "attack" Charlston Harbor and Norfolk. Admiral Graham, 2-star (with his eye on his third star and a grudge against the Dodge), ascribed to the crew disorganized, expecting them to spoil everything, so Dodge would lose. Tom Dodge manages to speed up the team and work as a team, and can he get an old and outdated sub and beat the best of the Navy?
