Ed (coincidentally a publisher) is hired to cut horror movies to be favorable in Europe (where the standards are much more stringent). But he finds the movies very mind-boggling and starts to get a little crazy. Okay, "a little bit" may be a euphemism. <br /> <br /> Let me first say: the better. opening. scene. ever. A man in an office blowing his head off with a grenade. Your boss then says - with a serious face - "you're fired." The whole movie does not maintain that level of intensity, but it certainly tries. <br /> <br /> Take the shotgun scenes, the beheading, the clips of "Lost Members" (which my friend Jason wanted them to be a real movie). ). The writer of this movie thought the idea of ​​a woman being raped by a beaver and then immediately afterwards is shot in the face with a bazooka. This is something you will not find in any other movie (at least I doubt you do). <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw of this movie is the quality. The picture is not as sharp as a 1997 movie should be, and the sound can be retouched (though not bad). I thought I was watching a movie from the 80's. Although it gave me a boost in my mind - the movie also had the 80's style of writing and directing it: a sense of fun and giving the audience something a bit more exaggerated. I miss those days. <br /> <br /> I wish I had more to say, although at the moment I can not think of anything strong enough to praise this movie. I think you should see this. You saw the box in your video store with the ax splitting your head ... maybe you've gone a few times. Maybe you thought it would be cheesy. Take. Enjoy yourself.
