I captured this 1969 film at TCM one night. I remember when I first saw the movie in Hong Kong, I really enjoyed the songs and performances of Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. I love Clark better in Francis Ford Coppola's "Finian's Rainbow" (1968), opposite Fred Astaire, Don Francks and Tommy Steele. Simply ecstatic to know that finally this delicious pot of Irish-flavored gold is released on DVD! Ah, "it's that old demonic moon (in your eyes)." <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Mr. Chips - yes, he sang - a great deliverance. He may not be a veteran in musicals like Rex Harrison, but he dwelt wonderfully in the role. His scene running through the lawn on his flying cape reminds me of the PBS series, "To Serve Them All My Days" - an adorable teacher and a loving man, he is: 'Mr. Chipey. Clark and O'Toole somehow gave us the right blend of courage and circumstance. The songs and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse are captivating, as usual. The melodies of "You and Me" and "Walk the World (with me)" stayed with me more during all these years. And there is "That many flowers," "And heaven smiled," "Fill the world with love" - ​​not honeyed. Sometimes I think that if the world is immersed in the songs and words of Bricusse, we would overcome all the struggles on earth and 'loving ones' will be all our days! Yes, "Talk to the animals" too. ("Doctor Doolittle" 1967) Musicals are a boon to the world of the spectators, they are somehow greater than life. Like the music and lyrics of the Sherman brothers (Richard M. and Robert B.) who gave us "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" (1968) and "Mary Poppins" (1964) - they would not feel absolutely delighted simply by saying "superexifragilisticexpialidocious" "I was tickled by just a number of music and dance featured in the Spanish movie" Km.0 - Kilometer Zero. "(2000) My favorite of all time is the French filmmaker's" Young Girls of Rochefort "(1967) Jacques Demy, with colorful cast of Catherine Deneuve and (older sister) Françoise Dorléac, Jacques Perrin, Michel Piccoli, Danielle Darrieux, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris singing, dancing The music of Michel Legrand.
