I entered the cinema, with no expectations for the movie I was about to witness, "Everything is Illuminated." I left with a joy that I hardly ever felt with American movies. Leiv Schreiber's film debut accompanies a man on his journey through the past, accompanied by an eccentric group that includes a malicious English-language punk from the Eukraine, his grandfather who believes he is blind and his dog Crazy. The first half of the movie is funny and clever, with an extremely European flavor in the use of small, but wonderful characters, while the second half of the movie descends into a dark history of discovery and holocaust. This little film brings so many emotions, and so many colors, with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story of enlightenment, but also of relationships and connections. The acting is unbelievably powerful, the story mysterious and interesting, and the artistic appeal of cinematography, to die for. With some brilliant and absolutely touching scenes, "Everything is Illuminated" has captured my heart.
