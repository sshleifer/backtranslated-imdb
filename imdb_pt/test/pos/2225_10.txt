I'm having so much fun reading user comments about watching the movie! It seems like this is the classic or "Love it" or "Hate it" movie. And I have to say that I'm not just on the "Love it" side, I'm going on a limb to say this this my favorite movie, ever! Thank God I found it first. Almost impossible to find, I was lucky about ten years ago to record a UHF channel late at night. Of course, my taste for Sellers can make me a bit biased, but I can not see how someone with a cornball, dry sense of humor (like me) can not be in love with this movie. The plot is great (but maybe as a previous poster said, maybe the reason why it is not a widely known film ... disturbing the medical field?) The acting is great (I can see why some might say that the acting was horrible .. but that's what made this movie so good ... it's total and moody) and the humor is destructive. I am proud to say that I watched this movie no less than 20 times and I have practically all the lines memorized. This movie is great !!
