Of all episodes of all series, this is the closest to the original Roddenberry principle. According to the book THE STAR TORQUE, in Roddenberry's screenwriter, he states that any alien creature, no matter how horribly ugly, unbelievable, benign or malicious, SHOULD have some semblance of humanity that the television audience may have empathy with and / or relating. The HORTA of the Dark Devil, which resembles nothing more than a large bubble of cow dung, is a mother protecting her babies, those ball-shaped silicon nodules that the miners keep finding in the mine passages and destroying, because they have no idea what they are! This is one of my absolute favorite episodes if only for this!
