I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about a former Vietnam prisoner of war in Laos who escaped, but I did not know much more. Actually, I was not expecting much. Oh, what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what distinguishes this film from other types of biography is that Dieter himself tells most of the story. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. Your personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during World War II and the difficulties. We are there with him in the same small town he describes his family, inspirations and struggles. We follow you to America and your way to fulfilling your dream of being a pilot. Then Dieter describes his story of capture, escape and survival in the jungle of Laos. We are again with him in that same jungle in describing and reenacting his imprisonment and way to freedom in great detail. We see the same primitive huts, villagers and forms of detention with which he dealt, which have not really changed for 30 years. We see the thick jungle, the hilly terrain and the rivers that Dieter faced during his escape. This helps us understand their emotions, pain and suffering. I liked the man, the history and the style. Work well done!
