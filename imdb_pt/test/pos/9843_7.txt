James Cagney (The Yankee Doodle Dandy Boy) was just beginning his career and was able to act as a gangster and also as a social worker at a Boys' Reform School, which is being run by corrupt politicians. Reform school inmates are underprivileged on the streets of New York, such as the "East Side Kids," who were poor and neglected during the Great Depression. In the final scenes, there is a trial conducted by the boys of the reform school with torches lit and a barn that is set on fire and a big leap from the corrupt director. I noticed they released the horses from the barn first. This movie is not shown very often and I can really understand WHY!
