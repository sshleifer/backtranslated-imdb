I watched this hoping to see the usual stereotypes of rigid British upper lips and was surprised to see the remarkably natural and dyed black humor dialogue. It was more like Eastenders goes to the sea than what we serve. The scenes during approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their description of a combat vessel and the ups and downs between the ship's company (at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some of the disposable lines are very witty ("I'm not joining the Band of Hope just to please a fatty fish fryer!") My only complaint is that they did not show what happened to the Irish coxswain and his fiancee. or the tattooed PO and his tattoo "I Love Arabella"!
