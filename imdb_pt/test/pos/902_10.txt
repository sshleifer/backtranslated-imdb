I'm having a holiday in hong kong now, and I just saw gen y cops at the movies .... what can I say ... it was so cool !! <br /> <br /> Everything you could wish for was in it! Basically ... just see if you can ... I'll have my friend send me the vcd when he's released ... <br /> <br /> The only bad thing was the dishonest American talking style employed by some of the hl actors ... like Edison ... "Hey, my man?!" but he added even more humor to it ... hhehe <br /> <br/> See ... especially if you like any of the following genres: HKfilm, action, comedy, science fiction! SEEITMAN !! Edison made a good song for this too ... so download ... Edison Tse - Heroes
