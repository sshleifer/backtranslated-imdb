With the timing of your ww2, falling in and out of love, and easy on the Kira eye, that's re-Atonement. <br /> <br /> This is a relationship story with key characters focused on balancing the first and fastest love in front of WW2. The poet Dylan Thomas dates his journey between his wife and ex in the dark and smoky Blitz of London and later in the valleys of the winds. <br /> <br /> Vera's ex and the next exhale each other as the poet and the soldier become a side line as the girls unite and share. An easy watch that works well at the time jumping along with just a few dives in rhythm. It would work well with French subtitles, but I may have gone to many art films lately.
