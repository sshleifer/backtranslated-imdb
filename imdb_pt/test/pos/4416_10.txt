One of America's most sublime masterpieces, Morrissey opens the film sexualizing Dallesandro, with his mouth open snoring on a pillow. We wonder, is he dating a tall heroine? We just see your face, then, shine, your body, flash, your bare back. I can not think of another movie that used this form of flash-blip editing as well to create a hypnotic, drugged mood, an editing method that works wonderfully like rhythm and style. After this introduction, when Dallesandro opens his mouth, his accent is shocking - we expect him to be some kind of soft-spoken androgyne; instead, he has the voice of a street thug - Morrissey is not comfortable letting our assumptions go uncontrollable. The long opening is very sexy and fun - it's a combination of martial problems, Dallesandro's fascinating lip kisses and early-night sexual escapades; everything flows together, if not always smoothly, then emotionally realistically. <br /> <br /> What I got from it was the same thing I got from "The 400 Blows" when I first saw it - this is like a continuation of 20's of that story. There is a sense of camaraderie between the meat vendors and the buyers; when Dallesandro walks down the street in search of men (to fund his wife's miscarriage), there is the sense of a secret handshake when the boys make deals with each other. I never find it boring, although nothing happens - nothing happens brilliantly, the boys stay around, like them, waiting for tricks. The main trick that Dallesandro finds is fascinating to watch, using Greek descriptions and just touching his back, a form of adoration of the aesthetic body on the part of the man. It's also terribly funny ("I'm not talking to an empty bed, am I?"). It's one of the most revealing scenes in the movie - in any movie, I think; certainly any movie that deals with sex and sex on sale. When Dallesandro's eyes look red and swollen, we can not tell if it's because he's drunk, embarrassed, ashamed, or all. <br /> <br /> The conversations in the movie are cut - they do not matter. (The movie is missing out on some scenes, some of the most poignant and beautiful you can try.) However, when Morrissey chooses to include one, the way he includes it (we kind of put things together), it's amazing how a conversation between Dallesandro and a rookie, and none of them ever mentioned the word "gay" or "hustler." What follows is a scene in which we hear a couple of transvestites while Dallesandro is taken care of - this after explaining to the beginner "getting used to" the work. <br /> <br /> Dallesandro is a subject worthy of attention paid to him, both by his clients and by Morrissey. He is less than effective as an actor in the sense of acting, but insofar as he reveals something, he is incredible - he is someone we immediately want to feel above, but we go through his experiences, with all his complexities, and we Re forced to try to meet him. It is the kind of blank slate we are drawn to but can not handle. And of course he is incredibly impressive - forgetting everything else, this is partly a testament to the beauty of the male body, Dallesandro's handsome torso and permanently upright nipples. <br /> <br /> The film has a devastating scene, but like everything else you can not dominate it - a girl says she was raped, and her only self-defense is to say that, if the rapist just asked for sex, she would have gotten a better posture. It's breaking. The film has feeling for everyone, but even better than that, it's not just sympathetic, it really tries to help us understand humans - and without ever dictating what it is we're being understanding. Do not look down nor glamorize the people inside the movie. It seems all-inclusive when we see Joe's arm around a transvestite. When he reads a letter (he talks about not getting past the eighth grade at one point), he is totally charming, when he pauses in a word ... then says "woteva" and continues. <br /> <br /> You can learn something deeper from the interaction between Dallesandro and one of your clients in terms of heterosexual relationships than with any case study. Here we have the boy who smiles (his upper lip disappears when he does it) when a 30-something Korean war veteran runs his fingers through his hair; it's a scene that looks very deep, this adult man sharing something with a younger version of himself - there are two gay men together, or a gay man paying a straight man, it's another thing you can not put your finger on; issues are irrelevant. (Never before having appeared a spine seemed so affectionate.) After sharing something with each other emotionally (though with Dallesandro, since he is there for money, it is never apparent because he is there; although he is never less sincere, which can be the most disarming quality), "So ... can you help me?" The man says so. "I do not want to say my pants!" 10/10
