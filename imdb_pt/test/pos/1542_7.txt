Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney), decided that the city is too busy and dangerous for their family, so they packed their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and their daughter (Tammy Lauren) and returned to a lake like that Rachel lived like a child. <br /> <br /> They say you can not go home again, but this is an ideal country house with what at first looks like a Mayberry feel. Later, the residence seems to be more like the people at Deliverance. Soon the bodies begin to appear and all appear suspicious, except for a few friendly faces. This does not stop the family from enjoying running and playing in the woods. <br /> <br /> We think they have to be super ignorant to find the secrets and not tell anyone until they are caught as the antagonists. <br /> <br /> Can the young Stevie ignored save his parents or his persecutor (s) will put his foot in it? <br /> <br /> This film is more than most parodies with narrow faces. They could not have chosen better actors and Daryl Anderson was exceptionally scary. An added bonus is that they let us know what's going on before the characters find out, instead of taking a hint of the hat after the fact. Anyway this made for the TV movie is good for some laughs.
