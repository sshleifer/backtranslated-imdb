If you pick up Huxtable's parents and mix them up with Kyle's parents, you'll have a perfect combination of higher and lower education that you may wish for your own early childhood education skills. The best part of each program is that parents do not go out as a high class and hypocritical knows everything but at the same time they are not stereotyped and under-educated parents who are constantly cheated and disrespected by their children. My children are 20, 16 and 6; almost the same ages as Kyle's children and I see many of their situations mirroring my own experiences with my family. The foolishness in which they indulge only shows that when you have love in your family, you do not have to take yourself too seriously to keep your family together and have fun with your children.
