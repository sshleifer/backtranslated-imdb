Norma Shearer dazzles as she is transformed from a frusty, brain-addle home-wife to a seductive potential divorcee. Most 1930s movies have a bad edge - camera work is sometimes too slow - but we must forgive those pleasures that speak for their "qualities." As a guest of the eccentric traveling traveler, Marie Dressler - Shearer mingles with a strange variety of passionate types, including her long lost husband. The dialogue is fun, often clever and the performances at the suggestion. Shearer and Dressler shine brighter. Shearer even shows her piano experience in a musical brevity. Her bizarre and attractive posture and "camera case" are evident everywhere - and she reaches all the emotional, genuine, and on target markings. For your time. . a good show.
