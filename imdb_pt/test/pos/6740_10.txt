How many of us read a book or watched a play, and when the movie version came out, we were terribly disappointed? Well, maybe this is one of those films for anyone who saw the piece as well, but as someone who has never had the opportunity to see on stage, I was extremely entertained by this movie. The characters were funny, the music was great, and the story was interesting and made you feel genuine empathy for the characters, flaws and everything. Jonathan Silverman has a good comic timing, and his lines are especially hilarious. I'm not going to give any spoilers, it's just a well-done and funny movie showing the inner workings of a middle-class family during World War II. So if you've never seen the play, and if you liked other Neil Simon movies, do not get caught up in the negative reviews seen here. On its own, Brighton Beach Memoirs is a great movie. I guarantee this (no money back, though).
