Sergei Eisenstein's most famous film really stood the test of time. The story of a riot aboard a warship in 1905 has the feel of Soviet propaganda, but does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt. The scene on the Odessa steps must remain marked in anyone's mind. <br /> <br /> Okay, so "The Battleship Potemkin" was not the first film to use the montage, but they did a great job with it here. Of course, any movie history class should show this movie. It's a great historical drama (although I admit I do not know how accurate it is). A 10/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and we should have already learned that "Potemkin" should be transliterated as "Potom√≠nkin".
