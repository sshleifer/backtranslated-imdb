I'm not sure if these other people saw the movie - some apparently could not follow the "complicated plot". He is a billionaire who owns an oil company that ALSO happens to hunt big hunters - this is very unlikely. Anyway - his new "drill machine" breaks through a glacier and on the other side is a separate world of our time, where dinosaurs and cave men roam. Nothing groundbreaking, but certainly not ridiculous. Anyway, the rest of the film is about that T-Rex they meet (which the billionaire, Boone, claimed to be there) hunting them and hunting them. Look - it's an old TV movie - of course the special effects look extravagant - they did not have CG - they did the best they could and for an MFTVM, they did a great job by the time. This movie should be redone for the big screen - I would love it and would be the first in line. Seeing that dinosaur with modern day specials chasing these guys would be great!
