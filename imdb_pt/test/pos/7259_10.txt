This movie has almost everything. The action is cool, it's funny, 2 great leaders and a really nasty villain that I really hated. Not many movies have bad bad guys. Just mostly comic villains. He really deserves a powerful kick. <br /> <br /> Jake Scott really has the talent of his father to know how to do great visuals. The steering is flawless and feels light and irresistible. I usually do not like movies set in the old days, but this I liked a lot because it plays a boring role like many other period films (Sense and Sensibility, Age of Innocence and the absolute worst ... Lady and the Duke). This will restore your faith. Thanx mostly for Craig Armstrong's incredible score. The music is both atmospheric and ethereal and in action scenes is very exciting. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and has an anamorphic image 2.35: 1 very grainy and muddy.
