I've watched several Pauly Shore movies, but that's the only one I liked. Of course it helps a lot less irritating than usual, maybe even a little nice. The rest of the cast does a good job, especially underrated Carla Gugino. The film itself is basically a silly, harmless comedy, and although some of the jokes are especially funny, the movie is a lot of fun overall.
