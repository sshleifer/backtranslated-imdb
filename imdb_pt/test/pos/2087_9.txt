this is the movie is probably one of the best I've seen so far. I'd put it just second to All About Lily Chou-chou because it kind of gives me the same vibes ... '9 souls' are about 9 prisoners who have just escaped from prison to go and find some counterfeit money stored in a time capsule at Mount Fuji Primary School. Later, they discover that there is not much there and depart in their own ways. the first half of the movie is just a moment for the characters to be presented and for the main points to be indicated. is a comic and yet serious part of the journey. the second half brought me to tears. As the movie progresses, each character goes and tries to fulfill their dreams, but unfortunately ends a little badly. in the end only 2 of the 9 fugitives are left. the way each character left the scene was very sad and you will probably feel tears in your eyes. a beautiful film directed fantastically. this is a movie for people who liked other Toshiaki Toyoda movies like 'Blue Spring'.
