Return to Me is a movie that you will want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. The story, though seemingly impossible, aspires to divine intervention when a man loses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives the heart of his wife. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm performances such as those designed to be lovers who meet by chance. But the true story lies in the friends and family who love and support them in times of trial. Carol O'Connor, as the grandfather of Minnie Driver, is authentic in every scene. Bonnie Hunt as the friend whose wit and encouragement underscore that Minnie is a "sister" is funny, yet warm in the scenes, especially with James Belushi as her husband. Classic scenes and writing make this story so enjoyable and touching to watch over and over again. Thank you for making a film that demonstrates families and friends as united people who love each other in difficult times.
