This is one of the best horror / thriller movies that Hollywood has done in years or maybe even decades. Even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts, it has everything a good movie in this genre should have. ! SURE WAX HOUSE DELIVERY !!! In some places this was a bit overdone, the performance was not that good, but my overall rating for the HOUSE OF WAX is eight in ten ... if you like to be on the edge of your seats, just the right movie for you, I have to admit, it was kind of seeing the whole city made of wax ...... I even like these museums, but after seeing this movie I'll look at them in a whole new way different!
