this movement was intriguing and absorbing; however, the story was a bit unstable and difficult to follow sometimes. Although the two main actors did a great job, seeing Senn Penn acting with every fiber of his being and stealing every frame made this film a memorable film. Subsequent movies revealed that he was not just a paper actor: he also showed a comedic twist in Sweet and Lowdown. Surprisingly talented and not lighthearted I used to think he was.
