Growing up in the late 60's and 70's I could not help but become a science fiction fan. With America's space program at high speed, science fiction books, movies, TV shows and comics fueled my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe. Farscape is so unlike any other science fiction show, but it has all the ingredients that made shows like Star Trek, Battlestar Gallatica, X-Files and the personal favorites of Deep Space Nine. One of the criticisms of Farscape is that the casual viewer can not simply come in and watch an episode and understand what's going on. There were other very successful shows that used multi-episode arcs and complicated characters. This to me is one of the charms of the show. I do not need or want to have the whole story tied up at the end of each episode as the various incarnations of Star Trek did. All in all, Farscape has wonderful and funny characters and a running story that says that although humans may be the least evolved or advanced intelligent species in the universe, they still have unique qualities and abilities. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, myopic people on the Sci-Fi channel canceled Farscape's fifth season. They stated that the cancellation was based on flaccid assessments. However, only a few years ago, it was their original most voted and critically-favored series. It's a shame that all the artists who help to create this show can not continue their love work because of the tax problems of the channel itself that have made it all possible in the first place. <br /> <br /> Hey, do not take my word for it, watch the show, watch the reruns and make your own opinion. Help save Farscape!
