The Regard of Flight, written and performed by Bill Irwin, is a true classic play that translates very well to the small screen. Filled with quick and flickering dialogues and some of the best physical comedies of the decade, it's head and shoulders above 99% "Comedy" as it is presented today. I am sure that one day he will take his rightful place with great programs like "The Fantastiks" and "Waiting for Godot". Why not available on DVD is still a mystery and a tragedy.
