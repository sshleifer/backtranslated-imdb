This is the kind of movie I grew up with. It is great fun for the family, which kids love and parents also enjoy. I wish more movies like this were made. It's a great story about a little boy who creates a bull with his mother and sister and shows all the way to the Grand National Championship where he wins! Then he is afraid that someone will prepare his bull, so he kidnaps him and goes home with him. I was very excited when I first saw this movie at the movies and was surprised to see George Strait, Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis in this little movie. The song was great with all sorts of big country names like Willie Nelson and Dixie Chicks. Who does not like this movie, has no children or has never been a child.
