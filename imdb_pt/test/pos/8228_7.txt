Do a title search on Randolph Scott and TRAIL STREET is the missing movie on the list you saw. One of the four films that Scott did at the RKO during its heyday (1947) the others are always easy to get. Liberal, Kansas, is southwest of Dodge City and is a barrel of gunpowder about to explode between the riders driving the longhorns to Trail Street, the city's main street, and the jerks that feed our bellies. It will take a strong man like Bat Masterson to get between the two groups and bring the city to order. More I will not say except that Scott's films usually have only one beautiful girl and this one has three. RANDOLPH SCOTT has always played men you could admire for his sense of honor, courage, determination and willingness to do the right thing. Fifty years ago, parents could send their children to a Scott movie with confidence that they would learn positive values. ROBERT RYAN co-starred in this film, playing a good guy for a change. In real life, RYAN was one of many WWII HEROES that starred in American films. How sad what we have today. George Clooney teaches our young men that we should sympathize with the suicide bombers, while Steven Spielberg teaches that there is no moral difference between the 1972 Olympic athletes in Munich and the Palestinian terrorists who killed them. Hollywood 2005 derives its moral compass from a lot of cocaine and a lot of commitment to the crazy left. I wonder how this all happens in Liberal, Kansas. Liberal, after all, was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named.
