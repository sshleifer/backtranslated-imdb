"All men are guilty," says the police chief. "They are born innocent, but they do not last." Add this bit of nihilism to the fascination of Jean-Pierre Melville with the idea of ​​the villain's code of honor and you will have Le Cercle Rouge. This code of honor among thieves, however, is not simply a cliché; is an invention of the imagination, even when movie moralists - moralists who are realistic for their views, romantic moralists by most others - have begun to make films about the subject. Its theme is that it is not what you do, but how you do it. We often end up with stories about experienced men with their own sense of honor, stories in which fate, fatalism, and the code deal with things. <br /> <br /> For most of humanity, except screen writers and film directors, this would seriously get in the way of living life, raising children and being a good friend. This educated fatalism is a kind of self-indulgent notion. Le Cercle Rouge is, in my view, a classic movie for people who can secretly enjoy the adventure of missing the last bus home. But where Le Samourai - Criterion Collection de Melville, in my opinion, is a story that dominates the style, Le Cercle Rouge manages the great trick of combining style with a strong story and with compelling actors. The point of the film, in my opinion, is absurd ... but the film itself is a first-class experience. <br /> <br /> The hopeless tale of Melville's three cheaters - Cory (Alain Delon), Vogel (Gian-Maria Volonte) and Jansen (Yves Montand) - draws on a little wisdom that is perhaps , attributed to Buddha: That all men who are destined to meet, will, along with their destiny, can not change. Perhaps, because some believe that Melville himself came with the text, if not the thought. Anyway, we know from the beginning that this movie will not end happily, it will depend on destiny and coincidence to set things right for us, and it will leave us reminiscent of the nihilistic philosophies we discovered and loved when we were in high school. Once Corey and Vogel meet and then join in the unique talents of Jansen, we are on a one-way trip to steal an exclusive and heavily protected jewelery story on Place Vendome. The tension arises because not only do we know that the French police are behind Vogel, but we also realize that some determined thugs are behind Corey. The great pleasure of the film came to me from admiring the work that Delon, Volonte and Montand brought to their characters, and the intelligent cruelty that Andre Bouvril brought to his character, Captain Mattei . . Melville hooked me up when he developed these characters and their own situations; He built me ​​up emotionally and then released me when he brought me to enjoy his probable destiny and let me see it happen. Melville sets out his pieces - the train escape, the forest run, the shooting in the woods, the meetings with Mattei and a man who refuses to inform - with intriguing possibilities. He builds the tension in all these cases by taking his time; a rare feature in the movies and an even rarer feature now. And Melville takes time to build Mattei as an individual. Mattei is a sad and experienced man. He is a loner. He has a set routine when he returns to his apartment - he greets his three cats affectionately, he bathes and while the tub is filling, he prepares food for them. I do not know who Mattei is destined to meet, but I hope he is someone who likes cats. <br /> <br /> Nihilism is always fashionable among some creative people and some critics. In most cases, I think it is a much more difficult task to leave nihilism aside and simply live life without harming many people. (And that's even more challenging to show convincingly in a movie.) Le Cercle Rouge is a movie that, to me, tells me little, but it's in its own way, I think, a beautifully organized film.
