I had just written a comment about the IMDb before that, as I consider most games unworthy of time and effort ... Curse of Monkey Island is different. <br /> <br /> Having played and was impressed by Monkey 1 and 2, I had high expectations for the third release ... and I was not disappointed. The first thing that struck me was the substantially improved graphics. Do not get me wrong, for the games made in 1990 and 1991, respectively, Monkey 1 and 2 were innovative and provided goods well, but the CMI advances and offers an excellent cartoon style game that is both fun and satisfying. . All the scenes and settings have been carefully crafted and well thought out, and fit perfectly into this type of game. Animation / CGI is a mixture of realism and exaggeration; a fantastic combination in this case. <br /> <br /> For me, the script has been crucial in the success of the previous two games. The CMI script is clever, appropriate and, above all, absolutely hilarious. Added to this, the script is now audio, unlike the previous two, where the speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen. The voice of Dominic Armato is perfect for Guybrush: witty, clear and slightly naive. All other voice talents fit perfectly into their characters, especially Earl Boen, who is the voice behind LeChuck. I loved every character throughout the game: not just their personalities and intelligence, but the way each character is animated superbly and distinctly. Still on the subject of audio effects, the soundtrack is worth mentioning. The soundtracks for Monkey 1 and 2 were monotonous and nonetheless were very effective in giving atmosphere and representing a change of mood. The WCC soundtrack is yet another step forward. Each scene is complemented by a captivating, subtle, playful and pirate melody (if it's a word). With a change of scenery or mood, the music also adapts, increasing the entertainment and fun that the game offers. <br /> <br /> The idea behind Monkey Island is to solve puzzles and problems to progress. This may sound easy, but it's actually diabolically complicated in many places. Some may be delayed by the level of logic and amount of thinking that goes to Island of the Apes, but in reality this makes the game even more fun and fun, and also increases the value of replay. The "Monkey Island Curse" or "Monkey Island Curse: Mega-Monkey" option (which involves more complicated and abundant puzzles) caters to players of all abilities and also gives a good cause to play the game through least twice. Whatever level of difficulty you choose, you'll be guaranteed a different game every time you play again, with numerous speech options and other puzzles to solve that do not affect the outcome of the game, but are there just for fun. The most entertaining part of the game is the Combat of Ships, and the sword "fights" that follow. These were particularly well thought out and make the game worthwhile. Add to that a stupendous story that is non-violent and suitable for all ages, which will keep you hooked and longing for more until the end. <br /> <br /> Finally, to conclude, a unique and special mention must be given to the designers. this game. The way each complex puzzle and problem is thought is simply amazing. While collecting items and objects during the game, we can not see how each will help you progress, but with a little reflection and solutions of perseverance present themselves, and for this the WCC designers should be highly praised. 10/10 for the best game I've ever played (not an exaggeration)
