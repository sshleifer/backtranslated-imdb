This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of westerns released during the 1950s; the cavalry needing to protect the territory of a killer band of Indians, an officer determined to see this task, and the men with him with various flaws of character that he needs to merge into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold a fort located near the indigenous village until they get reinforcements. The Indians know, well, that the little band is subalternized and can be eliminated before help arrives. One big difference for this film, "Only the Valiant," is that it tries to replicate the usual plot, but at the same time convey the message that duty is a paramount concern to be shared by everyone, even if they do not Accept this charge. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck incorporates the closed-mouth captain of the troop that should prevent the Indians from invading the territory. The soldiers he takes with him to the small outpost are the remnants of the troop in the fort; they, in turn, have complaints or weaknesses that lead them to wonder if the captain has not withdrawn them because of their general lack of devotion to a cause. Eventually, the captain and the small group face their enemies, and at the same time each of them faces their own fault. The cast includes Western faithfuls such as Ward Bond, Gig Young, Neville Brand, Lon Chaney, Jr. and Warner Anderson. <br /> <br /> A movie sleeper, and a good solid western for fans of this genre.
