It is the story of three brothers uniting in the midst of difficulties and losses, and learning that the truly important things in life are family, love, trust, and forgiveness. The whole cast manages to achieve a powerful performance, although some offensive. A great movie for fans of real problems that happen in trusted families. It's also worth looking at fans of Dermot Mulroney or Sean Astin. Both do an amazing job, often leading him to tears. Take my word and rent today!
