The cinema of the 1960s was as much a time of revolution as politics and music. Filmmakers dared to make avant-garde films by discussing taboo subjects that were only previously allowed in feature films. Beginning with both "Breathless" and underground American cinema (like Kenneth Anger), movies have become more and more experimental. All this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with "Easy Rider". One of the best (and most surprising) outings of this era was also one of the least successful initially. "Head" was made when The Monkees' career was in decline, which is what is one of the best psychedelic films of all time. <br /> <br /> The plot? Well, there really is not one, as many have said. It involves the Monkees going from one surreal to the next. However, these sequences are obviously tinged with LSD and basically scoff at how The Monkees were tired of being confined to their pre-made reputation. It's a pity that the movie has no audience. The little boppers who loved them had changed into a new fashion, as they always do. The psychedelic crowd / Haight-Ashbury whom the film was received would never be caught dead in a Monkees movie. It's all your loss. This movie may be less plotted, but it certainly is not meaningless and is very cleverly put together. The crew later made "Easy Rider" and "Five Easy Pieces". The film was later revived in a retrospective of Raybert's 1973 and obtained a very positive response, which granted him the cult that deserved for a long time. Ironically, The Monkees would fall victim to the same commercialism they protested in this film with their subsequent meeting of the '80s. (10/10)
