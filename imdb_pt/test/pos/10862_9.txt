This wonderful 3 part BBC production is one of the sweetest love stories I have seen in a while. The actresses exhibit a very high level of talent, especially Rachael Stirling as Nan Astley. She is funny, seductive and cute. The scenes of love and kisses up close are very erotic, regardless of sexual preference. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined and very believable. I think this is a byproduct of a good adaptation of a well-written novel. <br /> <br /> A truly remarkable drama that quickly gains speed after some boring (but necessary) scenes at the beginning. . <br /> <br /> My vote: 9/10
