Police Squad! (1982) was a funny show that ended too soon. But I think it happened before it got repetitious and bland, like so many American television shows. The geniuses behind this funny show were the team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. Since her direct act in the comedy hit the AIRPLANE!, Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian. In this short-lived TV series he had the chance to play the straight man in a crazy comedy once again. The bizarre titles of each episode gave the ending. But Lieutenant Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) has entered into so many strange cases that they need to be seen to believe. <br /> <br /> Tooo bad they never released it in D.V.D. If a show needed to be re-released, it would have to be that one. A whole new generation is waiting to see this show! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended!
