Although credit should have been given to Dr. Seuess for stealing the story of "Horton Hatches The Egg," this was a great movie. It touched the emotions and the intellect. Due especially to Justin Henry's incredible performance of seven years, and a script that was sympathetic to each character (and to each person's situation), the elements that provoke the thought last for a long time after the tears open. Overall, the superior acting of a solid cast, excellent direction and a very powerful script. Correct humor touches help prevent a "heavy" subject from becoming tedious or difficult to sit on. Finally, this film passes the test of time and seems not to have been dated decades after it was released.
