Both the book and the film are excellent by themselves. They differ slightly, but this increases and does not diminish what is an excellent script and acting. The historic atmosphere, the young lady looking for love, the incredible setting of the music hall and the trip to the lesbian world of London in the early 20th century make this an exceptional film. Andrew Davies as a writer excels in writing this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. Rachael Sterling and Keeley Hawes are both excellent actresses and give these pieces the best of themselves. The rest of the cast is very good. If there were more than 10 out of 10 I would give it!
