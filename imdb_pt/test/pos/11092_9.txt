Based on the true story of Christopher Boyce (Hutton) and Daulton Lee (Penn), and his involvement in selling US government secret documents to the Soviets during the 1970s. Boyce works for the government, and his job is to protect those documents specific, which ultimately disappoints him on the subjects and practices of his country. He then asks for help from Daulton Lee, a friend of his drug dealer, who has become a wanted man, to be the messenger of these sensitive documents. Lee infiltrates the Russian embassy in Mexico, and makes contact with Alex (Suchet), and both begin to play the espionage game. <br /> <br /> Lee's interest is purely about money, while Boyce is acting angry about the system in which he is involved. Alex believes that Lee is the inner man of the American government. Things are getting entrenched when Lee's drug addiction and his reckless behavior in dealing with the messenger position offsets both Alex and Boyce. Lee becomes more paranoid, and the initial espionage game becomes more deadly and consequential to everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is a real espionage thriller without tacky action. The character motifs and analysis of real-life themes are sympathetic but very well written, and the film cleverly intertwines real-life events with underlying political themes about human predatory behavior. Where a larger nation uses its political power to control the smaller nations. Well directed and intense in parts, especially where the protagonists become immensely over their heads in the espionage game. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn give incredibly fascinating performances in a film that questions authority, yet there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of that system. The situation of the protagonists becomes the underlying message within "The Hawk and the Snowman," and makes it a clever political thriller with a poignant element about society, human relations, and the American system. Great movie! <br /> <br /> **** 1/2 out of *****!
