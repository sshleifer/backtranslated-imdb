Stan Laurel, it was noted, first made a real name for himself, appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s. He certainly turns out to be an excellent comic actor and performer here on "Mud and Sand" (a parody of "Blood and Sand" by Rudolph Valntino), but I think a movie like this really works not because Laurel was a big satirist, but because it allows the audience to enter the comedy already familiar with the situation and the scenes. Laurel can then let go with her inspired jokes without having to create context or go without it. I watched it the day after watching "Blood and Sand" itself; it certainly enhanced the experience to know what was being parodied and where. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Laurel (Rhubarb Vaseline, if you believe in the title cards, or Vaselino rhubarb, if you believe how his name is written on the chalk board) takes the mother of money with a trick of two for you, two for me is funny by itself because it's a big joke but it's very funny if the viewer knows what it's like to take the air out of Valentino's extravagant and melodramatic promises to give his mother all the luxuries she want. <br /> <br /> This is Stan Laurel's best solo work I've seen. It's just funny - even more so if you had a chance to see the source material.
