This story documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive film production in Chinese history. It's worth every penny. Visually stunning cinematography, sweeping punctuation and excellent characters make this one of the best epics ever placed in films (foreign or otherwise). Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
