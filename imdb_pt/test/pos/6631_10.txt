I should no longer be surprised when critics lose the most obvious things in works of art because they are human beings, and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature. That said, the simplistic notion that Ingmar Bergman's 1968 film Shame (or Skammen) is merely an anti-war film greatly undermines the reputation of this very complex and highly nuanced film. Compared to his more cinematic predecessors, Persona and Hour Of The Wolf, Shame is apparently a more classic film in terms of narrative. But apparently the key word is that although it does not have the popular psychology of Persona and the horror films homage of Hour Of The Wolf, it is one of the best films ever made about the war - not as an anti-film -war. , nor a pro-war film. As such he has to sort with wild strawberries as one of his greatest films as well as one of his best scripts if not the best. <br /> <br /> Although ostensibly a movie more psychologically outwardly than the films that preceded it, it actually says much more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive. In it, Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman play Jan and Eva Rosenberg (perhaps a nod to the infamous American spies, which many European intellectuals found innocent), two musicians who played for the local philharmonic orchestra before the war began, and they withdrew to live on a small piece of land on an island, content to work in a greenhouse. The country they live in has no name, just like the island they live in, although the film was made on the small island of Farö in Bergman near the northern tip of the Swedish island of Göttland. It seems that his nation has been at war for some years with an invading country, or perhaps in a civil war with rebels from another province. All this is left deliberately nebulous, since this war symbolizes all wars. This is reinforced when the movie begins with multiple war quotes on screen while the credits are released. These include quotes from Hitler for Vietnam. It was American military figures. After the initial scenes depicting the prosaic nature of their rural life, and after the arrival of the war, where even the elderly men are recruited, an aerial assault plagues the land of the Rosenbergs, while enemy jets fly overhead, dropping bombs and which seems to be chemical weapons of an Orange Agent like nature. An airplane is struck and a paratrooper jumps and ends up hanging from a tree. Jan, who starts the movie as a weeping coward, refuses to go and help, so Eva goes alone. Jan joins her and they find out that the pilot was shot. It seems that he is, in fact, part of the invading force, or possibly rebellious. A bunch of government soldiers will soon stop at their house and ask questions about the dead pilot, then advise the couple to leave their home as the invaders are nearby. there are erroneous interpretations of the film on a micro level, such as that of Bergman scholar Marc Gervais, who provides the film's commentary on the DVD of the film. Like many other critics, he claims that Jacobi is a Quisling, who collaborated with the Invaders. But this is clear and proven wrong, for Jacobi is with the original Fascist government. As evidence, first, the Invaders are repelled after they invade the land of the Rosenbergs and do their agitprop interview. We know this because the government that later questions them about the fake interview and the words put in Eva's mouth sees the film as a supposed proof of their betrayal, and Jacobi is clearly working with them, statists of the fascist Big Brother. Second, Jacobi is in charge of deciding which of the inhabitants of the city are sent to concentration camps, to collaborate with the invaders, and the Rosenberg, again, are among those who have been spared. Third, in her seduction of Eve, Jacobi tells her that her son is on leave of the military, and clearly, if he were an invader, he would not be talking so happy about his son serving the state. In addition, the rebel forces are not official armies and do not grant official leave. Finally, Filip is clearly with the Rebels, or Invaders, of the Organization, and why would he have killed a colleague? <br /> <br /> That Gervais and other critics so rudely and arbitrarily misinterpret and fail to realize this key. and the manifest point of this film questions his ability to discern any and all aspects of all Bergman films. This is a wonderful, excellent, and very high film in Berman's canon, but it is disappointing to read how few critics and viewers actually understood its complex message, opting for cheap, lazy, easy-to-be anti-war claim, and a rather simple in comparison with his two more showy predecessors. And that, in the long run, is the true shame of shame.
