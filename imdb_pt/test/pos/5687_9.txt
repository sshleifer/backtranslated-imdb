This film sets out to do something very private, it also proposes not to do certain things. In short, it has a definite premeditated trajectory - dealing with the idea of ​​facing death (with very few choices and all bad ones) as something serious and real, rather than something casual or fun. In pursuit of this realism, he avoided certain conventions such as obvious bows and hooks of character. Not about the characters, but about the human condition. No matter what the actors would do ... what would YOU do in your situation? <br /> <br /> Open Water may have been an early idea for this movie, but it goes far beyond. Unlike the movie, it does not fool the audience at the end when you discover that there really is no shark to speak of. This has a real monster, not just the idea of ​​a monster and not just an animated support. It also has good production values, given what these very ingenious filmmakers had to work with. And again, in contrast to the other film, it has some stimulating action and brilliantly rendered at its climax. And let's not forget the "blinding" presence of his youngest star. It can prove to be a great discovery.
