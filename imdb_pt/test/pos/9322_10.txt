This great musical film, in the beautiful Technicolor, is so wonderful that it is enough to make all people of Irish descent feel proud. Filled with joy and celebration of all things Irish, an excellent cast, with brilliant scenarios and superb theatrical ornaments, lovely Irish music and the Irish tenor voice of the star Dennis Morgan, is the luck of the Irish to have such a marvel movie to enjoy one and another time! Not just for St Patrick's Day, remember, but for the whole year. <br /> <br /> One of the jewels produced by Jack L. Warner during his heyday as studio boss in Burbank in the 1940s. <br /> Shame on Warner Brothers for not having this beautiful picture available on home video and DVD!
