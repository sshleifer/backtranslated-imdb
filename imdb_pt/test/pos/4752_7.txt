This film is not about the soda or the French connection. <br /> <br /> The Seven Ups are a group of elite cops who use tactics that do not conform to the NYPD protocol. Scheider leads the group with his gang or regular colleagues. They are guarding a local cartel of crust and things go wrong when a cop's wire is discovered. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Richard Lynch, Invasion: America, Little Nikita, and his partner end up killing the cop by accident and escape from Scheider in the coolest scene I've ever seen, Bullitt and French Connection are not as good as one on the West Side up to George Washington and Palisades Parkway in New Jersey. <br /> <br /> The stunts are great and Lynch makes him free, even though he seems scared of the dangerous trip. Roy Scheider almost dies when his car hits the back of the Mack truck ripping off the roof of the vehicle. <br /> <br /> Things come to the surface and you have to keep watching to follow that sequence. Fast and intense movement, cool for thirty years.
