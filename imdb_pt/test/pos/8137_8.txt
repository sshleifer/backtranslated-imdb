What are the movies? I mean ... what are the movies made for? Shooting? Murders NO. They're made for life stories and that's what this movie does. It shows how life has changed between two ages. The father and the son, the father in need of a job and asking the son for help. <br /> <br /> Although there is another generation, there are some traits that remain, including the caress towards the family. The main subject is, in my opinion, the love of the son to the father and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The film is composed of just a dialogue, but this dialogue is more than I ever wanted. This movie is a pure art! Once again, after "Marfa si Banii", Cristi Puiu hands us another beautiful film. Well done !
