When I was in 10th grade, my friend and I were up late in their home and we started watching this movie. We watched it because it looked kind of funny and because it had breasts. But then the end came and we just stood there completely speechless. I think after a minute watching the credits, he sort of whimpered "Oh boy ..." It goes from the teenage sex comedian of the 80's ass to nihilistic realism so fast that it catches you off guard. I've been trying to rent this movie for years and I have not been able to find it - and no one has ever seen it except me and my friend - so it seems. But now it's available! I suggest renting it out and get ready.
