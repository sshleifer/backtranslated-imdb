Anthony Wong plays Lok, a husband whose wife is seriously ill. Poor Lok - due to his illness, he has been without sex for a long time. That is why he is plagued by a series of despicable nightmares with nurses and students. "Erotic Nightmare" It's a fun Cat III movie loaded with sleaze and voyeurism. There is also some blood when the first part of the film shows some nasty murders committed by Wong under the influence of the monk's mystical powers. The sequences of dreams are quite erotic. and despicable, so I'm not complaining. Of course, those who expect horrifying horror from Cat III in the tradition of "Diary of a Serial Killer" or "Red to Kill" will be disappointed, but despicable filmmaking fans should give this one a look.7 out of 10.
