It turns out that Chris Farley and David Spade made only three films together ("Coneheads", "Tommy Boy" and "Black Sheep"), but this was actually the "Citizen Kane" of their peers. Farley plays Thomas Callahan III, the idiot heir of an auto parts company. His father Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) hires Richard Hayden (David Spade) to take care of him. Big Tom is going to marry a "ten" (Bo Derek), so everything has to be in order. After Big Tom suddenly dies, Tommy and Richard have to try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy. From there, the film is practically an excuse for Chris Farley to do what he does best: make a mess of it all. <br /> <br /> When this movie first appeared in theaters, I saw it with my grandfather. He discovered at the outset that the characters of Bo Derek and Rob Lowe were hiding something. But you can completely ignore that and simply revel in Chris Farley's antics. Nothing is safe around your stomach, and hell has no fury like your carefree attitude. The scene in which he sets the cars on fire and, later, the scene of the deer, creates a pure mutiny of laughter. Chris Farley and David Spade were actually the John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of their day. It's a pleasure to always be able to think of "fat guy in a coat" over and over again.
