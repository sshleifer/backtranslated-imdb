this is an adaptation of a book by Dirk Wittenborn, which I did not read. Young Finn Earl lives with his mother Liz (Diane Lane) in a crowded apartment on the East Side in New York. he dreams of joining his father anthropologist studying a fierce tribe in South America. Liz has boyfriends and coke. when he gets caught marking cocaine for her, one of his clients (Liz is a legitimate masseur), a wealthy Mr. Osborne expels her in exchange for being his full-time personal masseuse at his huge property in New Jersey. They are taken there in a limousine with her stretched out in the back seat with the dress engaged and showing panties. (this and a few low-cut dress scenes are Mrs. Lane's only exploration, some may be disappointed, but I'm sorry she had to do all these things on "Infiel" to do List A. That woman has more Talent in his little finger of what Streep, Roberts, and Sally Field do in their entire bodies and their time is owed.) When they arrive Finn befriends the grandson of Osbornes, Bryce, and has a maturity with his new girlfriend, Granddaughter Maya. Liz, meanwhile, joins AA and dates an AA doctor. She miraculously cleans instantly. Finn, however, does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends. Bryce looks like a nice guy, but gets jealous when Osborne takes Finn in a hot air balloon race instead of him, and this leads to tragedy. <br /> <br /> The genius of the story, (and movie) is that they cut off the violent acts of the Blysdale tribe, filthy and fierce, to the warriors of Yanomano. It is somewhat implausible that when Liz discovers what happens to her child, she merely demands action from Osborne and does not contact the authorities or resolves the style of Thelma and Louise. there are elements of a gothic novel with a revelation of the village idiot. Also they hardly develop any plot or character before moving to Blysdale. Liz, for example, as Lane's Lane Kantrowitz in "Walk on the Moon" had an unwanted pregnancy with Finn at age 18 and felt trapped. This is in the book, but not in the movie. Still, these are small shortcomings. The film will be in full release on 12/31/05, more than a year after the original release date, and I could not wait. <br /> <br /> There were many moments on Red Carpet in the theater. film with almost the entire cast ... except Diane Lane !! $ #% # Q $ Director Dunne said she was out shooting a movie. I know she did not promise to be there, but I came from out of town and it would have been a great thrill to see her in person. The film is a definitive contender of best film, how to act? Sutherland was very good, as was the boy who played Finn. Lane was magnificent as always, but I only remember one or two emotional scenes when she picks up Finn with drugs "let's get together mother and son" and with Osborne "his twisted grandson ...". She would do better with a supporting actress, but it will not work that way. unless they give you a "body of work."
