I wish Hollywood would make more movies like The China Syndrome. Because it scores on all levels. <br /> <br /> It has a clever and convincing script. This shows that it is not just the nuclear energy itself, but the money involved in it, which causes danger. And the film also gives you a great backstage look at how the television is made. <br /> <br /> It's a thriller: the first time I saw it, it kept me at the tip of my movies. seat. And it marks as a character movie: I really cared about the main characters. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Wilford Brimley and, above all, Jack Lemmon are great.
