We're in a small town, a homely widow (Ida Lupino) hires a handyman (Robert Ryan) to take care of her house. She soon begins to regret as Ryan grows erratic by the hour, it seems she is the host of a dangerous schizophrenic, and now she is unable to escape from her home. <br /> <br /> Beware, my love is adapted from The Story of The Spiral Staircase by Mel Dinelli and play called "The Man". Almost a film of a set and a play directed by two characters, the film features two great central performances and offers an interesting insight into mental illness. However, one should not be led to think that it is a violent and nervous image, because it is not. It was clear from the start that Ryan's Howard Wilton is a dangerously disturbed man, but this is a different kind of "dangerous" movie. One that throws another trend toward psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist. <br /> <br /> Ryan and Lupino are a great combination, they also did the excellent, and much better, in Dangerous Ground. same year. So with both actors clearly comfortable together, this brings a finely tuned character story, all based on the boundaries of a house, re: prison. Ryan is particularly strong as his character enters and leaves the madness, with some powerful scenes and sometimes, inducing fear, and others, gaining deep sympathy. Harry Horner's direction is secure (he really does not have to do much more than let his actors interpret it), and George E. Diskant's cinematography contains some clever and striking visual touches. With an enveloping hugely memorable Christmas tree ornaments. Falling somewhere between being medium and big, Beware, My Lovely has enough to make a recommendation for borderline fans and easy to follow Film-Noir. For fans of Robert Ryan tho, it's something of an essential vision, oh yes, and then some. 7/10
