He said in flashback, the movie opens in 1989 with Charlie being given a prize for his role in the defeat of communism. I must admit that my heart sank as in the thought of having to endure yet another sincere, rather boring and excessively long life story. How wrong I was, because this short scene is the closest the film gets to boring. <br /> <br /> The film is full of fun and fun scenarios and violent dialogues in some of the most unexpected places. The next scene after the awards ceremony is Charlie in a Hot-Tub with some naked women and a guy trying to get him to invest in a TV show. Another rather entertaining scene is about 3 rooms in the film comprises Charlie, a group of his very sexy secretaries, Phillip Seymour Hoffmans CIA Man and a bottle of whiskey. As for the dialogue, what about that to a line, "The Senator says: He can teach us to type, but he can not teach us to cultivate the breasts." Okay, I know the boy from school, but the movie has big lines. <br /> <br /> As for the performances, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as always, steals all the scenes in which he is. Hanks is OK, but surprisingly to me, Julia Roberts who is very good in the role of an eccentric millionaire of Texas oil. Charlie Wilson's War is one of the best biographies of non-musicians in a long time, apart from being a rare thing a movie that entertains, entertains as well as informs everything in equal measure.
