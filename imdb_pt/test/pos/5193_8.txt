Having graduated from Western History when I was a student in college, seeing the views on World War II is quite uncomfortable and in a whole quite wrong. World War II was the bloodiest and most graphic one that has ever occurred in the history of the world. While the Axis Powers have carried out many crimes against humanity that are still the vision today and right many people forget that not every German soldier was exterminating the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier turned a samurai sword and flew kamikaze missions, not all Italian soldier was fascist. Most of these soldiers to the Axis powers were normal people like you and I got into a terrible conflict and happened to be fighting for a country they loved. <br /> <br /> The Battle of Stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles. in the history of the world with more than 1,500,000 victims suffered throughout the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader, Lieutenant Von Witzland, when they are assigned to the Eastern Front to fight the Soviets in Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as a sort of main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They are all normal men and seem to be completely unaware of what is happening in Germany and Poland. <br /> <br /> The film follows the course of the battle. The film is overall very gloomy when it comes to portraying the combat and life of a soldier during the battle. We are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of battles (including a sequence of firing squads). In general, battles are the first examples I know of that portray the loss of limbs and, in general, in their faces, death and violence sequences. Much of the inspiration for the soldier Ryan's battle sequences seems to have come from this movie. The film is not intended to make the German completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the senior army officers are portrayed in the usual view most people use for evil. Most soldiers are just normal people who usually talk about home. The film makes it clear that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and the army was totally oblivious to the fact that the genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that German Army soldiers were simply fighting for a cause they did not really understand and most wanted to simply go home instead of freezing to negative degrees in Russia. <br /> <br /> The film really shows how the war is hellish, especially the Second World War. The battle scenes will amaze you with your realism and the story is very easy to follow, since you are simply following a platoon during the battle. As with most war movies, one does not expect much happiness after seeing it. This will leave you with a little depressed mood just to see the life that most of the Eastern Front soldiers faced. Not recommended for children. 4/5 stars
