Okay, I admit that if I did not have kids, I would never have seen this movie and never see it. But considering all the rotten kids' movies I've seen (like SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: PIG IN THE CITY), that's a significant improvement. And that had enough that I did not get totally bored or contemplated suicide (something I did repeatedly in the other two films). Of course, the performances are pretty wide and the plot is kind of silly - but it's a children's movie. And compared to other movies of the genre, this is definitely better than average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines actually seem to have some talent and will probably continue to have careers after puberty - at least in commercials or voice-overs. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a movie to watch with your kids, you could certainly do a lot worse!
