On stage, John Osborne adapted "Picture of Dorian Gray" as a tribute to the talents of Oscar Wilde as a novelist and playwright. On the screen, with a few edits, it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cut of 3 crucial scenes from the play. important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time passed.) The acting however is brilliant. The return of Sir John Gielgud to his origins as Wilde as Lord Henry, and despite having a very old decade for the role, he becomes utterly enigmatic, caring and cynical that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novel. Jeremy Brett is also strong, offering a poignant portrait of the distressed artist Basil Hallward. Peter Firth, though not originally my vision of Dorian, handles paper with style and grace ... and then with a convincing strain of cruelty. The support cast is equally as good, Gielgud's former colleague Gwen Francon-Davies plays Aunt Agatha's philanthropy with dignity and Judi Bowker makes a touching Sybil Vane. The wit, spirit, and tension of Wilde's work have been remarkably impressive. My only other fear is with the hairstyles. Many of them seemed out of place, looking more Victorian versions of the 1970s than the real style. In general, however, acting and writing elevate this production to a high level. level of excellence of small screen.
