This movie starts a little slow and starts running at the end. Not that this is bad, it was meant to illustrate the character's degrading character trait. Consequently, if you are not in tragedy, this is not your movie. It's the thought-provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worth it. If you liked Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment," you'll probably like this just for comparisons. The intriguing question the movie suggests is, "What makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publicly approved ideas for another set?" New ideas are totally contrary to the status quo - if you're a conservative, you will not like this movie. Aside from other philosophical issues, I must admit that the film was quite aesthetically pleasing as well. The grassy slopes and beautiful scenery helped me overcome the slow start. In addition, there was use of colorful symbolism in the representation of the mental state of the main characters. If that kind of thing does not impress you, skip it. 7
