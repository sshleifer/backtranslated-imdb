This is one of the best TV productions of a musical of all time. I listened to Merman's cast album, Angela Lansbury's album, I saw Tyne Daly live, and I've seen the Rosalind Russell movie countless times. I think Bette is, if not the best, tied with the best. It captures not only the bravery but also the pathetic Mama Rose. I've never been a fan of Natalie Wood, so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb in what is undoubtedly her best role. Everything from the costumes to the scenery, to the supporting performances, is wonderful. The three strippers, led by the ever-reliable Christine Ebersole, are hard to beat. There must have been a production of Mame on TV a few years ago with Cher, but I think Bette would be the best bet (pun intended) for Aunt Mame.
