I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and I was simply delighted. I saw a review that said something about the fact that the critic thought it was just another teen movie but then thought it was based on Shakespeare's Tenth Night ... and then it started try to justify liking this film on Shakespearean grounds. I really think this is going much further: the only connections I could see in the Night of Kings are (a) the basic concept of a girl disguised as a man; (b) the extensive male-female humor stemming from this basic concept; and (c) some of the names (including Viola and Duke). <br /> <br /> In addition to these names, the theme themes (a & b) are really great themes for any screenplay, and the script for this film is no exception. Plus, though, this really is a teen movie simply charming and very contemporary. And this is a perfectly legitimate genre, even if the intellectuals have to find an excuse to like it ... as if it alluded to Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The film is brilliant, fast, emotive, stylized, fun ... full of teen hormones and teen humor and masculine / feminine humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best IMHO part: really just about all male stereotypes and all female stereotypes are portrayed in round-toply attractive fun. These stereotypes are relentlessly parodyed, but lovingly, with such complexity of invention that I'm still a bit confused ... but really do not feel anything disappointed in that regard, it's not that kind of movie: things come to you fast and fun and you get a chuckle and a whimper and then move on to the next split-second event. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes really is simply delicious as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful duke; David Cross does a wonderful job on Main Gold. All performances and characterizations were fine and on target. The cinematography was excellent. <br /> <br /> Wonderful entertainment from start to finish ... check it out!
