I think Crewes did his bit evil well, she should have won a prize. Anything Dunne is in is usable because Dunne is a great actress and can get anything, even a faint script. So, I would recommend it for this reason alone. This movie may have been a little ahead of its time, the plot may be more acceptable these days. <br /> <br /> During the golden age Hollywood movies were meant to entertain or teach, mainly to make us feel good or deal with the times. This chart seems to deviate from this profile. However, once again I must say that whenever Irene Dunne was at least "good" because she made things so believable! The only other actress I can say made me think that way, maybe, Deborah Kerr. Watch the Silver Cord if you have the chance to "act" if nothing else.
