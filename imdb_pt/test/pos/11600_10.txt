It seems that many Europeans and Americans see Indian films for the wrong reason; I see some people complaining that this movie had no dance sequence!

Rituparno Ghosh is one of the best young directors in India, being widely known for his choice of film themes and the strength of his screenplays. 'Chokher bali' is a perfect example. A faithful adaptation of the novel by the Nobel laureate Tagore dealing with the pursuit of sexual pleasure of a Bengali widow, the director gives a new dimension to the much acclaimed and controversial work.
