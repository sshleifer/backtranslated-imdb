Ostensibly, Hans's isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother, a boring wife, and the rejection of a lover. And despite the complex picture - Hans himself does not exactly make these statements - the above must also be a substantial part of Fassbinder's thinking (his use of Freud and Marx). But the viewer may look no further than Hans's sex and sexism to locate the truest cause of his crushed spirit. <br /> <br /> First, it is highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love forced him to register with the Foreign Army. Legion. It was much more likely, and it is partly indicated, that it was a quest for adventure, male camaraderie (male-female fugue) and male identity itself - which both the Legion and the war offered. Secondly, Hans loses his successful job as a police officer because of his own sexism. By falling in love with the wiles of a prostitute at work, he not only characterizes prostitution as an oppressive institution, but shows that he can not even control his sexuality in a professional arena - and is even willing to risk a desirable career. Thirdly, he commits serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his sheep-like male friends, making no distinction between his absence or - when she appears searching for him - presence. In fact, he is more brutal in his presence. <br /> <br /> A few hours later, in a violent and drunken state, he beats the woman in front of her daughter, who intervenes on behalf of her mother. The terror he inflicts on her and her daughter is palpable. But both he and the public continue with only a moan of conscience or protest. Because? Because his wife is cruelly characterized as uncomfortable and sexually promiscuous (yes, this may be Fassbinder's view of what capitalism does to women - property, insecurity and a commodity - but this hardly acquits Hans's brutality or Fassbinder's exploitation ). In the drum scene. <br /> <br /> And then there is this pressure of the male role, which Hans could reject and protest, but instead accepts. He is too small for a man and not heroic to achieve the mundane success that the male role recommends. But how can they be causes of despair when he not only gains his love lost as a lover, but marries a tall woman who is considerably more attractive than him. Finally, Hans allows Harry, his war partner, to remain convinced of his wife. on the contrary, in your home. By this decision, he not only makes it clear that he is more attached to Harry than his wife, but that the male bond replaces his love for women. And it replaces, in the end, his own life, because it is the superior competence and the spirit of Harry around the house that causes the star of Hans to fall. Hans the merchant may be to some extent the victim of capitalism, but more precisely he is the victim of his own fidelity to his own masculine identity. His inability to let it go, is the ultimate cause for his isolation and despair. <br /> <br /> This is something that is lost, I think, not only in Fassbinder, but also in Han's sister, Anna - though, just a bit lost. For Anna's (and Fassbinder's) support of her brother - as far as his mother is concerned, it only goes so far. She is quite insistent that only he can save himself - that his support and love can not end his self-loathing. Unfortunately, she offers nothing of the same support and love for her wife, who must be much more bitter than Hans, but who, in the end, is able to pick up the pieces, save herself and her daughter and present a striking contrast . for the fall of Han.
