I mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be cautious because of what I discuss, although I do not really think I'm giving anything important. Any "surprises" are really insignificant to the success of this movie or the ability of a viewer to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Although not without some very small shortcomings, this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship, time, uncertainty and the choices that people make about their lives. However, at the same time, it is also a humorous movie, with little pieces of comedy, usually understated, woven everywhere. For much of the film, it progresses at a reasonably slow pace, but it does not seem slow since the movie draws it into the lives of the characters and is at first quite disinterested. Some have commented that much of the film seems slow, but it is such a wonderful picture of the lives of characters so understanding that one can watch almost infinitely. As it progresses, the film becomes more emotional and moves to the end, and the progression is treated wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Eventually some of the characters decide to rob a bank, and although it's a bit hard to believe, that's irrelevant. It's a wonderful addition to emphasize the love these friends have for each other, while at the same time accentuating the mood and adding a bit more irony to the film. And while it's not original to have a bunch of old guys robbing a bank, the context and details are pretty unique and do it wonderfully, making it really funny too, as when Ismet (if I remember correctly) exaggerates his aggressiveness to "disguise" the fact that he is old. <br /> <br /> Like I said, most other comedies are pretty low-key, but it's still really funny so I was always laughing. <br /> <br /> Actors are probably the real key to this movie. They imbue the characters with deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and care. There are some small transformations or miniscule details of the characters' personalities, which run smoothly and beautifully. Of course, the movie is about the personalities of these characters and how they care and interact with each other. It succeeds so well because of them and if smaller actors had the roles that the film could have failed. <br /> <br /> Gule Gule is not without sorrow, but it simply provides a full range of emotions and provides a more powerful power. experience. In fact, the film is so touching and full of so much love for such rich characters that in the end it is a very comforting, satisfying and even happy film despite its sadness. I could watch more and more.
