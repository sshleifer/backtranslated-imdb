I'm not a fan of Sean Penn, but in contrast to my German colleague whose review appears here, I think he was perfectly chosen as the neurotic and drugged character in this movie. It has all the nuances perfected and reminded me of several acquaintances who had similar tastes in "recreational chemistry". I saw this movie but once, 10-15 years ago and this is the only part of the movie that was etched indelibly in my mind. I do not say that very often, but in this case I go: Bravo, Sean Penn! As for the plot, well, it's based on facts and as such, it's a tragedy that people sell the secrets of their country to the then enemy. Once again, Penn showed you what you can do if you do not agree with the administration. Use the freedoms you have, paid in blood; Do not break the law.
