I saw it in a German press exhibition. Without revealing too much: most critics really liked it very much. There was even applause later, which is quite unusual for this species. From my point of view and so far, it was the funniest film of the year. It retains the charm and wit of the three short W + G's and is expanded with many references to these and other films. Of course, there are obvious allusions to werewolf movies, especially for "An American Werewolf in London", "Jaws", "King Kong" and even for "Braindead" / "Dead Alive" by Peter Jackson, but also for others genres. The characterization was best done in "Chicken Run," but that movie had a whole new "cast" where introduction was needed. Here, you can already know the two main characters. So the new movie "Wallace and Gromit" is best if you watched (and liked) the shorts, but it also works on its own. "Chicken Run" had the most convenient storyline, but also more storytelling. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece maintains that crazier and somewhat more "isolated" feel of W + G shorts. Children should also have a lot of fun, especially because of sweet bunnies (if you like bunnies cute, this is a must-see for you!) And because Gromit has a lot to do and really steals the show (kids also love dogs ... :-)). But many jokes are intended for a more adult audience (there are even mild sexual allusions). The film manages, like "Shrek 1 + 2" and "The Incredibles", to satisfy the high-level entertainment for the whole family, adding a British and at least a little darker to the mood of American animated films. <Br /> <br /> Is the animation ?? as expected ?? superb, and they remained true to Aardman's style because they did not put a lot of digital effects - I only realized a few when it came to Wallace's inventions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score works well in the film, although one of the main themes is definitely borrowed from Randy Edelman's "Dragonheart" score. <br /> <br /> The worst is that it will probably take another six years before we can see a new cartoon.
