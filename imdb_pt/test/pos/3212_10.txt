I've watched this show from the beginning, and I'm a 45-year-old man. For me, this is much more than a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family, however. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive and, in their own way, successful. Lorelei takes her home in the fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history and a population of people that may be unusual but acts like a dysfunctional family. The show also plays in the relationship between Lorelei and his parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore, people of the old DAR WASP money who do not approve of Lorelei's choices in life, though Lorelei does not care. The story of relationships and across the line is what makes this show, in my opinion the best of the WB network (which will soon be the CW). Watch this show!
