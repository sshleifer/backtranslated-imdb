Fulci is one of my favorite Italian splatter directors of all time. He is also a good storyteller, mixing horror, supernatural and psychedelic themes. This movie was truly his last great story before directing such disappointments as "Voices From Beyond". The story is simple as Fulci interprets himself, a director of terror. After years of filming and bloody movies, it seems that Fulci begins to undergo a collapse in which he begins to hallucinate about being massacred. He decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes things worse when he convinces Fulci that he is killing people. <br /> <br /> Fulci used gore scenes from several photos at the same time. These movies do not believe he drove, but certainly produced. Some of those films are "Massacre" directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground), "Touch of Death" directed by Fulci, "The Murders Secret" and I do not remember the rest of the films. <br /> Nightmare Concert is a very underrated film, even for Fulci fans. But I loved this movie and I've watched it many times. It's sad that Fulci has not had the chance to direct anything worthwhile after that, but even so, this is a great movie and I recommend it to any Fulci fan, whether you like it or not. 9/10 stars
