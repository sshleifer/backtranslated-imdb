A surprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production. Features performances by unnamed actors who rival the best talent on the planet (unfortunately, none have followed a career). It also features Christopher Nolan's divine ability to write a perfect dialogue. Dialogue is what carries this story, which is about a man who likes to follow people by material for his books. Well filmed, VERY well edited, even better written and incredibly well executed. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything a great movie needs, except people who have seen it. 9/10
