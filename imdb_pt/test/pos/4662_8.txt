Well, I just found out the IMDb of my twin sister, Carol. Carol and I played "Fat Identical Twin" in Midnight Madness. We did not have to prepare much for the fat party, who came with us and well and the rest was natural. ;) It was our first big movie role and we had a lot of fun doing it. We were 21 at the time and we lived about an hour and a half from Disney Studio in Burbank and the Hollywood area of ​​California. We grew up in front of the TV and probably some of the first generation of kids with lock switch. Twenty years later, we still have a lot of fun and are still "heavy" or what is politically correct today. We do not seek to act any more, but we know it will "come back" when the right opportunity arrives. Carol is a chiropractor in our hometown of Southern California, and I'm in the area of ​​Information Technology in Georgia. <br /> <br /> I might come, but I thought the movie was cute, clean and fun. We knew it was not a masterpiece or an Oscar nominee, however it was and still is a movie that the whole family can watch and have fun together. It's good not to have to worry if your young children can watch a video without having to advance some parts. And no one left more when it was released on video as Carol and I were. Carol found at Kmart for $ 6.99! This is a cheap way to capture someone's memories and share them with others. <br /> <br /> Best regards, Betsy Lynn and Carol Gwynn; The Thompson Twins
