It's great to see a whole new batch of dolls creating havoc in this series. I found this chapter very entertaining. In fact, it would probably be my second favorite in the series. This movie has very little violence and is only classified as PG-13. This is remarkably different from the other major R-rated puppet movies that were loaded with blood and violent chaos. Lack of violence does not detract from the fun. This film also has notably better special effects than the last film in this series. Good.
