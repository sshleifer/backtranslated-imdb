This educational show focused on emotions, interactions and relationships. It was produced at the Detroit ABC affiliate and syndicated in 90 markets across the country. Last week, Detroit Public TV had a one-and-a-half-hour clip show as part of its pawn campaign. Wow, the memories that have resurfaced! While I remembered the show, there were segments I had forgotten, but I remembered immediately as they started ("Hot Fudge HOLY MOLEY!", Detective Tomato and the pies in his face). <br /> <br /> For more information on the Public Television special, search for "Hot Fudge Comin 'Atcha Concert"
