This was an interesting study in the sexuality of society as well as the "obscure interests" of man. <br /> <br /> Although I can not say that the wife was a strong character - she was the wrong choice for the role, in my opinion - she was a rich child in search of escaping her life of drool. She was a rebel in truth, and never fully matured for her husband, a lawyer (Rickman). It is obvious that he married her for his money and to cover his sexual desires, which is taboo. Rickman played his part in a T-shirt, his flirtations with the young, subtle touches of homosexuality. The young man was gay to the max! When he did the imitation of Marilyn, that should have told his wife everything. He was also perfectly chosen. He has a hustler written on top of him. <br /> <br /> I was not crazy in the end because I knew what was coming. Overall though, Rickman's performance was great, Reedus was good, Walker was fine, but I had doubts. For a gay-themed movie, it was average, but not brazen, at least. It's worth seeing if you do not have "Truly Deep Mad" out there for a spin.
