Okay, I will disagree with previous comments that criticized this program. I think this show is incredible. (I mean, when Jasmin Weber was still and Franzi was still alive, so addictive!). And I was surprised to learn that this was classified as a soap, because it does not look the same as the soaps in the United States. Soaps here are absolutely horrible! At least GZSZ films in place, features real music and more plausible story lines. In addition, the performance in GZSZ, for the most part, is quite convincing, especially with Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jascheroff. (In addition, soap actors are some of the most difficult workers on the market as they have the most demanding work schedules). If the ratings are so high, you should be doing something right; Soaps in the United States are displayed during the day and historically have always had low ratings. Give GZSZ a try! Trust me, it's good!
