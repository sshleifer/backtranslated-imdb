This time the kind dimwit is summoned to the jury service, where a corrupt lawyer realizes that he looks like a prisoner who wants to leave, so the two are swapped. Of course, most of the film is a series of jokes; in "Ernest Goes to Jail," most of the jokes refer to electricity. I really enjoyed the entire sequence of the vacuum cleaner right at the beginning. Overall, the purpose of the movie is just to have fun, and I'm sure you will. This is possibly the best movie you watch with a button. It is safe to say that Jim Varney will be truly lost. Knowwhaddamean? FYI: The only other member of the cast that I recognized was Randall "Tex" Cobb, who played Lyle. You certainly saw it somewhere.
