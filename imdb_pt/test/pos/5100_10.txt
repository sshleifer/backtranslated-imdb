I first saw this in the theater in 1969 when I was 9 and immediately fell in love with it. I'm sad that Sony was not happy to release it on DVD ("but one day, one day ..."). I recently got a VHS copy of this on eBay and sat down to watch it 39 years later. I'm happy to report that it's still the test of time. The performance is flawless, John Williams' orchestrations are exuberant and Leslie Bricusse's memorable songs ("When I Am Older", "You and Me", "Fill the World with Love", "London Is London" are just and some can not say enough about Peter O 'Toole, Petula Clarke, Michael Redgrave and Michael Bryant, Terence Rattigan deserves an A + for his updated James Hilton story. There is nothing you do not like about this movie. a good selection of fans, happy that they released the original soundtrack as a set of three CDs with lots of extras, and that Sony would hurry up and do the same with the movie.
