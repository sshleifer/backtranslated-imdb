This movie did not remain exactly new in the minds of movie fans, and it's a shame. His sagacious cinematic adaptation should have earned Oscar nominations for the great screenwriter I.A.L. The adaptation of Diamond and the impeccable performance of Ingrid Bergman. It must have been an honor for Goldie Hawn, so young, to work with Bergman, looking more than a decade younger than her 54-fifty-four! When it is on the screen, it glows positively. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that may seem dated at first, but it actually made me wish I was around during the sixties. Hawn's fashions are as tacky as Bergman's are fancy. (This is a small flaw - is not her character a little too much for a girl who still lives with her sister? But then again, would we have Ingrid any other way?) And who would not want to leave A nightclub called The Slipped Disc? The best compliments I can give to this film is that it somehow made me homesick for a decade that I never saw, and that left me wanting more. Speaking of wanting more, I wonder what happened to the sexy supporting actor Rick Lenz? (He looks like Griffin Dunne in this movie). This was his movie debut, and I do not see any other major role in his filmography. As for Goldie Hawn, she's done a lot since then, it's easy not to be impressed, but neither can I imagine any other actor in the role. <br /> <br /> As the film is based on one piece, the delivery of the line may seem a little difficult, but it did not inhibit my satisfaction. In fact, I'm struck by how funny it is after more than thirty-five years. Because this film represents a bygone era, it has slipped unfairly from the conscience of moviegoers. He is more connected to the films of the era that came before him than those that followed. But do not let this stop you from savoring the delights it has to offer. Grade A
