I am always surprised, since the famous title track of 2001 is called "Also sprach Zarathustra", which no one (I have read, at least) has noticed the parallels between the film and Nietzsche's famous work, "Also sprach Zarathustra" . . The idea of ​​man rebirth in a star child; a childlike form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of the "Zarathustra" of N .; there is a prominent passage called "On how a camel becomes a lion and a lion becomes a child," in which N. describes the first incarnation of the superman as a child, transcending both the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel always asking for more weight) and the voracious and brutal side of man's will to power (the lion). The fact that music plays during the star children sequence can hardly be coincidental. And also, Zarathustra said that "man is a rope tied between animals and superman." The structure of the film fits this description: a brief history of man as animal, until we become truly human, dominating arms and acquiring reason, then a long sequence on man (the rope, so to speak) and then a brief glimpse of or overman. The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in "Zarathustra," he makes it very clear that he has no idea how people will be able to make these changes and suggests that we will have to depend on a stranger (Zarathustra) to show us how to "go down." Bowman's psychedelic sequence at the end may be seen as Kubrick's best 1960s style attempt to describe the mystical "sink". <br /> <br /> I know that these parallels are quite broad and almost certainly have already been noticed elsewhere. despite the fact that I did not see it in person. But I only wanted to mention them, if for no other reason, than to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was, ultimately, a somber philosopher. Few people think that the end of 2001 is bleak, and it is, in my opinion, explicitly and unequivocally Nietzschean. The case certainly could be made that 2001 is, above all, a dramatization of "Zarathustra" updated to the modern era. Feel free to disregard the snobbishness of tying everything up in Nietzsche.
