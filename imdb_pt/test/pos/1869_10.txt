I was a big fan of this series. Yesterday I watched again on DVD. I was apprehensive about whether the laughter would come or not? But in some episodes I was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good. The wise Rakesh Bedi (Raja) and Satish Shah is brilliant, while Swaroop Sampat is just plain bad, but I think she does the job. Maybe a better actress could have been used in her place. This series shows that comedy is good and clean . <br /> <br /> If this series aired this year, I would have given 9/10 and think that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good. <br /> <br /> 10. I recommend this series to watch on DVD.
