My whole family liked this movie, including 2 small children. Great values ​​without sex, violence, drugs, nudity or profanity. Also, no million dollar special effects have been added to try to divert viewers from a poorly written storyline. A little fun movie for the family. We especially like the songs from the movie. But we only heard part of the songs ... Especially during the final credits ... I would love to buy a soundtrack CD for this movie. This is my 4th Bill Hillman movie and they all have the same guidelines as mentioned above. With all the movies you do not want your kids to watch, this guy from Hillman does not have a risk rating. We love your movies.
