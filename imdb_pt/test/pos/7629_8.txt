The Last Dinosaur was one of those movies "out of place" from the movies of the 70's week which was very exciting for the time especially for fans of Japanese films of Tokusatsu. Originally scheduled for a theatrical version (around the time the Dino King Kong came out the previous December), it was suddenly pulled and turned into a Friday night ABC movie of the week. Rankin Bass - who were not strangers to Japanese co-productions, were the weapons behind this production, co-produced with Tsuburaya Productions of Japan - the people who brought us Ultraman in various forms. Starring primarily an American cast, including the late Richard Boone, Joan Van Ark and the late Steven Keats, he told a prehistoric tale in which there was a volcanic caldera overheated somewhere in the frozen Arctic circle containing dinosaurs. He looks a lot like The Land Unknown (1956) and The Land That Time Forgot (1975) in sensation and rhythm. Of course the dinosaurs were guys in suits (The Triceratops with the front knees!), But they were filmed in such a way, the music and the score were so well made, and the cast did a good job that it did not matter much to many brought us into Godzilla. The film has a lot of class, from the opening track of Nancy Wilson's "The Last Dinosaur" to the overall "big" feeling in the film - hot spring locations in northern Japan were excellent and exuberant - and the undeniable sentiment of Kaiju Eiga for this. There are some incredible pieces - the "bone yard" of the T-Rex and a tracking shot that takes us into the jungle to see the T-Rex eating a giant fish from a creek. Tsuburaya's FX folks did their job in style here and, in addition to a few fake and dishonest shots, they do their job well. This film is considered to be the best "kaiju" movie of Japan's 70's, even in the five Godzilla films made during that decade. Rankin Bass did several other co-productions with Tsuburaya providing the creatures or miniatures - The Bermuda Depths (1978) and The Ivory Ape (1980) - but did not measure up to the epic appearance of this film.
