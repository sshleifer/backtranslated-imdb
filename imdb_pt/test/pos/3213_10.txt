When the gilmore girls started in Germany, I did not want to see them, because to me it was something that was not unique. it was a show and I did not even know anyone. later, I realized that Edward Hermann is part of the overboard cast (a movie, I absolutely love it). I had to watch one time with a friend and have never stopped since. it's fun. you get the feeling that it's okay to have sex before you get married and it's okay to be a coffee addict and eat unhealthy food all the time. I do not do these things all the time, but when I do these things I feel a bit like a gilmore girl. even my boyfriend started to watch them and that says something. from season to season improved with the scripts and stories. they have an open mind and for being different from any other show, you want to be like them.
