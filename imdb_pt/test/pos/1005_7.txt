In this TV special, Jon is the one who needs a life. The highlight of your day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging your sock drawer. Not content with this forever, Jon takes Garfield to a self-help group to meet people. How many people will be interested in a loner? 20-something that the best friend is a cat? <br /> <br /> After several unsuccessful attempts to get a girl, including a dance scene that rivals the merger of Flashdance and David Brents. MC Hammer in The Office (he's dead, says Jon), he's more than shocked to find a cute girl who's as much of an idiot as him. <br /> <br /> Of course, they get along, but Garfield is worried that John will forget him and would rather have children for a cat. Luckily Jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats. <br /> <br /> With softer animation than the previous TV specials, it seems like a longer episode of Garfield and Friends.
