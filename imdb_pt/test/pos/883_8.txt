Good movie. At first, I thought it was a high-fidelity movie, but the ending totally surprised me. I think the whole movie covers many subjects, each one of them can be the main subject, for example avenge, friendship and dream. But he mixed them all without concentrating on any of them. I think it would be a great movie if it was built around the end from the beginning. <br /> <br />
