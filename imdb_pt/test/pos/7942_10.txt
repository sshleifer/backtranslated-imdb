Alexander Nevsky (1938) is a brilliant piece of film propaganda. The people of Russia are threatened by two great enemies, the Mongols and the Teutonic knights of the Holy Roman Empire. Ordered to unite the rival princes warriors in the Russian kingdom, Nevsky takes care of and fights the lesser of two evils (the Teutonic ones). This influential film has been copied many times and still holds true today. The soundtrack of composer Prokiev and the direction of Eisentstein are a vision and a sound to be seen. Many years later, John Milius used many film scenes, scenes and costumes from this film and incorporated them into Conan. <br /> <br /> My favorite lines from Conan were taken from this movie. "It is not the force of iron in a weapon, but the strength of the person who holds it is what matters." The comparisons are unmistakable. The armor that James Earl Jones and the leader of the Teutonic Knights use is virtually identical. A real tribute paid from one director to another. <br /> I give Alexander Nevsky one of my biggest recommendations. The film plays as the final act of Richard III. The presence of Prince Alexander on the screen is truly incredible.
