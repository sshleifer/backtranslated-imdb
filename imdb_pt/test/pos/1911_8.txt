A classic blaxploitation, this movie was terribly influential in rap music for the "goodies" that Rudy Ray Moore performs. Toasts are long stories of rhymes that are funny and give a point, and you can see how they would naturally evolve into rap. For more on gifts, Rudy Ray Moore, and why this movie matters, go to Dolemite.com. <br /> <br /> Which leaves us just to talk about the movie itself. This movie has a lot of "funny laughs - hairstyles and hairstyles" because almost every scene has some sort of scandalous element or dialogue. It begins when Dolemite is released from prison to find out who fits him and brings him to justice. I did not know that prisons release people so they can prove their own innocence, but it's me, I'm a neophyte at the prison scene. He is helped by Queen Bee, who is the main prostitute of Dolemite and has run her brothel while he is away. She also put all her prostitutes into karate school, so now he has an army of female karate fighters. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in two parts, which is usually a mistake, but in this case provided an interesting contrast. The first part I watched in my lunch break while exercising, and was not really liking this at all. It seemed to me particularly badly done blaxploitation, with a ridiculous history, poor quality craftsmanship, well, I think it makes it look like it had a bit of handicraft and tons of outrageous sites, clothes and dialogues. But I was not liking it - actually, it kind of made me feel dirty. Let's face it, a white guy watching something like this to laugh at the clothes and the things the characters say is essentially having a pleasure in that which is racist: how ridiculously these black people dress, what silly things they say. I was not really liking this, I was not laughing, and I was not looking forward to seeing the rest. <br /> <br /> Later that night, when I was in a "much more relaxed state," I watched the rest and legitimately loved it. As Disco Godfather, which I had seen a few days before, it has a warmth and sweetness in its core that makes it pleasant even when it is silly or violent. The Dolemite character has an element of self-parody about him that makes the whole thing fun, and the appearance of several actors who were also on Godfather Disco implies that we are watching the group effort of a group of friends who just want to do something fun together. Even poor dubbing, karate fights and everything else just make it so much more charming. <br /> <br /> What I find interesting about the Dolemite films is that they have some moral ambiguity that I do not see in other blaxploitation. movies, and certainly in very few mainstream movies. In this, there is an African-American woman who gives a speech about the mayor (white), saying that "he did more for the black community than anyone." We later discovered that the Mayor is surprised, corrupt, but I like the film to portray itself as an essentially misguided woman and do not try to "redeem" it in any other way. There is also the figure of the Hamburger Pimp, who is presented as a useless junkie, and no one makes an effort to find some socially positive and redeeming angle for what he is, he simply is. In Disc Godfather, the religious character that Lady Reed plays is presented just as crazy for wanting to pray for her son, hopelessly lost in angel dust. I like the movies to present such harshly critical portrayals of people in their own community without sugar coating or trying to redeem them to make them more palatable. <br /> <br /> There are many elements worthy of respect, like when Dolemite says "Move and let me through, or I'll pull those Hush Puppies out of your muthatf ** a **". There is Queen Bee arriving and answering the phone: "Total Dolemite Experience". And you can not lose (although you want to cover your eyes) the extensive nudity scene of the REPULSIVE mayor. I'm all for older, mustached men, but even I have limits - and my limits are usually a few miles from most people, so be warned. The DVD I had is clearly edited, which is noticeable in certain dialogue scenes, and in the end, when the murder of a main character of Dolemite with his own hands obviously excludes the main event. <br /> <br /> If you get the DVD, however, be sure to watch all three trailers for the Dolemite movies, as they are a joke. I was not going to watch The Human Tornado, but after seeing that trailer, you'd better believe that I am. Also, there is a scene in the Dolemite trailer that I do not remember the movie when Dolemite swings to a Mexican-looking thug, obviously misses it, and the guy throws himself in a suitcase from the nearby car. <br /> After watching the first half, I was going to say to skip this and watch Godfather Disco, since the film and the story improved marginally, but after really enjoying the second half, I would advise watching this on Disco Godfather, as this is even more exuberantly fun, scandalous and humorous and has those gifts that, even if one does not understand the roots and nuances of the form, are still something to be seen. <br /> <br/> --- Check out other comments on my site of bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
