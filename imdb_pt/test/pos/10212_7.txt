"Western Union" is a kind of forgotten classic western! Perhaps the reason for this is in the fact of its unavailability on DVD in the United States. However, all is not lost, as it has now appeared in Region 2 in England. This - being a blessing in some ways - is not only incongruous, but totally ironic when one considers that a film depicting the founding and establishment of an organization as exclusively American as the Western Union Telegraph Company is without the launch of Region 1. It is a beggars belief! It just does not make sense! <br /> <br /> Produced by Fox in 1941, "Western Union" was directed by Fritz Lang. This was only the second occasion on which the great German director took charge of directing a Western one! He had done an excellent job the previous year with Fox's "Return of Frank James," and would have just one more ride in 1952 with the splendid "Notorious Ranch." Lang was not Ford or Hawks, but with "Western Union" he turned into a very fine western that holds up very well. Beautifully photographed at the beginning of three strip Technicolor by Edward Cronjager who boasted a good cast led by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female lead is taken over by Virginia Gilmore, who really has little to do in the picture. An actress who has never done anything of her career. Your presence here is merely cosmetic. <br /> <br /> It's curious that Robert Young has a big bill on Scott! It is clearly the image of Scott from the beginning, when we first see him in the opening scene of the film being chased by a legion across the plains. Young does not have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western. He looks just plain silly going against Barton McLane in a shootout! An actor who never distinguished himself - except perhaps with "Crossfire" (1947) - Young appeared in a series of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties, culminating in his greatest success when for seven years he was "Marcus Welby MD" . the seventies. He died in 1998 at the age of 91. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" recounts the telegraph wire connection from Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a retired outlaw hired by Western Union boss Dean Jagger to protect Sioux's rampaging lineage and also to confront McLane and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own dishonest purposes. Robert Young is the young back east engineer who joins the company and competes with Scott for the affections of Ms. Gilmore. Some comic relief is provided by - and annoyingly by some would say - by Slim Summerville and John Carradine appears in a meager role as the company's physician. <br /> <br /> In all, despite a good western western, although in Region 2, but in good quality sparkling that fans will delight. My only cradle is that there are no extras, not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those bland graphics. UGH! <br /> <br /> Footnote: Oddly enough, the associate producer of "Western Union" was Harry Joe Brown, who later with Randolph Scott would create a partnership that would produce some of Scott's finest Westerns in the 1950s.
