I recently saw An zhan. Not because it was a Hong Kong movie, but because I was looking for a change from the movies being produced here in the USA. In my humble opinion, I believe the film could easily compete against the action thrillers produced here, with the exception of the traditional idiocracies of the Hong Kong film. What still bothers me is the main character of the inspector. I still do not understand why there has to be a complete, idiotic and comic character, even in the serious movies that come out of Hong Kong, but I can live with that when the movie is good. Characters are believable even if the situations they are in are not. The story is quick and really sucks you into it. The actual scenes of the cincher for me were the two bus rides that the thief character takes. Overall a really solid movie.
