A middle-aged man, Robert Jordan, has put in his ways, assumes a troop of Boy Scouts after his predecessor leaves under duress. Jordan takes the pack mainly to learn what the boys like so he can relive his radio show that is losing the appeal to the younger group. He has a fight at first with the boys, especially with Mike, an 8-year-old boy who makes an attachment to the older man who is anything but reciprocal. Does it work for Jordan and the scouts? Check out this fun and entertaining movie from the old days.
