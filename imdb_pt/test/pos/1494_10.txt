... the last time I laughed so hard. It is a testament to Rowan Atkinson's talent that he has succeeded in creating a comic character with multiple layers and a clearly defined personality - without ever speaking a word. All of the program's success rests on Atkinson's shoulders, but he carries it with ease. Despite the fact that the show has only been shown for a season, anyone in touch with pop culture recognizes the social backwardness, so great is the talent and effort invested in the performance. At times exasperating, sometimes amiable, Mr. Bean is an innocent and unlucky fellow who is also incarnated by evil. The brightness of this character can not be put into words, you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> The show gets very depressing at times, like the infamous sketch of New Year's Eve, or when Bean celebrates his birthday by going to a restaurant alone, by offering himself a self-congratulatory card and being served from a stake he does not like very much. Still, there are times when you can not help but feel impressed by the inventive methods by which Bean gets rid of problems such as when he discards the stake in numerous clever ways, or when he turns into bathing shorts without his pants first ! Whatever your reaction to Bean and your unorthodox lifestyle, you're bound to play with laughter while watching. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to point out that although "Bean" is classified as a children's program, it is so enjoyable for any adult with a sense of humor. Because the more "adult" jokes go over the heads of the little ones and the clever antics (yes, there is such a thing) is funny, no matter the age, "Bean" is the truest definition of a familiar program. This is just a classic and always brightens my day.
