I saw the film and I am very pleased to see such a different film in character and history for the great American productions. It is a film with an interesting background for both young people and all age groups. Contrary to certain ratings, the audience seems to share my assessment, since the film is very successful wherever it is explored around the world. For example, in the Netherlands, it has been classified as number 3. Negative statements must be respected, but this should be expected to be guided on a factual basis. If you get the chance to see the movie and have fun.
