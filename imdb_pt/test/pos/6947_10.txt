The saddest thing about Frontline is that after watching three or four episodes, you really begin to understand that it is not far from what happens in real life. What is really sad is that this also makes it extremely funny. <br /> <br /> The Frontline team in Series One consists of Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence) - a man who actually lives and dies merely for the ratings his program receives. Occasionally, his acrobatics to get these ratings lead him to work with his line producer Emma Thompson (Alison Whyte); a woman who has not lost all her journalistic integrity and is prepared to defend moral scruples on certain occasions. The same can not be said of reporter Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) - a reporter who had all the stuff sucked by her - so much so that when interviewing Ben Elton, she needs to be instructed to laugh. Her reports usually consist of interviewing celebrities (with whom she has "crossed paths" before) or scandalous anti-ethical reports that usually backfire. Martin De Stasio (Tiriel Mora) is the reporter with whom the team trusts for the seriousness and dignity, since he has 21 years of journalism. It has no principles as much as what makes a good journalistic story, although it draws an occasional line. Parading about this chaos (in name) is Mike Moore (Rob Sitch), a selfish, naive reporter who can not see that he's just a handsome little face for dirty journalism. He often thinks his morals are being compromised simply because Brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest. Frontline is the kind of show that needs to be more, because it shows that while in modern times, happiness, security and deep political insight are interesting things; it is much easier to assess with scandal, fear and tabloid celebrities.
