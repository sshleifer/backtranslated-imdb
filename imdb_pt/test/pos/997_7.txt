Where would Hollywood be without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, famous lovers in their day? Even an actor as normally narrow as Michael Redgrave once brought some grumpy charm to a portrait of W.B. Yeats The life of writers is an inexhaustible source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> But of all the poets was Dylan Thomas, the freedom-loving Welshman who enjoyed a beer or two (and drank to death in New York at the age of 39), which was over close to the spirit of the film industry. During World War II, he produced screenplays for British propaganda documentaries. He even wrote the script for an insipid melodrama called The Three Weird Sisters, in which three maids from a Welsh village plot the murder of their rich half-brother. All this is now forgiven. In The Edge of Love, by John Maybury, Thomas is played by the Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. It's not a full-scale biographical film. The film covers the poet's four-year life during World War II when he lived with two women: his wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and a former lover Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley), whom he met again by chance during the war . It seems he loved them both. The relationship of these extraordinary women - with Thomas and with one another - is at the heart of the absorbing Maybury film. <br /> <br /> How this came to be is a story almost as remarkable as that of lovers. themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson, producer of the film, is the granddaughter of Vera Phillips and William Killick. William, a war hero (played in the movie by Cillian Murphy), married Vera while she was still in love with the poet. Gilbertson was inspired to make the film when he discovered a book about his grandparents, Dylan Thomas: A Farm, Two Mansions and Bungalow, by David Thomas, describing their tangled lives. Sharman Macdonald, who wrote the screenplay, is Knightley's mother. The part requires Knightley to sing and his mother included songs especially for her. Certainly, no movie with such dignified family connections deserves to be done besides being successful. <br /> <br /> We started in London during the Blitz. Bombs are falling, sirens are whining, and Phillips is singing to house crowds at an underground subway station. In a pub, by chance, she meets Thomas and discovers, after all these years, that he has a wife and a son. Phillips and Caitlin form a carefree friendship with envy or bitterness and soon share beds and tubs, listening to Thomas read his poems, exchanging intimate secrets and smoking their heads, as they all did in times of war. Caitlin turns out to be more experienced in the ways of the world ("My first was Augustus John, he seduced me when I was 15"). But it's the refined and soulful Phillips that stirs Thomas's deeper responses and eventually succumbs to his charms. Meanwhile, she reluctantly married Killick, who saw her at the subway station and was instantly captivated by her beauty (if not by her singing). <br /> <br /> It is an intense and strangely beautiful film, although Thomas himself may be his less impressive character. He is most remembered by Under Milk Wood, his verse in a radio play about a day in the life of the mythical Welsh village of Llareggub, whose name written backwards was not something the educated English teachers called attention to. I once had a vinyl recording of Richard Burton reading the poem (he appeared in an Under Milk Wood movie in 1971), and I never forgot the creamy, seductive quality of his voice. The legendary charisma, the magnetism of man, is something I missed in Rhys' performance. Thomas appears as a strangely pale, even secondary, figure compared to the women in his life. In his previous film, Love is the Devil, Maybury explored the turbulent life of the painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasochist. relationship with his lover and model, George Dyer. The Edge of Love seems to me a richer and more satisfying film. If you ask what insights he offers to the sources of Thomas' creative inspiration, I would have to say Llareggub. But as a sight of his selfishness, his smoky moods, and his general indifference to the feelings of others, it is wonderfully sad and revealing. <br /> <br /> Thomas had a good war, drinking and writing while other men (including Killick) were being traumatized by the horrors of battle. In a scene near the end, Thomas's behavior toward his friends seems inexpressibly insensitive. But this is not, after all, Thomas' movie. Murphy offers us a magnificent study of the doomed passion and emotional weakness of war. Miller is charming and pathetic as his wife. And Knightley seems almost exquisitely delicate to be real (as she did in Pride and Prejudice). But this is probably her best performance. And in all respects, the film is worthy of it.
