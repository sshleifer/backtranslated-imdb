It may be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you do not have to throw money carts in a movie to make it good, nor will it guarantee that it's worth watching), but I think this is totally wrong. . Whether you're expecting fast cars, T & A or a movie that will express itself to you, then do not watch it, you'll be disappointed and stunned. <br /> <br /> This movie was a lot of fun, kept us at the edge of our seats and made us really think. The writer has obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this movie and shows it to the end, just remember to keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Note: The school scenes were all filmed at McMaster University and most of the rest was done in Toronto.
