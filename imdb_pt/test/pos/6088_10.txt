Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. He is terribly burned from an ambush. His nanny Hana (Juliette Binoche) takes care of him, body and mind, because he fears, rightly, that he is a very disturbed soul. In the course of his care, the earl begins to tell Hana his recent past. It seems he worked at a government function in Africa, where he met a beautiful married woman named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Katherine gave up, leaving the Earl desolate. Even so, the two would meet again, under distressing circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana falls in love with a Sihk man in the British bomb squad. However, the war is relentless. Can love exist when the world is tumultuous? This is a tremendous film, based on an equally good but complex novel. The plot has many story lines that are woven together beautifully, each poignant beyond description. The screenplay itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is magnificent, as much as the burn victim and as the man who thought love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also very much like the woman who fights her passions. As for Binoche, she earned the Oscar for being presented, as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a desperate situation. The setting is absolutely beautiful, as are the costumes, the direction and the production. If you missed the preview of this movie, correct this soon, very soon. The English patient will continue to be one of the greatest achievements of cinema in the coming centuries.
