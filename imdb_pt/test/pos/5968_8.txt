During World War II, two Belarussian soldiers (Soviet Russians) try to avoid being captured occupying Nazi as they walk through the snow-covered ground in search of food and security. If you do not like "foreign" movies in black and white, you can still enjoy "Voskhozhdeniye" (reissued in English "The Ascent"). Director Larisa Shepitko rates the film extraordinarily well, despite being a largely introspective work. Her untimely death, in a car accident, made Mrs. Shepitko's latest film, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> After the opening mission was declared, there does not seem to be much that could happen in the snowy woods, but Shepitko and a changing scenario make it unexpectedly exciting. The protagonists Vladimir Gostyukhin (as the spiritually wounded "Rybak") and Boris Plotnikov (as the physically wounded "Sotnikov") manage to avoid the crushing of the ever-increasing symbolism. Her allegorical performances, under the sharp direction of Shepitko, provide a memorable and thought provoking take on a family history. <br /> <br /> Voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) Larisa Shepitko ~ Vladimir Gostyukhin, Boris Plotnikov, Lyudmila Polyakova, Anatoli Solonitsyn
