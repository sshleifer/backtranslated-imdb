I lost count of the times I watched this movie, but I love it and I find it very funny every time I see it. Facial expressions, slapstick humor and the timing of jokes are great. The characters, especially "Nitro", "Sonar" and "Stepanik" are hilarious. I thought Kelsey Grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a great job. Actually, I think this movie was perfectly released. I think it needs to be released on DVD before using my VHS version.
