Accepted is a teen movie of 2006 that stars the face of ads mac and PC. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who rejected all of the colleges he asked for so he decides to do his own college and invites everyone else who did not, the problem is that hundreds of people sign up for their school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $ 5.00 on a sale and I've always watched it since. Overall, this movie is a must for fans of all comedies, as it is fun, witty and a good movie. I rate this film very fair 78%. I WILL ACCEPT TO MAKE A SEQUEL, BUT MAKE SURE IT IS NOT CRAP.
