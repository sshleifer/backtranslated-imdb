So Dark The Night is a difficult challenge: it is very difficult to write about it in any detail without ruining it for those who have not yet seen it. As it remains quite obscure, this includes virtually everyone. Will the film reach those who are familiar with the most well-known titles of director Joseph H. Lewis in the noir cycle ?? Gun Crazy, The Big Combo, My name is Julia Ross, who in its brevity looks like ?? as a strange choice. <br /> <br /> For starters, the bucolic French countryside serves as the backdrop. Steven Geray, a middle-aged detective with Surété in Paris, goes on vacation in the town of Ste. Margot (or maybe Margaux). Unexpectedly, he falls in love with the daughter of the cartridges (Micheline Cheirel), although she is engaged to a local farmer. But the mermaid's song of life in Paris is difficult to resist, so she agrees to marry him, despite the disparity in their ages, which inevitably becomes the talk of the city. <br /> <br /> But on the night of the engagement party, she does not return to the inn. Soon a hunchback finds its body by the river. His jealous and rejected lover is the logical suspect, but he is also found dead. So anonymous notes threaten more deaths, which happen. For the first time in his career, the bereaved Geray is perplexed ... A particularly weak script except the movie; plays as the bad Cornell Woolrich crossed with the murder of Roger Ackroyd. But Lewis makes that boisterous vehicle proud. He takes his time near the beginning, but then the story? and the narrative? gain momentum (unfortunately, almost the time the script breaks an axis). Burnett Guffey lit and photographed the film, with an intriguing leitmotif of spying and peering at the windows; There is also an effective score of Hugo Friedhofer, who provided an auditory threat to many noirs. A good deal of talent was given in So Dark The Night, but in the end it all comes down to not much more than a trick? and not a good trick in that. It is a pony of a trick of a movie. <br /> <br />
