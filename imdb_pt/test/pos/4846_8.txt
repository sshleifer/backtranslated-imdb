Focus is another great movie starring William H. Macy. I discovered Macy in Fargo and saw some of his movies and he still has not fooled me. Macy is the archetypal "cool guy with something to hide". In Focus, he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a hard and faithful worker, who shelters his disabled mother at home. The scene is defined after World War II, at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is the chief of Human Resources for a basically anti-Semitic enterprise. After he accidentally hires a woman of Jewish descent, he is asked to buy a pair of glasses, to improve his failed vision. <br /> <br /> Unbelievably, the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on your life and that of Gertrude Hart, his wife (played by a great Laura Dern). As the film unfolds, Newman will begin to see a completely different world, where being Jewish is similar to being an animal. <br /> <br /> The film is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was quite normal. The scary thought is that in some places it probably still is.
