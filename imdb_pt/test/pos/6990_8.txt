This was a great movie and the sequel should know our socks! The action will be uninterrupted and I just bought the special edition DVD with animated story similar to Animatrix. This will put Vin Diesel back in the limelight and hopefully get the coveted role of Spider Man 3 as Venom. It would be the most logical choice for the role. Back in PB this movie, although it is an indie thriller, has a great story and characters with backgrounds that scream for you to want to learn more. If they made books or comics, it would be a great read. There was one thing I felt was a little below. The finale required a bit of work, but not all movies will have the best ending.
