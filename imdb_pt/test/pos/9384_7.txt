A great bed possessed by a demon eats people, among other things. I am not making this up. <br /> <br /> Completed in 1977 and not officially released until coming to the DVD in 2003, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a film whose plot is impossible to describe. You probably know this thanks to the excellent article by Patton Oswalt, as well as Stephen Throwers' essential book, "Nightmare USA". As you watch, you ask yourself the following. <br /> <br /> -Who is George Berry, and what drugs did he smoke / inject / snort before writing and directing this movie? <br /> <br /> -Is this a horror comedy? A combination of a horror movie and an art film? A strange joke being pulled into the audience? <br /> <br /> What the hell am I watching? <br /> <br /> The "deathbed" really defies any explanation. I know, this term is overused, but it could not be truer than here. This description really beggars. It's a horror comedy, as well as a hybrid film / horror film. But the whole thing is so surreal it must be seen. The score sounds like the electronic parts of an old Candlemass album, the acting is terrible and disconnected from everything, the direction is surprisingly competent, and the movie sometimes looks like a Jesus Franco movie - that is, if your movies were intentionally funny . <br /> <br /> In the end, there is no way to describe this movie. Lord knows I tried, but in fact, few movies are as strange, unique or incomprehensible as this is. Look, but you've been warned. This is also the only movie George Berry ever made. He definitely left his mark on the exploit genre with that, I'll tell you a lot.
