This was a very funny and fast movie. I've watched it more than once and am keeping my rent to show to others. I would just like to take this opportunity to ask anyone who knows, how do HK producers choose their subtitle translators? I'm very curious. Please direct me. <br /> <br /> Once again, to return to criticism, it's a very entertaining movie, with a lot of content, subtleties reminiscent of the classics, though full of antics. Remember, let's say, the Mexican comedies of Cantinflas. <br /> <br /> The film does not disappoint the director's fans who have noticed that he chooses distinctly Chinese themes, trying to come up with rarely exploited features. The entire director's collection is a way to take a look inside the culture in a disarming way. <br /> <br /> And I do not see how your funny girl at the Chinese party could be at the top.
