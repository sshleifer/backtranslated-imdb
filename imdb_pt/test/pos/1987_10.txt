The producers of this image are Hungarians. It is not by crazy artistic impulse that X and Z are capitalized in the titles, whereas the word "isten" means "god" in Hungarian. "By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian-" "Um ... Is that so?" <br /> <br /> Let's consider this movie as a sci-fi brother 'A History of Violence'. Both films have in common the force of blowing up their respective genres; thriller and drama in 2005 and science fiction 'no FX-ed as hell' in what we are seeing now. Everything he does has meaning and is full of details: he nods at Phil K. Dick (who wrote "In the Days of Perky Pat") when creating a "Perky Pat" fast-food restaurant. The nod to Stanley Kubrick using the naming pattern of 2001; as IBM became HAL (a letter in the alphabet) in the 1968 film, in the classic eXistenZ lubricant spray, the WD-40 becomes XE-60 (a letter above) when Allegra cleans Pikul's door. The nod to David Cronenberg using Videodrome's witty type of formula ('Death for ...' and 'Long Life' ..) and taking another medium for the central theme of an image (tv in Videodrome, Video games and virtual reality in eXistenZ In 1983, you penetrated into a TV set. In 1999, you are penetrated by a game. Welcome to Canada!) <br /> <br /> I nod to good taste by getting the cinematography of Peter Suschitzky , the music of Howard Shore and Ronald Sanders Edition (a team that wins). For everyone born in the early 80's with a super famicom, a genesis or an arcade baton in their hands, this movie rings a bell. Enough with the nods. The plot ? "Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as a game designer (Allegra) who creates a virtual reality game that touches the players' minds," as we can see on the main details page of the film. This is the history of history. For me, this picture is about a young couple of 'reality demonstrators' infiltrating the 'new virtual game' presentation session to destroy their programmer. I assume that what we see in the last five minutes is reality, if there is reality. Jennifer Jason Leigh is always playing with a game designer in the game they play in and the end of the movie is reality, with video game laughs, big hairy dogs, realistic 'Cronenbergy' plastic textures and 9mm weapons. What you see is true. They play transcendence for an hour or more (in this game, there is a game (eXistenZ) in which JJL plays the brilliant programmer of eXistenZ and Jude -Pikul-Law a marketing trainee associated with the game of Allegra), they play eXistenZ because Allegra is very worried health of your pod (the thing you turn on your nervous system in order to play), she has to hook up and Pikul then wins the game (Transcendenz) and back in reality they kill Yevgeny Nourish, TranscendenZ programmer. <br /> <br /> Playing eXistenZ and TranscendenZ is to face your essence, to face the subconscious while creating a virtual reality that you will have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game (playing the game, the girl playing Allegra, the 'reality demonstrator' becomes Allegra, a 'goddess of virtuality'). <br /> <br /> What game would Heidegger have to feel for his abstract term? To be truly engaged in the world? <br /> <br /> And Nietschze (Yes Friedrich, God is dead and you know what? Willem Dafoe means him! - God, the Mecanic -) ??? <br /> <br /> Yes, we built a narrative for ourselves and, losing that thread, we continue from day to day disintegrating people as personalities; eXistenZ discusses the fact that reality is all perception of itself by anyone who has actually involved it. And sometimes we get some cool stuff; a perception of virtuality in virtuality in reality.
