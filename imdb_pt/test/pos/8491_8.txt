Jamie Foxx does a great job of playing the famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles. For the credit of the film, it shows both good and evil in relation to the character of Charles and the choices he made, both personally and professionally. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that offers a rich feel. of the periods in which the story takes place. Not only does it look good, it looks good. I just wish there were more songs here. When it's inserted, it's fabulous, but it's not enough. <br /> <br /> Assuming, at least for review, that the story was true, I was impressed and disappointed with Charles, which means that the story has left some impressions memorable since I wrote it 16 months later to see her. The main impressions include: <br /> <br /> BOA - Re-live Ray's immense talent and his insight to go out and take risks musically, such as "going to the country" for a while. The man had supreme confidence in himself, but he did not seem arrogant about it. Also memorable was showing him hitting his heroin addiction - no help! That is simply incredible. <br /> <br /> BAD - I also remember, through this movie, how easily addicted Ray came in first and disappointed that he was so unfaithful to his wife. One really sad comment was that his wife was more upset with him for losing the Children's League games than for all the betrayal he was making with her, even for being the father of a child with a member of his singing group. The only negative aspect I had with the filmmakers was the overemphasis on their problems being attributed to an early childhood event, the accidental death of their brother. This tragedy was used as an excuse for all of Ray's mistakes as an adult, which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions. Note: There is an extended version with the DVD, but the word says it is so poorly edited that it is not worth watching, so stick to the "theatrical version".
