China White (1989) was Ronny Yu's first international film. This UK / Netherlands / Hong Kong production was filmed in English and was slightly edited for western audiences. The brothers American Wong (Michael and Russell) should star in the film together, but due to previous commitments, actor Steven Leigh took his place. Several Hong Kong stars such as Tommy Wong (playing a mute) and the always scary William Ho appear, as well as the director, in a special appearance. <br /> <br /> The Chow brothers are in the Netherlands to run the family business. . They want the family business to be legitimate, but the other Asian gangs do not want to see change as a move to save "foreigners" and want to keep making money the old fashioned way. Others want to take their business to a new low, smuggling drugs and stuff. After Elder Chow is killed in cold blood, the brothers move against any family that is not with them. Can the Chow family prevent families from killing each other or while the streets of Holland flow with the blood of innocence and gangsters? <br /> <br /> A highly underrated film. I was surprised at how good it was. I did not see the Hong Kong version. That would be a great pleasure for me. It is longer and has many more stars than Hong Kong Cinema involved with the production. Too bad this movie is not available in D.V.D. The video print I saw was flushed and the sound playback was not so good. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for action fans. <br /> <br /> Fact: This movie takes place before the decriminalization of drugs <br /> <br /> in the Netherlands.
