If you love Chan-Wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic and artistic, with very unpleasant humor touches. THIRST is clearly Park's style, and I love every second of it, from cinematography (every scene is beautiful and creative) to the storyline, which mixes Shakespearean tragedy, murderous love, gothic horror and layered character drama. The characters are complex and there is a lot of moral ambiguity out there. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy. The direction is contained and the performances are differentiated - like SYMPATHY FOR MR. Revenge, there are too many subtleties to have on the first display. Chan-wook Park is an intelligent, bold and consistently surprising filmmaker. It is unpredictable - the scenes go from brutal and moving to hilarious laughter in an instant. This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE and then SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE as to being over-the-top and comical. But, like LADY VENGEANCE, she's incredibly rich, thought-provoking and rewarding. <br /> <br /> If you like stories of vampires beautifully told (LEAVE IN RIGHT) or are a fan of Chan-wook Park, see THIRST should be obvious. Easily one of the best films of 2009.
