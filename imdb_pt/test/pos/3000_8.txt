Lewis Seiler's hasty approach to the Underworld King establishes a deeper storyline while maintaining an efficient execution time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The public is instantly transported from a doctor's office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is fundamental to understanding the position in which the doctors were placed. The story suggests from the introduction that these two people are generally happy to provide medical practice to those who are less fortunate. By abruptly cutting from this backdrop to the morally conflicting occupation (personal physician of the mob), the viewer is called upon to experience this sudden turn of events. The Nelsons (Kay Francis and John Eldredge) are forced to work by Gurney (Bogart) without objections. This stylized notion of organized crime, which is very influential and powerful to overcome, has become a standard component in all gangster cadres. The one aspect of this movie that raised some issues for me, ironically, dealt with the pace of the story and the speed with which it was told. I think character development and social identity may suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully examined. This paradox is a result of personal taste, as I believe the film's experience can be enhanced through the rigorous development of the character. However, for the purposes of this film, I must admit that quick action contributes more dynamically to the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 (of ****)
