This movie deserves the 10 I'm giving. <br /> <br /> But it's not the 10 you would give to movies like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' or 'Psycho'. This is the kind of 10 you give to a movie that just makes you laugh, over and over again! It is the most terribly written and directed film, but it does not stop entertaining. It has the most amateur effects, but you enjoy every moment! I saw this movie today on TV and did not want to move! Read the following dialogue to know why! <br /> <br /> (The whole college is standing around Manisha, who has just gone through a rape attempt and the guys who tried the rape are asking for forgiveness) <br /> <br /> Bad Guy 1: Please forgive us! <br /> <br /> Bad guy 2: Yes, we will not do it again. <br /> <br /> (No answer from Manisha) <br /> <br /> Akshay: Come, forgive them! Manisha: I do not know ... Akshay: You are a beautiful woman, and even dead men can be awakened by you! And these are young males alive! Do not blame them! <br /> <br /> Pancholi: Yes Manisha .. <br /> <br /> Manisha (to Suniel): What if they tried to rape your girlfriend ??? <br /> <br /> Suniel: I would break your hands, legs and kill them. But anyway, just forgive them. <br /> <br /> Akshay: Yeah, if you do not forgive them, then it will be as if you were too arrogant with their beauty! <br /> <br /> Now, this is a true masterpiece of a dialogue! This movie never fails to entertain, mainly because there are so many silly things and unreal situations! The bad guy (Munish) can basically do anything. He can blow a sandstorm out of his mouth, or he can pick up a motorcycle from his butt and easily make it disappear again. <br /> <br /> Each actor turns to speak. A line from Akshay, after Suniel, after Arshad, then Aftab, then Nigam. It is the main rule followed by the director, so that equal screen time is given to each face. And then there's the all-powerful pendant, which can make even a high-speed car pass you by without you being harmed! All these things make it a nice movie, and I can watch it several times. I think this movie can enter the comedy hall of fame if there is one. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that he was not trying to be funny.
