Mishima is one of the biggest movies ever made. Now I think Paul Schrader is the best screenwriter of all time, but I really do not like the movies he directed than I've seen (apart from that and Affliction), but this is amazing, disturbing and highly character-driven three-dimensional. It follows the life of Yukio Mishima, Japan's most celebrated writer, combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and their stories. I do not know how, but Paul Schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way. The acting is great, just like photography and Philip Glass's perfect score. Although confusing the first view, this is one of the few movies that gets richer with each view. Truly an underrated gem of a movie.
