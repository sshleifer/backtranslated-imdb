Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a retired heroin addict returning to his Chicago neighborhood after an extended stay in a clinic. He plans to stay out of drugs and find work as a drummer, but he can not help but meet his old friends. He had originally been arrested not for any drug-related charges, but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game. His poker skills earned him the nickname of The Golden Arm Man, and the men who run the game, one of them his longtime connection to heroin, want him to deal with it again. Meanwhile, Frank has to take care of a woman he injured in a car accident, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), and makes up with his old girlfriend, Molly (Kim Novak). The movie is great in putting us in the mental state of Sinatra. When he feels safe at the beginning of the movie, I feel good about him. But when a promised phone call does not arrive one day, it goes down in depression and back in the same cover. Later, when he finally gets the audition, he arrives completely nervous. His embarrassment when he can not play the correct beat is devastating. He had big dreams, and the other musicians did not pay attention to him as he ran out of the room. The film moves quickly and shows the problem of Frank's drugs in a realistic light without turning into a social message. The actors are evenly well. Elmer Bernstein's score is one of the best of his time. The only thing I do not like about the movie is the ending. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although I really like the character of Zosch and Parker is very good in the movie, they could have done a bit more to fill his story. The ending is a bit much. Although there are certainly ducks that will remain with the characters after the closing of the film, Zosch's death ties all the loose ends a bit too much. Frank is free to love Molly and he does not go to jail. In addition, your dealer is dead, at least the immediate threat has disappeared. Well, I think in Hollywood there is always the desire to tie it all in one small package. That hurts the movie a bit, but as it stands, it's still one of the best and most adult drug addiction movies I can imagine. 9/10
