This Popeye cartoon from World War II had some very good visual jokes, and is decidedly above average for its genre. It was also well designed, with some great angles, good details and ... well, lots of interesting sights. <br /> <br /> What it means is Popeye at sea in his boat and running accidentally. in a small Japanese boat with two faces. (By chance, why have the "Japanese" always been portrayed with large, rounded glasses and ripped teeth?). <br /> <br /> Anyway, these innocent Japanese sailors want Popeye to sign a peace treaty. Oh, boy, thinks the naive Popeye, "wait until the admiral sees it!" In one of those great art scenes that I was alluding to above, we slowly see how that little Japanese ship really is a great destroyer ..... and Popeye is in the background .... um, water! "Why, you're crossing the Ja-pansies!" Shouts our sailor. <br /> <br /> How does he get out of the situation is fun to watch.
