Shadows breathe the scent of the streets of New York like no movie before him. This kick-start of Cassavetes' directing work is as atmospheric as it is political and the initial spark for a renewal in American cinema. <br /> <br /> Perhaps he requests to watch the first work of Cassavetes in a feature film with another debut, Godard's Looking for souffl√©. Both films have shaped the filmmaking of their countries for decades and both breathe a peculiar lightness and joy that later were rarely achieved by those filmmakers in their careers. Shadows tells of three African-American brothers, Ben (Ben Carruthers), Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) and Hugh (Hugh Hurd). The story takes place in New York's jazz scene and the rhythms of directing the soundtrack play an important part in the feverish, sometimes almost dreamlike atmosphere that runs through the entire film. There is not much going on in the plot. The daily life of the three siblings is defined by problems in the love relationship or in their jobs, but at both levels normalcy deceives. Without moralizing gestures, Cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial exclusion in public and private life. It was, with regard to the cinematographic representation of racism, a revolutionary film in the USA. <br /> <br /> This film also owes much to the performances of the three main actors, who were almost completely unknown before. Ben Carruthers, in particular, established the image of a new self-conception of young blacks and urban blacks in America, an image that characterizes Spike Lee's films of the 1980s and 1990s. In a telling way, none of these three certainly talented actors was able to start a great career later. Hollywood was not and is not ready to ethnically expand its star system, which is why Goldoni, Hurd and Carruthers found only small artistic niches on TV and independent films later. <br /> <br /> Maybe Shadows is one of them. of the less "beautiful" films already filmed, and one of the most beautiful at the same time; a film of shadows and spaces, with a camera that just watches the flow of life in crowded corners, bars, lobbies of hotels, apartments, inducing an intriguing walk through the vibrant streets of New York.
