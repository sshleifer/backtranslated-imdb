As I read the comments, I was surprised to find one that said that this movie was not "too deep". I have to disagree - this has to be one of the most profound and thought-provoking movies I've ever seen. Yes, the performance and the music were excellent; They were praised repeatedly in the comments. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feeling - it is a story of redemption. It's about two very different and very flawed characters, slaughtered by life, but too strong to lie down and die. It's about a man seeing more value in a girl than she saw in herself. It reminded me strongly of Francine Rivers's book Rescuing Love, which has a similar story of redemption. Yes, the images and themes are confusing and sometimes shocking, but if you look closely, you can see these characters. Sometimes the truest things in life are not beautiful, but they are real.
