Since the last horrible movie of Asterix and the fact that we only had the Swiss German version in theaters, I went to watch it with a little fear ... Without foundation, how happy I was to discover ^ ____ ^ (Note: I can only speak for the Swiss German!) except for the daughter of the viking chief, Abba (the name (Goudurix in French, Grautvornix in German, he is the young man who should be put into shape ...). ). He is a very entertaining portrait of an urban and pampered teenager; but he is very nice, despite the teenage mannerisms ... XD The interaction between Asterix and Obelix and his young charge is fantastic and completely entertaining. <br /> <br /> It should not be compared to the old films, since one is quite different ... What surprisingly does not hurt. On the contrary. When they tried to modernize the last film (twelve years ago), they completely ruined it. This film, however, proved that it can be done very well ... ^ - ^ <br /> <br /> I left the theater cheerful ... Always a good sign ^ _ ~
