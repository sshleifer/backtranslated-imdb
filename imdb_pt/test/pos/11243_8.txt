Of course, it seems like there's only about 17 minutes of actual content in each episode, but it's certainly fun to watch. You may find yourself cowering in your chair when your friend sticks his foot in his mouth and is downcast, or laughing and shaking his head when some ridiculous line really works. The panel of presenters has a more friendly, friendly (I dare say Canadian) comment style compared to the American reality programming. I think the people who complain about this show do not understand the joke. They are taking the show more seriously than the show carries itself. The keys to the VIP are a great caricature of reality shows, sports TV culture and the club scene. I hope they do another season, and I would be interested to see if a US version appears. It is certainly a fun and original premise.
