I remember seeing this movie 34 years ago and it was full of suspense and twists. Grab yourself at first and keep guessing for the whole movie. I have been thinking about this movie in recent years and I have checked into video stores to see if it is available but was never able to find it or someone who had even heard of it. I think this kind of movie is timeless, and I know it would be appreciated by a whole new generation of moviegoers. I hope this will be released soon, as it would be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as it did in the early 70's. It's very rare that a TV movie can do so much of a printing, but this was done and still happens after so many years.
