What a crazy movie! Dura 12 (!) Hours and you do not understand who these people are and what they are doing! The main plot is about a bunch of clueless actors trying to bring to the scene "Prometheus", but there are lots of subplots like the disappearance of Thomas and a crazy guy looking for Monsieur Warok .... what is the meaning of all this ???
