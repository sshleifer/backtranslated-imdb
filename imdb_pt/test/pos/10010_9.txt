I saw this movie for the first time at IFC. That's a great network on the way to watching underground movies. I watched this movie and was thinking that it would be a pure drama and a storyline that can not stand water. But it really was worth watching. The main character is in such a brute form, and you hate to see him deny help, but no matter what you just can not hate him. His devotion to the Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the movie is also great. Sometimes you feel like you can see what he sees, feel what you feel in some situations. This movie does not leave you wanting to know more, or do not like a breakthrough in the plot. There are no gaps (in my opinion). I've always been a fan of foreign films, especially now with films being made so poorly in America. I really like the foreign settings because I feel this can take you on a journey and sometimes understand a different culture. This movie did all these things for me and more. Please watch this movie and if you are new to foreign films, this is a great start.
