Vidor shines like Judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family. Her brother, David, is so overwhelmed by his father that it is a surprise that he is able to tie his shoes, instead of asking his father to do it for him. <br /> <br /> Other critics have already delineated the plot, so I'm not going to redo it; I will, however, point out that Nan, who is pregnant with David, is also married to him. This is not a pregnancy out of wedlock, which would have been horrible by the standards of 1921. The two are secretly married, but Nan's father, having been paid by David's father, tears the marriage certificate. <br /> <br /> The scene of Nan's death, with Judith present, is a truly lacerating and highly emotionally charged experience. Only this scene is worth watching the movie, but there is much more in the plot than this; Why the hell are not modern movies made with the same attention to history?
