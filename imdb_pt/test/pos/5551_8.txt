Lauren Himmel's debut film is well directed with a polished touch. There is a strong plot going on with a significant point for all of this, even if nothing is resolved in the end, hence the name Treading Water. The plot revolves around a lesbian couple and their battle with the mother for acceptance. 7.5 / 10
