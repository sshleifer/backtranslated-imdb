As far as I know, this was my first experience with Icelandic films. It's a relief to see something different from your normal Hollywood movie. Too bad movies like this have a small chance of success in the big world. I can only hope people watch this by accident, by recommendation or otherwise ... <br /> <br /> Because it's really worth it. I left the theater feeling very sad. I could not get the tragic fate of the characters in my head. And it impressed me even more when I thought about the complexity of the film. Not only was it a tragic story, it had great comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, watch! This is really thought-provoking and made me reflect a lot. <br /> <br />
