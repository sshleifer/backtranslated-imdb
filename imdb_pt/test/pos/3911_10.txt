I loved this movie !! I've been waiting for this movie to come out so I can see. I saw the opening night and I loved it, Some people told me that this movie was not good and to stay away, but I thought it was great. The actors did very well and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everyone is giving her a hard time when she did very well and she does not even have a big role. The set was great, it was made of wax and how it was made. The two brothers did a great job and the sense of death was great. The killers were really scary and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them. I can not wait until this movie comes out for the video so I can get it and watch it over and over again. The overview of my review is to go see this movie if you like Hororr movies and you will not regret I loved this movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10 IT ROCKS !!!
