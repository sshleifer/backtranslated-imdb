Who will love my children changed my heart, made me cry all the time, the most I cried was when the family had to say goodbye to the baby, I cried more with it, and every time a child was adopted, I cried when they had to say goodbye to their mother, it was sad for them to lose their mother, I felt sorry for the boy with epilepsy, I was glad he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers. For me, that kid I thought was special because he was going to a house. I feel that I am special because I am in a world with Asperger Syndrome and sometimes when I feel down, sometimes I like to cry. I really liked this movie, 10 out of 10. A real, very good story. Another film that would bring tears to your eyes, I think it would be Tuesday With Morrie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)
