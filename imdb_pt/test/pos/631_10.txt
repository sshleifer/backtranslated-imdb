One of my favorite movies of all time. Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia, I would like to enjoy this film as much as the first time. It's still nice second and third time, but I found myself enjoying the humor more as the shocks and emotions were not unexpected. If you want to see a movie that you really will not be able to predict the end of then I recommend this movie. It's creepy, shocking, full of suspense and also has a lot of humor to help you too. If you watch this movie and do not love it I really question your sanity!
