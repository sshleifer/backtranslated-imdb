I never remember reading Sarah, Plain and Tall at school, but when my son told me about it and said he watched the movie in class, I also wanted to see it. I borrowed the video from the library and watched it as a family. It was a wonderful story. However, I did not know until some months ago that there were sequels. I finished watching those this week. I discovered a little oops: in the second movie, Skylark, Jacob is reminiscing when he was a boy, and tells Sarah "my brothers and sisters and I would dream ...". In Winter's End, these "brothers and sisters" do not exist in conversations between Jacob and his father. But it's a very small oops, and I just caught watching the trilogy, the second time around. Great movie, a must see for a good healthy family viewing.
