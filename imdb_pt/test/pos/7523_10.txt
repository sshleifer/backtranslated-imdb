Another Raquel Welch Classic! This photo reached theaters on November 10, 1969 starring Raquel Welch as Michele, James Stacey as Joe and Luke Askew as Alan Morris. Nikki is on her way to meet up with her friends Michele and Jackie. While on the way, she finds her ex-husband who wants a second chance. Nikki gets away from him goes to the table where she sees Michele and Jackie. Alan approaches her again and she starts to pull away when Alan shoots her back. Nikki is taken to the hospital while Michele and Jackie go to the police station. Michele goes to the hospital, where she meets Jackie only to find out that Nikki has died. Alan then goes after Jackie, who he hits with a car and then tries to run over Michele. Michele jumps in his car and goes to Los Angeles. When she gets there, she calls her boss Lloyd in Las Vegas to let him know she was fine. Lloyd tells her to go to the club called The Losers to see Jeri about a job. However, there is a problem! The bartender has a problem with drugs and Alan knows that Alan and the bartender have a joke. Back in Los Angeles, Michele not only gets a job as a dancer with Jeri, but also joins safety Jeri Joe. Now some thoughts on this photo! This photo was much better than Raquel last, and this photo had uninterrupted action. Luke Askew did a great job playing Nikki ex-husband. It was his typical murder with the look that comes with it. As for Raquel Welch's performance, the only word that comes to mine is fantastic. She was amazing in this movie and her beauty stood out and shone like never before. The clothes she wore on stage to dance were breathtaking. In fact, all the clothes she wore in this movie were breathtaking. Of course, it does not matter what Rachel had, because she looks good in everything or nothing. I give this film 10 stars of ferret for two reasons. The first and by far is Raquel Welch, who is the lead actress and deserves 10 stars. The second reason is that this film was wall-to-wall excitement, from beginning to end.
