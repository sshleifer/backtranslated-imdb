There are 3 of these movies, all created in a similar way and extremely funny. Red plays radio detective Wally Benton, also known as The Fox, who engages in real-life crime resolution along with her fianc√©, played by her typical wartime neighbor Ann Rutherford. Many of the one liners and gags are dumb and probably were in the 1940s, which I expected. But, likewise, many made me laugh out loud, which was unexpected, to say the least. Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence, which is surprising because I grew up with a much older version of the man whose charm really did not go well with my formidable years. I have to give those films the future - if you're in the mood for such nostalgic food. I almost threw my heart out lightly but in fact people are wasted and beaten and I dare say that, the suspense is sometimes well above average. As with most movies of that time, he gets a PI rating (politically incorrect) for reasons you can imagine. Wartime is funny so I guess, and then again it's these movies. Watch one, watch all of them.
