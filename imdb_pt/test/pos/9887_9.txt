Many movies try to have universal themes and make a comedy; but few will rise to the occasion as "check-out". The movie is brilliant. The dialogue is well written and true to form. The acting is absolutely prime. Peter Falk gave a truly great performance - as an actor; as an actor. He is able to take the cast to greatness. Another great performance is given by Laura San Giacomo. She's such an intriguing actress. His performances take one by surprise. She offers, no matter what role she's been asked, from wacko in Stephen King's "The Stand," to her television performances. However, "Checking Out" allows it to shine. It's a role she must play. The film is brilliantly directed by Jeff Hare. He was able to bring the best in his cast and his direction - in all respects - made the film a wonderful treasure. Jeff Hare was able to make a difficult, laughable and yet profound subject. It gives us a close up and personal look at why indie movies need to be made. The knowledge of directors of his cast and screenplay is extended to the finished film. The results are excellent. <br /> <br /> I hope it will be made available to large audiences, because this is one that you will not want to miss. It has the potential to be the hit of 2005 - fashioned in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding".
