This almost documentary look at an enterprising kid who lives in the body shop area outside New York is real all the way. Real lighting. Real sound. Less editing throughout the movie than in 1 minute of most movies. And while there is very little script, there is a story. Filmed in primary colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we have a real notion of the life of a boy who is doing something out of nothing. He has a place to live that he does his own, has a good job and is trying to bring his sister to his little universe. The people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture that I did not know about. They generally seem decent and pay the Ale for what seems to be daily, seeming genuinely concerned about their well being. The actor (I think) playing Ale says more with a facial expression than you can imagine. It reminded me of what a real small movie can do. It shows what children are capable of even without much support and love. Definitely recommend.
