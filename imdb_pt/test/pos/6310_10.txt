Well, where do I start ... <br /> <br /> As one of the other reviewers said, you know it's a real treat when you see the opening photo - minutes and minutes of time spent in a guy's standing movies in a travelator. <br /> <br /> I will not repeat the excellent summary of Rubin's story. What I would like to say, though, is that this movie grabbed me more than any movie I can remember. I sat with my mouth open and on the edge of my seat all the way. Camera work, soundtrack and fantastic performances (especially that of Tony Servillo) draw you to the screen and do not allow you to look away. It's Italian, so of course everyone looks fantastic, but it's by no means a mere cool style exercise. This is a movie with a lot to say about luck, luck and love. <br /> <br /> Go and see.
