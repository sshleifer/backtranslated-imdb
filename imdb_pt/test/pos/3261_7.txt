"Two Hands" is a fun and funny story about low-lying Australians. The script contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstances. In a subtle way, we are asked to ponder the concept that important events in our lives are sometimes generated without being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstances lead Jimmy, the main character, to situations that bring about the fulfillment of his shallow dreams, and finally to an understanding of a more personally promising world. <br /> <br /> The ignorant Jimmy, portrayed with the insight of Heath Ledger, is a child who grew up without opportunity. The high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to your dull senses. The love and help of friends drives you to a higher plateau. <br /> <br /> The film is well directed and well represented. The band of criminals swings between pleasant and despicable, keeping us interested in their crazy antics throughout the film.
