This film, as it is now, is much shorter than when it was released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium-sized silent Chaplin features (THE DOG'S LIFE and THE PEREGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950.. In his day, the Shoulder Arms was a big hit because of his humor in a uniform approach. It is still very funny (Chaplin disguised as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous that he is hysterical), but suffers with his own age. Charlie is dealing with World War I, a heinous conflict that killed 20 million people, but not the worst (20th century) worst war ever. Chaplin would live to see that war as well and imitate his top architects in the GREAT DICTATOR. But the latter is more accessible to the modern audience because this film is a talking image. In addition, Hitler as a target seems more important to the public in 2008 than the Kaiser Wilhelm II and his team. <br /> <br /> SHOULDER ARMS was to take us through the drafting of the tramp, its training, its use for trench warfare, and its actual fight against the "Huns" on the Western Front. Much of this is gone - a segment (when Albert Austin is a Doctor examining Chaplin in his office at the recruiting center) still exists and was shown completely in the documentary UNKNOWN CHAPLIN. This is unfortunate because the film now has about forty-five minutes and there seem to be gaps that these scenes fill. What's left is the front line, but you're out there wanting more ... and feeling a little cheated. <br /> <br /> Sydney Chaplin and Henry Bergman do well to support plays, especially Sydney as Wilhelm. He had done this before in a short time with Charlie for the sale of securities, giving a military speech before being beaten by the homeless man with a huge hammer labeled "War Bonds"). Here we see that the bum manages to capture Wilhelm and the general team in conclusion. It was just topped by Stan and Ollie capturing the German army with a tank and barbed wire in PACK UP YOUR PROBLEMS. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that Chaplin actually had a major crisis as a result of his activities during the war. . He was not a naturalized American - not in 1917 or 1952 when Attorney General McGranery publicly announced that Chaplin could not return to the US because he was an enemy foe (Chaplin and his family were in Europe on a trip) in Switzerland to the rest of his life except when he made a prayer from Hong Kong and when he went to Hollywood for his special career "Oscar" in the 1970s). Since he was not an American, he could not be summoned by the United States. So he sold (with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford) the US War Bonds. But in Britain, tens of thousands had died on the battlefields of World War I, and the public was upset with Chaplin, whom they considered a "lazy" and a coward. Chaplin ended up overcoming this, but remnants of resentment followed him until he died. That does not detract from the success of SHOULDER ARMS as a movie, but suggests why Chaplin did not make another modern war movie until 1940, and a more valuable target.
