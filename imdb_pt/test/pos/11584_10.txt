As I had hoped it would happen, many critics of this film (of professionals and amateurs) focused as much, if not more, on the ideology of the film. That's because The Sea Inside (also known as Sea Inner) is a film about euthanasia. Specifically, it is a true story about an infamous Galician named Ramón Sampedro, who fought for many years for the right to assisted suicide, who was denied this right by the Spanish constitutional court, and - well, I do not want to ruin the end of the film for you. <br /> <br /> Real life Sampedro catalyzed a national debate on euthanasia in Spain. Now with the producer / director / writer / composer / editor Alejandro Amenábar (Abre Los Ojos, 1997, and The Others, 2001) "biopic", The Sea Inside, another rhetorical aid was provided in the international debate on this issue. <br /> <br /> But as I keep saying (to deaf ears?), your opinion, pro or con, about the ideology of the film should not affect your movie rating. You should not evaluate the philosophical or political messages that Amenabar wants to do. You should rate the movie as a movie. It may be a little too idealistic, since none of us can divorce completely from our assessments of our ideological prejudices, but idealistic or not, that is the goal. <br /> <br /> So forget the philosophical and political issues for a moment. . As a film, Amenábar has turned into one of his most elegant and mature works to date. It does not focus on social debates. He does not focus on Sampedro's legal / political struggles. He focuses on Sampedro as a man, living his days confined to a bed in his brother's house. Sampedro, played here in an incredible performance by Javier Bardem, was quadriplegic. When the movie starts, he's been a quadriplegic for 26 years. This condition was triggered, as Amenábar shows us through beautifully filmed flashbacks through a diving accident - Sampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman, misjudged the water, dived, broke his neck and nearly drowned. In the tragic, he finally began writing poetry, some of which were published in a book entitled Letters From Hell ("Letters From Hell"); In real life, Sampedro's book became a best seller in Spain. Perhaps having the artistic work of Sampedro as a suggestion, Amenábar created an elegantly poetic film. <br /> <br /> Most of The Sea Inside is inside Sampedro's room. The focus in these scenes is the complex and sublime performance of Bardem. As a quadriplegic, Bardem simply nods and talks. He has mastered subtle changes of expression and inflection to convey a deep character with a multifaceted and intellectual approach to life. Bardem and Amenabar have Sampedro often getting philosophical in subtle speeches, but there is always a combination of a perverse sense of humor, passion for aesthetics - including music and women, and a sadness and even occasional bitterness not far below the surface. Different underlying emotions occasionally break like waves on the skin of the ocean. <br /> <br /> The people with whom Sampedro interacts more often facilitate this in complex ways. These others include his sister-in-law, Manuela (Mabel Rivera), who has been their main caretaker since Sampedro's accident; his brother, José (Celso Bugallo), who is one of the main opponents of Sampedro's desire to die, and with whom there is an underlying problem unresolved (does it seem that Joseph was the one who saved Sampedro from drowning?); his nephew, Javier (Tamar Novas), who may be the most sympathetic to him; a defender of the right to die, Gené (Clara Segura); a pro bono lawyer, Julia (Belén Rueda), whom he wanted because she had a degenerative disease, CADASIL (Dominant Autosomal Cerebral Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), and thus would be more empathic, and by whom he falls in love; and Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a local woman who works in a cannery and moonlight as a DJ, who heard about him from the media, who wants to convince him to want to live, and who falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> Most of the film consists of these characters interacting with Sampedro in his bedroom. There are also a few other auxiliary characters, including Sampedro's father, who remains strangely distant, and a notorious and media-conscious priest, Father Francisco (José María Pou), who does his best to change Sampedro's mind via philosophy / theology. scene often erroneously characterized as "comic" - has a comic element auxiliary, but the scene is essentially very serious). <br /> <br /> That most of the film takes place in Sampedro's room ingeniously gives the couple significant changes in the creation of greater impact. Sampedro's bedroom has a beautiful large window, which he says is satisfied as a vantage point in the world. Perhaps even more importantly, he regularly imagines the window as a launch pad through which he flies across the slopes to the ocean, which he has always loved, and which has been the most influential force in his life - she provided his life when he was younger and took his mobility away. Amenábar gives us a fantastic sequence of Sampedro imagining one of his flights to the sea. It is beautifully filmed, with low angles (presumably a helicopter) from the hills running, until we follow a stream to the open ocean, which in this film represents freedom, infinite and natural forces. <br /> <br /> The other significant change of scenery arrives with Sampedro finally leading to a wheelchair (he otherwise refused, saying he "mocked his immobility") to make an appearance in court to help defend your case. Amenábar gives us a pungent and melancholy script, filmed subjectively, of Sampedro seeing life and the world in action from the window of the car. <br /> <br /> Whether you agree with the legalization of euthanasia or not, it is hard to deny that this is a well-illustrated, well-scripted and well-constructed film. You may not believe it's a ten (and this is even more unlikely if you disagree with the legalization of euthanasia), but it's still worth watching as a good example of sophisticated and artistic filmmaking.
