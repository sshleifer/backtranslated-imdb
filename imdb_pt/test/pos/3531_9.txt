It may have been inevitable that with the massacre of slasher movies in the early 1980s, a few good ones could go unnoticed. This is a great "rare" film by Jeff Lieberman, who secured his cult status with his memorable 1970s films "Squirm" and "Blue Sunshine." <br /> <br /> Five young people go to the mountains of Oregon (this movie was actually filmed locally) to do some camping and check the deed of some land that one of them got. Before long, they will be predictably terrified by a bulky killer with an incredibly scary chuckle. <br /> <br /> "Just Before Dawn" is visibly more ambitious, "artistic" and clever than some horror films. Lieberman actually shows the characters - well, two of them at least - a 90-minute film will allow it. The film has genuine moments of suspense and tension, and actually abstains from graphic gore, except for a murder at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is an above-average cast here, including Oscar winner George Kennedy, as a ranger who understandably got a little weird from being alone in the desert for a long time. Jack Lemmon's son, Chris, future Brian De Palma Gregg Henry, blonde Deborah Benson (it's a shame she has not become a better-known artist, judging by her work here), Ralph Seymour ("Ghoulies") , Mike Kellin ("Sleepaway Camp"), and Jamie Rose ("Chopper Chicks in Zombietown") complete the cast. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are interesting, and the initial soundtrack to Brad Feidel (now best known for his theme "The Terminator") is haunted and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> This is worth for the important turnaround at the hour mark, although a time of about 75 minutes involves the heroine and a tree. and the killer is almost comical; can really remind a viewer of a cartoon! One of the smartest touches is the killer's final order, which I had never seen before in a horror movie and probably will not see again. <br /> <br /> I did not give it 10 out of 10 because I can not honestly I was so scared. Still, it is an interesting slasher that is worthy of rediscovery. <br /> <br /> "This act means nothing, son. These mountains can not read." <br /> <br /> 9/10
