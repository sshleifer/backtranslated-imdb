Not only does this movie have a great title, but it's simply the biggest drama I've ever watched. The viewer is irresolutely drawn to the film involving 5 young people working together to try to overcome unsustainable odds, Sean Astin as Billy Tepper is brilliant along with great supporting roles of TERussell, Wil Wheaton and Shawn Phelan, the guidance and leadership of Gosset and The Astins characters make the film much better. As time goes on, the film continues to gain strength and it is a disappointment that none of the young actors have made fame in the film industry after this wonderful film.
