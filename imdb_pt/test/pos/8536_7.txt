First, to rent or watch this movie, you're expecting something in the B-horror range. What this film offers for the crafty fan of this genre is a hilarious joke through the Nordic flavor. Sometimes, reminding me of the mood of Dead Alive, Jackson, and other Stuart Gordon movies, that little find should be the funniest of them all. The f / x reach some truly scary levels (the first time Ed finds his enemy), but generally feel that this movie was assembled by an af / x team who decided to use any all props at his disposal of other films ... gremlins, devils, slasher films, etc., have a very good effect and work through the use of hallucinations. <br /> <br /> The gem of the movie is humor. Gore works most of the time, but more for laughs. In your heart is a parody and a fun in it.
