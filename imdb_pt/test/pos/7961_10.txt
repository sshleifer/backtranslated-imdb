The last time I checked here, I think there was more than one comment. I'm really happy that more people have gotten into this movie right now, and more so about you all digging that too. I realized this on Christmas Eve 2004, and I found myself unable to change the channel on my TV, even though it was an Asian movie - and I'm sad but really used to giving no chance to any Hollywood Products. I did that night, though, and I thank God deeply for that. I have not been able to shake this movie off my system ever since - not that I have tried or wanted to - and it still amazes me - in a most grateful way - that such a beautiful and wonderful experience has come to such an extent. way, completely unexpected, like a Christmas Miracle.Please, if you have the chance to go see this movie, buy it or rent it from bootleg or anything else but watch it. I guarantee it will affect you. I'm out of time, but I'm far from finished with my approval here, so I'll be back as soon as I can.
