I found this movie on DVD by chance through a Blockbuster rental. Voyage to the Planets is an excellent 2 hour BBC documentary / drama about a future "grand tour" of the solar system. Taking care to adhere to current knowledge about planets and space flight and plausible extractions of existing technology, this film tells the story of astronauts on a journey to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto. <br /> <br /> Special effects are great for a TV show. I found the actors credible as astronauts. The situations presented are mostly plausible, and you learn a lot about the science of planets and space flights! Just two minor complaints: I've found some of the situations and dialogues a bit cheesy at times. Also, I'm not sure that a single crew and ship would be sent on a single mission to see all these destinations at the same time. You are more than likely to visit Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc. be separate missions. <br /> <br /> They did not try to spare this program with production values. The scenes of Venus and Mars were actually filmed in the deserts of northern Chile - the driest area on Earth and a deadly reference to the Martian landscape. Sequences of weightlessness were filmed on a Russian transport jet. The producers could have faked any of them using studios and CGI, but they preferred the real thing. <br /> <br /> I would especially like to mention the wonderful song that was composed for this movie. The gripping Don Davis theme is the first thing that grabs you when the movie begins, when the magnificent Pegasus take on the screen and David Suchet intones "it's man's destiny to explore the stars ...". <br /> <br /> Watching this on a small television screen is a regret that I have. What a thrill to see this in a movie theater, or better yet, an IMAX presentation!
