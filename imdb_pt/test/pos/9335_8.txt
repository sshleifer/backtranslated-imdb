It may be a bit shocking now, and certainly can never have the impact it once had, but this is still an exciting reminder of what Michael Jackson could do once. Looking back now for the first time since its initial prominence, I was struck not by the terror traps - quaint but fun, and Vincent Price never sounded so genuinely, non-camply (sic?) Threatening - than his uptake of the film of terror, allowing Jackson, behind the genre and makeup, to give us a boldly revealing portrait of male sexuality. <br /> <br /> Because THRILLER is not really about horror, in the way horror is not really about horror: it's about that old topic, the sexual awakening of a young woman. The movie opens at a movie theater, with Jackson's girlfriend feeling uncomfortable with the pictures and the aggressive gender response. Of course, she's on a date, and she's less scared of the movie than what she knows would be expected by her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The main images of the film they watch, the atmosphere of the group suggests socially conditioned expectations. This leads her not only to think of the body in disgust - hence all decomposing ghouls; the loss of her virginity is seen as a kind of death - but the sexual rite is not just about her boyfriend, but about her peers, her society, hence her viewing as a gang rape. <br /> <br /> That's brilliant disturbing things, the best thing that director Landis has ever done. Jackson, the most popular artist on the planet, was still willing to show that the still image of a star contained crowds, not all of them comforting. The music itself has stood out very well, the frightening and insistent serious rhythms, the extraordinarily salivating lyrics, the beautiful 70s disco ecstasy following the chorus, breaking the timelessness, revealing the milky desire behind the fear.
