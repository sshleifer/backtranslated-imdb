As someone who was in a pan-Hellenic brotherhood, I was not sure what to expect when I joined this show. After seeing so many dramatizations in "TV movies" and the madness of reality shows, I was curious to see if the Greek would be able to show the true life experience in college and in Greece. <br /> <br /> He was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the familiar characters of this genre but was also able to add depth to the characters. Greek life is not just about petty parties and conflicts. Although these things happen within Greek life, they also happen in any other social or professional circle throughout a person's life. To characterize it as an exclusive experience for those in a Greek organization would be false. Most of the plots and situations that occur in Greek can and do happen everywhere, in all circles of friends, in sports teams, in real life. But I watched the two episodes and my "little sister" with whom I'm still very close and spent the two episodes laughing and being reminded of how they really captured the spirit of our college years and experiences. <BR> I liked how the second episode showed how the characters struggle with the other facets of their lives; school, relationships, goals, etc. Cappie telling Rusty that the school comes first and going to his brothers for help, this was very true to life. You can not stay in an organization if you have bad grades. The way Rusty got his assignment to his teacher was unlikely, but it was fun. Even the dynamics between Casey and Rusty; It turns out, you grow up and whatever your relationship with your sibling (s), it changes, so you should adjust. <br /> <br /> The result: Greek is a great show, a great entertainment value and enough "real life" there to be believable and definitely worth the time of spectators.
