"Murder by Numbers" stars Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt as two high school rebels who are content with the perfect murder to overcome their shattered self-esteem. Sandra Bullock plays the heroic thorn in the path of her plans as Det. Cassie Mayweather. This is not even close to the traditional murder mystery that points fingers, since the film graciously reveals the killers to us (Gosling and Pitt). What the movie does is focus on the purposes of their murders and if they have what it takes to commit the perfect murder. <br /> <br /> The title itself is chosen for several reasons, mainly because the "Numbers" in the title is the most vocal. The angle focusing on the reasons behind the heinous murders, while haunting him with his chilling dialogue (especially the insensitive boys), does not fully explore the origins of what drives them to their murderous frenzy. The characters are fascinating, you have the good looking rich boy Richard (Ryan Gosling) and the clever but socially clumsy Justin (Michael Pitt). At school, they pretend to despise each other, and even share a taste for the name of colleague Lisa (Agnes Bruckner), but out of school they are allies and collaborate on a ritual in which murder is an escape to free the mind. <br /> <br /> Of course the story involving the boys looks exciting but is pushed into the background for a more mundane subplot involving Det. Mayweather (Bullock), who assumes his murders was because of the discrimination (hence the arrogant appearance of Gosling) and unexplained traits, but manages to get it right. At first, the audience may dismiss Cassie's character due to the fact that she is very stubborn and does not give much support. She shows dominance and control over her junior partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Even when he tries to argue with her, he knows it's a battle he's certainly not going to win. <br /> <br /> The reason behind her tyrannical behavior stems from the fact that Cassie was the sad victim of a crime that left a permanent mental scar on her. This side of the story does not have much place in this film, in part because it offers nothing fascinating with the main plot (the wave of murders of the boys). It also offers some development for the character of Bullock in the film, but it's just a half-hearted and not very rewarding job. I would have liked it if the devilish students had a parallel story. The resources were there in front of them for the perfect crime, the creative schemes for the boys to manipulate the police with their false evidence and lies just to get out of a possible life sentence in jail. <br /> <br /> Despite the asymmetrical subplots and the useless final "real killer", "Murder By Numbers" has a strong cast performance. Sandra Bullock was convincing as the tough, unrepentant police officer who tries to shift her inner pain to a more positive light. Ben Chaplin shows his strength as the young detective who tries to understand his partner and is able to defend himself from his insignificant occasional tirades. But the scene thief is the evil duo of Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling as they keep you glued to your seat waiting for what they will do next. The boys' chemistry is reminiscent of Matt Damon-Jude Law in "The Talented Mr. Ripley."
