Oppenheimer was a great series (it was the first thing I saw Waterston in) and it's very bad copies are not available. A similar situation exists for Glory Enough for All, a British series of the same time, about the discovery of insulin. I would pay a good price for both on DVD. Is it really so difficult to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that can be played in the US? Another very nice series, once again from the same era, was "Danger UXB". A series on how to disable Unsexploded Bombs, hence the name. The one you can get from your local library. <br /> <br /> Pete
