First I played the second game on Monkey Island, and I liked it despite the low quality graphics and sounds. Then, a few months later, I discovered that a new game was made. I tried and I liked it a lot. The first thing you notice is the great graphics. The areas are huge, colorful and detailed with lots to explore. The game requires you to use your brain, very much, as always. The game is challenging with all the points and click on games, frustrating. The jokes did not age a third time. Animated scenes are a great addition to the game as well. This is the best MI game out there, maybe the best P & C game too! If you like cartoon games that play like a movie, get this game!
