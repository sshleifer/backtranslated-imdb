The Lone Ranger was one of my childhood heroes, and I never missed a chance to get their adventures on Saturday morning reruns in the mid-50's. Somehow, however, this movie went through me until I had chance to pick it up today courtesy of my local library. I was impressed with several elements throughout the story, since from the beginning you have a new Lone Ranger theme song before you hear the traditional opening used on the TV show. The adventure uses Tonto (Jay Silverheels) in a well expanded role, even if he gets his share of lumps, being beaten and shot more than once. Perhaps most interesting of all, the Ranger actually shoots to kill in some situations, putting his character at odds with the vision created for the TV series that he would never use his gun to kill, only to hurt or protect himself and to others. . <br /> <br /> In addition, you have a rather traditional Western adventure. Ranger and Tonto come to the aid of an Indian tribe whose members are being murdered by hooded invaders trying to find five medallions that together form the key to a fabulous treasure. Curiously, the bandit leader is an already wealthy woman, disarmed by Noreen Nash. His best henchman is played by Douglas Kennedy, and it was no surprise to see Lane Bradford as one of the bad guys. Bradford's character was one of the men shot by the Lone Ranger, which led me to wonder how many times this could have happened on the TV series. A quick check revealed that he appeared on the show "The Lone Ranger" fifteen times while Kennedy appeared a total of six times. What may be most interesting about the photo is the attempt to portray the Indians under a revisionist light, at a time when TV and Western movies still largely portrayed the red man as a wild illiterate. The character of Dr. James Rolfe (Norman Fredric) is the most revealing in this regard; He is an Indian who achieved an education and became a physician, returning to the land of his tribe to meet the needs of all its citizens. For purposes of history, he had to pass himself off as a white man to be accepted by the local farmers. That was the hardest thing for me, actually, about the plot, since Dr. Rolfe was the grandson of the elderly chief Tomache (John Miljan). That no one in the story except Paviva (Lisa Montell) knew that he was really an Indian, was difficult for me. I suppose it was possible that he left the tribe at a young age, but without this background story, it made no sense to me that no one else in the tribe knew who he was. <br /> I do not know why I'm so intrigued by this, but after watching and reviewing more than two hundred events on this site, I suddenly came across three movies last month that use a trick of mitts like the one performed by Boy Scout in this photo. Roy Rogers' Trigger did a similar feat in 1952's "Son of Paleface," and I picked it up again in 1958's "The Big Country," by a horse named Old Thunder in that movie. This is done as a comic relief in a situation that would not normally turn into a horse, and now I'm curious when the bit may have been done for the first time. I'll have to keep watching older Western times. Not to be outdone, Silver had the chance to shine in the photo too, making the defense of an Indian baby who was about to be used as hostage by bandit Brady. Speaking of tricks, Clayton Moore lent a tactic to the TV series when he wore a disguise as a southern gentleman to smoke the villains that went by like the hooded invaders. Whenever he did it in half-hour format, he was always smart enough to hide his real features, usually with a beard like it was made here. One of the most interesting episodes I remember has to do with the Ranger representing an actor under the guise of Abraham Lincoln. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on some goofballs I've seen along the way. In an opening opening scene, an Indian is shot by one of the hooded attackers, and in a close-up, there is blood on his shirt, but there is no bullet hole. Later in the story, Ross Brady and Wilson ride to the Indians after kidnapping one of the prison villains. Brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from identifying the attackers, but is immediately shown to make his escape on horseback with Wilson.
