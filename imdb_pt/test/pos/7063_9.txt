No, it's not Citizen Kane. But would you expect it to be with a name like "meatballs"? It is the best summer camp movie of all summer camp movies. Does anyone quote "Little Darlings" line by line? Or "Whitewater Summer"? <br /> <br /> This is just one of those movies that popped into my brain when I was in high school and stayed with me all those years. Whenever I feel nerdy, I grumble "Spaz. Spaz. Spaz. Spaz". Or when we are walking in the bush in the forest, I tell my husband, "I'm Wudy from Wabbit." He does not understand. "It just does not matter. It just does not matter." I mean, this material is classic! <br /> <br /> Disappointed with the DVD, however. I wish there were special features, maybe a comment or a making-of. But the film itself is a perfect portrait of teenage life in the late 70's. Maybe it's not MY life ... You can not stop running through the forest in short shorts, knee-high stockings and feathered hair every time see this movie.
