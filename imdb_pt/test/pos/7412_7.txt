I've only seen this movie in a preview and before reading my review, you have to know it's very subjective because I love Techno, Trance, Club, House and music like that. <br /> <br /> The movie deals with Carl, whose brother Jason (or whatever his name) died in an accident: he fell off a roof, "drunk." Carl finds Sunny, his brother's girlfriend, and the two discourage a sort of private investigation into Jason's death, and Carl engages in Jason's ex-life with clubs and drugs. The film itself, seen from the artistic point of view, is nothing more than a large pile of s ** t. The plot is predictable, all characters are extremely clich√©d and two-dimensional (stupid kid from a small town, innocent young good-looking, great king of bad drug ... the list is endless) and most of the acting as the plot does not is just credible. Matthew Rhys's performance of the stupid kid coming to London and taking sudden drugs from people he does not even know does not seem very reliable, unlike his female counterpart Sunny, played by Sienna Guillory, whose behavior seems more realistic to the viewer. Nothing more than a joke was Tim Curry's performance of drug king Damian: a fake, very "eeeevil" caricature and just plain ridiculous to be true. <br /> <br /> BUT: If you like club music as the selected tracks are simply brilliant, if you like a simple lovestory with a sweet girl like Sunny (yeah, I confess, I've lost my heart;) ... that makes my comment even more subjective, I think) with some (predictable) twists and turns you'll definitely enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone else: FORGET .... IT! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (objective view) <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 (my personal opinion and also my final vote)
