I bought the DVD a long time ago and I finally got to see it. I really enjoyed watching this movie as you do not get a chance to see many of the more serious Bollywood movies of better quality like this. Very well done and but I would say you need to pay attention to what is happening as it is easy to get lost. When you start watching the movie, do not do anything else! I really advise people to read all the comments here ... including those with spoilers, before they watch the movie. Raima Sen gave his first great performance that I saw. Aishwarya was easily at his best. All performances were strong, direction and cinematography ... go watch!
