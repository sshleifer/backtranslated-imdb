I felt compelled to give some feedback on this movie that I rented from Blockbuster. This movie has it all - comedy, drama, crime, suspense and "realism." <br /> <br /> This movie also had a lot of action with the right amount of humor! I'm sure I'll watch again! There were some funny parts as well as action-packed drama. I like movies that make you wonder what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Writer / director, Travis Milloy, should make more movies !!! In my general opinion, this movie was great! I look forward to your next! Travis Milloy has a real talent as a writer and director.
