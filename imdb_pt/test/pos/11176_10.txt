What can I say? Curse of Monkey Island is fantastic. The story is good and solid, but appropriately silly, the jokes are hillarious, the puzzles are puzzling ... you could not ask for more in an adventure game. The bit "You do not need to see my ID" is worth buying the game, not to mention Murray, which became the hot topic among many of my friends (only a few of them played the game). You're going to love this game. And if you do not do it, it's too bad!
