Telling the story would not be the point, would it? Barnensö, written almost like "booné aww", is the title of that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked many people, including me. <br /> <br /> Children's Island is the title, and what an island is. In the book, Raine, the main character has the Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's interested in breaking new records. In particular the younger person under water for three minutes. <br /> <br /> History is, like most Swedish films and books of the time, profound, consciously provocative and inspiring. Bergman was starting his last film and Cries and Whispers barely left. expectations for any Swedish film were very high. They taught us then that the great theater, great actors, superb writers and talented directors made a real team of perfection in the movies. <br /> <br /> All this said, Barnens Ö is a story of discovery. It is also a story of alienation: cities are alienating themselves and living in one of them makes us alien to most of its inhabitants. It is a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny. It is a film of overwhelming hope and despair. From feelings buried under layers and layers of isolation and isolation from a world that could not care less ... <br /> <br /> This approach alone is a very difficult way to weave a compelling narrative. Here, Kay Pollak's masterful orientation to Ola Olsson's screenplay of PC Jersilds' novel turns him not only into a possibility but into one of these movie masterpieces. <br /> <br /> I may disagree somewhat with someone who said that this work was forgotten. It is not. Even as I write this in 2009, discussions about the history of P C Jersild are conducted around the world, and the film is shown in many film schools and small theaters. <br /> <br /> Why? Philosophical debasing in all this would be difficult and many have already made it academic through essays and lectures. The reason Barnens was and is a special story is the warm feeling you get from the beginning when you find out that everything is told by the eyes of a small child. And that's where it ends too. Maybe it's a clinical view, as someone pointed out. But profoundly disturbing, moving and satisfying. The concept is profound: as long as we do not have pubic hair, we can still live another day as an angel. Then we will become what Raine reflects as the colophon of his experiences: "Men are Pigs". He finds his fears when he is fearless. He finds love when the world is crumbling around him. He discovers a reason not to behave like adults because he refrains from committing crimes. He let go of his inner purity and trust in others unreservedly, only to learn how rotten a man's soul can be. <br /> <br /> Where love is expected, it finds hate. Where compassion is needed, he finds suspicions and cold hearts. It's a movie of metaphors. A movie to think about and raise questions that are difficult to ask, but harder to answer. <br /> <br /> In the end, the satisfaction of witnessing such an excellent job (which really raised the ante of any other Swedish film later) is a walk of joy and hope. Be aware that it is a movie filled with the dark side of our nature. But unfortunately, a film of hope and deep joy. Reine will still be an island in Stockholm, but there is great hope of living today in full, even when we find our first signs of sexual maturity.
