This movie was a pleasant surprise to me. In all honesty, the previews seemed horrible, to the point where Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman appeared. So I rented with reservation, but I really enjoyed this movie. He had great acting, some good twists and, of course, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. It is definitely worth checking out.
