Out of any category, this is a demented and over the top film, even by today's standards. Filmed entirely in crap-o-rama, this movie will blow your mind (and another thing too!) <br /> <br /> The amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is astounding. The dialogue is incredibly fast and exaggerated. You will love or hate this movie, but you will give up. I've seen this 4 times and absolutely love it. Divine is in the quest to be the most filthy person alive, but also his rivals in this little obscene and disgusting (but funny) and stylish movie. <br /> <br /> Divine was phenomenal, and "she" will always be very lost. Edith Massey makes the unforgettable performance as the "egglady" and do not forget the energetic Mink Stole! <br /> <br /> Ãœber crazy s ** t!
