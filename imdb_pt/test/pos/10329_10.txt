The bug juice changed my life. I know it sounds weird, weird, weird. But happened. I'm from England, Bug Juice never went on the air there, but five years ago I went on vacation with my family and saw on the Disney Channel. Once I saw this TV series I was hooked I wanted to go. It took me a long time to convince my parents to allow my brother and I to go to Waziyatah. I have been going since I was 12 and it was my fourth year this summer. If you are a teenager reading this, come to this camp and change your life. You make long life friends in wazi. No matter who you are or if someone at home does not like you, everyone likes you at the camp. You have so much fun. If you want to take a look, go to www.wazi.com and check it out for yourself.
