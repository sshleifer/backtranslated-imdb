"Please do not kill me! I'm just an actor!" "Can you play dead?" It's hard to describe this show. It's like a crime drama. Where the bad cop is an idiot. Literally. What's great about the show is one of the utterances of a perfectly horrible Assy person. Dismissing these gems as "Goodbye, Blimp", Assy Mcgee delivers great laughter. Unfortunately at other times, the show seems to creep in at a slow pace, making it almost difficult to watch. This is definitely the kind of show that you will love or hate, basically there are no intermediaries. Not the best program in {Adult Swim}, but it has some strengths. It pays to look just to see if you like. I know I did.
