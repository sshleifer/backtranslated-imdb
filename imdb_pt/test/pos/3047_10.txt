This movie has launched my theory about film based on books: instead of following the clich√© "You read the book, now see the movie", if you are looking for a good book to read, try a movie that you like based, because will be 10 times better. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in its initial release at the National Theater in downtown Eugene and I enjoyed it so much that I stayed to see it again. It's a perfect fusion of the inspirational talents of one of my favorite actors, Jon Voight, with what has become my favorite book, "The Water Is Wide," by Pat Conroy. <br /> <br /> I can not think of anything better. film about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life. Two minuscule warnings: <br /> <br /> (1) The video suffers severely from pan-scan and deserves a letterbox version. (2) The title must be restored to the name of the book, a reference to one of the most touching and enigmatic songs ever written
