Ok guys, here's the deal with this movie. not the best, but for all of you 80's kids out there, it will bring back good memories of your childhood. Personally, I love this movie. I still love the rainbow brite and the care bears. so in my opinion if you are not a kid now or you were a kid who loved and / or loves the rainbow brite you will not like this movie.
