Utopia, made in 1950 in France, was the last film produced by Laurel and Hardy. With the bad reputation the duo have for their post-1930 productions, I expected this movie to be horrible. Although it is certainly not the standard of his "vintage" comedies I was pleasantly surprised. It's watchable and in genuinely funny parts! And certainly the plot is of the same standard as you would expect. Some jokes are derived from their previous work, but when you consider that this film was the first of them for five years after their last Hollywood-produced film, "The Bullfighters," the routines are performed with confidence as you would expect from these professionals. Some scenes are not much, but the value of this movie is that some scenes are funny and, as such, absolutely invaluable. I particularly enjoyed the bedtime scene. <br /> <br /> I felt sad at the end of the movie. Our heroes are left on their own desert island. It is a metaphor for the truth of real life. Hollywood and the audience of the time had confined the stars to a desert island of memories, and that would become the last image portrayed in the movies. Ollie died seven years later and Stan died fifteen years later. Stan declined an offer to appear in "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" in 1963. What a shame it was - a colorful movie, just two years before it went by. However, her health probably was not very good. <br /> <br /> These boys are probably the greatest comedy artists of all time, and although the film is far from its true potential, it is still an honor to watch them. appear in the movie for the last time and play in the echoes of their highest talent.
