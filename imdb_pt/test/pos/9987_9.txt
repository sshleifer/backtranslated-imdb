THE GREATEST GAME ALREADY PERFORMED (TGGEP, 2005) is an incredibly uplifting infectious bad luck movie that never really turns into frivolous or heavy. Yes, it takes a lot of liberties, as most Hollywood movies do, but these freedoms are forgiven, since they actually contribute to the movie's enjoyment, and they do not hurt that. In fact, there are many truthful moments in this. You can actually say it's a "Rocky" movie from the beginning of the movie, but who cares? Directed by none other than Bill Paxton (I know, right?!), He is cleverly done and immensely watchable! TGGEP tells the story of Francis Ouimet (played with confidence, arrogance and class by the future superstar Shia LaBeouf), an amateur golfer from a family of Irish and French working class immigrants living in Brookline, MA , in the early 1900s. Ouimet qualifies to play for the US Open in 1913. Among his competitors is the legendary Harry Vardon (played with immense class, dignity, and ferocity by Stephen Dillane). Ironically, Vardon is the second loser in this movie! The film begins in the 1870s in Scotland where land developers tell the young man that they are building a golf course in their home and that golf is a game that is not for people like him. Francis suffers the same preconception as a boy in the early 1900's, Brookline. The stories converge on the 1913 Open. What is ironic is that, even as an adult and multiple great champion, Vardon is still a pariah in British society because of his creation. Francis learned a lot about golf by reading Vardon's books on the subject and Vardon is his booming idol. Unbeknownst to Vardon, they actually met in 1900 in Boston after Vardon, who won that year's Open, was on tour when Francis was only 7. In addition to Francis and Vardon, participants of the 1913 Open include Vardon's friend and champion, Brit Ted Ray (turbulent Stephen Marcus) and champion John McDermott (Michael Weaver). The film really shows the different personalities of these men. <br /> <br /> Redhead Marnie McPhail is pleasantly serene and dazzling when Irish supportive mother and veteran Elias Koteas gives a stern, reserved, and taciturn performance. like his French father. In addition, young and brave Josh Flitter (like caddy Eddie, Francis's ten-year-old) almost steals the proceedings. <br /> <br /> Paxton adds many modern details like special effects. in shots to show the positioning of the players' scoreboard and CGI to a lot of golf putters to keep the movie exciting and at a fast pace, not to make the movie much of a period piece. But the film still convinces us of a specific time and place. <br /> <br /> What's interesting is that while Rocky-like, it's all based on a true story! So the end is satisfactory on many levels. A fun movie about the game of golf in the early 1900s ... Wow!
