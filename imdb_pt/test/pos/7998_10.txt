This sequel proves that Tim Burton was, by all accounts, the best choice to direct a Batman movie. The story focuses on Baman facing three enemies: catwoman Penguin (beautifully played by Danny DeVito) (stealthy Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the superb Christopher Walken). <br /> <br /> Maybe the best entry into the story. series, has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that really stands out. The cast is simply wonderful, although the obvious highlight is DeVito as the multi-layered Penguin. Here is a guy who is evil, pitiful, funny and perhaps most important, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants still causes shivers down the spine. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn into first class performances. <br /> <br /> I do not hesitate to say that "Batman Returns" is my all-time favorite of Batman released (sorry, Dark Knight Fans). If you want a superhero movie that has a bit more to offer besides flashy effects and full-scale action then check out this underrated movie. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, is at least the best movie that Tim Burton ever made.
