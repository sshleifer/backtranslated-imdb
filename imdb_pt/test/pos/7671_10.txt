I found this movie to be one of the best for this time and season. The cast was very exceptional and very entertaining for everyone who saw it. I wish my younger generation had seen this movie but I have not been able to find or see the movie in the past. the early sixties and I've been looking for it ever since. The film showed me the potential of how far we have come to become talented in an office where we could only have meaningless roles to act as buffoons and servants. <br /> <br /> Porky and Bess showed a little of the urban life of my neighborhood as I saw in the time when I needed good solid male models. Singing and acting made me jump for days, playing different characters in this great film.
