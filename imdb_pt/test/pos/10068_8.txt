"What's his name?" "Loudon" "Loudon what?" "Clear." <br /> <br /> That gag still catches me, TWENTY ONE year after the movie was released. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie back then and I love it today. I must have seen this hundreds of times in the past, and when I bought the DVD recently I still remember some of the dialogues. <br /> Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman arrested for a crime she did not commit. When she leaves, she decides to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Griffin Dunne (what happened to him?), plays a lawyer for the father of his fiancee (John McMartin). The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki from jail to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus as part of a supposed new public relations program. A seemingly easy task, but there are a lot of complications, some funny dialogues and some admittedly stupid but funny scenes along the way. <br /> <br /> Madonna has a stupid voice in this movie that even I got. watching with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible to me (hence only 8/10), but otherwise I can not imagine her doing it in her normal voice. <br /> <br /> This film shows the comedic side of Madonna (very needy today, maybe), and she genuinely is funny on paper. Dunne does a great role, while Haviland Morris is perfect as the arrogant bride. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but I think this is a great movie and it will sit happily. and watch it 100 times more.
