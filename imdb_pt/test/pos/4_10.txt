This movie was sadly under-promoted, but proved to be truly exceptional. Entering the theater I knew nothing about the movie except that a friend wanted to see it. <br /> <br /> I was taken aback by the high quality of the movie. I could not imagine Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance really exemplified his character. This film is exceptional and deserves our monetary support, unlike so many other films. No use recommending any movie, but in this case I recommend that everyone see it. <br /> <br /> This movie is really exceptional!
