is not a masterpiece of Larry McMurty, but presents itself as a good western, any of the solitary pigeons. who never takes on the role of Woodrow's call, makes a great portrait in his own style. It's also easy to see that they were looking to use this as a stepping stone to the TV series (both version of it) and that the writers knew how to keep the taste alive William Peterson was amazing in this, the CSI geeky guy is not the character he interpret - this guy can do everything that seems <br /> <br /> deserves to be enjoyed by those who like the western <br /> <br /> 4out5 stars
