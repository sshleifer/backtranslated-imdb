Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film that portrays an era full of emotions and varied characters, as seen through the eyes of a boy. The film clearly supports "it takes a village to raise a child" and recalls an important moment in black history and culture. I earned an incredible amount of respect for Macy Gray as an actress. His character was a little crazy, but kind; Of course we all know someone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as a nanny. I never realized that Epatha was a great actress. Law & Order has never shown the depth of Epatha's acting skills as Lackawanna Blues. I was pleasantly surprised and amazed! The music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood ... it was a nostalgic sweet to walk the road of memory. I really enjoyed the movie and look forward to the release of the DVD to add to my collection.
