If Family Guy offends you or you just do not get the humor, unfortunately this show is making fun of you and the overly religious, dull and politically correct masses of people in the United States. So, put your morale aside and enjoy this show. FG is a hilarious opening of mind into the reality of today's society. Whoever said this show is for a young and immature audience is very much mistaken. With all the references to old movies and politics from 10 to 80 years ago, I could not imagine any young, immature kid finding this funny. Family Guy is definitely for an open-minded mature audience who is not afraid to criticize American society. We took off the hat for Seth and all the crew that were able to make this show happen.
