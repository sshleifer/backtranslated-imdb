Over the years, I've become a fan of director / writer Barry Levinson and he did not disappoint me with that very funny look on politics. The popular TV comedian Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) enlightened the nation with his blunt jokes about the state of the country and the elected politicians responsible. Night after night he has his fans rolling on the islands; then the question is proposed that Dobbs run for president. His manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken) says he's going ahead. Dobb's irreverent truisms launch a base movement that puts him on the ballot. Comedian to the president-elect. Meanwhile, a young woman (Laura Linney) finds a flaw in the computer system that will count the bills coast to coast. My favorite sequence is Linney's collapse in the cafe. Williams is absolutely hysterical with his quick jokes. Others in the cast: Jeff Goldblum, Lewis Black and Rick Roberts.
