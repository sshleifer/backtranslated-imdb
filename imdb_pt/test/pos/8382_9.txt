Brad Pitt stuck his index finger into Diane Kruger's leg wound and kept it there until he got what he wanted. Funny, terribly so. The invented yarn takes "The Dirty Dozen" for a ride and sometimes leaves it to honor other films. Lot of fun. Even "Paris when it screams" is mentioned in a delightfully organic dialogue. I was thrilled by the Christoph Waltzer character and his phenomenal performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There is a whim on the character who is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe, but. thankfully, his hand. your brain and your heart are visible all over the place.
