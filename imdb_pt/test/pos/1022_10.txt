I was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this movie is very much like my school. The school play where the main actors kiss, what happened at my school. A crazy gang of lads, my school again just when we went on a cross country race, we'd have a cigarette! 'Getting the blow', someone in my school invaded the light from the sky and broke the flares! after that they were kept in a safe !!! What about certain nighttime activities! what can I say .... The movie really came out in 1982, I remember this as it was when I bought my house and the movie was showing up at the same time. If you like British films and films about school, growth and period pieces then this is for you. Another very similar film, 'SWALK', came out a few years earlier and I would like to see it again, also 'Kes' is in the genre. Highly recommended. (But trust me, 1982 is when it came out)
