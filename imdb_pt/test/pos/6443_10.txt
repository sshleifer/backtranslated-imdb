An orphan boy named Tom (Tommy Pender), who works for a pair of somber chimney sweeps, is falsely accused of stealing from the mansion where he is working by Mr. Grimes (James Mason) - the real thief - and goes on the run. Tom's only alibi is the mansion's niece (Samantha Gates, a slender blue-eyed blonde with long, wavy hair, which I'm sure was the main reason I watched it repeatedly as a boy). He and his dog jump into a river and a witch turns them into cartoon characters who breathe water! While he is submerged, he befriends and rescues a group of water-breathing children, known as water babies, from a shark. <br /> <br /> A very interesting and always fascinating fable, created in 1850, which should appeal to all children. The animation (42 minutes of the HBO VHS 85-minute print) is only average, but is preferable to the latest animation - even computer animation! My only real complaint is a plot hole caused by a deleted scene. At 42:06, after the first verse of "Cockalorum Alto", the film cuts to a scene with octopus swimming, followed by the meeting of Tom and Jacque with Terence. This leads to a scene in which the killer shark (voiced by Mason) takes our heroes into a trap. The shark then greets Tom with "Young Tom, so nice to see your ugly mug again" - but this is the first time in HBO's imprint that Tom knows the shark! Most reference books list the runtime as 92 or 93 minutes, and were previously available from Sultan Entertainment and Nelson, so it is very likely that HBO's print will be edited and / or compressed in time. Adding insult to injury, MGM released a 76-minute DVD release in 2002! Let's hope a restored version will appear in the near future. <br /> <br /> The film is copyright Ariadne Films 1978. "Ariadne" is the water baby voiced by Samantha Gates. Bernard Cribbins, who plays Mason's partner in crime, also expresses the electric eel. A.K.A. Slip Slide Adventures.
