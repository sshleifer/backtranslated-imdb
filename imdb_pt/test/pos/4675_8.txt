I liked this movie. More than I expected. There is plenty of action, intrigue and places to make it worthwhile. Although I still can not see Mark Wahlberg as a leader, he has managed to be good enough to be a trusted administrator and that's okay. <br /> <br /> The superhero of the film is the Mini Cooper. It is shown to have the speed, dexterity and muscle to pull off any work. And deal with a manic driver as the character of Charlize Theron.
