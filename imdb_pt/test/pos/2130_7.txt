I missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played a week. I had to settle for the shorter version of two-and-a-half hours or so a year later and was shocked by what I saw. I left the theater thinking I had witnessed a masterpiece and wondering what the full version was like. <br /> <br /> The full version is good but has incredibly tedious sequences that the whole movie is pulled down and almost sinks under the waves. <br /> <br /> The problem is entirely in the issue that should be labeled as the final word about excess. There are times when things go on and on and nothing happens. Photos of people in a city who spend a lot of time without purpose in narrative. We have beautiful views and visions of such beauty that they bring tears to your eyes, but they are often used as a place of space rather than punctuation or to establish a place. Much of the longer version seems to be on the screen simply because it looked good. <br /> <br /> I've tried really sitting down and watching Heavens Gate without resorting to the Fast Forward button, but somewhere along the way I think I can not stand it anymore. <br /> <br /> I wish MGM felt sorry for us and released the shorter version for the DVD, in addition to the huge dinosaur. Maybe as a package of two so we could see which is the best version, and whether Cimino was crazy or not. <br /> <br /> And while they were at it, why not include the edition of the Johnson County War? 90 minutes. Supposedly, United Artists repaired another cut in the hope of recovering some of its money. If it was already done or still exists it is in the air, but it would be interesting to see.
