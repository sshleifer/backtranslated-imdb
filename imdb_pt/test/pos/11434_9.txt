As a modern Marco Polo, from Venice to China, here we go Amelio, again, taking on the task of making us the gray area in the middle of two worlds in solid colors. Corroded by the collateral damage of globalization, Europe's pessimistic view is mutual with China. <br /> <br /> The vision of this charming but intriguing country is treated from below, devoid of any pretense of learning or imposing opinions. The reality, however, is hard. Abandoned and exploited children, hive houses, backward areas are the other porcelains we ignore. Vincenzo (Castellitto), a steel mill technician, is one of us. Your trip to China is a pretext to understand, to learn from the interior of a country where the progress and problems of the third world coexist in an infamous balance. It is not exactly clear if Vincenzo knew, for the first time, that the mechanical component was already fixed, I think so; in any case it is a minor aspect. Liu, the Chinese girl, is the key to the whole movie. She carries many difficulties in the back, has the strength to overcome, but how could she fight with little money and little help? <br /> <br /> The realistic and impartial view of the facts by the girl, rejecting Vincenzo's money, touched me a lot. A bundle of notes can not recover the husband, the baby (forced to treat like a stranger by the Law), protect it with derision. Liu knew his intentions were benign and gentle, far from being a cold charity act. Her friendship is beautifully narrated, the way she grows step by step, dignified and formative, unique. An invaluable legacy to maintain. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are impressive, either by acting (Vincenzo crying on the ferry) or by the dialogues (in the restaurant, on the railways). In addition to a careless edition and a rather lazy start, "La Stella che non c'Ã©" is brilliant and sharp just because it chronicles the undisclosed truths. <br /> <br /> In competition at the 63rd Venice Film Festival, a lot of focus on Tai Ling for the Mastroianni Prize, dedicated to emerging stars. She definitely deserved this award. <br /> <br /> [8/10]
