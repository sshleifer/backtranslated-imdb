Having recently seen Grindhouse, I was browsing Video USA looking for some movies that might have played in real theaters in central areas during the '70s. The Hong Kong Five Fingers of Death action movie looked like just such a picture. The cartoon-like sound effects and the quick jumping cuts seemed a little disturbing at first, but after a while I was so engrossed in the story and the characters that I did not care. Parts of the score sounded like the TV theme song "Ironside" which was later used in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies. Some scenes involving the hero's fianc√© seemed to border on the parody, but they were so brief that they did not ruin the movie. The most exciting parts involve the tournament and some segments of revenge after that. Worth seeing for kung fu fans!
