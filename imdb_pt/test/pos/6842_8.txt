Came through this movie recently after so much time hearing about it. It's a great non-pretentious movie for people who love movies and noir movies. Not "camping" but good humored. <br /> <br /> GREAT TEMPLATE! From the magnificent Carla Gugino and Emma Thompson to the German superstar Til Schweiger, this film is a feast for the eyes. Alan Rickman is very funny as the antagonist of the gang. I would love to see the spin off of the movie with this character and Emma Thompson resolving cases and arguments between them all the time (much like Tracy and Hepburn, etc.). <br /> <br /> Intelligent storytelling, plot twists and Don see if it is not the scope because the compositions are very rich). Sexy sexy and very fun time. Best use of Just Like Heaven by The Cure ever (must see believe it!) <br /> <br /> ********
