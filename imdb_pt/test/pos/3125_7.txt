This movie is about two horse dealers who agree to escort a small group of Mormons through the desert. Along the way, they encounter a murderous family of thugs who threaten peaceful people and put their pilgrimage in danger. WAGON MASTER is what I would call a "little" John Ford film, as it obviously did. it does not have the budget or scope of some of its other faroestes. In particular, this movie does not have the big stars like John Wayne, but it allows some of the usual supporting characters to take center stage. Longtime Ford actors Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr. and Ward Bond were elevated to leading roles and perhaps what came as "the" protagonist was probably Johnson - although the other two had almost as much time and focus . This is not a bad thing, since the movie worked very well without the big star - and it's worth seeing it. <br /> <br /> Now, that does not mean I loved the movie. It was very good but certainly not perfect. In particular, as far as music is concerned, you will probably love it or hate it. I found the music of the Sons of the Pioneers a little schmaltzy at times. He evoked a good mood, but he seemed to occasionally dominate the scenes. I think a little would have worked much better. Plus, with their incessant singing in the background, I expected Roy Rogers to show up at any moment. Another small problem is that the plot was incredibly simple and the ending was practically a foregone conclusion. <br /> <br /> However, and I'm happy to say that there is a 'however', despite being somewhat stereotyped and sentimental. , the movie still worked well. This was mainly due to the legal direction of John Ford as usual as well as Ben Johnson's outstanding performance. He was able to provide a great anchor for the movie. Another plus for me is that I saw it in the same week as BRIGHAM YOUNG, another Mormon Migration movie. While BRIGHAM YOUNG was a little foolish and overly "holy" in his portraits, here the Mormons were less "perfect" and more like real people - with weaknesses and personalities. Oh, and speaking of BRIGHAM YOUNG, it seems that Jane Darwell was the 'go to' girl in movies about the Mormons during this time, since she was a great supporting character in both films. Considering that she died in BRIGHAM YOUNG and was marked about 20 years before the WAGON MASTER, this is a trick! <br /> <br /> In addition, if you'd like to catch a glimpse of the famous Jim Thorpe, he's a tiny role where he plays the indecent Indian dance next to Jane Darwell around the campfire.
