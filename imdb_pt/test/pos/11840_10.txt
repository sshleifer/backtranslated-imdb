I think this show is incredible !!! I love, and I love Fabian (not in a romantic way), but if I were there I would totally support Fabian as Haley, and the other girls, yes !! I mean, if they're rivals, why do not you want to fight them !! Fabian is the only one who has the courage to confront people and say what he thinks, not just stay and suck !!! FABIAN 100% !!!!! I also love Haley because she's like a normal girl who does not want to be with cows, insects and grass everywhere, and sleep in a warm bed with servants, that is, if you have the chance and the money, why? do not do it!!! and Fabian also, Fabian brought pizza and just like 2 or 3 people said thank you, I mean he spends money !!
