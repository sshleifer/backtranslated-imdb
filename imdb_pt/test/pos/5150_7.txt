I like the national anthem. I like the National Anthem if for nothing else, just before the Midnight News, I imagine that I'm playing the band's dishes. It's not as easy as you may think! One two three four; One two three four; but then what? So I have sympathy with the bass drummer in Roy Andersson's wonderful film, patiently waiting for his cue to hear a 70's tape recorder. The motive of the '70s seems to continue, with some classics, without soul. furniture. In addition, each scene has a strange jade wash that emphasizes the tiny nuances of the subtlest acting. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the remarkable purple boots of Jessika Lundberg. Boots that otherwise would have inspired an advertising campaign of the Silk Cult. <br /> <br /> But the hard part. Someone asked me what it was about. Well, there is a scene in that opening line like "I do not have this length in green" Brilliant. Straight from a box by Gary Larson. <br /> <br /> I can not say what it's all about. Go see yourself. <br /> <br /> Ron Plasma <br /> <br /> Hmm. Larson! Sounds Swedish <br /> <br /> (Viewed 15Apr08)
