Never been kissed, starring Drew Barymore as Reporter Josie Gellar is a sweet, extremely sentimental and sometimes very painful tale of a shy woman named Josie Gellar who although brilliant is calm and timid and has never been kissed by a man. She gets her first big news for the paper she works in - disguised as a high school student who befriends popular boys and finds out what really happens in the high school world. The only problem is that Josie was never popular. High school was, in fact, a traumatic experience for her as she received many cruel and provocative jokes. Josie grabs this task, both to finally "fit in" and to get a spoon - which she thinks is the main premise of the story. <br /> <br /> Never been kissed is one of those movies that is so sentimental and schmaltzy at times, particularly in some scenes at the end that the limits of credibility are tested and many cynics may not like this movie. However, it is very sweetly done. Drew Barymore is perfect as the awkward but lovely Josie - she breathes fresh air into the character and makes her seem perfectly realistic. I also liked Leelee Sobiesky as the intellectual student who befriends Josie on her first day at school. <br /> <br /> I've never been kissed for some really funny moments when Josie got off on her frenetic efforts to be cool. Example - The scene from the reggae bar. I also loved the look of Josie's brother Rob, who also comes back and signs up as a high school student, the way he helps Josie give her "dream" of finally fitting is hilarious. At the same time, as Josie's pitiful story of her original years in high school is shown in flashback, it is extremely painful. You do not have to have had similar experiences in high school so that Josie is affected by your story - Drew is wonderful in making your character have a personal connection with the audience and we love Josie from the beginning. <br /> There are a lot of "bad girls", a 2004 release in this movie, but the mean girls were honestly much more courageous. I've never been kissed it becomes a romantic photo, since Josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question is: will they be together? <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It was very well done in some areas. The film is tacky in some places, yes, the last realistic scene - not at all - does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious way of Hollywood? Oh yeah yeah baby! But it handles beautifully, there are some lessons to be learned here. The film never preaches but can paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select group. I've actually met people who have had similar experiences with Josie - I've met people very much like all those characters - I think many people just do not know or can not conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world. high school, and how painful it may be, but it's there. It is not unrealistic. What struck me was Drew's speech at the prom while she demonstrates the "sheep mentality" that can exist as predominantly - as Hollywood is made as many think it can be, it was well made and very true. <br /> <br /> I am never having been kissed sound much heavier than it is, in fact, this is a perfect movie to choose when one wants a sweet feel good light comforting image. It's engaging, sweetly acted and just Rufus. I'd say, check it out. 8 out of 10.
