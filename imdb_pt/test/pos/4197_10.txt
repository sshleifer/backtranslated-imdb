"Head" is one of those movies that you will have a hard time convincing your friends to see, but when they do, they will fall in love with him. I do not know how many times this happened to me. This movie is so funny and bizarre, really a deconstruction of everything the Monkees had done so far in their careers. Much credit goes to Bob Rafelson who pretty much ended Monkee's career with this movie. My guess is that he wanted to get out of directing the TV show and getting into features, which he did in a big way after that. Micky Dolenz is absolutely hilarious. I can not believe he does not have a second life as a comic actor after this movie. This film has many great appearances and many wonderful psychedelic nonsense. I feel that the reputation of this film continues to grow and would not surprise me if it eventually became a cult classic.
