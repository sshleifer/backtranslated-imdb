I watched this short moment ago on the website of the Sundance Film Festival, and I must say it is absolutely amazing. I hoped it was fun - like all Sundance shorts - but I was not prepared for such deep sadness and at the same time a sense of passion and beauty. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen any of this year's entries for the festival, I suggest you go on the site and watch these mini-plays - I've seen them all, and I can honestly say 'O Youth In Us' is what most touched my heart. I'm not the weakest member of the public when it comes to romance in movies, but my eyes are so full that I'm surprised that I can still see the screen. <br /> <br /> I agree with 'addicted2you', it really is a masterful work of directing work, and cinematography will take your breath away. <br /> <br /> I can not think of a better way to spend 12 extra minutes.
