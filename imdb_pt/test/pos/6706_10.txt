Based on Colin Wilson's book "Space Vampires". This is (in my humble opinion) one of the best parts of the Sci-Fi Horror to come out of the eighties. The effects (made by ILM) are still supported by current standards. The actors are mostly British and the British seem to give this film a greater depth of realism. <br /> <br /> The film was criticized by critics and unfortunately did not do well at the box office on both sides of the Atlantic. . Tobe Hooper blamed the promotional work that was done before its launch as the main cause of low profits. But for whatever reason, this still does not detract from the fact that this is an excellent movie with a great cast and very rhythmic plot. <br /> <br /> Not to be overlooked.
