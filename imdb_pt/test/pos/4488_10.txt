It seems that there are two types of people in the world: those who think that "Five Characters" is one of the best episodes in the series and those who are so cool they know it sucks because they are very clever and have already predicted the " in the end (which apparently, in their little minds, is the only reason the Twilight Zone exists: to come with twists). <br /> <br /> There are many lame episodes in the series and I'm not one that evaluates all episodes of TZ Ten. But this is certainly one of those who deserve this classification. It is claustrophobic and colorful. The suspense is built and we can not wait for the revelation of the secret in the end. But whatever that secret is, what these people are, it does not really matter. Most of the beauty of the episode is lead to this. It would be so powerful if we never figure out what these strangers in a strange place really are.
