An ingenious production that holds the interest since the first scene in which Max is choosing a ring in a jewelry store. Much of what follows reminds us of Shakespeare's "Mid-Summer Night's Dream," in which Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with each other's friends. Here Max and Lucien both prone to love at first glance mingle with Lisa and Alice, and Alice complicates things when she calls herself Lisa. On top of the jubilant confusion, Max is inclined to get involved in incidents that bring back memories of two years ago. And as Max has many of these dreamy episodes, we're subject to one flashback after another, many in my opinion because at the first screening of the film, I was not sure if it was in the present or in the past. Running through aisles, stairways, through doors, into elevators, etc. I accept all of this in a fast-paced movie, but do we have to have so many people bumping into each other? After four collisions, it will no longer have any impact if you give the pun a license. High marks for art design! The apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor but I wonder how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in Paris. Saving a suicidal person from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it's in that movie too when Max almost quits at the same time. However, a kiss or two soon makes him feel better. If you can find your way through all the flashbacks, you'll finally find yourself at the airport where Max's devoted sister will give you a very sweet kiss. One can say that she is the one who solves the complications of love, like Puck in a "Dream of a mid-summer night".
