If you are a fan of science fiction, and you only saw this movie once, please, please take a second look. I just did, and I was amazed at how good I thought the movie was, unlike when I first saw it three years ago. The first time I was certainly impressed by the astronomical views that were treated in this movie, but overall I did not think much about the movie as a whole. It was an alien scam, and I thought the description of the monsters was a case of really bad science. That they were allergic to light was something I found particularly ridiculous. Based on my first screening, I recently rated this movie as 5. <br /> <br /> However, now that the sequel, Chronicles of Riddick, is on the way, and the movie poster for that looks incredible, I thought I'd better brush Pitch Black one more time, so I borrowed a friend's video. I'm so glad I did. There is much of what I thought I remembered from the first showing that turned out to be extremely inaccurate. I thought most of the characters died very early in the movie. This was not so. I thought the character of Claudia Black was the first to die. This was not so. I thought Riddick was the only survivor. This was not so. <br /> <br /> I see now that the film works * extremely * well. There is no excessive and tiring focus on the monsters. It's much more of a human drama. The main characters are attractive and capable of some convincing acting. And there are so many little details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and believable, like the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet they collide on, and the fact that the monsters ate everything on the planet, and so they saw each other. <br /> <br /> And I have to mention the astronomical sights again. That is to say, we began to see the spacecraft passing through the tail of a comet, with pieces of space passing through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just as the castaways think it is dark, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon, and everything is shrouded in a blue glow. As the eclipse approaches, we see the immense giant gas-ring giant rise in the sky, and in the final scene of the movie, we see the ship skid right above one of these rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I do not think I've seen any other science fiction movie that really made such a point of including those things. I hope to see much more in the sequence. <br /> <br /> Pitch Black now gets me a rating of 9 out of 10. A cult classic? You bet!!
