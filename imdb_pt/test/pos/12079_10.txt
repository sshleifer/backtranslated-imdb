"Who will love my children" saddest movie I've ever seen. Definitely 10/10. Released on TV in 1983. The film was released on VHS. DVD release is a must, sooner or later. Mother dying of cancer, must find homes for all her children before she dies because her thoughts are that her husband and father of children is not able to care for them after she dies. She can find homes for the children except one, a boy who is not wanted because he suffers from epilepsy. Very sad when you do not want to. In a good tear jerker, put your hands on this movie. I'm a man even I cried when I watched this movie. To not lose.
