I was introduced for the first time to the John Waters films when I saw "Women's Issues" at IFC. I was disgusted, but for some sick reason I liked it. So I caught the Pink Flamingos DVD in the John Waters Boxed Set. The movie is about Babs Johnson's "The Filthiest Person Alive", who lives in a trailer in Maryland with his obese obese egg mother, and his insane son Crackers. In the movie, you'll see unhealthy visions like sex with chickens, drag queens, people eating feces, torture and all other types of random humiliation. The movie has a soundtrack of rock and roll artists from the 60's. The only problem is that some parts of the movie seem to drag on and can get a little boring. I found "Female Trouble" a little more fun. NC-17 score for explicit sex, violence and disturbing images. Appreciate.
