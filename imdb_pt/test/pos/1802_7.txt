I'm glad Cage changed his name to Coppola and got that part by himself. Disinterested, no need to think deeply, but a cute piece about attracting the opposites - although their parents are still hippies ... Capture the voice of the early 80's - the lament of the valley and the funk on the other side. You can see the beginning of Cage's talent.
