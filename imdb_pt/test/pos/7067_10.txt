I'm not American, but meatballs still impress me. Maybe because it's a sweet and sweet movie. Watching again today has made me sentimental for a time when I can not really put my finger on a place I can not remember. <br /> <br /> Meatballs are just a great movie. It reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and anything was possible. <br /> <br /> If you're reading this, you probably know what I mean. <br /> <br /> All I can say on top of what I've already said is that meatballs should be even more nostalgic if you're American. <br /> <br /> I think you know what I mean by that too.
