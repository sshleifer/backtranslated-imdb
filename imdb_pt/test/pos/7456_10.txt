Perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the US, "Duckman," is no more than 70 episodes in four seasons. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the often innocuous criticism found in "The Simpsons" (a good show by itself) and the rude-by-rude humor in "South Park," every bit of this series follows a plan . The critique of American society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, brings much more bite than in any other animated series. <br /> <br /> The cultural references in "Duckman" also tend to be obscure sometimes the fan sites will realize that most have not even been caught). In that, it's different from "The Simpsons," which generally uses pop culture instead of the eyebrow stuff usually hidden in "Duckman." Like other people writing about it, there is a growth in the characters (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed). In addition, making the main character not only a neurotic offensive, but in fact someone who lives a personal tragedy (as is clear in episodes like "The Duck Once and Future" ("You will love it until the end of your days ") and in" Bev Takes a Holiday "(when he takes to telling Beverly all those things he could not tell Beatrice), the series is anchored in a deep sense of reality. <br /> <br /> You can not help feeling sorry for him and his lucid madness. <br /> <br /> In short, in my opinion, the best design ever made in the USA and one of the best series of all time. will be sometime on DVD. Many things that Duck said make a lot more sense today.
