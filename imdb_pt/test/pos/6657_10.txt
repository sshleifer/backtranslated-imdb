I just saw the DVD and I loved it. In particular, I found the director and Jude and Nicole did an incredible job with the kiss between Inman and Ada just before Inman left. It was the most romantic kiss I've ever seen in a movie. I thought it was crucial to set the tone for the rest of the movie; He managed to make it believable that Inman and Ada would walk / wait, respectively, for each other for all that time without ever actually having a relationship. I thought the film managed this crucial plot point much better than the book itself. I'm sure a lot of you guys are going to be quick to name other movie kisses that look better, but this one is for me! Jude and Nicole showed incredible chemistry in the few scenes they had together.
