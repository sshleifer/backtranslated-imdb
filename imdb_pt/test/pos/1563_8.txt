I just saw this on cable. I liked. This interested me and the dramatic choices were good. The old couple was very nice and good at being subtly scary. Cinematography is not so good, but the video spent also increases the sense of realism, so it's a compromise, you know? Sometimes the girl was pounding in the New England accent. The accent came and went. Anyway, I thought the movie was well done overall, though. The plot was strong and the dramatic tension was maintained because you felt that their mystery was subtle, even if things seemed mundane. Good job with low budget. Another good filmmaker SUNY Purchase. Way to go
