When you read about this movie, you want to shrink. I've seen it countless times and I still shrink! So what's the attraction here? I think, for me, it's the eccentricity of the novel. I find it super refreshing to have an eccentric engagement between this NYC-Jimmy-Breslin-like columnist and a down-in-his-luck (health-wise) ballerina. You feel embarrassed by Paul Sorvino in his rather subtle approach to conquering this woman. Like the guy at the bar who can not give a tip. He's a bit overweight (at least as a dancer's wisher. I hope this is not unpleasant) and possibly a bit too old for her. Good change of pace of the Greek god courting Supermodel. Bill Conti's score stayed in my head all those years later, which is a good sign. However, some of the performances are just terrible. A subplot involving a young Puerto Rican boy helped by Sorvino's character is hilariously bad. But the opening scene where Ditchburn is warming up for Carole King draws you into this story. Good luck finding. You'd think Lifetime would be re-framing it or even WE, but I have not seen it for a few years.
