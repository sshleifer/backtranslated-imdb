As already noted, the short film "Every Sunday" (1936) may be considered the first video clip. This was a happy accident resulting from the need for MGM to produce a variety of short films for display with its feature length material. They had a couple of young singing talents (Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin) available and essentially put together a mix of musical styles in a kind of Norman Rockwell show on the park setting. <br /> <br /> Who would have dreamed at the time that they would capture the best collection of images since the sequence of Eisenstein's "Odessa Steps." <br /> <br /> It's Sunday with some inattentive people sitting around a small strip of wood in the park while a tired-looking set plays Strauss. Events unfold and next Sunday Judy and Deanna save the day. The opera Deanna sings "Il Bacio" (The Kiss) and Garland follows with the contrast "Waltz with a Swing". The climax combines the two styles well in a "Americana" duet. <br /> <br /> A must see. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
