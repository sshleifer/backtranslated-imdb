I would like to highlight these excellent points in favor of this film: <br /> <br /> # 1 Angelina Jolie's sex scene <br /> <br /> # 2 Foley got over <br /> <br /> The plot # 3 was quite thick <br /> <br /> The # 4 DVD includes trailers and parades for chapters <br /> <br /> # 5 No animal was harmed during the production of the film <br /> # 6 homage to the blade runner throughout the movie <br /> # 7 cans of burning garbage <br /> <br /> funny face # 8 with no legs <br /> <br /> # 9 Voice overs of Jack Palance has added a real dynamic element to the movie. <br /> <br /> Wise advises, for example "When you dine with the devil, bring a long spoon". <br /> <br /> # 11 Angelina Jolie was only 18! <br /> <br /> In short: an evening of entertainment was offered.
