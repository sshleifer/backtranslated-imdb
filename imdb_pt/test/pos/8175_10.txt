A great movie. <br /> <br /> A great love story. Lots of sword fighting. Huge battle scenes. Heroes and villains. Real story. <br /> <br /> Few in the West know much about Chinese history. Chin Zchaundi founded China. The country is indeed named in his honor. Some are familiar with the newly unearthed terracotta army. This is an historical epic of how it ended the period of conflicting states and unified China. He founded a dynasty that lasted only 14 years, but was immediately replaced by the Han Dynasty that has permanently defined Chinese civilization ever since.

Roman parallel domination in the world (Western and Western worlds) was achieved without a unique personality like Chin.It would not be for another century before the West produced Caesar - the closest comparable Western figure. Chin is shown with great sympathy here at the beginning, but it develops along The story recounts only the ruthless despot, but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for the character's real development throughout this long film.The famous story about the encounter with the murderer is as true as any anecdote of Gong Li is adorable, she is the emotional core of the story.It all contributes to a great film production.
