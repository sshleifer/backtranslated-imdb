Nightbreed is not only great, it's also unique, even taking into account other Barker films that never lack originality. An incredible adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. For the horror genre, it has various symbolisms and subtle references. Certainly a lot of fun to have, a bit to think about, if anyone cares. And, not to forget, a good score. Well, special effects, as usual, age faster than anything, but that's probably the only downside. I just saw it after ten years, and still think it's something to recommend.
