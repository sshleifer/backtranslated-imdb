Subtle, delicate, touching. <br /> <br /> A young man in a summer dress on a bicycle as an embodiment of perfect joy. Story of a coming-out and relationship anatomy. <br /> <br /> Soft ambiguous gestures, slices of desire and a day as an innocent miraculous expression space. <br /> <br /> Two men, a girl, an afternoon at the beach, some words and a gift. Religious traits and a pantheistic vision. Surround yourself with light and expression, nooks of an ordinary day and a warm night. <br /> <br /> A chaste and erotic film in which gay identity or first sexual intercourse are only tools for the good definition of a universe with sensory values. <br /> <br /> Promise of self-discovery, the universe of exploration of beauty, the sign of Ozon and the same nostalgic air of all creation, "Robe d'ete" is a splendid occasion to understand the moment as a projection of dream, look with emotion and soul of child the essence of the essence beyond the images or people.
