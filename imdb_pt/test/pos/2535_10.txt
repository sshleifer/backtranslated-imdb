The film begins with the director talking with the camera and saying that he will show a story about Brazilian street children whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill in order to survive. In fact, the main character (Pixote) was played by an 11-year-old street kid. What follows is one of the most brutal, depressing, and horrifying movies I have ever seen. I saw him about 17 years ago (on a double account with "Black Orpheus") and never forgot that. I do not think I want to see him again - it was too much. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD !!!! The scene that will not leave me is when Pixote finds a prostitute who has to abort her own fetus. You do not see her do this ... but you quickly see what she's left. It's almost 20 years later and just remembering that the scene bores me. SPOILER END !!!!! <br /> <br /> The movie gets more brutal and ends the way it can. What is even more distressing is that stories like these actually happened in Brazil in 1981 ... and they are still happening today. <br /> <br /> A brutal movie distressing ... but it should be seen if you can handle it. It surprises me that it has an R rating - I've seen movies rated X minus graphics. 10.
