Women will like this movie better than men. Of course, women enjoy all the more romantic comedies than men - on average. I usually like romantic comedies a bit, however I considered this a 5.5 for the first 50% of the film and about 6.5 for the next 40% and about 9 for the last 10%. So, unwillingly, I would rate a 7. I record and keep all movies rated 7 or better and none that is a 6 or worse - at least that's my goal. I have over 1200 movies, so why keep the dogs. <br /> <br /> My wife liked this movie much more than I did, although I'm not sure why. I'm a big fan of Drew Barrymore than she is. <br /> <br /> The purpose of this film was about a young girl who goes back to high school (disguised) to write a story about the experience of high school nowadays. She was an idiot in high school the first time and has to learn to be cool the second time around. Her journey to cooldom, as she falls in love with a teacher, is history. <br /> <br /> What drove me crazy in the first half of the movie was how sordid it seemed. I wondered why they would choose her for this role until I realized how she could look like a dog. So much so that I do not really think I want to see her in 15 years when she wakes up in the morning. ARGH! Of course, she turned into a cute (fluffy) woman at the end and she became very popular. <br /> <br /> The ending is about 9.9 on the very sweet scale, so you sappers out there will enjoy it. Otherwise it is not very memorable and easily missed.
