"A bunch of bandits steal a train from the gold shipment you're carrying." In their escape, the bandits parted ways. The only thief who knows where the gold is hiding is dead before he can speak. Three men have a different part of the "lane" that will lead to gold. Can the banker, the villain, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing service? Or will they kill each other first? "The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's Good, the Bad and the Ugly." Several scenes from the film are also taken from other Leone films, Corbucci and more. But for me, it is done in a way that shows no disrespect to the original work. Instead, Any Gun Can Play lovingly parodies some of the greatest films in the history of Spaghetti Western. The opening scene of three men en route to the city and the final clash between the three main stars are a wonderful tribute to the SWs that came before. <br /> <br /> - Castellari adds many nice touches of his own. - the reflection in the spilled wine, the Stranger's entrance with vivid red background and the fun way as gold is discovered at the end. Although highly unbelievable, many of the fighting scenes are well staged and directed. Two particular fight scenes (the market fight and the fight in the bathroom) are very well done. He also is not afraid to try different things with his camera. Tight close-ups, overheads and cornering shots are common in Any Gun Can Play. <br /> <br /> Another advantage is the cast Castellari had to work with. George Hilton is always good at these movies. Gilbert Roland is literally playing Gilbert Roland. And SW newcomer Edd Byrnes stays with the two SW veterans. The supporting cast features, among others, SW Gerard Herter regular. <br /> <br /> Any weapon can play should not be taken too seriously. Nice touches of humor can be found throughout the film. If this is possible with an SW, it's more of a "feel-good" movie - very reminiscent of some of the Terence Hill / Bud Spencer films.
