Leaving aside the "I'm so sure" and "totally gnarly" s this is one of the sweetest and most realistic novels portrayed in the film. deborah foreman (where is she now?) as julie and nicolas cage as randy are as classic as romeu and julieta, tony and maria, jake and samantha ... you can not help but fall in love with them. in addition, the soundtrack - the plimsouls, sparks, skins, flirts and, of course, modern English - is also excellent. For fans of young love movies, I also recommend the recent movie of all the real girls of david gordon green.
