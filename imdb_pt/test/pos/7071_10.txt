Excuse me, if I'm wrong, but "Cronica para un desayuno" could be one of the most important films in the history of Mexican cinema for several reasons. We can get lots of ingredients for a perfect breakfast for the middle-class Mexican family: a cup of surrealistic motifs from Bu√±uel with a small drop of desolate Ripstenian scenery; a pound of phallus symbols around the film and a difficult psychological complexity, more than Todd Solondz's Happiness and the Dogma films. There is a lot of sordidness, black humor, repressed dreams (Teodoro's dream to fly), lack of incestual control (the relationship between Marcos and Luzma), meaningless parallel stories, discreet violence, anachronisms and a small sign of hope (highlighted in Luzma, the husband's return home and "A Little Mas" used for the leit motif). Marcos (Bruno Bichir) is a charming character (I think in a bukosian way), the king - without a crown that expects nothing but broken noses. Luzma (Maria Rojo), the lovely wife, made many faces, but the only thing that worried was that their children had breakfast; She is a loser in many ways and sensual in some moments, but you will fall in love with her. The dragging of the soundtrack (lots of wood) feeds the lack of technical merit, of course, intentional: out-of-focus shots, super-bright close-ups (in introspective scenes), dumb pans and sudden editing cuts. "Chronic" is hard to digest, gets stuck in the throat and anything helps. It tastes bitter, like rotten orange juice sour like overdue milk, but you want to have fun. So I recommend getting a Melox before the show because you will not get hungry after all.
