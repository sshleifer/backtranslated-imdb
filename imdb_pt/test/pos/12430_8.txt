That was on Showtime the other night, and I figured it would be another video-like event, like "Earth vs. the Spider" or any of those other HBO horror shorts. Instead, I found a comedy / gore classic. It was legitimately funny and, surprisingly, the performance was very good. Even my wife, a jaw-dropper of horror in general, nodded and laughed. In addition, the FX was of high quality. Overall, the movie looked like a parody of Joy Ride / Jeepers Creepers, and the two main characters reminded me of the Shaun of the Dead pair. Definitely worth watching, but do not take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The End.
