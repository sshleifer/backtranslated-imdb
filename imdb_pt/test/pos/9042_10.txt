This is easily the best cinematic version of William Faulkner's fiction I have ever seen, and I have seen several of the most prominent. Filmed in Faulkner's hometown in Oxford, Mississippi, it truly captures the sentiment of Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha County. Intruder in the Dust is not one of Faulkner's best novels, but even if it's a clich√© to say that, it would be the crown jewel in anyone else's career. He surpasses Harper Lee's good, but simplistic, To Kill a Mockingbird, fifty feet on the ground (I read that in the ninth year, and that's exactly where it belongs). Two of Faulkner's most prominent characters play important roles in the film, Gavin Stevens and Lucas Beauchamp. Stevens is probably the most common character in all of Faulkner's fiction. He is a lawyer and works easily as a narrator because, unlike many of his other characters, Stevens is a man of logic, not of emotion (at least when he is older). Lucas Beauchamp may be the most prominent of all of Faulkner's black characters (he plays an important role in one of Faulkner's masterpieces, Go Down, Moses); Unlike all other blacks in Yoknapatawpha, he refuses to bow to any white man. He is proud, and many in the white population think it is an execrable quality in a black man. One day, Lucas is found standing on a dead white man with a newly fired pistol in his possession. Most Jefferson and surrounding areas do not see the need for a trial, and everyone is sure Beauchamp will be lynched before the end of the afternoon, or at least the next day, when the murder and arrest occurred on a Sunday. Beauchamp, on the other hand, declares his innocence and tries to convince Stevens to help him. Stevens refuses; the case seems open and closed. But his young nephew, Chick Mallison, because Lucas has helped him in the past, is willing to help him now. As far as I know, no Hollywood movie of this period deals with racism as openly as this. Hollywood movies rarely persecute the black population, but prefer to relegate them to serf roles. If you're an African-American actor, you'd better give up and accept the role of mother, maid, servant, or gatekeeper, because that's the only way you can work. Intruder in the Dust, one of the most memorable non-custodial roles ever played by a black actor, Lucas Beauchamp. And Beauchamp, as I described above, is not a stereotyped character and may have been difficult for the public to accept. To this day, black characters are usually simple, magical, and gentle. The recent attack on the film Far From Heaven is a great example of this. Beauchamp is kind of an idiot and he's very stubborn. Although it is perhaps a little less here than in the novel, it is not any kind of stereotype. He is a complex human being. Juano Hernandez plays Beauchamp extraordinarily well. I have not seen the movie for some time, but it also appears in Robert Aldrich's 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly as well as in the film adaptation of Faulkner's latest novel, The Reivers. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great in the movie. I should also praise Claude Jarman Jr., who has the great role of Chick Mallison. The novel occurs from his point of view, and he is the conventional hero of the image. Jarman is a true actor; he captures the character (which also appears elsewhere in Faulkner's fiction, narrating, for example, events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel The Town) perfectly. He would appear in another major role the following year in the underrated John Ford film, Rio Grande. The only other Clarence Brown film I've seen is the National Velvet, a very different image from the Intruder in the Dust. Your work here is exceptional; I really have to give him credit for capturing Faulkner perfectly. Other famous adaptations of Faulkner are too melodramatic (The Long Hot Summer, filmed in 1958, that I like very much in spite of it) or very cold (Tomorrow, filmed in 1972, of which I do not like, that coldness is a complete misconception of Faulkner). The only other one that really fits well according to its source material is Douglas Sirk's great Pylon filming in 1958 (actually a different kind of Faulkner novel), Tarnished Angels. 10/10.
