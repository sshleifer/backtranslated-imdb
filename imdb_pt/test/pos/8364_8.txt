Shazam was fine, but Hero High was my favorite when I was a kid, I mean before there was Sky High (2005) and Zoom (2006), there was Hero High, a superhero school in training, teenagers with super powers. police to capture the bad guys and sometimes get into embarrassing situations like The Greatest American Hero (1981). It was a fun cartoon to watch, which was also fun, it was the live action show called The Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam. The actors who expressed the characters, also dressed, have characters in the show. Rex Ruthless (John Berwick), Misty Magic (Jere Fields), WeatherMan (Jim Greenleaf), Captain California (Chris Hensel, who also sang the theme song), Dirty Trixie (Maylo Mccaslin), Glorious Gal the love son of Superman and Wonder Woman), and Punk Rock (Johnny Venocour). The whole cast just went with anything, when it came to jokes. The cartoon was a fun comedy of superheroes, I climbed it back in action live like Fat Albert (2004)
