I read about the movie and thought it would be cute, a very good Saturday night movie. I was not expecting anything good, I thought it would be nicer, but hopefully not a totally bad experience. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and flowed very well. Ash Christian was perfect, his ability to turn a strange moment into something touching was cool to see. He could have turned that character into something we've all seen before, but instead he turned away from stereotypes and focused on the character's insight. It was wonderful to see Jonathan Caouette again, I did not know what he would do after the Tarnation. Ashley Fink is a great actress of young character who hope to get more work. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the movie that could have used some work, but in the end it was not a bad time in the movies. My friend described him as a gay Angus / Napoleon Dynamite, but it's something more than that. It's a character study on how it is to grow up gay in a small town, the pain is there, but the mood behind that pain (which only age can make clearer) is magnified. I look forward to seeing more of Ash Christian, Ashley Fink and Jonathan Caouette soon.
