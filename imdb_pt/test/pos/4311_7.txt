Nicely filmed, slightly uneven, "No one" is a good night of entertainment. The plot is quite simple - three yuppies go into a junk with a bunch of strangers in a bar, and ends up being much more than they expected. The acting is decent and there are some unexpected twists. Pay attention to the completely unbelievable (such as the 10-shot revolver and 25 semi-automatic pistol firing).
