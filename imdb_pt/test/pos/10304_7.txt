It's not an easy movie to like at the beginning, with both main characters quite unpleasant, but luckily the heart and soul of the film is the touching performance of Paula Sage that takes the film to unknown waters and transcends the somewhat weird storyline . This gives the film a feeling of truth and makes you think you saw something special (7/10).
