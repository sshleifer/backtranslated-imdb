A wonderful film about people. I saw Four Friends for the first time when it was originally screened in theaters and I have seen it many times since. If you're not watching when you're on TV, I'll meet up with friends and rent it. Invariably, the people who watched this movie found this to be enjoyable. These are friends from childhood to adulthood in the 1950s and 1960s. It's very funny and touching, dealing with first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics - the whole 1960s. be quite dramatic. If you like movies about people, this definitely worth the time.
