When I was engaged, my fiance and I used to go to adult bookstores. He searched for his favorite magazines and, occasionally, a video that attracted attention. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video I really liked. I had just seen another movie back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (which dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was nice. All the other grunts, snorting, blowing and everything. There are only so many times that you can watch a blonde blonde pretending 'that'. <br /> <br /> This movie caught my attention, and I migrated to it, allowing it to wander around the store. I was really interested in something, lol (!) In the video section!) And came over, buying the slightly used copy for me. We took it home and I loved it. Here was a "Porno" with a plot. I was not sure if it was rated porn, but I use the word freely. <br /> <br /> The librarian was a character I could identify with. Alice rejected her advances. She was not comfortable with her own sexuality and prudish in her comments. Bill left and she continued to check the books. The White Rabbit went through the library (a book, if you look closely, I believe (it's ten years since I've seen the movie) was by Lewis C.) and Alice, for the same reason it drives teens to run into the forest when a maniac who uses the chainsaw is behind them, instead of moving on to populated areas, he goes on. It's the best way to make the story move forward. Alice is in Wonderland. <br /> <br /> I barely remember all the details, but I clearly remember the dip in the lake, and how dry it was. I liked how they picked up Humpty Dumpty Up again, the Mad Hatter member was wearing his hat to wear it proudly, and the brother of Dum and Dee's team (which bothered me a bit - then again they could have been husband wife, but I could never tell, no matter how many times I watched). The knight's wife who told Alice to go away and find her own Knight (what's a cool girl like you doing in a knight like this?). <br /> <br /> The part that really caught my eye when I watched about a year or so later was one of the cards (3 of hearts, I think) that resembled my ex's current wife exactly! We could not help but tease her about being in the movie! The King of Hearts was interesting, and the queen was even more so. Due to the opening of the forum, I can not go into details, just say it was based on "orgy" and we'll leave it at that! <br /> <br /> When we parted, I was allowed to take the video - he knew I liked it - but in the time since it was lost on loans. Someday I'll find another copy. <br /> <br /> Btw, if anyone can tell me what scene was cut from the Amazon version, I really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I very much recommend this movie to the crowd over 18 years. It was smooth, sweet and really 70's, but I enjoyed it immensely. 5. D.
