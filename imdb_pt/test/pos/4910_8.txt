Story of a widowed father (Claude Rains) bringing his four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is loved by the great and handsome Ernest (Dick Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is romanticized by an old but wealthy man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to become a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is a romantic. Taste dead beautiful Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), a business associate of his father, comes to stay with them. All the sisters fall in love with him. So the cynical and tough Mickey (John Garfield) comes on the scene ... <br /> <br /> The very entertaining film was a big hit and nominated for five Oscars. It is beautifully directed by Michael Curitz, has a very good script (if predictable) and a very attractive cast (especially Lynn). It was also John Garfield's first film and made him a star. This was so popular that there were three or four sequences (which I have never seen). This is a captivating, entertaining, great budget novel - well worth seeing.
