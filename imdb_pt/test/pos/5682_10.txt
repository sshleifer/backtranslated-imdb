I've read a lot of unflattering comments about this movie, and the only things I've seen they all have in common are "boring" and "unrealistic." <br /> <br /> First of all, they used the true frickin '. 'Crocs! How much more realistic can you get? No CGI, no animatronics, no thumbnails. Just a croc and a piece of meat. Have fun, guys! <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this movie begins slowly. The character development, the little they had, anyway, takes a little time, and I think that's mainly where this movie is missing. <br /> <br /> However, when the movie starts, I found the action dramatically. I do not want to say that there is a lot of action. At most, there are more times when the croc can not be seen, and people are just waiting. However, we know there will be no relief and that the crocodile is just waiting for your time. This had a strange feel similar to other films that have achieved their horror through non-action, such as Open Water (another movie that has been criticized by some viewers as "annoying"). Personally, I think that viewers who are unable to feel the suspense had their attention surgically expanded at birth, but that's just me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the characters look real, and the situation is such that it could really happen to anyone in the right circumstances. Also, the killings are completely real and sometimes it's a bit difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> On the whole, this is a winner.
