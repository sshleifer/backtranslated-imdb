Meester Sharky, you look so ... normal. You would never get a table in this fancy restaurant / bistro. I, on the other, and like grapes and pate, every day. Do you like my fur coat with any fine cut? My huge golden gold rings? Or maybe you like those blondes, what do you say, bombshells, which are all qualified in aerobics and bare petanques, which decorate my long brown velvet couch like so many boils cooked on a plate of foie gras and fried figs. Do you like? You can not have it! Zey is all mine. <br /> <br /> You will never possess it as I possessed. Domino was the best besides Maman. You do not understand the art of making love. Just look at your bottom mustache. It's almost funny to me, no, to think of that ridiculous bulge in your silly face as you scatter around Domino's love hill like the little pig looking for the truffle in the woods, the forest swaying and swaying in the warm winds of desire! You lose again Sharky. <br /> <br /> When I make love to women, you know, Sharky, you know. Zey learns, learns until he becomes the teacher. Not nano-mathematics, the arts of love. Domino was the seedling that I watered. I showered her very often. Everywhere, Sharky. Its scented petals, its proud stalk, everywhere. It will shrivel under your ridiculous hose, like the souffle taken from the oven five minutes before the hour. <br /> <br /> I need to go now Sharky, you bore me with your shameful behavior. It's you who will be thrown on the floor like the stinker. <br /> <br /> Bon chance!
