In the 60's in Hong Kong, a man and a woman move in the same day to adjoining apartments with their respective spouses. Soon they suspect that their spouses are always away from having a affair with each other. A strange bond arises between man and woman as they deal with their sorrow taking turns in the role of each other's partner, before a more complex bond emerges ... No summary can do justice , for Hong Kong's "In the Mood for Love" by author Wong Kar-Wai, is nothing less than a miracle. A story about sadness that can be touching and sometimes funny. A novel that never feels forced or false. No doubt, the director's method has a lot to do with it. Directed from a nonexistent script (although the concept flows widely from a Japanese tale) to favor improvisation, the film is immediately separated from freshness of its performances. The whole movie revolves around that and the rest is pure enhancement. In the center of the film are two characters who will ease their heart and stay there long after the end of the credits: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are simply incredible and no language barrier overlaps a single fragment of immediacy and truth that they exhibit. The additional material is also first-rate: the films are magnificent to watch (partly with Christopher Doyle's "Hero" lenses) and the music is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> This is something that everyone should see, if only because it is by far the most sincere, mature and authentic "love story" that exists. Unmissable.
