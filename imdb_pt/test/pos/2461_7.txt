This film easily rivals the emotional strength, dramatic impact, and high-level performances of "12 Angry Men." I rented on a whim and was surprised that I had not heard of it before. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this was the debut in the direction of Emilio Estevez, but the pace, interaction and development of the characters as well as the intelligent camera work around the character that Estevez interprets suggests an eye Natural. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry that we saw on Wall Street with Martin and Charlie. Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters of subtle despair and escapism; a variation on his characters in "At Play In The Fields of the Lord." She is annoying and can still empathize with her at the same time. <br /> <br /> There are a few moments when I feel the story delays a touch and the moments between Estevez and his ex-girlfriend almost seem written for another film, Estevez comes out as another character all together. But these are minor complaints. <br /> <br /> This movie must be based on a true story or it must have been written by someone who lived through these experiences. I rate 8 of a difficult 10. <br /> <br />
