1956 The man who knew too much is exceptional entertainment. For those who prefer the original 1934, I will say that it is faster and sharper. However, even if the American version were (God forbid!) A big budget blockbuster, I believe it blows the British version out of the water. I think this is one of Hitchcock's top 10 - not a small feat, considering he made over 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time. I find many things to love: 1) James Stewart, America's favorite man for so many years, does a great job playing the distressed father here. He can make any nice movie, and working with such a nice character in such an exciting story, he made me cheering for him intensely. Leslie Banks in the original is nothing in comparison. <br /> <br /> 2) Doris Day. Yes Doris Day. Despite all the criticisms directed at her, I think she makes the loving wife / mother an extremely nice person. I do not agree with the negative remarks about his character; just because she is soft-spoken and gentle, does not mean she is docile and helpless. I do not want to ruin anything, but she makes a crucial breakthrough on her own after her husband has failed. It gives the story a level of heat that just was not there at first, and for those who care about it, this version is the way to go. And I loved what Will Be; I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and deservedly earned his Oscar. He raised the film to another level. <br /> <br /> 3) The sequel to Albert Hall. I do not think it was too long; I think the thriller built all the time for that fantastic crescendo and Hitchcock's direction in that scene was absolutely brilliant. And the killer was truly scary. <br /> <br /> 4) The ending really put a smile on my face; even after the above mentioned scene was over, I found the rescue scene exciting and it was great to see the charming family united again. The last line of the movie is a lot of fun. I do not think the movie started slow; Hithcock was trying to get us to meet and like the McKennas and he did a great job. I was not a big fan of the kid who was playing Hank, but I did not have a problem with him. Because Hank was Ben and Jo's son, I cared about him too; It's not like he's a brat or anything. <br /> <br /> I have not found major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues. Way to go Hitch!
