You have to love the western universe of spaghetti. The sight of a west where the good guys are thrown without warning, caricature villains chew the scene in extreme close-ups and the anti-hero moves away from the girl at the end. Many people call the Corbucci films "depressing." I find this a little dubious with regard to descriptions. I find it dark and ruthless that they are more apt, mainly because 'depressing' suggests a level of sentimentality that almost every director of Eurowestern has ignored in favor of painting characters in broad strokes. <br /> <br /> GLI SPECIALISTI must be seen in all its widescreen glory before it can take its proper place in the canon Sergio Corbucci. It's a beautiful movie. And it makes sense that Corbucci wanted to vent a little with COMPANERS after the tireless number of two punches of THE GREAT SILENCE and this (although he returned to his habitual tricks with the sullen SONNY AND JED). There is still a certain caricature that diminishes the overall severity of the film, but it hurts more than anything good to have an unnecessary inclusion of three hippie-dressed kids walking around town in search of gold and trouble. And it hurts to have Mario Adorf playing the Mexican bandit El Diablo with one hand, since he always plays his characters. <br /> <br /> Those little side complaints are more than enough here to wet the taste buds of spaghetti. amateur Shooting in abundance, the population of a whole city reduced to crawling naked on the ground, the typical iconic badassitude of the laconic antihero (played by Johnny Halliday), the moral bankruptcy of almost every character in the film. Corbucci may never receive the acclaim of the most famous Sergio or of the American patriarchs of the genre, but you and I know that this is a great injustice for a very talented director. His selection of dynamic, in-depth footage, staging with objects that stand close to the camera and back in the background, his talent for fast-paced and feverish energy in moving a story that has not always been so well, the way he photographs open spaces, all in his work, I am sure that if Corbucci was an American and had come 15 years later along with Mann and Hawks, Cahiers du Cinema's critics would have hailed him as an author worthy of serious critical consideration.
