WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE BODY (2005) **** (Voices: Peter Salis, Ralph Fiennes Helena Bonham Carter) <br /> <br /> Fantastic made of clay: Wallace and Gromit Save the day! Crackin 'Good Entertainment! Nick Park, the creator of Wallace & Gromit's animation team, is a genius. His meticulous art in the form of plasticine Plasitinine is a unique process that involves literally thousands of hours (it takes about 8 hours of work to contribute 3 minutes of action to a movie; this incursion into the narrative took 5 years!) Your kind master and loyal team of dogs is finally on the big screen of the duo's first feature and is very good (to coin a phrase of Wallace's usual response to all good things!) Park, who co-directed with Steve Box and co-wrote with Mark Burton and Bob Baker, sends the horror genre in this fun and fast-paced action comedy with inventive Wallace (voiced by Britain's Thespian Salis) and his mute but loyal (and more perceptive) mutt Gromit all furrowed eyebrows and mouthless unconcern) has created a service for the community: pest control ("Anti-Pesto" as they are known) to the next Giant Vegetable Festival has all the city in mo od for all vegetative things a giant and the biggest pesk are troublesome rabbits that eat crunchy goods. Wallace's inventive mind has created a vacuum container that is fast, efficient and, most importantly, harmless to the cute animals that plague the property of Lady Campanula Tottington (dubbed by Bonham Carter, taking a quick break to be the first stop motion animation lady who with her previous turn in "Corpse Bride" a few weeks ago) who is harboring the competition and is a love interest for the Wallace nerd. The only fly-in-the-ointment is Vaidoso, bombastic, noisy and idiotic Victor Quartermaine (voiced by Fiennes, his first attempt at the animated arts, when Patrick Stewart boasted with hilarious results), an evil idiot wearing a male idiot who is planning to marry Lady Tottington for her. riches while he is a chief competitor of W & G's human endeavors, resorting to his dependable weapons and nasty bulldog. <br /> <br /> To add insult to injury, the pair are facing a terrible situation in the form of a huge rabbit. (the titular monster is a good sign for bot h Universal and Hammer horror flicks) that is terrorizing the village and devouring all the vegetables in sight. The two go off to trap and discard the creature, but there is more to it than it does when things progress. <br /> <br /> Relentlessly funny and with incredible elastic and kinetic energy for its wonderful clay counterparts, Park and A Box has created a truly magical and highly entertaining movie with an incredibly detailed production design for your little world , which can take more than one session to absorb how much effort your blood, sweat and tears have to make this instant classic. children of all ages. Wallace, the bald inventor who loves cheese, could easily be Homer Simpson's cousin in the UK with his resounding body and constant ability to do the wrong things while trying to do the right thing; your heart is in the right place, but your head is in the clouds. His sweet passion for Lady Tottington (reminiscent of a pre-plastic surgery, Carol Burnett), who is a head taller than our hero, may recall those of his first unrequited love with a smile of strange admission. His gift of Rube Goldberg to make the trick easier is inspired by the madness that fans will remember from earlier short films, "The Wrong Trousers," "A Close Shave," and "A Grand Day Out." <br /> <br /> But it is in my opinion that the wise, silent and suffering Gromit, his egg eyes boiled with slow burns and disbelief in what is happening, is one of the best animated characters ever created with such an incredible arsenal of exasperated, mouthless expressions and subtle nuances that most of the live action actors would kill to perform in an attempt to convey consternation, worry, regret, genuine surprise and relief. Your final chase? an immensely popular comic book signature? is cleverly arranged and quickly improvised, especially his literal dogfight with the equally silent bulldog with tenacity, insight, and a Chuck Jones-driven intelligence that would have Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger green with envy. <br /> Wallace and Gromit combine with the best of Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello and any other classic comedy team that comes to mind; I hope your longevity will remain on the screen for as long as its predecessors. The wait is more anxious.
