Okay, the first time I saw "Talk Radio" was in a video store for only $ 2.00 on VHS, believe it or not, and I looked at it and thought it might be about Howard Stern because I looked at it for about thirty seconds, so I just did not see it again. So I went to another store about a month later and found "Talk Radio" on DVD for only $ 5.00. So I see it was directed by Oliver Stone, and I got it. So, after the movie was over, I was speechless. I've never seen such a movie. Here's the main plot, so I'll tell you what I thought about it. <br /> <br /> It is about a Dallas radio presenter Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio presenter who talks about what other people bring and he interupts, and is taking everything seriously. Now, a network wants to put their show live everywhere in the United States. Barry's show gets many interesting interlocutors such as Chet (a neo-natzi), Kent (a drugged boy and rock), John (rapist) and others. . Now some of the callers look the same actor / actress. But still I think it fits well. <br /> <br /> Now what I love so much in this movie are the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. The dark music in the background also fits very well. There is a flashback scene in the movie and also how it started with the radio, which I think they did well. <br /> <br /> But the great thing about the movie is ending. I was surprised by this, and it kind of makes you feel a little paranoid about the phone calls from the outside and everything about it is wonderful. It also tells you how to say the right things to people in a big city like Dallas. One of Oliver Stone's underrated / weaker films mentioned, but I think it's the best of it in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But definitely get this movie if you like paranoid movies - feel like movies with a somber atmosphere with sinister music in the background. I still watch this movie many times now when I'm bored, as a fact I watched tonight. Yes, if you really want to feel the sinister movie, watch the lights go out at night. I may sound crazy but this makes the movie better! <br /> <br /> Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason I did not think the film went so well was perhaps from my point of view because of the title. 'Talk Radio' Does not sound too complicated or anything, it's kind of simple. A better title like the book "Talked To Death" or perhaps "The Abusive Radio Host" or something captivating and not simple "Talk Radio". Or maybe because of Universal Pictures? Oliver Stone generally did not do Universal, I do not think so. Paramount could have been a good company. I do not know, something about this movie did not go so well, but I love it. <br /> <br /> "Sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can cause permanent damage."
