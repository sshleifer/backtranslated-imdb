This review was written by someone who has read it (several times) and knows what they are talking about! At first I read other comments and noticed that some of the objections were really stupid. People who have read the book and other Jane Austens, or any other good book, will know that joining the book is vital that you should trust an author with what he does. If the viewer does not like it because it attaches to the book well, it shows that they do not understand Jane Austen and obviously are not a true fan. <br /> <br /> First, if the viewer really loved the book or Jane Austen in Overall, watching it for four hours should not be difficult. Second, their society cared a lot about the looks and hair styles so big and extravagant they showed how rich you were, which in your day was a key factor in getting on well in "good" society. I have to confess that the women's outfits were not brilliant but there were only a few bad guys and the males made up for it, also this prejudice for naval men not in their uniform is in pretty words too silly!, Today people do not go in their uniform away from school or work because they have casual clothes and it was the same thing in the 19th century. Also as it goes the acting is very good, it's subtle because that's how Jayne Austen writes! and the scene at the end is beautiful. You can not compare the footage to the 1995 version, since technology has improved so much since then, that it's ridiculous to compare it to that. The actress who plays Ann is very old but the way she acts and how she does it makes up for it. <br /> <br /> People seem to prefer the 1995 version for some reason that I can not understand!. He does not cling to the book at all and so it's flat, the ending is sentimental, they change main scenes, the only good actors are the leads and they give you a good job for what they've been given. Obviously, the people who really like them are (sorry) stupid because they do not understand the persuasion and need to be exaggerated. The 1971 version is beautiful, romantic, written by an excellent screenwriter (the same as did the Inspector Morse), had very good actors and really is a movie that you can watch many times and during each of them you can delight in that.
