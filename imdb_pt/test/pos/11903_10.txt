Finally, a gangster movie that is worth watching! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily should be nominated for her role as femme hard killer fatal! <br /> <br /> This movie flies like a bird, just a quick non stop Gangster Mayhem! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily is so beautiful and so bad in this movie. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to discover that Faye Dunaway is still alive! The cast of this film is so well suited to their roles. <br /> <br /> A very cool soundtrack accompanies the Spanish soul of this film. <br /> <br /> The story is original, deep and poetic. <br /> <br /> This Flick has a lot of Substance and never rests. <br /> <br /> The Spanish fire gang has just set fire to everything on the screen. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa is a joy to watch and a movie Star. <br /> <br /> Sit down and enjoy the ride.
