The 2002 film by Nuri Bilge Ceylan Distant (Uzak) - his third feature film (his first in black and white, The Small Town- Kasaba), is a significant step in his good but imperfect movie May Clouds (Mayis Sikintisi) . The previous film had potential, but it smelled of a small budget and improvised the quality of the worst forms - tracing holes and acting amateur wood. That Clouds Of May succeeded at any level was a testament to Ceylan's talent as a beginning filmmaker. However, Distant is the arrival of Ceylan on the international scene as a great artist who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman (although his script is not as heavy as the dialogue, it is as bleak as it lacks Bergman predilection for close-ups - his shots are usually long planes for exteriors and medium planes for interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose penetrating scenes of contemplation Ceylan reconfigures). Most of the film takes place in the winter snow of Istanbul (the fact that it snows in Turkey will probably surprise some), which gives the film a definite Bergman feel, as well as remembering one of Krzysztof Kieslowski's snowy and gloomy urban images. The Decalogue Natural images invoke the best of Werner Herzog - as they tend to give one or two more beats than the standard theory of cinema would dictate - which is what makes them all the more memorable, while urban landscapes range from quasi-precisionist compositions scored by Michelangelo Antonioni. Woody Allen's cultural hagiography - a shot from a bench overlooking the water is a direct quote (read steal) from Manhattan, except for the lack of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene, Ceylan similarly quotes a famous picture of a ship at the port of Ozu's Tokyo Story. However, like all great artists, Ceylan makes his appropriations his own art, altering them slightly and keeping them on the subject of his own film needs. Distant is a film whose title fills the characterization of the film and the feeling that some viewers will have towards them but does not describe the film itself as the scenes remain long after the film ends. Perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when Mahmut pursues his ex-wife at the Istanbul airport and watches her with her new husband as they embark on the plane that will take her out of her life forever. As he watches her, from afar, we see her catching only a glimpse of him staring at her. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this movie. He retreats behind a column, and Nazan simply turns his head to her future. Mahmut is her past, and she knows how best to move on, just keep walking. Mahmut will never get it. More rarely, these moments of introspection in themselves of life. That some viewers will receive the film, and that Ceylan gets his own creative powers, shows that ignorance can teach, as long as it moves on. Distant does, though at the right length.
