On the surface, TMHS seems to be more of a generic high school drama; but surprisingly hidden beneath, there are immense amounts of depth, originality and eccentricities that not only make it unforgettable for the viewer, but also makes it arguably one of the best animes the medium has produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> We see the world through the eyes of Kyon, who on his first day in high school meets Haruhi Suzumiya, a girl who boldly tells the rest of the class that she has no interest in 'normal humans' and on top of it off casually invites any strangers, time travelers, sliders or espers to meet up with her. Kyon looks incredulous, wondering if she's joking or if she has a few loose bolts. However, defying his instincts, he begins to talk to her. In doing so, it soon becomes apparent that she is not a normal student. Not long after, she creates her own school club called 'SOS Brigade', and drags Kyon among other highly unfortunate people to attend. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this anime is according to the usual standard conventions, Kyon o The protagonist is an overly cynical pessimist and contributes with a witty narration for the show. Far from the usual 2D male characters who tend to populate the environment. The episodes themselves are not chronological and compels the viewer to think about the events unfolding and how they relate to previous instances. This is a stroke of genius; the effect is like a jigsaw puzzle, while a new piece is placed, we have another notion of the larger picture. Previous scenes now receive new meanings, and the fulfillment of them is deeply satisfying. This means, however, that you feel disjointed (it's anything but), a very cleverly written script circumvented this problem and ensured that it flow smoothly from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The story itself is surprisingly original. , but I will not go deeper than the simple plot line I just gave, since it will undoubtedly ruin everything for you. However, what I will mention is that the plot incorporates a wide range of genres, ranging from comedy to science fiction. How they managed to do this in the space of fourteen episodes is beyond me, and undoubtedly a great achievement in itself. <br /> <br /> TMHS is a true gem that has so much diversity and depth that it will appeal to just about anyone interested in anime. Watching him, in an unusual way, is something that lives up to the enormous enthusiasm he received - and even exceeds.
