I absolutely love this movie and have seen it many times. I recorded it in 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four, but my tape is severely worn out now and I would love a new copy of it. I emailed Film Four to ask them to show it again, since it was never available. and as far as I know, it has not been repeated since the 1980s. I have had no response and it has not been repeated yet. The performances are excellent. The movie has it all. It's funny, sad, disturbing, exciting and totally takes you back to school days. It is extremely well paced and grabs you from beginning to end. The scene in the bathroom is particularly horrible. I also can not hear the song Badge by Cream and do not even think about this movie. This movie deserves to be seen by a much larger audience as it is excellent. Channel four please show again or release on video or DVD.
