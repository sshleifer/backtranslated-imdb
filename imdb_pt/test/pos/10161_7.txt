"The Man Who Knew Too Much" fits into that Hitchcock tale that characterized many of his films during the 1950s: it's not a masterpiece of suspense, but it's a lot of fun. <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day play a holiday couple who gets caught up in a heavy plot in foreign intrigues. The famous climatic scene occurs in a concert of classical music, in which someone will be assassinated during a confrontation of particular plates in the score. Damn Hitchcock, of course, lets us know what that point is, so the race to stop the killer becomes a race against him. Much of that movie reminded me of the 1978 Chevy Chase. / Goldie Hawn comedy "Foul Play" I have to believe that the movie was inspired by it. No movie is important, but both are easy to appreciate. <br /> <br /> Note: B +
