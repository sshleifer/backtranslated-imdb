I was a bit surprised to see all the hate comments here. Of course it's not the best kid show, but people do not stop despising Barney so much after the fifth grade? <br /> <br /> Ok, everyone hates Barney. Okay, I think his voice and the songs are annoying. Okay, it's kind of creepy and weird. I'm fourteen, so I know well enough. But here's the thing. Children? They LOVE this show. <br /> <br /> When I was a baby two or three years old, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than anything else. Nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. Face it, that's how kids are. Even the most patient can not sit around long enough to give parents time. There is lots to do and see and explore, lots of difficulty getting in. <br /> <br /> And then came Barney. I do not know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that is so fun for kids, but they certainly love it. I know I did. I was addicted to the show and wanted to watch it several times. Yes, the songs kind of made my parents crazy, but in order to see their kids learning, and to be excited about something that might really catch their attention, it's worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123's, the magic words and brush their teeth. I grew up five or six years, of course, but at that point at least I was a little more patient, and I gave my parents some time. <br /> <br /> My nephews and nieces have gone through everything. the stage of Barney growing, to the delight of his mother. I know what keeps Barney in the air. It amuses. Of course there's Big Bird, Ernie and Oscar, and they're great too. But at the baby stage, it seems like more kids prefer the big dinosaur singer. And that's enough for me.
