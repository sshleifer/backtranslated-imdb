The Twins Effect This action-comedy vampire is one of my favorites because I was completely entertained throughout the movie. First of all, the characters are memorable, contributing with a multitude of classic scenes. Charlene and Gillian are naturally cute, charismatic and funny. This movie was my first exposure to them, and all I wanted was to reach the screen on my television and give them a BIG HUG. The remaining cast did well in their supporting roles, including Jackie Chan, Karen Mok, "The Duke," Josie Ho, Edison Chen, Anthony Wong and the vampire villains (one of whom seems strangely familiar to Will Ferrell). Even the abominable and horrible Ekin Cheng was good at it. Good characters are important, of course, because they avoid the feeling of annoyance by keeping things interesting between action sequences. <br /> <br /> And speaking in action, this movie has a lot of it. More importantly, there is an emphasis on quality in the fight choreography. One aspect that helped in this sense is the weapon of prominence of the protagonists? a sword with a retractable rope with a spearhead. This weapon, by itself, opened a variety of moves that would have been impossible. Josie Ho and Gillian Chung, in particular, perform some perverse aerial maneuvers using these devices. <br /> <br /> In addition, the fencing is superb, and is highlighted by two great sword fights ?? one occurring during the sequence of the opening train station and the other occurring at the end of the church. In fact, the maneuvers of wielding the blades shown in this movie put some other favorites highly valued by the fans, and I'm really sorry for those who would cite the horribly choreographed garbage seen in Ashes of Time, Storm Riders or A Man Called. Hero with well-planned and accurately executed sequences seen in The Twins Effect. It's not even close to that. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why this movie receives so much criticism. I am sure that proponents of the "Golden Age" of Hong Kong will hate this because it does not fit their limited vision of what Hong Kong's action should be. We must learn from the fall of John Woo - a pony of a trick that never learned to reinvent itself. We do not need another clone. We need something different. The Gemini Effect is a good example. <br /> <br /> This movie was so good that it really left me disappointed in other Chinese movies with the same actors and actresses. Does this apply especially to Ekin Cheng, whose other movies almost always suck ?? and yes, that includes the obscurely overestimated and exploitative wuxia mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even The Twins were never able to match the value of this movie when they were both leading actresses in a movie, despite having achieved some good films when one or the other takes on the lead role (eg Beyond Our Ken, Good Times Bed Times, House of Fury) or when one or both are in supporting roles (eg, Color of Truth, New History of the Police, Just a Look). The Twins Effect 2 should have been a straightforward sequence, rather than a familiar fantasy. I'm still looking forward to seeing Charlene and Gillian team up and kick ass in another movie, but the fact is that The Twins Effect hits all cylinders, optimizing their charisma while avoiding a hint of hatred (like the Protégé de la Rose Noire) <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie has everything you need to have fun. And can I remind the reader that it is precisely that? ENTERTAINMENT ?? who judges the greatness of a film, rather than dramatic artistic elements or meaningless awards from established academies of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> In the end, the Gemini Effect is a CLASSIC not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Rating = 5/5 stars <br /> <br /> ?? Hollywood executives decided to shoot down this film when it was released in the US, renaming it as The Vampire Effect and cutting 20 minutes of footage, which includes parts of the action scenes. However, the final fight of the US version has a better soundtrack than the original version. So I bought the two versions, which allows me to first watch the original until the 1:20 mark and then swap the disks to watch the final fight in the US version.
