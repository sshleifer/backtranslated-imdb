For the main criticisms of the film ... The love story: this was not a love story. These were two disturbed people coming together trying to find humanity in anyone. The same thing happened to the soldiers and the Russian boy. It added a feminine touch, but let's see American movies ... not near the love story. There was no plot: does war have a plot? I think it's a silly review. The plot is this. They start with 400 men and the film was reduced to show the lives of about 10 men and how each did his part and died. Death is the ultimate end of any story. Just because there was no happy ending does not mean that it does not have a plot. <br /> <br /> There was a horrible truth in this movie. I would not necessarily call it "anti-war." It had a political statement, of course, but the film was not about politics. In fact, except for a few instances when the captain? appeared, there was never a stifling air of Nazi Germany. They were far enough out of reach of the main Nazi party. Fat cats would not go to Russia! <br /> <br /> It may not be completely accurate and not a Hollywood hit, but it shows a good grasp of the ordinary soldier (I would say exactly of almost any nationality and war) and what they should pass on. It was a losing battle, of course the movie is going to be depressing. And for the person who said it was brave (and silly) to even portray the Germans as victims: there are victims on all sides in all wars (any real soldier will tell you this). <br /> <br /> This film is a good balance between film and documentary. Some problems with it when it is discussed by only one, but incute the best of both worlds. Watch as such. Beware, though, because it's a difficult movie to watch, if not graphically, emotionally. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting until they make a movie about Iraq. It will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial, I want to see who has the courage to do this first. (Jarhead does not count)
