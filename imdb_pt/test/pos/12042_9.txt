Darr is a brilliant film .. It's one of my favorite movies..RK did a mind blow job in the movie .... <br /> <br /> this role could not have been played by anyone else because that type of paper only matches the SRK ... <br /> <br /> The SRK plays a mental villain in the movie. <br /> <br /> SRK's performance in this film is the best all-time performance in wood. .. <br /> <br /> The SRK deserves a tribute and an encouraging appeal for its fantastic performance ... <br /> <br /> Juhi also offers excellent performance .. <br /> < > Sunny Deol looked strong and physically fit in the movie ..
