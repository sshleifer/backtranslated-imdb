This is a 100% improvement over the scum of a third movie and it's a hell of a long time. This is a John Hughes movie meets Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany very well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. In fact, they are the only good parts of the movie. I was bored with the scenes of Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable. It is as if they were thrown there as a diversion and someone to save the day. But Chucky and Tiffany were great to watch and I really enjoyed the dark humor for that. I thought this made the movie stand out more. If you want a good time, be sure to check it out. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
