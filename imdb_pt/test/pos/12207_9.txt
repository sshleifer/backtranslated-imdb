Surface, the day his teaser first appeared in the summer of 2005, was a tossup. On the one hand, it seemed so high concept and story driven that, for the passerby, it seemed that it would work better as a movie (or several). Also, it looked like it was NBC's attempt at a "killer of the lost". On the other hand, it may have been realized that the story was too expansive to be told in a movie or two, and the fans of Lost seemed intrigued. So after a (and possibly only) season on NBC, the show is on an indefinite hiatus that could put it in the safe, on Sci-fi, or fill a gap in NBC programming in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond. His rankings were some of the best on the net (which is not saying much), but the show was taken off the air with no real official announcement of its future. <br /> <br /> So, is it worth it? Yes. <br /> <br /> Surface follows a continuous format of story driven by a plot with almost no fill-in. Almost everything that happens in the program is important to the plot, much like a movie. There are no episodes of filling, which puts a pain on your side when you missed an episode. However, the advantage of the program helped offset this; Big things seem to happen every episode, but since it looks like a movie, you end each episode feeling that little happened and you're wanting more! This trait of the show, however, shows how good it is. The cast is solid; The three main tracks, including the beautiful Lake Bell as Laura Daughtery, presented a solid performance each episode, each driven by their own reasons to find / study the creatures. The supporting cast, including Ian Anthony Dale and Rade Serbedzija's brief performance, complete the cast. The story is slow to start (my only regret, it does not get up to 3-4 episodes in the short season of 15 episodes), but the second half of the season offsets that. The visual effects are impressive (the jaw drops when you see an aerial view of one of the creatures "attacking" a ship). <br /> <br /> Many of the problems in the series can be solved with the purchase of completing the first season and not having to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode. <br /> <br /> In short, if you missed the first season and are curious, come back and watch. It's not a Twin Peaks in terms of strangeness, but its highly regarded nature connects to it, Lost and other similar shows with a touch of action and adventure. Enjoy.
