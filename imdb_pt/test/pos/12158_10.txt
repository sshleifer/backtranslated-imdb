Has there ever been an Angel of Death like MIMSY FARMER in Barbet Schroeder's heroine in the 1960s? A kind of Jean Seberg with a hypodermic. Pink Floyd score. Despite some insignificant weaknesses, a classic, brazenly erased by Erich Segal / Noel Black for his inept JENNIFER ON MY MIND (1971), though Tippy Walker, playing a similar character, is herself very addicted to junkies in the last mess. BUT, it's fantastic, a great 60s drug film and simply an important document of its time. Much more a cult film, so join the cult. <br /> <br /> No American film then, as far as I remember, traces the same territory. MIMSY is an amazing archetype, elevating it to mythical realms. It is not for the weak. Great sex scenes too.
