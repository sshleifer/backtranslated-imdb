Victor Sjostrom's silent masterpiece, The Phantom Carriage, was recently released on DVD with a new soundtrack recorded by KTL. The duo, composed by American guitarist Stephen O'Malley and the Austrian Peter Rehberg, created an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and accentuate the original 1921 film. A stirring sound introduces each act and a mix of drones and guitar chords. and feedback flows back and forth as the gloomy drama unfolds. As impressive as the new soundtrack, the film remains the true star with its timeless interpretation of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. According to this tale, the last person to die before the midnight stroke on New Year's Eve is doomed to spend a year behind the reins of the eponymous ghost carriage, collecting the souls of the dead. This is the fate of the movie's anti-hero, David Holm, who is moved to painful scrutiny of his life after his premature death and subsequent encounter with the chauffeur of the carriage. <br /> <br /> This movie is often referred to as a horror movie and although this is an appropriate label, the true horror here lies not in the supernatural elements but in the depiction of human suffering in the hands of others. Sjostrom performs remarkably like the drunken drunken, spiteful and threatening life, and the miserable and scared Holm looking back from the land of the dead and shrinking from his past deeds. <br /> <br /> Impressive images abound everywhere. Phantom Carriage and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue. The malicious beginning of midnight is mightily illustrated by the image of a clock face hovering alone in the dark night sky like a second moon. Equally impressive, the dead are portrayed through pioneering semitransparent images and scenes of the ghost carriage riding by land and sea remain icy to watch. <br /> <br /> Sjostrom's film deserves its place as one of the most esteemed silent films. films of all time and the new soundtrack of KTL is an excellent accentuation of their themes. This is a must-see.
