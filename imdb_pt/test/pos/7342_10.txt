Whatever you do, do not stop watching when you think the movie is over! Wait for the first batch of credits or you will actually lose something! We saw this movie at the Savanaah film festival and thought it was the best of the group. Dreya Weber is truly a marvel not only because of her performance but because she manages to reach it far above the ground. In the question and answer session, she said there were no strings or effects, so all you see is really what she's doing. Addie could not go to the festival because she was dancing with Madonna. She was excellent and, my kindness, so beautiful. I was amazed that the film was so good with the multitude of blue hairs, but there it is, Savannnah is not a backwater.
