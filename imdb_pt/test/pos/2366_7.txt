This movie is great! Being a fan of "The Comic Strip Presents ..." I just knew that I would love this movie. And I love this I do. I finally got to buy a copy of this movie earlier this year. But I was annoyed to think it had been cut! So, I will continue to see car sales for the original version. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson), who tries to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French) claiming to be a drug dealer. However, Dennis is heard bragging one night at the pub and stole it! So Dennis turns into supergrass, but the problem is he does not know anything and starts to invent lies and dig himself into an even deeper hole! The irony of all this is that there are drug smuggling going on in Devon. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as funny as I expected, but it's still a really good movie with good laughs and a great soundtrack. . He also has the best all-time scene in a British movie (Robbie Coltrane's walk down the pier was marked for "Two Tribes" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood.) If you are a fan of "The Comic Strip Presents "..." from any of the cast members, or a British comedy fan see it as fast as possible !!!
