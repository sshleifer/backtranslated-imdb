Watching this movie, I can not help but compare it to Wild Reeds, another thoughtful movie about teens who are maturing. <br /> <br /> Like Wild Reeds, this movie is slow and the director would not be rushed. . So, if you want a quick fix to things, do not watch. This movie is like a slice of life, starting imperfectly and ending imperfectly. There is no resolution for anything, neither happy for anyone, as in real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is as real as it seems. The acting is surprisingly good. The director likes long, very long shots, and the actors and actresses stand out in showing subtlety and intimate thoughts. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I almost did not watch, but now I'm very happy to have watched. It's not a movie at all, but if you're willing to let it grow in you, you'll be rewarded. <br /> <br /> 10/10
