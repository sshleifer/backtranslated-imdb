He came before "the ten commandments" "land of the pharaohs" "Ben Hur" and is neglected today.What is unfair! Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel, do not be discouraged! Waltari's novel was so great that only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it's done someday). Waltari, whose message is essentially Christian remains intact (another of his books "The Secret of the Kingdom" (Part One) occurs after Christ's death in the Holy Land). "The Egyptian" is the birth of a monotheism close to Christianity long before Christ: the Pharaoh (Wilding) is some kind of Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the true kingdom is not in the material world: he asks to return good for evil! And he has disciples who will eventually become martyrs (the scene in which Simmons and the other Sun God worshipers are killed is visually striking, looking like a pagan ballet). priests, on the other hand, this new religion would mean the end of their influence over the population, and that is why they seek a strong (mature) man who can lead the army against the Hittites as well as against their dangerous compatriots. Another religion, or religion, we should say is that of Sinouh√© (Purdom) who for two hours believes in nothing (the sequence of the grain of sand is absolutely sensational and climbs the whole film well above the average peplum !!) <br /> <br /> There is another fascinating side: the film looks like an extravagant melodrama. (notably the final revelation of Pharaoh's sister (Tierney) preceding the "Ten Commandments" for two years), but also the splendor of cinematography: Viviani, in her book on Curtiz, talks about a Baudelairean, blue atmosphere and gilded, notably in scenes involving the prostitute (Darvi) who contemplates her reflection in the water of her bath, supreme narcissism. Around the hero, all characters appear, disappear, appear again, but when they reappear, they go their way and all subplots come together with consummate skill. In addition, as is often the case in "modern" melodramas, the story is a long flashback, framed by two short sequences showing Sinouhe an old man who is remembering. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful sword and sandals, which had a strong influence, not only in America, but also in Europe, notably in Poland, where Jerzy Kawalerowicz directed a fascinating "Pharaoh" (1966), which she owed a lot to Curtiz.
