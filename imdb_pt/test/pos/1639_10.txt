Okay, that was just brilliant. I wish the rest of the first season had been so strong. It really needed more episodes like this. <br /> <br /> The cast worked perfectly, though they were nobody in the past. Writing was fantastic and editing as well. Great work on all accounts. <br /> <br /> The episode was thrilling, full of suspense and just kept you guessing until the end. Which is what most of the MOTW episodes tried, but failed so far. <br /> <br /> The first five-star episode for me. Very good, almost like a movie. I did not even remember being that good. I think it's even better than the great horror movie called 'The Thing'.
