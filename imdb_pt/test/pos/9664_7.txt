it's not a bad movie, but the acting and script can be better. I like this movie because I have a life that is largely like that of the movie. It's hard for a lost generation to have a life in Romania, and 90% of us choose something else, and that other thing includes dealing with people with "bad habits" if you understand me, but that comes with territory. This movie represents me and I like it. I have a rage at me that I barley talk to people, I live in a messy society and I can not fit and I do not want to, and that's the story of the movie too, if you r like me, you can understand the true movie, otherwise you will find it easier and cheaper.
