I thought this movie was really amazing! One of Drew's best. I'm also a fan of Michael Vartan, so I thought he was really hot in this movie. Why all the bad reviews. I'd like to watch this movie again and again if I could. I also loved the ending. This movie clearly showed a smile on my face! I was also surprised that James Franco and Jessica Alba were in it. I love both, so I also highlighted this movie. In the end, when Drew is making the big comment about the truth, it really tells the truth of what sometimes happens in high school. Once again, the movie was amazing. Challenging a 10/10. I hope this review has been very useful to any IMDb reader.
