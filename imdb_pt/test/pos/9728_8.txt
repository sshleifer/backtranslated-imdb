Robert Cummings, Laraine Day and Jean Muir star in "And One Was Beautiful," a 1940 film also starring Billie Burke. In an hour and 15 minutes, this seems to have been a movie B. Cummings is a playboy, Ridley Crane, whom many women desire, including two sisters, Katherine and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir). Katherine is the earthiest of the two who likes to fix cars, and Helen is the blonde social butterfly with the beautiful dresses. Ridley arrives back in town and, believing he will not be at a party, Helen decides not to attend. Since the party is given by a family friend, her mother (Burke) sends Katherine in a trapped dress. Ridley is there and the two are connected. But Ridley has more superficiality, and when he sees Helen at dinner, the two pick up where they left off and go to a club. He gets terribly drunk, and Helen at first refuses to ride in his car because he will not let her drive. After walking a little and breaking the heel of her shoe, she gets into Ridley's car as he passes by. He faints, and she takes the wheel, accidentally hitting and killing a cyclist. <br /> <br /> Ridley can not remember anything, so Helen lets him take the blame for the death. The heel of a woman's shoe is found in the car, and Katherine sees her sister bury her shoes - plus, something in Helen's ways makes her realize that Helen is not telling the truth. Ridley is convicted and goes to jail, and Helen marries a man she does not love and leaves for South America. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, although at the time, it was not a A Cast List. Cummings is playing a role that Robert Taylor would have played (it's an MGM movie) - he's handsome and very lovable even though he does not have the dazzling looks of someone like Taylor. Laraine Day is one of my favorite actresses, someone who MGM lent constantly because they did not know what to do with her. Why, I wonder - a wonderful actress with a great face and voice, she has animated many films. This is no different. Her Katherine is determined, friendly and totally adorable. Jean Muir is a terrible actress. <br /> <br /> So who was the most beautiful? We all know MGM did not. <br /> <br /> I recommend a little gem.
