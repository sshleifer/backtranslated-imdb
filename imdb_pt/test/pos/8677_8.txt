Imagine a world where everyone treats someone to perfection, no rude word is ever uttered, office fights are nonexistent and your boss invites office staff regularly to home-made dinners where you can chat about the latest interior design styles. Everything is clean, pleasant - well, just good. In other words, you are in hell. After being left in the middle of nowhere in the mid-thirties, Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) begins a new job as a bookkeeper in a small, clean town. From the outset he feels strange in this own impersonal world of superficial goodness, surrounded by a pleasant but lifeless interior architecture, and also by colleagues. The food does not know anything, the drinks do not make you drunk, you have no children anywhere; After the initial stages of adaptation, Andreas looks for ways to escape the insipid world. He no longer knows where he came from but still remembers rich tastes, true feelings - anything beyond the uncompromising life he is taking now. The BOTHERSOME MAN echoes ideas of Huxley and Kafka, but here cruelty is the omnipresence of omnipresent cleansing. Unlike PLEASANTVILLE, it is not a narrow-minded fanaticism, but a fable of our urban civilization to fit in. This is reminiscent of FIGHT CLUB's ingenious scene, in which Edward Norton goes through a simulated IKEA catalog. Tempered with macabre humor, this terse Scandinavian tale convinces at all levels: story, characters and relevance. A real gem of a canvas. 8/10
