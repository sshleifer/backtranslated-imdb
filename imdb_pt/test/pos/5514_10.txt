Strangeland seems to have a love / hate relationship with many of his viewers. I personally loved the movie, and everything about it. <br /> <br /> The performance in some places could be improved, but the filming increases the atmosphere where the acting can not. In some areas, the dialogue is a bit extravagant and dramatic, but in fact, what do you expect from the late 90s? Most of all, Dee did an incredible job writing what I believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers I've ever seen. He plays with the fears of many age groups - adults, parents and children. All parents fear that their kids get too involved with chat rooms and find strangers on the Internet. And it happens in the real world. And every child and adult fear to be abducted and tortured against their will; this is also true in the real world. This is what makes this film so sensitive to many. <br /> <br /> My only warning is that if you * know * that you are sensitive to things like violence, visible torture and violence, then you * do * not want to see this movie. If you're not sure if this movie will entertain you, read as many comments as you can, ask people you know who watched this movie, and be prepared to turn off the movie at any time should you become annoyed.
