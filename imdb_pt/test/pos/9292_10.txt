That's exactly what Australian television and Australian politics need, people with a sense of humor !!! Good on ABC for supporting these guys. The show is based on a couple of Australian guys who know how to get the mickey from politicians or other people in the limelight. The boys use Sydney as their primary base to make a splash in the public. Keep an eye on Crazy Wharehouse Guy or Mr Ten Questions. The guys who perform these acts are the same guys who presented CNNN. If you liked CNNNN and Glasshouse then you will love this show. I'm still interested in what feats are real and which are purely acting because there are some questionable actions by the guys ...
