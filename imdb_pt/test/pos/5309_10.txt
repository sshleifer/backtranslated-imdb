this is what confuses me about the critics and their opinion. I usually accept, what the critics say about a movie, most of the time before I watch a movie. <br /> <br /> However, I saw this one, without knowing anything about it. mainly because of the cast. kevin spacey and don cheadle are two of the most acclaimed and, in my opinion, the best living actors. and Ryan Gosling is on a quick climbing journey up there as well. His reality and humanity that emanates from most of his portraits, makes the audience really believe in the character and what is happening to him. He's really my favorite actor of my generation. I always find Jena Malone very cute, since Donnie Darko, and if she chooses to continue doing similar roles, then I will not complain. <br /> <br /> Back to my point. this movie really thrilled me. I believed that. the performance was first class. as expected. the film really left the audience with the ultimate goal of a good movie; reflection and weighting that follows after the final roll of the credits. I think I need to watch it again to figure out how this movie was critically attacked. I know your reviews should be taken with a pinch of salt. at least I know now.
