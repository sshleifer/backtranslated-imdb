I felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise in this role that everyone knows about him. So even though I had never heard of this movie before, when it appeared in my cable listings, I immediately switched to that channel. I'm so glad I did! <br /> <br /> I've read from other reviewers that they generally do not like stories about ripening; I, on the other hand, yes. I am one of those who is always maturing; I've been since I was 12, I'm 52 now, and I'll probably continue to be 92. Old age is nothing more than suddenly realizing the possibilities that the other day brings. The speed of realization, the magnitude of it, sometimes puts us in disorder. If we try to protect our delicate self from it, then yes, I can see how the end of age can end. But if we just take the dust out and settle in the new direction we find, then suddenly we're on a new path, and we're as alive as we were yesterday, just stronger, brighter, and I'd say, more interesting. <br /> <br /> So that's what this movie was about. This was a ripening story all around; Young Ben, his father, Father Robert, and certainly Lady Evie ... all underwent a wonderful transformation. In fact, the same thing happened to Mr. Fincham, did not he ?! Everyone suspected, except for the mother, despite her enormous opportunity to do so, provided by the end-of-movie events. You get the feeling that she's going to stay exactly the same way she's been, with only a different supporting cast. <br /> <br /> So, a great movie that could not have been made in America, which is absolutely depressing to think about, but thank God we have a steady supply of movies made elsewhere that we occasionally get to see. I really highly recommend this movie, as long as you do not mind shrinking through those parts that are very familiar to all of us, and smiling through everything else.
