This is one of those movies that has everything in it. I do not think I would tire of seeing this. I hope more movies like this are made in the future. The cast was perfect in every way. In a way, the song sung by Engelbert Humperdink "I never got to say goodbye" is the song that comes to life. You will definitely laugh and cry over the whole scenario for sure. I'm surprised I never saw it before last weekend. I think it's worth seeing, and your heart will be shining. It would be good to curl up with your "honey"; Drink a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy being in each other's presence. There is so much heart and emotion that sometimes you honestly do not know where to turn. You will know exactly how the character feels. True family expression is available all the time. In fact, sometimes you even think that you are part of this family or part of it. Look!
