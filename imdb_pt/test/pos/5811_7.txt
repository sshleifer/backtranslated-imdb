As a big fan of the Hammer Studios and enthusiast of the Gothic Horror movies, I wonder why it took me so long to start watching the TV series "Hammer House of Horror," which only lasted a season in 1980. Now that I've seen the first four episodes of the show, I can say that it easily meets my expectations so far. While this first "Witching Time" episode may not be the most imaginative Horror story ever told, and fails to deliver the wonderful gothic atmosphere that I love the Hammer movies from the 50s to the 70s, she undoubtedly can say surprisingly scary tale and create some genuine shiver within fifty minutes. Tracks composer David Winter (Jon Finch) is plagued by seventeenth-century witch Lucinda (Patricia Quinn) ... Although the story may be simple but for a run time of less than an hour, it is effective and provides many moments scary . The Irish actress Patricia Quinn, who is probably best known for her role in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), as well as the fantastic comedy Monty Python (1983), is wonderfully malicious in her role. which fits like a glove. Jon Finch is also very good as David, and while Prunella Gee, who plays his wife adulterous actress, may not be the best actress of all time, she is definitely cool to see. The episode is accompanied by a good score that goes well with the atmosphere. Overall, "Witching Time" is a very entertaining episode with several truly scary moments and decent opener of the series.
