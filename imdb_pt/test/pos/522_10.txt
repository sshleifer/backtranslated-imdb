I like watching Linda Blair playing a "horror" movie again. I had been disappointed with her in almost everything from the films "Exorcist" (which I loved). What was going on with all those nasty "B-movies" she did? <br /> <br /> David Hassellhoff, on the other hand, all I could do is laugh. He is not cut out to be a horror movie actor. David needs to stay with "Knight Rider" or "Baywatch". <br /> <br /> All around, this is a great movie. Even for the eighties, this was an incredible movie. It has horror, action and drama. It's a suspense, and I loved the way Linda Blair showed up.
