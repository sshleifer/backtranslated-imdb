Margaret Colin stars as the main figure in this story; while watching, I remembered his part in "non-religious" of Adrian Lynes like neighbor of Diane Lane in an elegant district of New York. <br /> <br /> This movie was surprisingly good, and Diane Stillman deserves credit for an accurate portrayal of class, crime, and misdemeanors that really occur in upscale neighborhoods (thought perish !!!) It's real, but it's not. super dramatized; the audience lives their accident, the pain it caused, denial; and the final resolution. <br /> <br /> It is more than just a matter of "what a good person", as Colin talks to her husband ... it is the character of a person defined by a single act; and should they be condemned forever because of their deed? The questions are pertinent; It's also fun to see several film references to Martha Stewart (ie the restless and boring mother), Colin is reputed by his friends at some point to be a "perfect hostess, with perfect genes" .... (gag); and a scene in which Colin is confronted by the police ("friends" also betray her later). <br /> <br /> The denial and facades of American society are addressed; (Oh, murder does not occur here, similar to the subject in Dominick Dunne's Ã„tru in Purgatory, about the true murder of Martha Moxley, in Greenwich, Connecticut); Colin is aware of his crime; but consciously sees herself perpetuating the facade, until she finally breaks, rents or buys this film; she is an underrated actress who does well in these roles.
