When the dirty dance was on TV in the middle of last year I was out so I could not see, my mother swore I had seen her and that she had on tape somewhere. Anyway, getting to the point, she could not find her video, so at Christmas I bought the DVD for her, well, she did not take a look. He sat for a while, so one night I decided to take him to watch and I fell in love with it. This is a great movie with so many lovely scenes! I love the plot and enjoyed every moment! It's definitely not for everyone, but if you love a love story then you will want to watch Dirty Dancing again! Dirty Dancing - The way love is meant to be!
