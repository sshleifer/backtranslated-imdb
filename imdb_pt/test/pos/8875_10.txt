This movie is extremely funny - Mom's character makes me come back to the movie over and over again! I can not get enough of her dry lines ... like when she tells her son Owen to bury his friend in the yard before he sniffs the place ... and his suspicion that Owen is trying to kill her, Give him walnuts without salt! It's hilarious! <br /> <br /> If you like movies like National Lampoon's Vacation, Uncle Buck or Plans, Trains & Automobiles, this has a similar mood. It's a great, healthy laugh ... a must see!
