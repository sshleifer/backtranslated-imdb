I was in my early twenties, just graduating from college when this movie appeared. Seeing it was a major event not only because of the high quality of the film (as evidenced by its many awards), but because of its place in the historical context of 1959. Because of social progress since then, it is almost impossible. to understand that my college had only begun to admit (carefully selected) black students in 1953. A high-budget show with an almost entirely black cast was a distinct novelty in 1959. The film was given a Luxury roadshow presentation (seat reserved) only in the best theaters, complete with a souvenir program detailing the luxurious care that has been taken with lighting and color, stereo sound of various banners, etc. Almost all the black artists we whites knew we were in the movie. Gershwin's music, superbly executed, and the sheer universal humanity of history were tremendously in motion. <br /> <br /> I recently got a faded copy of a two-hour cut from the movie, and repeated views confirmed my opinion. Time did what appeared to be sex scenes in 1959, but the musical quality did not diminish. Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their portraits. What a crime the young black artists of today can not see these artists at the height of their careers!
