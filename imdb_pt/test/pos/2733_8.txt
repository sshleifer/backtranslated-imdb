I was watching this movie with my family who was expecting a neatly conclusive story like "Mr. & Mrs. Yer" and they came back completely disappointed back home. So this is a warning to all "conclusive lovers of history." Park Avenue does not seek to answer questions or provide moral solutions on how to treat the mentally challenged. Instead, your intent is high and clear. This questions the sense of reality of every human being, are or are not. I even raise doubts about my sense of sanity guaranteed. The security, the bondage, the satisfaction I encounter in my present, is really who I am or really creates an illusion that we all desperately and sometimes ignorantly Cling only to falsely console the neglected 'meethi' that exists in all us in some way or another? So why does Anjali do it maniacally to show her strength of spirit when she is really distressed by the realization that she is becoming a monster? Are not we all who think we are "normal", really monstrous? and helpless vulnerable about it down there? Is not it better to be happy even foolishly than to create the impression of "normality" while suppressing someone's fragility? The meethi bravely, madly, sincerely does so. And society labels it as "schizophrenic." The ending confused me at first, but then you realize that the bravery of the meethi and the sincere belief took her where she wanted to go. She discovered what she was looking for, not caring what society had to comment on her quest. and it is the seemingly "real" people - Anjali, the psychiatrist and jojo - who never get anywhere. My family thinks I am also schizophrenic in trying to understand a movie that is largely "insane" to the rest of the world. world. someone more willing to believe in my sense of reality ...........?
