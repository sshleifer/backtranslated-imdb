I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. I already knew it would be a funny movie, but it was funnier than I expected. Of course there were some stupid jokes, but they made a fool of me. I thought the actors would turn out to be really bad, but the actors were good at playing this comedy. I have to congratulate Amanda Bynes, she looked amazing with her brother and had a great performance as a boy. As for the other actors, they were funny too. Of course there have been times when you scream on the screen "how can you not tell?", But that's all part of the fun. In the end, the plot went very well. There is a happy ending, but what did you expect? <br /> <br /> Overall, it's hilarious.
