I really enjoyed this movie, but the feeling that I left the most was the memory of how much I liked the novel. The film features two of the best actresses working today - Jessica Lange, who is great here, and the divine Jennifer Jason Leigh, who does the best she can with her ill-designed character - as well as a surprisingly excellent one. Michelle Pfeiffer and a firm Jason Robards. The adaptation is basically true to the book, at least as faithful as possible in an hour and forty minutes. The film does not really enchant, except for certain scenes between Lange and Pfeiffer, but it does a thoroughly competent job of visualizing this wonderfully tragic story. With regard to the films adapted from the novels, this was definitely among the best. If nothing else, he sent me back to my book shelves to rediscover favorite passages from Jane Smiley's excellent novel, and back to King Lear to review the secondary characters in order to see how deep the parallels happen. It's worth your time as a movie, definitely, and hopefully enough to make you remember that reading literature is a joy too.
