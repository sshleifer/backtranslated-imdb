It was a sweet introduction to the most intelligent Sailor Soldier, Sailor Mercury. It consisted of a new "in croud", Merciurios. He, at first, wrote a love letter to Ami, which would be transparent (of course) and now Ami thiks he is a chibi-Einstien, and he is attractive (he turned out to look like Umino (Melvin)). This was a halarios (Minako expostaly "No skin on my neck" scene (HOT!)) Well, I really like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon Series, I personally think it's the best anime ever! But, this movie was good, Funny, but not as adventurous as Sailor Moon R- It was more like the movie "S". I saw this @ Sailor Moon Univewrse, with Real Player, and it was very good. (In general)
