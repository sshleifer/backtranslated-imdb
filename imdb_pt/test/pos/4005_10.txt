First of all I want to say Ang Lee did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and was surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say "That sucks, people can not fly!" for them I say it is fiction and that is. This should not be considered as a film about reality that you could say is a "fairy tale". And very nice to watch an Asian fairy tale. The image can really blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed, Ang Lee has a great talent (very little recognized). The fight scene is very cool and beautifully brought to the viewer. But it's sad, but this movie did not have the appreciation it should have received. But Ang Lee, fortunately, got the attention he deserved with his great success breaking the mountain. So even for viewers who are not interested in history, the pictures are fun enough!
