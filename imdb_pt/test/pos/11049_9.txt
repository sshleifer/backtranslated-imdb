And with those words, one of the big movie ad campaigns came to a conclusion. "Garbo Talks" and she spoke those words in her first sound film, an adaptation of Eugene O'Neil playing Anna Christie. <br /> <br /> Unlike some other players and other studios, MGM took great care in finding the right vehicle for Greta Garbo. Many players who were right in the middle of the silent movie world would lose their careers because of the talkies. His strong native accents hinder, some do not know English. <br /> <br /> It was no coincidence that Anna Christie was chosen for Garbo. First of all, being authored by one of America's leading playwrights, it was the kind of literary property that would have appealed to her. Secondly, since the title role was someone who was Swedish, the accent could be explained. Finally, many of the problems of the early talkies were resolved, even if Anna Christie still wore the title cards. <br /> <br /> Like most of O'Neil's works, he's short on action, but long and deep. Description. The story takes place on the edge of New York, where Garbo as Anna came to live with his father, George Marion. Marion fled to the sea years ago when Anna was a baby and Marion abandoned his wife. Anna had to do what she could to survive in the world of adults and this includes prostitution. <br /> <br /> Marion, of course, is happy to see her, he even ejects Marie Dressler, the old seaside old woman he is living. with years to give place to his flesh and blood. Of course both Marion and Garbo have their problems adjusting to each other, which is not easy when they house a sailor played by Charles Bickford, who likes Garbo. <br /> <br /> Marion is repeating her role from the start. original Broadway production. Anna's role on stage was made by Pauline Lord. Anna Christie competed for 177 appearances in the 1921-22 season on Broadway. It is one of O'Neil's best-known works and one that is revived frequently. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo's performance with perfect diction, even with a Swedish accent, was acclaimed and his future in sound films was assured. Greta Garbo received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and the film also received nominations for Clarence Brown as Best Director and William Daniels for Cinematography. Daniels should especially receive many accolades for the way he photographed the seaside scenes. And Brown created the mood around the edge where the film is set. <br /> <br /> Eugene O'Neil's work is timeless, so Anna Christie, even with many of the earliest sound films, does not dance like many films of that era do. Garbo also shows that she has mastered the subtlety needed to work in the midst of sound. Anna Christie is a classic, all the way around.
