I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen so far for naruto. the action was much better than the first movie because it had so many more fight scenes and came to you at a faster pace. was amazing, the choreography was great, as were most of the visual effects. <br /> <br /> The plot is something new for Naruto. but it's basically the same as the first movie. in the series we will fight against other ninjas, but in the movies (1 + 2) you see them fighting the machine of mass destruction. It's good to see them fighting against something other than the ninja, and it was great to see another power beyond the chakra. and how other people from other lands on the other side of the ocean struggle. also sakura has finally killed someone who is stronger than her. (it really became strong) was far better than the fillers in the series that I'm watching right now. When you watch this movie, the fast action scene will surely make your heart soar. With new jutsus and claw in the movie, you know it's good. and the music was good too, but I think something is missing. But the final theme song was an advantage. (dind dong dang) I think it was a very good song. I totally recommend it. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this movie a 10, because I love it. If you decide to watch, enjoy. I laughed a lot
