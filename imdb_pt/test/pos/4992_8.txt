Things I like. Steve Zahn as Gus, plays the play, copies the mannerisms of Robert Duvall, which makes him feel comfortable with Gus fans. (some of the other actors also copy the style of their predecessors in this series). Karl Urban, looks dark and tough, but he can make a joke and smile too, which T. L. Jones did in the original series. The equipment, the weapons, the clothes, all precise or very close to the exact period. I will never forgive Costner and Duvall for having a nylon tie on their chuckwagon in the Open Range. The Comanches, they're really bareback riding, rather than hiding a modern saddle under a Navajo blanket. And they are not painted as politically correct peace-loving pastoralists, but as a proud warrior people. There are some idiotic scenes, but it beats the heck out of yet another variation on doing something stupid not to win a million dollar reality shows.
