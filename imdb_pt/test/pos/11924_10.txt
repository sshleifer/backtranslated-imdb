I loved this movie since I saw it in the theater in 1991. I was 12 years old and Wil Wheaton was my favorite actor and teenage passion. I am now 23 years old and still love this movie. The best part is whoever I'm dating also loves because it's a totally sexist movie! It is done with enough action and chaos to keep men with the slightest attention that stretches to the screen. I just wanted it to be available on DVD!
