We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film and Video Festival and we liked it. <br /> <br /> This film plunged into the fear that we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and, most important, fear of our own inadequacies. <br /> <br /> The three protagonists, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo, combine well with their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamics between the three as it seemed real. <br /> <br /> I think Barbora Bobulova is a highlight. I hope to see more of her in the next few years. <br /> <br /> This movie does not take the easy way out. Thumbs up to the Italian team who set up this movie. Highly recommended.
