Jewel Thief is a rare breed of film - completely noir in its history, but nothing noir about the presentation. A young man named Vinay, superbly played by a newly created Dev Anand at age 40, is removed from his father, the policeman, and finds a job at a jewelry store. Soon, random people approach him and call him Love. Using only a few concise moments the presence of a "doppelganger" is established. Then a Shalini woman (Vyjayantimala) introduces herself and claims to be committed to the so-called doppelganger. She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar), who is so convinced that Vinay is actually Amar that makes him take off his shoe and prove that he is not Aamr, the sixth. The super cute daughter of jeweler Anju (Tanuja) is completely in love with Vinay. In the midst of all this confusion, there is a jewel thief on the loose and he is stealing at will. Slowly, we learned from Vinay's encounter with a super-popular singer (Helen!) That the thief is Loving the doppelganger. Many beautiful women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) stand behind the hero. The police force, including Vinay's father, is completely confused. Vinay is slowly falling in love with Shalini / Shalu and his brother seems to bless the union. The action moves to Sikkim, for it is where the next assault of Amar must take place. The rest is for you to watch - the duplicate, the girls, the men who cling to every word of Vinay thinking that he is their boss Amar, the loving twin brother - nothing seems quite right, and you need to tell the direction) by Vijay Anand to conclude this tale in a very entertaining way. The movie has countless moments in which you will wonder until they delightfully enter into a grand finale at a ball at a palace in Sikkim. <br /> <br /> I was not a big fan of Vyjayanthi, but she is quite competent here, although to her more chubby. She is able to increase confusion in the story in a subtle way, but it is best when she is sad or dancing. Tanuja is cute as a button and I loved her in that movie. I so wanted her to take the man. Dev was, well, Dev. If he was not walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder always shorter than the other), I wonder who they found to imitate him! However, his style, charm and charisma were infallible. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod in which a large plastic fish was stuck! Ashok Kumar was simply amazing - Dada Moni did not miss a single beat throughout the film and made it into one of the history books. <br /> <br /> SD Burman has turned magic with numbers like Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas (Helen in an imitation of red blood rooster dancing on top of a bar), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera, and my favorite seductive staff Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye. <br /> <br /> If you're wanting a great story, with more twists than a pretzel, wanting to keep guessing, but fun and entertaining - then buy or rent the Jewel Thief. Better buy it, so you can come back and see it again with your friends. This is a guardian.
