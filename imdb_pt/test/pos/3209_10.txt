Hands down, the best drama / comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16-year-old daughter exploring life and discovering things not just about the world but also about themselves. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to maintain a close bond with her daughter, but guiding her on the right track, which throughout the show is becoming increasingly difficult. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), stuck in a world of books and learning, is just beginning to discover the boys and their own sense of rebellion, which surprises them both. With the help of Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) and Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy) and a huge variety of other hilarious characters, this show remains one of my favorites. What really puts the show on top is the complex, incredible and witty, which often uses references from pop culture to the martas dynasty.
