** SPOILERS AHEAD ** It really is unfortunate that such a well-produced movie ends up being a big disappointment. I thought this was full of cliches (silly) and that I basically tried hard. <br /> <br /> For the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making a monkey <br /> <br /> does it sound? For (married) girls: how many of you suddenly went from puritanas to nymphs at night - but not with your husband? For the French: would you really ask about someone being "à la fac" when you know they do not speak French? Would not you use a more common word like "university"? <br /> <br /> I lived in France for a time and a half that I know and I understand <br /> <br /> Europe (and I love it), but my roommate (German) and I find it < / general insult. It looked like a European Parliament-funded film, and it basically tried a lot. He had all sorts of differences he tried to unite (not a bad thing in itself), but the result is at best weird, but actually ridiculous - too many <br /> <br /> confrontations that really do not would happen. So the end of the movie - the last 10 minutes - ruined everything else. Why does Xavier not talk to the Erasmus students he knows in Paris? Why does he just walk away? Why did he just get away from his job, this is "freedom"? And in the end, the new Europe should rest on a lot of people who smoke and fuck all day? Is that what it's made of? <br /> <br /> Besides, the acting was pretty awful. I can not believe Judith. <br /> <br /> The role and performance of Godrèche. Why was she made to look so much like Emanuelle Béart? At first I thought Xavier was fine, but in retrospect, I think he was really bad. <br /> <br /> And this is really bad, because technically (opening credits, scenes when he's asking what papers he needs) was really good <br /> <br /> (except for the sound editing around the British brothers), and the soundtrack <br /> <br /> was also great. So the shape was good, but the content was horrible too.
