This is the second Hitchcock movie to appear on the list and the second Hitchcock movie I saw in full, the first was Rope, which I really enjoyed. With the saboteur, Hitchcock had more room to be free, while the Rope was in a single room. I did not like this as much as Rope, but that's not to say that this is a bad movie, it looks like a medium movie that could have been something more. It looks like a movie Hitchcock would do. take a break from the more serious ones. As a thriller, I feel like I can not really get to the edge of my seat or be involved with the main character who is running around the United States. The climax of the film seems like a missed opportunity to really increase the tension. The sound design is almost non-existent. You can listen to their dialogues and some of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the points ripping apart, the need for music to amplify the tension, all that is missing. Intentionally, without a doubt, you lack the emotional punch you would want from such a scene. Then it ends abruptly leaving it empty inside. <br /> <br /> The movie does not look like it should, they are almost trotting from place to place, but it seems more confined. The script itself is very medium and seems to go over the more obtuse ways of making the storyline move. <br /> <br /> The performances are there, but nothing surprising. All play their parts for words written on the page. The relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. What stands out is Otto Kruger, who has that rich ego, an evil person. <br /> <br /> In the end, I wanted more of this. I understand it's one of the less exciting Hitchcock films, but I had a good time watching. I can recommend it, just not enthusiastically.
