Congregation of all monsters in the final film of Universal's renowned cycle of classic horror stories. Count Dracula (an intense, elegant John Carradine), calling himself Baron Latos, arrives at Dr. Edelmann (Onslow Stevens) asking to be cured of his affliction. Of course, this is just a trick. So coincidentally, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney), known as "The Man of the Wolves", appears and of course he * really * wants to be healed. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, monsters do not get equal screen time. The Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange) is played at the end only for the purpose of including all Universal Monsters. Library movie and music images are reused here as well. The film spends a little too much time on Dracula's part of the story, though Carradine offers an impressive non-Hammy performance as the Count. The film is mainly a showcase for Stevens, who goes through a tragic arc of character and does an excellent job. The women are beautiful, and I must say I loved Jane Adams as the luminous nurse-who happens to be hunchback. <br /> <br /> Of course it would not be complete without the inclusion of angry villagers. <br /> <br /> The professional and professional chiller is, just to my liking, not really scary, but it's fun. It's a respectable series of releases in general. <br /> <br /> 7/10
