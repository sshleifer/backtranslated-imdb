Graphics: brilliant, obviously. The most impressive things were definitely not given in the trailers. The fight sequences move extremely fast, but after watching some of them your eyes must be accustomed and this will not seem so confusing. Cloud has a wide variety of swords, and I kind of wish things were moving a little slower so we could see them because they were incredibly detailed. Oh, and finally we get to see exactly how Matter is equipped ... Music: brilliant too. I was a bit nervous about that, since (from what I've seen) Nobuo is not the best at writing music to keep up with the action (remember Steal the Tiny Bronco?), But it's brilliant and fits perfectly. I'm happy to have ordered the OST. They have changed lyrics to One Winged Angel, so you will not be able to sing along if you know the lyrics of Carmina Burana. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: The first half of the movie sets things up and presents everyone in a fairly complex tapestry, but the second half is almost entirely fight sequences, since all players are in place. I would not say it's a weak plot, but it's not nearly as complicated as the plot of the game. I think this is an effort to avoid trying to overshadow the game, and I think it's a good thing ... the movie is an entity of its own, and should not try to overcome the original in terms of pure plot. <BR> I admit, I was kind of hoping that this movie would bring the FF7 to a larger group of people, but this is NOT a mainstream movie. I was going to give only nine stars, just because it does not even try to explain anything to the newbies ... Marlene (at least I think it was Marlene ... she looked like it) gives a bit of experience starting, but it's more an update than one intensive course. But then I realized, for me this movie is a 10/10, so why should I take points just because other people probably will not like it too ... if you've ever played the game, or at least passing familiar with it, you should see this movie. But you do not need me to tell you that. If you're not familiar with it, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and hit it, and then watch the movie ... although even without any background, it's still incredibly beautiful. You simply will not have any of the internal references ... that make up 50% of the movie (that is, everything that is NOT a fight sequence).
