In the mid-1970s, a group of teenagers from Venice, California, broken homes and the bad side of the city, known as Z-Boys, transformed the already sober world of professional skateboarding into its radical, unconventional punk attitude. style, and unbridled spirit of pure aggression, revolutionizing the sport in the process and paving the way for the many extreme variations of sports that have emerged in its influential wake. Director Stacy Peralta, who is one of the legendary Z-Boys, reports the incredible feats of this incredible crew in a fierce and visceral way that is both informative and wildly fun: fast and fast editing, fast paced rhythm and brutality. Rude creates a hell of a contagious buzz, projecting a feeling of pure joy and full energy that is a total pleasure to see. Better yet, this documentary does not sanitize or romanticize its subjects: these coarse boys were so fiercely competitive and out of it that they all went their separate ways when the attraction of fame and fortune manifested itself in their lives. The final destiny of certain guys is moving and touching, with Jay Adams rated as the saddest and tragic: he blew his shot at the big time and ended up making time in jail. The other guys are very colorful and kind too; charismatic ball of arrogant and defiant fire Tony Alva in particular appears as an arrogant but impressive piece of furiously assertive work. Beautifully narrated with deliciously easy'n'breezy nasal delicacy by Sean Penn. The fantastic rock soundtrack also smokes seriously. But what really makes this documentary so victorious is its refreshing lack of pretension: it's so dynamic, exuberant and extraordinary that the gloriously outrageous Z-Boys.
