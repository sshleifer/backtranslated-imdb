I have difficulty putting into words just how wonderful this was. Every once in a while you see a movie that simply gets you. "You Are Alone" is this movie (for me). The movie is constantly in my head and in my heart. I review the scenes mentally every day, analyze them, and review the emotions as if I were seeing them for the first time. <br /> <br /> There's nothing I did not like about the movie. Awesome soundtrack !!! The ending was perfect. Very emotionally shaking !!! It was compelling and fascinating. <br /> <br /> I loved Jessica Bohl and her performance was the biggest I've ever witnessed. I admired the strength of Brittany (what a strong woman). <br /> <br /> The slogan is "When your darkest moments come to life." We never know what we can do. Everyone says oh I would never do that, when we really have no idea what we would do in a situation. We are very capable of anything and this film plunges directly into that subject. The honesty of the film may be my absolute favorite part. <br /> <br /> Thank you Gorman Becherd for a perfect piece of art !!!!
