A good x-bad movie with likes of "James Bond," "Romeo and Juliet," and perhaps even "Star Wars." <br /> <br /> The Count of Evil Von Bruno receives an English gentleman as guest for a very dangerous hunt. Elga, the beautiful simple and well-meaning lady who was forced to marry the count, provides the love triangle. The number of missing points points to a terrible past. English is not what the score thinks and it is a terrible treat for him. There is also the terrible hunchback, crocodiles and even the side appearance of some torture instruments. <br /> <br /> Boris Karlloff, here in a supporting role, makes a strong but somewhat harsh presence. The other actors (and direction) are the symbol of an era of the strong representations of black and white films. From the beginning there is no doubt who is the bad guy, who is the good guy. Even traitors and rigid can be identified with some ease.
