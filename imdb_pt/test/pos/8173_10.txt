I have nothing but good things to say about this tasteful and moving film. I think the effort of the director / writer of the film is courageous and inspiring. I loved this movie not only for the fantastic story (which needed to be told), but also for the way the actors handed the story. This is not another superficial "gay film" that portrays characters stereotyped in humorous situations. This was a memorable and flawless effort to show people that love really knows no limits and that love is still as beautiful and wonderful as it always was. <br /> <br /> Another thing that touched my heart was how well I could relate to the emotion portrayed in this movie around the emergence of one of the main characters. We all have to go through similar situations living in the society in which we live and feeling that sense of detachment from everything that is "right" and "normal." I give my heartfelt praise for this fabulous and brave story.
