simply can not watch this many times, is full of true enthusiasm and cunning that Mickey had in his first 30 years. Nowadays' Mickey is a little clever whiner when compared to that. The steamboat Willie always makes me smile, at least the end where Mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with a potato. The animation is very good and although the steamer Willie does not have dialogues, the music is enough for that. IMHO If this little one does not deserve 10/10 then any design not only because it is a true classic but also because it is so full of joy and it is always fun to watch.
