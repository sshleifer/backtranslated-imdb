Superb silent version of the story of Francois Villon. Although redone in the thirties as if I did KING, directed by Frank Lloyd, screenplay by Preston Sturges and starring Ronald Colman, this version is even better. Barrymore, with a group of comedians, plays the comic fool and the depressed Villon with an enthusiasm that Colman could not match. The picture is amazing in its beauty and innovation and the supporting cast, particularly Conrad Veidt in his American debut, the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day, and supporting comics, Slim Summerville and Hank Mann steal all the scenes they are in. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Barrymore has done so few first-class comedies. Among his sound films, only his leadership in the twentieth century and his supporting role in MIDNIGHT can compare to that, and those that rise only because of his superb voice. In this silent film, Barrymore must tell his story without the benefit of words, and does so, alternately hilariously unrecognizable as the King of the Foolish and lovingly as Villon in love. He can even jump in Fairbanks bragging style more convincingly. It also allows your supporting cast to have its share of glory, stirring up in this joint work just like any talented comic of the day. <br /> <br /> Finally, a brief word about Alan Crosland, a director known only today for directing the film. first talking feature, THE JAZZ SINGER in the same year it was released. Crosland was a careful, innovative and delightfully original director, and it's a pity that more of his work is not known. Perhaps this film, much more interesting as a film than his best known work, is his introduction to his other talents. If so, you could do much worse.
