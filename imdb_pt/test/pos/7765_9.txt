This is my favorite movie that portrays African Americans in all different light. because it shows a different side of African Americans that is not shown in the movies. it's not the gang bang, the urban ghetto scenario or having to deal with deep racial issues, captivates the whole essence of being young and trying to be successful and having problems with lowering your guard and letting someone into your life, and the whole bohemia Atmosphere gives that great touch that makes everything great, is a great dialogue script that captivates you and you end up getting involved with the character. perfect cast with a lot of chemistry and very good acting and I have not yet seen any other movie with black characters that are portrayed in that format the only one that comes close is "Sprung" but since it's a comedy he loses very quickly I give this movie 9 10 and I would like them to continue making films with that kind of attitude about African Americans
