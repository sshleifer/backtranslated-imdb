Governments are elected for three-year terms, as Reg Whithers said in 1973, the Liberals were determined to continue forcing the polls until they were defeated. If you ask me, this is portrayed in the docudrama, but anyone who says that Kerr acted correctly does not recognize the expensive and costly strategy of the Liberal Party of Australia. In the series itself, I thought Max Phipps was a poor Whitlam, his voice was too ghostly. In addition, more of the main political actors on both sides should have been used, although this may have been a reflection of the budget constraints of the time. However, I recommend, with caution.
