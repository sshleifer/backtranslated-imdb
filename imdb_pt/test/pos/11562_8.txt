I have not seen this movie since it came out in the mid-'70s, but I remember it as being a very realistic picture of the music business (right there with Paul Simons "One Trick Pony" ... another immensely understated IME) Harvey Keitel does an excellent job as a producer stuck between the music he believes, and the commercial "gut" that the label "suits" wants him to work on. <br /> <br /> Since I've spent all my time career in the music industry as a composer / arranger / producer, I can really attest to the likelihood that this movie has. <br /> <br /> If I ever leave uncut DVD I buy!
