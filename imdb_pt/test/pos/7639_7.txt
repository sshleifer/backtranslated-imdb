I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. I think the general dislike of this movie is due to people who do not really understand the plot. If you think about the plot, this movie really makes perfect sense, it simply does not give you a stupid explanation. It is true that the special effects are insignificant and seems to have a very low budget, but I think the originality of the plot keeps you attracted. People say that the vampire genre is exaggerated and clich√©d, but with Bled, what you get is not your conventional vampire movie. It's a dream / alternate reality story with a vampire / eternal life spinning over it. I loved. The only thing that stopped me from giving a higher rating was the lack of special effects and that I personally do not like movies where most people have an accent. But as I said earlier, if you really understand the plot, this is not a bad movie.
