"Seeing Other People" is a daring romantic comedy about a couple named Ed and Alice (Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson) who are engaged and planning to get married soon. They live together, but both are having doubts about their relationship. Alice realizes that she has had so few sexual relationships in the past, she may be marrying Ed because she has never felt anything else. So they agree to start playing with other people for a while to test their own relationship. <br /> <br /> The film balances a prescient issue - concentrating too much on "What if?" aspects of life, can in fact do the opposite and just make you feel more constrained? When Ed starts having sex with a college girl, he begins to get hooked and almost forgets Alice - when he realizes it, it scares him. <br /> <br /> I had not heard anything about this movie before, but I liked it. It is not extremely well done and definitely has a deliberately low budget indie mood - but it is much better than most romantic comedies currently in the mainstream. <br /> <br /> Take a look if you have a chance.
