I'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (I'm not counting the budget for the super bug, none of Batman's plots as well) <br /> <br /> Some of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget film called The Demolitionist. The Black Scorpion can be added to this collection. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Demolitionist, then get this movie. It's basically a copy of this heroine. (He still has the same face in both movies) <br /> <br /> If you do not have it, then let me explain ... the father of a cop is murdered and she seeks revenge. She ties the black outfit (a sexy, quaint outfit that looks absolutely great on Joan Severance) and goes out to kick some spoils. <br /> <br /> It's a fun, action-packed movie, remember, you might not want kids to see it ... without doing a screening to see if you approve of the beautiful sex scene that Severance has in her Which in my opinion was a bonus (alright, give it an extra star <smile>)
