In the last century, there have been many advances in gender equality, but not so much in the world of cinema. I'm not talking about what happens behind the camera, I'm referring to the tastes of the audience. The idea of ​​a "girl movie" is alive and well today, while there are still a lot of action and horror movies that mostly appeal to men. Of course, there are men and women who enjoy movies that are outside their typical demographic profile, but there are not many movies that have general appeal. Hitch, Will Smith's latest vehicle tries to change that trend by being a girl movie that plays in a dose of male perspective. <br /> <br /> Smith star Hitch as the title character, Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a "date doctor" who trains men on how to approach a woman and have a date of success. Hitch likes his job and loves to see men successfully accomplish their goals of dating the woman of their dreams, but because of a poor college experience, Hitch himself is a little dirty with the idea of ​​love. As the story unfolds, the film introduces two seemingly separate story lines. The last case of Hitch is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), an accountant who is very attracted to one of his clients, the beautiful heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Hitch has his doubts about Albert's chances, but if the wishes of his clients seem sincere, Hitch supports them. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hitch meets gossip columnist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) and is instantly attracted to this strong woman. However, the medical date can not follow its own advice by chasing after Sara. Things get even more complicated when Sara's work leads her to investigate the relationship between the accountant and the heiress. Will Hitch be able to balance your private life and your work? And more importantly, can Hitch believe in love again? If you are a true movie fan, then there was at least one time in your life when you complained about the redundancy of the Hollywood movie factory and clamored for something new and original. Well, Hitch is not that movie. But, most movie fans also admit that occasionally a formula movie can only work on one level of entertainment. Hitch qualifies as that movie.
