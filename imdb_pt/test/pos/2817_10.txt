The best part of the movie was when Alan lowered his panties and ran his cut throat razor over the cheeks of her butt and around her butt hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's butt rising and falling like the elbow of a violinist later in the movie. Alan was as hard as hell, like when he got angry and pushed the four-eyed coward up. sofa. <br /> <br /> I've laughed for days on the little cut throat razor. A brilliant idea from the screenwriters. Alan must be brought back to the Eastenders so he can do the same with Peggy. <br /> <br /> Alan is back, and this time he is armed with a razor. Beware if you are a girl and he finds you and pulls his panties down.
