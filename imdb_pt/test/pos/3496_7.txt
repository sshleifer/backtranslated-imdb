The character Ali G works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show, but as a movie, it does not work the same way. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong - this is a very funny movie, full of witty and witty dialogues, which caricature wonderfully well the modern British cinema, providing the viewer with a hilarious and unrealistic story. <br /> <br /> One problem with this movie is that the script and content are either fantastically brilliant, or it's embarrassing to watch. When I say embarrassing, I do not mean the embarrassing funny to the Office or Extras, but rather, you wish they had not included it in the final cut. An example of this is the inclusion of a video clip after the end of the film, to the sound of "This is how we do it". Whenever I watch the movie, I stop the DVD when it says the end, and I leave it at that. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ali G Indahouse is a good movie, which is worth watching sometimes. The script is pleasant to a certain extent, and there are no problems with regard to acting. However, refinement is the key word here. <br /> <br /> Ali G is a better television show. Borat is a better movie.
