WARNING: SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> This is written for viewers who may have walked away from "Mood for Love" perplexed and confused about the paths that the main characters choose in life. From reading other reviews and criticisms, it seems that many viewers and critics have missed some very important details that may have prevented them from enjoying this delicious film teaser. <br /> <br /> We are so accustomed to seeing the blatant SEX in the narrations. that we forgot that there was a time when cameramen suggested "dirty action" by simply showing couples with their mouths open on a sleigh or wagon just to go back to the next scene with a protruding belly or a fat kid stuck with hip ... " Get to know your son. " <br /> <br /> The director chose the same nostalgic approach in telling the story of Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan. Last warning ... SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Mr. Chow tricks Mrs. Chan to show her true emotions when they rehearse their departure forever. Next scene: Mrs. Chan nods to Mr. Chow in the cab and says "I do not want to go home tonight". Why, then, did the couple simply not do the modern thing of abandoning their spouses, getting divorced, raising their loving child, and living happily ever after? The answer is that this whole story takes place in Hong Kong during the sixties. A bastard would live in a sad life of shame if he were the son of an adulteress, whereas a "legitimate" child could live a tragic but noble / honest life if his mother chose to raise him away from his traitor "father." the invisible Mr. Chan. In short, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan sacrifice their relationship for the future of their son. <br /> <br /> That's why Mr. Chow, knowing that Mrs. Chan lives alone with a little boy, smiles. He dreams of making Mrs. Chan his Mrs. Chow. He then also notices why Mrs. Chan went to Singapore to stay with him, only to reconsider at the last moment and leave ..., choosing to never see him again (but not before taking some anonymous recollection) Mr. Chow lives with this wonderful secret with no one to tell. No one except for a ruined temple wall and of course we the spectator ... but only if we listen carefully.
