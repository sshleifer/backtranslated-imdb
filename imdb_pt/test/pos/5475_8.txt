Wolfgang Peterson directs this thriller that has Clint Eastwood playing Agent Secrect Service Frank Horrigan, who combines intelligence with a clever psychopath (John Malkovich) in a cat-and-mouse game involving the president's protection. Mitch Leary (Malkovich) maintains contact with Horrigan by provoking the agent with discouraging comments about his abilities as well as protecting Secret Service presidents in the past. Agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) tries to keep Horrigan grounded; but he's strong-minded in stopping Leary from accomplishing his murder threats. Very good FX and fast paced sustains the plot. Eastwood and Malkovich are superb. Russo has a way of getting his attention. Completing this strong cast are: Dylan McDermott, Fred Dalton Thompson, John Mahoney and Gary Cole.
