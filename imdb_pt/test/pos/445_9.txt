This movie works on many different levels. It is a profile of a very cool couple, a social commentary on aging and nursing homes, a love story, a musical. I've seen Uncle Frank a few times, and every time I watch, I'm not sure who to call first - my parents, my wife, a friend I've lost contact with. . But there's a way to make you remember the most important relationships in your life - and you want to reaffirm those that continue. Expect lots of laughter, and probably a few tears if any of the vibrant characters here hit a chord. I'm sure they will.
