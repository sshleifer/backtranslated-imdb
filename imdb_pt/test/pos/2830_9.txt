I would suggest that Only the Valiant is one of the most original and intriguing films and, to some extent, strangers that Peck has done; bold, surprising and one of his few best westerns (- no, of course, not a western really, but a chronicle military, which sometimes is better--). It is very low budget, but, oh, very original and striking. It's one of those treats that a real buff sometimes gets; movies that no one has yet told you they exist. You say 'this sounds intriguing, or interesting', and it surpasses your expectations. <br /> <br /> On the whole, the script shows an unusual maturity level for Westerners and somehow reminded me obliquely of ULZANA; it's also a meaningless, meaningless suspense. <br /> <br /> Peck looked bold as a tough young man, a little somber and stoic officer; and there are many unexpected touches - like the blonde kissing and flirting with what she has decided not to marry, maybe a feeling of her for justice and retribution ??. <br /> <br /> Same genre, ONLY ?? is much more than a military tale - it's also an action drama, a thriller, an action / action thriller - the strangest combination imaginable; a band of soldiers on a special mission to neutralize and prevent a possible attack from the native - the insane decision not to take all available troops to the place where these natives could be stopped - but only a handful of people? "And this plot never takes a rubbish route like most would and did. The interest in humans, people and their reasons and actions never falters. A word due to Peck himself; he presents himself with panache, and although I often find his films flamboyant and boring in such small encounters, I find intact all the gloomy and even creepy glamor of Peck. He was an unusual star. <br /> <br /> I gladly recommend this extraordinary film.
