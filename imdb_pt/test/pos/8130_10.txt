The biggest tragedy surrounding this thoroughly delicious movie is the lack of US distribution. I was fortunate to see this movie at the Boston International Women's Film Festival and I recommend it to all who have the opportunity to see it. Great performances, insightful screenplay and great direction from the talented and funny Rose Troche, all combined to make this film a winner!
