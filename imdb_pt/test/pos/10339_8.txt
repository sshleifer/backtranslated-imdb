This is the kind of movie that you initially select to compose video rental numbers ..... just to discover a fun and under-rated fun movie !! The opening sequence of the police arriving in a dark and rainy house in which the "wife" committed murder ....... or is it ?? .... and the rest of the movie seeks to unravel what really happened. ... OK ... the movie is a little "exaggerated" ... but it has good editing and dialogue ..... professional acting ..... often humorous ...... and the last scene with facial expression is one of the best of its kind ...... definitely worth watching ..... deserving at least a 7 or an 8!
