This was one of the worst episodes of Columbus I've seen, however, I'm only in season two. <br /> <br /> Columbo's typical activities are fun and annoying. His cigar ashes causing him problems were seen before, and the part where he always identifies himself in some way with the killer - in this case, cooking, threw the scene in the TV show absentminded from the main theme. <br /> <br /> Also not explained because the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting some of the mixer wires. Reason was never explained, nor served any purpose. But the part I did not like was the death of the bride. This has never been explained and is the main reason why I give this episode such a low note.
