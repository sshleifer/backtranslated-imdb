It is particularly difficult for a director to capture films without being precious, innate, dramatic or all three. Breillat deftly demonstrates an author's instinctive lizard-brain methods in extracting two "oxen" (as Hitchcock called actors) - a love scene of searing intimacy. His main battle is with his leader ("an actor is really a woman", she opines), although of course she is the protagonist who will steal the show. I disagree that this is Breillat's first comedy. "Romance" was hilarious on several points, but I accept that the French sense of humor may be indescribable to strangers; In fact, dozens of IMDb reviewers did not detect any comedy in the novel. On the other hand, Sex Is Comedy raises many laughs, mainly using the support of an actor who goes back thousands of years to Plautus and the ancient Greeks. We imagined, coming out of the theater, if Roxane's "beard" was a wig. A beautiful performance by Anne Parillaud as Breillat struggling with her own script, looking ten years younger than her age.
