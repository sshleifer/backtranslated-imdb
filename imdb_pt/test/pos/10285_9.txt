In this tense and character-based romantic tragicomedy, we are given a glimpse into the intertwined life of four Parisians in their 30s. In the center is the portrait of Max de Vinz Cassell. Starry-eyed Romeo, he falls in love with Linda Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his best friend Lucien (Écoffey, in a discreet yet effective performance), he conquers his heart and they live happily ever after ... that is, even the intriguing, neurotic and obsessive Alice (the versatile Romane Bohringer) becomes very involved in the life and love of the other three. <br /> <br /> The rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological confusion, and the film appears as an intricate puzzle, the eyewall of Paris photo-postcard at the heart of it all. The use of color does not go unnoticed, particularly in Lisa's spectacular apartment (presumably responsible for the title of the film), where the reds and yellows provoke the fire of passion and lust. <br /> <br /> The audience can relate to Max: he really uses the heart up his sleeve and is constantly punished for irony and circumstance. In a memorable scene, our predestined lovers (agonizingly separated by a "choreographed" misunderstanding) narrowly miss the chance encounter that will surely reunite them. Independently of each other, they travel to the same destination: she in the subway, he in a taxi, practically in tête-à-tête. However, fate seems to have it for them, and the audience is captivated. <br /> <br /> The performances in this movie are really what makes L'Appartement stand out. I still can not understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside of France. He has presence and diversity in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cassell's real-life wife at the time of writing) recently found fame in the English-language film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - true, she is divinely beautiful, but behind it is a talented actress who can master a scene in style classic "protagonist" that many British and American actresses dismiss in favor of the "subtle" approach very easy. <br /> <br /> In all, watch this movie! I doubt you'll be disappointed. It's exciting, satisfying, fun, sad, lavish and a lesson in artistic film production.
