I've never forgotten this movie. All these years and that has remained in my life. I've looked at this movie on so many sites and stores. If someone reads this and has a copy, I'll pay you for a copy or please let me know where I could find one. This is a movie that must be a well-known Classical Romance, as well as my other favorite, Somewhere in Time. It was really brilliant. If the right actors could remake this film and give it the Patience it needs, to be the Right Actor, it could be a block buster. A love story as powerful as this should be around for all lovers to see. I remember how sad I was at the end and it really was a shock. I believe with all my heart that Johnny really loved the woman and she loved him. This was a fantastic movie and it's a pity that it is not available for us to buy. Please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - I want to thank a wonderful lady who answered my message almost a year later. She had a copy of the film and was very kind to send it to me. She is a big fan of this movie as I am. With her help, there were 3 women happy to receive these DVDs. She's waiting for the book she's based on. I am checking with my local library, entitled 'Mrs Maitlands Affair', by Margarett Lynn. I'm sure it's great, too. Many thanks to Julie for her kindness and friendship. I am your friend forever, / Sharon
