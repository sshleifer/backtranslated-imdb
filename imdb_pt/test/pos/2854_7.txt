Small spoilers follow, but nothing you have not learned by reading the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Along with a wonderful central performance by Renee Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a somber but humorous comedy. Suffering from an emotional and mental collapse after witnessing the murder of her husband, the already desperate and desperate waitress Betty becomes convinced that a character in her favorite daytime soap is her long-lost fiance and part of her job. Kansas to Hollywood to meet him. Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger interpreting her as an innocent lost, not totally helpless, but tragically vulnerable, however. . Crucially she is never really a victim despite this and while she undoubtedly suffers horribly the motives of the characters who treat her poorly are understandable - even Greg Kinnear as object of his deluded affections may be a egocentric, blind and arrogant pig, but he really believes that she's just a pretentious actress with bags of talent instead of a crazy stalker. <br /> <br /> The end of the farce where all the main protagonists descend in the same place (in this case Betty's house) at the same time is as old as the cinema itself, but works very well here, even if the change of tone is regrettable. <br /> <br /> Zellweger is ably supported by Kinnear and Morgan Freeman, both doing a solid job, and it's especially nice to see Chris Rock show restraint in his earlier scenes. <br /> <br /> It's not as cruel as you might expect, and not a bit stingy, Nurse Betty - though it's far from a riot of laughter - is a solid entertainment elevated to something considerably more for the lead actress.
