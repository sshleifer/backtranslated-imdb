'Blade' would be an extremely above average comic book, vampire hunter action / horror if it were not for two minor flaws. # 1 I loved watching the all-but-invincible Blade / Snipes make their cut and cut, but the whole "Yes!" fist / punch was literally a disappointment. # 2 Bad, do not do this horrible, CGI? even by 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but a few have sprinkled everywhere. Okay, despite these minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All the actors did a job in the suburbs and the fact that this now looks like another 'Matrix' scam is hilarious considering that it happened a year earlier. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade'. Anyway, it's a movie for various genre-savvy audiences: comic geeks, action fanatics, and vampire / horror lovers. So we have Blade, half-man / half-vampire, or "walker of the day" and his achievement, Whisler (a la "Batman and Alfred") fighting the undead that apparently almost out of human numbers. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade is yet another anti-hero), our ninja / vamp sword rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood / medical expert. Meanwhile, the problem ferries between vampires as if it wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs Blade to get it. It's not the most original concept, if you read what I just wrote, but it's still very nice. You will want to see Blade succeed, you will cheer for it, despite its imperfections and mannerisms. And you'll know what's coming, as this is the typical 1-2-3 act of a comic book introduction. Still, watch this without trying to go too deep. How to Vampire SPF-1000 "suntan lotion"? Same? What about the scalp? Would not that burn? Just like the money they burn for guns? All right, I'm going too deep. Again, sit back and enjoy the fun techno-filled ride.
