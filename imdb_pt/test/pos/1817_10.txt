I remember seeing this movie when I was 13 and I fell in love with it and I was a big fan of the movie and the characters I loved. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker) because she made me laugh when she showed no interest in Fred (Cameron Dye) who really liked her and I hoped in the end they would join her annoying boyfriend, Ralphie (Christopher Murray) because he ignored her and went out with his friends. I love the cast and the story. I always love the part where Fred tries to join Stacey, and I always remember when he chased her around the car. But it was so good. I will always remember this in my teens. Now that I'm 33 years old, I've got my copy on DVD and hope to see it.
