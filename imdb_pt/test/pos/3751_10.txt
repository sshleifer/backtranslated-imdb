I liked it more than House Party 2 and 3. The cast was hilarious and cool at the same time. Chris Stokes, who directed the film, has a humorous tip as a car repairer; Look for your mother who plays the main character, John's grandmother. And you can hear her sing the title song "Down to the Last Minute" at the end of the movie while the credits roll. She is very funny and a great actress too. The young actors who lead (the main trio) and who, in fact, are part of the IMx musical group, did an excellent job. Before this movie, I had not paid much attention to this r & b group. I'm a fan now. The number of the song in the House Party scene is only worth checking out. I was pleasantly surprised. I loved.
