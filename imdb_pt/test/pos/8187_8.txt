I really enjoyed the movie, especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful Li Gong as the concubine. <br /> <br /> It was a bit disturbing, however, to have the dialogue in Chinese plus the English subtitles and the American accent narration. , even though the voice was very well synchronized. The family name of Qin shi huiang di (The First Emperor of Qin) was Zheng, and his name given Yiong so in English he should have been called as "King Zheng" or "Emperor Zheng ", and NOT as" King Ying Zheng "as in those days the two family names / data were not used together. <br /> <br /> The state of Qin is pronounced "Chin" not "shin" - a pity that the researchers did not hit. <br /> <br /> I forgave this, but I was disappointed at the end when the commentary announced that he was buried in "Zai-an" along with his terracotta warriors. The city of Xi'an is pronounced "See-an", never "Zai-an" - surely the American announcers could have been successful!
