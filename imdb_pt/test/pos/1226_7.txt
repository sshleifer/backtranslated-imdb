This movie is about six men who are assigned to carry money from the bank to the companies. Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) was in Iraq for the war serving his country and is now only being helped to earn a living by his friend Mike Cochrone (Matt Dillon), making sure he does not lose his home. Mike tells him that this was not the life his parents were expecting for him and that he should be living a better life than he is now with his brother Jimmy Hackett (Andre Kinney). Telling Ty that he and Jimmy had always been his family and would do anything to help them, Mike tells Ty about a plan to make an assault. The money would be around 43 million people divided in six ways, though Ty does not like the idea he tells his friend Mike as long as no one gets hurt. He was forced to talk to him last night. a lady of social welfare about placing her brother in an orphanage, giving her a dilemma to lose what matters most in her life. Although the plan seems safe at first, greed is not everything when it comes to taking lives. <br /> <br /> When it comes to robberies, you enter or leave, so when you do not go with a plan its hard to play the hero and stop the greedy people when it comes to having large sums of money. This film comes with a cast of stars to keep you interested, starring Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburne, Amaury Nolasco, Ward Fred, Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia. Short Recently, I only remembered him in "Stomp the Yard," which was about a child who lost his brother and lives his dream of going to college. This was probably one of his best movies I've seen him in and he fits so well into the character that it's great to see him on the big screen again in action.
