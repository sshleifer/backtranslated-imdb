The filmmakers made the story of a more boring man seem interesting and complex, focusing on his wife at home. At the same time, we are exposed to a truly unique and existential French solitary. <br /> <br /> The film is more than a documentary. I almost never feel like I've experienced something that is accidentally deep, which makes it even deeper. <br /> <br /> The film has visually interesting interior moments. I absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers took me. (Quite a lot of Europeans in the credits). I hope PBS shows this to reach a wider audience in the US.
