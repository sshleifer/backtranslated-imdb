Ugh, what an embarrassing episode last night! It was a failed script for "ABC Afterschool Special", or the product of a sincere beginner, fresh out of college, paying homage to this classic 1974 antidepressant homily, "The Gun." In fact husband and they were disappointed that the closing shot was not of The Gun being melted like in the movie! <br /> <br /> No, I'm not some NRA shun. It's just that when the producer of an intelligent and nuanced series has in mind that I should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal Cause, I would appreciate it if the lecture was not at least transmitted via 2-by-4 Wow! <br /> <br /> OK, sociology class is over. The message has been delivered. The important episode was aired. Now let's go back to some fun episodes that try to respect our intelligence.
