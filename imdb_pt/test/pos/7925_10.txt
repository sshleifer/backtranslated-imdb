I went looking for this movie after reading Tom Clancy's novel "Red Storm Rising." Timeless masterpiece about the thirteenth-century Russians being invaded by the Germans. The film was made in 1938 under orders from Joseph Stalin to warn the Soviets about Hitler and Germany. Battle scenes are beautifully done, showing you do not need computer animation to make a great fight scene. Probably the best work of Sergei Eisenstein. See also 'Battleship Potemkin'. Any fan of history or major poli-sci should watch this movie. 10 out of 10.
