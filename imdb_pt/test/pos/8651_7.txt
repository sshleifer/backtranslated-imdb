A man arrives in a strange, beautiful and sterile city, where no one feels any emotion and instead becomes obsessed with interior design. The essential sameness of his days is reminiscent of "Groundhog Day"; the strange passages in and out of this world are more like "Being John Malkovich." But, in fact, this is a Scandinavian film, a self-satire that is also Scandinavian in style: the tone is austere and even the most fantastic scenes are reproduced directly, challenging you to laugh at the absurd. In my opinion, the combination is not entirely successful: there are not enough genuine laughter to compensate for the difficulties of taking the play as pure drama. It is certainly original; maybe my problem is that the world that satirizes is not the one I recognize. Maybe I should move to Scandanavia!
