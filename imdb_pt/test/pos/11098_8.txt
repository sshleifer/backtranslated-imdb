The Hawk and the Snowman is the true story of two wealthy boys from LA who become spies of the Soviet Union. One of them, played by Penn, is already a drug smuggler until his eyes in trouble. The other, played by Hutton, occupies a position in an aerospace company where his job is to run an ultra-secret cable installation. There he learns some of the dirty tricks employed by the CIA on foreigners the United States does not like. Do not forget that the film is set in the early 70's in Vietnam and Watergate. Shocked by what he learned, the character Hutton decides to betray his country and convinces his friend to join him. None of them are long in brains, it does not take long for them to be overcoming their dead ends. <br /> <br /> This is not a thriller, and it's a bit slow. If this is not a problem for you then it is well worth the rent.
