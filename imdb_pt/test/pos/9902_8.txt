"Check Out" is a very witty and honest portrait of a bizarre family that is Jewish. Judaism plays virtually no role in the film, but Judeo-American culture and behavior are completely sent ... it's a loving way. I would like the film to deal with the religious perspective on the topics it explores, because I think it would be interesting. <br /> <br /> I've never been a Columbus fan so I was not familiar with Peter Falk - he's a lot of fun to watch. It's great to see Judge Reinhold, Laura San Giacomo and David Paymer again - why do not they work anymore? They are all hilarious. The script is fantastic with many memorable phrases that I will use with my own family. Pay attention to Gavin McLeod (Captain Stubing!) As the doorman.
