Brett Piper again makes a very good movie that is destroyed by the so-called movie "experts". is low budget but fun, and the protagonist is very sexy. I wish I could see more of Irene Joseph. Good viewing fun. I bought the DVD and I liked it. The special effects are stop motion animation, and far better than the computer-generated crap they call effects today. I always like Brett Piper movies, and if you like it, I recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead and anything else he's done. I look forward to seeing more of your work and also more of Joseph. I just can not understand why this woman has not taken part in more movies, since her acting is excellent.
