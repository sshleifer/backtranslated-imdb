Wow!! it's even better than I expected! the best animated film of Asterix of all time! and it's great to hear Roger Carel making the voice of Asterix again! I certainly recommend it to everyone who likes the Asterix comics! but I suggest you go see the French version because it certainly is the best and you hear the original cast! Did you know that Roger Carel played Asterix for almost forty years? I think he did a wonderful job! and the music of CÃ©line Dion in the end fits well in the final credits! the music is good, the designs are good, the actors are wonderful ... in one word: a masterpiece! go see you will not regret it!
