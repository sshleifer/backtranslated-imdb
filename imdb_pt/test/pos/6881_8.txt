Excellent movie with Anthony Wong that certainly lives up to the title. Erotic but increasingly violent courtesy of dreams bought from a crazed occultist that quickly turns into nightmares of a certain magnitude when the wizard enters inside them to manipulate poor Wong. Well filmed and very fast, this is an uninterrupted tale of serious magic, medicinal herbs, power and corruption, but also gives time for some sex scenes and very bloody violence. There is also just a little twist of humor every once in a while to catch him even more unprepared and the whole thing makes the most stimulating 90 minutes or so. Great performances everywhere.
