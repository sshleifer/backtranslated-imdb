I have loved this movie since I was a kid. I remember the night my mom brought this movie home. I loved it and still love it. I find it very funny and original. There are also some very catchy songs in this movie. Lou is also a surprisingly good singer. The actors who play Prince Arthur and Princess Eloise are also well, but Abbott and Costello are the best. Former heavyweight champion Buddy Baer, ​​also brother of former heavyweight champion Max Baer is good in this film as the cop and the giant. He's a better actor than a boxer. He had a natural talent. The beginning of this movie is hilarious as Lou Costello keeps hitting the car and as he gets into trouble with Buddy Baer. The clowning in the house is also good. I especially like the comedy at Giant's Castle. My favorite parts are; the part where Lou is climbing the beanstalk and everyone is singing like a farewell. Jack is singing back to them that he will return. Lou Costello is very good at singing. My other favorite part is the part where Jack is struggling with the giant. I like it when Jack makes eggs exploding and when he tries to make the giant an omelet they continue to explode. Abbott and Costello are hilarious and the greatest comedians of all time. This is just one of his great films that I will love and love. The comments for this movie are not very good and I can not understand why. This is a great film by Abbott and Costello. I also love how Lou Costello comes back to reality at the end and thinks he's back in the dream when Bud hits him. He starts singing his song and leaves with an attitude that no one will push me. Very good movie.
