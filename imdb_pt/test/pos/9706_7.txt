I just got off a selection in advance, and wow was this hilarious movie. Possibly better than the first, but at least equal. If you do not like idiots, or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity (much more than at first), then stay away, far away. But if you dig the whole Jackass thing, this movie will not disappoint. Toro Totter is the greatest invention of all. IT'S OK. so my comment was not long enough ... All else I have to say is poor, poor Dunn, they really kick his crap in that. So, if you like masochistic humor, and prolific male nudity, and by far the most disgusting female nudity of all time (John Waters is involved, do I need to say more?), Then this movie will keep you whole in full. I never stopped laughing and really came out drenched in sweat.
