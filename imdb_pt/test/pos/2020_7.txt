This was an interesting movie. I could have done without the bathroom scene and the scene of seduction - EWWWW! Other than that, I loved the head-hitting music that this movie revolved around. Chris / Izzy's parents are AWESOME! They fully support the interests of their children and believe in him enough to support him - now this is AMAZING !! What really surprised me was Chris's achievement in the end. It was not exactly the end of "hollywood" on its way to self-discovery. The overall rise to stardom and fall was a roller coaster ride.
