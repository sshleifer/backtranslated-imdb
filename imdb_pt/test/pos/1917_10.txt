I saw this movie on TV and I loved it! I am a true fan of disaster films, and this was great. The cast was made up of some really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in a league of his own. He can play both comedy and suspense in the same movie, as few do. The plot is great too. The thought of being able to follow a timeline of what will happen and using that timeline to avoid a global disaster is an interesting idea. And this film brings in such a way that it is almost totally believable.
