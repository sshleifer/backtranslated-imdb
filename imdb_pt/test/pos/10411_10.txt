One of the reasons they call the 80's, "The Awesome 80's" is quality television. Shows like Wonder Years, War of the Worlds, V, Amazing Stories, and many others have always left an impression for every "lucky" one of us who over time will always find a way to wake up. To complete, here comes the Monsters! A very original series and a theme totally dedicated to monsters. It can be the good, the bad and the morbid. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror movies then this is absolutely for you. Provided you can find this rare gem. <br /> <br /> Even the younger generation will be impressed with part of the episode with its harshness, the indiscriminate use of bloody effects, or the narrative of its power and simplicity. I guarantee, because I'm 23 years old! <br /> <br /> Make sure you do not miss it! <br /> <br /> Although it is a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember ...
