There is not a moment of boredom in Francois Ozon's "Robe d'Ete." It's amazing how much is packed in this short film. While reclining on a deserted beach after a swimming swim, a young gay man is approached by a girl in search of a cigarette light. She invites you to make love in a wooded area near the beach. Coming back to the beach. they think all their clothes have been stolen. She lends him a summer dress to cover her nakedness and asks him to return it the next day. He rides his bicycle back to the holiday cottage dressed as a girl. Your gay partner is sexually excited. The next morning, the young man returns to the sea and says goodbye to the girl whose vacation is over. She suggests that he keep the dress as a souvenir of the summer romance. It's a jolly movie that captures the spirit of seaside summer vacation, but perhaps not for those who are ashamed of nudity or homosexual themes.
