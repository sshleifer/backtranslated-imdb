I saw this series in 1999 on London TV and I was impressed. As another reviewer commented - This is what I would have liked to see when I first watched "Jurassic Park" - Life and death of dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary. The GC is very realistic and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats shown also makes it very educational. <br /> <br /> The series takes everything that is really known about dinosaurs, adds many good ideas about "what could have been" to make what appears to be a series of documentaries. What I missed was a small bar chart constantly in a corner of the screen, moving between "fiction" and "fact" along with the narration and the photos, because you often wonder how much educated guessing is, and how much is pure fantasy <br /> <br /> For some clues about facts and fiction, you have to see the 50 minutes "Making Of" which are not only very educational about the GC process and collect and include the knowledge of paleontologists in series, but that is also very funny (Dinosaurs smoking cigarettes and complaining of animators in CG). <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this series before entering the next Disney Dinosaur movie or watching any Jurassic Park movie (like) again. You will certainly be much more critical of these films. Disney trailers looked especially bad.
