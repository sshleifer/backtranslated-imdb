This is a brilliant movie. The story begins in Romania, where Billy Crystal is an agent who can convince anyone to do anything. There's a very funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and she tells her father, who is rabbi, to eat pork (you, philosophers, may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is primarily a talent scout and is trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After discovering that the entire movie has a terrible crew, he accidentally falls into a small river. Believing he's dead, some huge hands go out to catch him. Later he thinks he's in heaven. He discovers that he is not, but that he is in a monastery. Believing that God has saved him, he becomes a monk, searching for the one who saved him. He later finds a 7-foot 7 man, which he defines as the perfect villain (he also recites Shakespeare!). Watch the movie and find out the rest!
