Strange movie but wonderfully original. Genuinely scary, creepy, and ridiculous in equal measure. The setting of a red brick apartment is a perfect setting for amazing action. The thought of a secret room enclosed in a place like this is good enough, but when the naive couple of lead begins to clean the old bed they find in this room the scene is ready for some classic creeps. The cast is fantastic. Tanya Dempsey can actually chew on some scenes after being underestimated in other Full Moon films. Joe Estevez proves why Brother Martin Sheen is so much bigger in Hollywood - his twisted eyes during the bed-making scene are really hilarious. Charles Band co-produced with Stuart Gordon and this is an exceptional release of Full Moon / Dark Wave. Danny Draven also directed Hell Asylum with Dempsey.
