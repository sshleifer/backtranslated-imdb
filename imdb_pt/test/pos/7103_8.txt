House of Dracula was made at the end of the Universal Terror cycle of the 1940s and I've seen it a few times. <br /> <br /> A mad doctor, Edelman is creating plants for a serum that heals people. Count Dracula arrives for a cure for his vampirism and Lawrence Talbot, then comes to see if he can heal him turn into a werewolf at the full moon. Frankenstein's monster is then discovered and Edelman brings him back to life as the villagers descend to the castle and set him on fire. Talbot, now cured and one of Edelman's female assistants are safe. <br /> <br /> Like many such films, we have a humpbacked assistant and a storm to keep him moving. The cast includes Universal's horror fans Lon Chaney Jr, John Carradine (Frankenstein's House) and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's monster. Also starring Onslow Stevens (Them!), Lionel Atwill (The Vampire Bat) and Martha O'Driscoll. <br /> <br /> House of Dracula is a must see for all the old horror fans out there. Great fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
