I entered "Night of the Hunted" not knowing what to expect. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> It's essentially a mystery / suspense where this girl who can not remember anything is 'rescued' by a guy who happens to be passing by. The two become fast friends and lovers and together, they try to find out what is happening to her. Through some vague flashbacks and dark memories, they eventually reach the bottom and the end is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I really liked the scene of this: a desolate and postmodern Paris is the backdrop. with many gray skies and tall buildings. Very metropolitan. Groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity. <br /> <br /> Surprising was done in 1980; seems a bit ahead of his time. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
