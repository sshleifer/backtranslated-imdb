I first saw "The Knowledge" during a Thames Television marathon at one of the local independent stations in Los Angeles when I was young. I liked it very much along with the UXB danger. <br /> <br /> That a film I saw once more than twenty years ago should look so good in my memory is proof of its originality and the quality of the cast's performances. I searched for a DVD copy here in USA and I did not find any. I finally played and bought a UK DVD on Ebay and was very happy to find out that it does not have a region code. So those of us who would like to see this little gem can get a copy.
