With the exception of the main character, the performance did not convince me, but the story was very good: it is a love affair between a gay party-goer and a young Mormon missionary. As you can imagine, this relationship is quite problematic. The film is very American and as such has some metaphysical nuances to counterbalance its critique of religious intolerance. But some stories are hilarious: one of the main characters asks his gay colleague, "Do you believe in God?" And he replies: "you mean: besides Madonna?" All in all, the film is not one of my all-time favorites, but the script is very good and I really enjoyed it: it's fun and stands up against prejudice and intolerance. I think this is an important message in our times. Since I rated movies I liked least with 9, that's clearly a 10 for me. Some people may find this exaggerated, but I think this movie deserves it.
