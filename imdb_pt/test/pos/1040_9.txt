Has anyone ever found a way to buy copies of this series? I can see that many people have asked, but I do not know if any of them were successful. It's hard to believe that such a good series can not be seen by people today, especially one based on real issues faced by real people during both tense and exciting times in our country. How can this be true and what can we do to change it? As an aside I agree with all the comments that other writers have made about this series on this site. This is a great story about events that everyone should be aware of and know something about today. Many of us watched this series when we were in college or back then. Now we want to share with our children ... but we can not? If this is true, what would be some good written materials that would convey the same information?
