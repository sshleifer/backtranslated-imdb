I really love this movie. I need to get this on DVD. I have 2 copies on VHS, but the quality is so bad that you can not read a joke written about the wing door. I am eternally surprised that Blankfield did almost nothing afterwards. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable. <br /> <br /> The film is plagued by low budget. (An outrageous edition jumps in the middle of the word and was described in "Siskel & Ebert".) But, there are thousands of jokes, visual jokes for subtle references that more than make up for it. I often find myself citing lines (or singing "I have nothing to hide") and, from time to time, I completely describe a scene that matches some conversation. There are at least six scenes that are among my favorite comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> Spectators with no history of cocaine use may miss many jokes. "Here, take it." * Visual drive while waving out the window. * "I said, 'Is this place busy?'" "Cool burn!" Visual chaps, headdress, jockstrap and flippers. "Yes, I am right handed." * "Me me!" says the woman trying to sell 'nads. * "Bernie will love this." "That's my feet, Jack." says the black feet. * "Why should we tell you?" ... "SHE IS NOT SUPERMARKET!" * "Ivy!" at the PA supermarket. * Loading entire shopping cart in ambulance. * etc.
