I'm not Ebert. What I am is a compassion and I have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than for Leland P. Fitzgerald. Sorry if I do not offer a review, but I see nothing but perfection in this movie. I'm sure that many who watch this movie will never see the same things I do, but if you look closely you might see something you did not expect. I read that Leland's character was flawed. It seems to me that who wrote this was not able to see beyond the question that this film presents. I'm sorry for those who do not see the answers that this movie offers. Open your heart more than your mind and you may be able to let this Leland P. Fitzgerald show you a world that really has a meaning. Exceptional story with extraordinary acting. Ryan Gosling deserves to be spoken.
