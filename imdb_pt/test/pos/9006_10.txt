Forever strong is one of those sports movies that you can watch. It reminded me a lot of Remember the Titans, because it included comedy, sadness and just grandiosity. I saw it in a pre-projection and all my friends liked it and easily put it in their 2 best sports films. The acting is great in the movie. Even though it is similar to Remember the Titans, there is something very original about this movie. I feel this is definitely worthy of the Oscars and will receive many awards. Everyone should definitely go see this movie and it's worth its $ 10. I'll have to see it again when I leave because it was fine. I can not say one bad thing about the movie.
