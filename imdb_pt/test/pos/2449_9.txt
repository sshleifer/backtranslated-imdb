I feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie. I actually went through this movie by accident. I was filming another movie on Showtime one night, overnight and this movie came later. So I sat and watched and boy was I impressed. The acting is absolutely superb. Kathy Bates ... who has been my favorite actress since Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes has performed amazingly as a domineering mother who desperately tries to keep her old school values ​​(religion, family) at the risk of alienating her family. Martin Sheen is superb as the "tough" patriarch who is not really in control of anything in his life or family. The only thing I really loved about this movie is how it tells what happens when the heroes come home. It shows the true damage that is done to our soldiers after they fight meaningless wars for political and financial gain. This film surprised me and I feel blessed to have accidentally recorded this movie and seen it. This is a must see for anyone who wants a real drama, this is not too melodramatic and preach, but it pulls your heart like no other
