MINIMUM SPOILERS <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The classic misinterpreted remains one of the finest and personal films of It may seem funny to call a film as beloved as this "misunderstood", but the people seem to remember him mostly because of Jerry Juhl's grumpy script and Paul Williams' knockout tunes. Now, while these things are admittedly great, as is the film's formal playfulness (screenplay, screenplay, etc.), what distinguishes "The Muppet Movie" from the other Muppet films is the serious and melancholy topic walks. through the image. It's a road movie, that's fine, but like most street movies, the pleasure is in getting there, and the achievement of the characters' goals is tempered by the uncertainty and the knowledge that they can never really come back. Throughout the film, we are shown the downside of show business, even before the Muppets have 'made it': Piggy leaves Kermit without a second phone call from his agent, Gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of an artist's life in the road in his haunting "I'll go back there someday" and, worst of all, Kermit is continually tortured and tested by Doc Hopper, who wants him to market his art for the most inopportune purposes. (One can only imagine what Henson would have done with managing his family after his death.) Kermit is agonizing over his choices in the desert talk scene, and the final number of 'Magic Store' asks if everything was worth it , before concluding that it probably does not matter in any way. All this is punctuated with the expected chaos of the Muppets, satires and delightfully horrible jokes, and of course serious things would not work if they were not. But 'The Muppet Movie' is not just another jokefest, as the rest of the Muppet films of diminishing returns would become. No, it's a lovely and gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business, and it's just as effective today as it was 25 years ago. 9.5 out of 10.
