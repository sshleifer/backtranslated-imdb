You know, people who do comedies often forget that it's really good to be scandalous. Well, not this time. Unconditional love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic protagonist ... and it works. Not only does it work fine. Actually, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself, but the main characters were so human, so honest and so real. But is not that what great comedies come from? Do the characters need real feelings, real emotions, and the ability to feel real pain? Well, they do in this movie. Unconditional Love is a movie you should not miss, especially if you need a good laugh, or you're curious to see the psycho dwarf in the red raincoat.
