A film that reveals the discomfort of modern men and women in life when confronted with death. We are beyond mere religious belief in the afterlife, and what's more in any kind of hell or heaven. Religion is pronounced dead. However, humans are more obsessed with death than ever before, especially since we can push them away for a long time. In addition, the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe that we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. This was quite typical of the late twentieth century. Things are changing today, especially when US President Barack Obama himself speaks publicly to journalists about his quest for truth and describes that truth as being, of course, relative, because it is more of a quest than a final end . goal or achievement. The film shows the end of good old metaphysical thinking that was beginning to evolve into an obsession with truth, an obsessive conception that truth was unique and irreversibly attainable. Postmodernism had not yet reached Hollywood, though it seems to have reached the White House today. So some young doctors and medical students decide to die and come back. Technically it is possible, but the result is not surprising. It reactivates old feelings of guilt and frustrations that were buried in the unconscious. One has to do with a drug-addicted father of a Vietnam veteran who commits suicide, one with a boy who was stoned to death by other members of the group, another with a young black girl who was victimized and bullied in elementary school. out of racism, sexism and hatred, if not fear in front of your shyness. It is so naive that you can cry with shame for these highly skilled young adults who behave like babies who are crying over their bottles of sweetened fruit juice. The film is interesting, but something quite different. The setting and filming and every detail or treatment of any detail is baroque, morbid, decadent, in the style of "Death in Venice" or Greenaway, or some other works of art that make friends with the basic enemy that death is. Of course this does not save the movie, but at least it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris University 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Versailles Saint Quentin University in Yvelines, CEGID
