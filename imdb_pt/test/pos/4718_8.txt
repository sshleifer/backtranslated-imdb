It was time for a movie about the situation in an Asian country largely ignored as Myanmar have to be done and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywood's answer. Initially, I thought that Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 insurrection and would add the traditionally Hollywood-style Titanic-type spice between the leading heroine and the Burmese male leader who happens to be an old man. Luckily, none of this was in place - which may also explain why the film was not financially successful. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was honest with God and I was pleased with the accuracy of the events portrayed. . In addition to the fact that filming was done outside of Myanmar in Malaysia and Thailand and I missed the exotic Burmese locations, I could not find much flaw in the film. <br /> <br /> You can not blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions. After all, they are real events of a civil war. The music of Hans Zimmer is definitely the USP of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it. <br /> <br /> I was only one year old in Rangoon (now Yangon) during this tumultuous period. When I heard that a movie was made about my real-life experience, which I was too young to absorb, I had to get the DVD and needless to say, I could hardly have any complaints about it as it's a wonder to me.
