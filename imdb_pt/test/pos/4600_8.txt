Let me start by saying that if you're expecting a subtle mood, you're in the wrong theater. It's low-brow and heavy beating. But he does not want to please his funny bone. He has his sledgehammer off and he has drawn a bill on the side of his head. But do not be afraid. Like movies, this is a very gentle education. Oh, too, heavy with the swear word, but again, Mike Judge, not Fred Rogers. <br /> <br /> Was this movie called 'intelliocracy'? F *** not. The jewel, the essence of Mike Judge is that he has the ability to make people laugh at themselves. Beavis and Butthead were more popular among adolescent boys, the same people they played incessantly. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, I do not think the humor in this movie is directed at super smart. Maybe you're too smart to get it. But he is not aiming at you. He's pointing at his average Joe. And he has a message: Join and, for God's sake, study botany! It's a bit disconnected and the narrator gets a little annoying after a while, but again, this movie is for people who need a lot of narration ;-) It's funny. He has a message he wants to make sure we all understand. <br /> <br /> I question the cast of Luke Wilson in the role of a man with an IQ of 100. Sometimes he can not belittle (what he has, type 104) to the level of his character. Slightly forced sometimes. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Dax Shepard in this. I remember seeing him in Zathura and thinking, "These people look like an idiot." In this movie, he makes a great idiot. Maybe I'm a psychic. <br /> <br /> It took me a while to warm myself up with Maya Rudolph, but I gave her a little room to maneuver. After all, she had to throw the man straight at a whole planet. But once she got a little time on the screen, she made a solid contribution. <br /> <br /> Terry Crews played the same psychotic and aggressive character he's played many times before, but he does make a front-line president, though. <br /> <br /> Another bonus is that the place was virtually empty. Counting my girlfriend and me, there were literally six people in the theater. We could have a barbecue and a mariachi band. So there are no boring people talking, as seems to be the norm in the era of "talk to the tv." <br /> <br /> All in all, a good premise and competent delivery, given the intended goal. . Lots of laughter scattered everywhere. <br /> <br /> What made this movie scary was the fact that when we left the movie, it was as if the movie was still playing. We've seen a lot of idiocy in the people immediately around us, perhaps more apparent by the dose we get into the theater ... <br /> <br /> They're all pods, all of them!
