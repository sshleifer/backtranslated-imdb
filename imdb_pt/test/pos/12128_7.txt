A very accurate representation of the small time crowd life filmed in New Jersey. The story, characters and script are believable, but the acting falls the ball. Still, it pays to watch, especially for the strong pictures, some still with me, although I first saw it 25 years ago. <br /> <br /> A young hood gets closer and starts to do bigger things (tries), but those things keep going wrong, causing the local boss to suspect that his end is being taken away, not a good place to be whether you like your health, or life. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that introduced Joe Pesce. for Martin Scorsese. Also present is that wicked perennial canvas, Frank Vincent. Strong in characterizations and visuals. Confusing sound and a lot of acting is amateur, but a great story.
