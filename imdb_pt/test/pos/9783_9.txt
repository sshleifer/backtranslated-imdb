This movie was great and I was waiting for a long time. When it finally came out, I was very happy and craved a 10 out of 10. It was great and lived up to my potential. The performances were great by adults and most kids. The only bad performance was Milo himself. There was one problem I encountered with this (and others like it) movie. All the characters I wanted to live were being killed. Overall, I give this movie an excellent 9 out of 10. Maybe we should select better people to kill next time, okay?
