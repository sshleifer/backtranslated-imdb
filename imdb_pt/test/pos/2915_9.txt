This is not what you would call a happy tale. The main character titled (Edmund Purdom as the Egyptian) does not take the gallon - although he (?) Evidently gets the word 'last', the main tragic figure (Michael Wilding as the politically myopic pharaoh) tragically ends, and the wrong guy? even if it's Victor Mature, ends up winning all the marbles. Peter Ustinov possibly got the best part (Kafka) and may have stolen some if not most of the film except Jean Simmons as the waitress a bit brighter than the average (Merit) who possibly has more in the film. ball ?? intellectually and spiritually, than all the others together. The thoughtful and pessimistic Sinuhe, the doctor (who is Purdom) is portrayed as a dark, cynical and tortured soul that spends the whole plot. ??? your life, searching for the meaning of "life". (Btw, and to paraphrase John Lennon, 'Life' is what happens while you're making other plans.) Forgive the philosophical lack of depth in the previous parenthetical commentary, but eventually the plot unfolds to reveal just that! <br /> <br /> And speaking philosophically, as if things were not pessimistic enough and negative enough, John Carradine (as the un-named tomb robber) appears in a special part in the middle of the movie that 'Life' basically has no meaning and is only worth living as a poor alternative to eventual eventual disappointment. <br /> <br /> So, here we are with over 200 words and I did not really have a kind word, so why the hell did I rate it so loud? Well, there's a lot of Shakespherian tragedy and a lot of moral worth in it. There are ethical contrasts, true friendships, true and unrequited (almost) love, and - despite the limitations of the production capacity of the 1950s, it is very well (sound) staged, pleasing both eyes and ears, and very well / evenly . Is acting, for the most part, uniformly very good? given that it is a fantasy drama from the 1950s, and the interactions are plausible to the fatal flaws of the characters - who abound, and do justice to the best of Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> Is there any redemption, Sinuhe discovers and hugs his son? played by Tommy Retigg, who, despite Ustinov's best efforts, really needed Lassie to do it. A couple of other "misguided" souls get their desserts only? the Dutch 'alien' Nefer (Bella Darvi) ?? apparently in Egypt with a work-study visa of carnal exploration, which formerly cruelly even ruthlessly rejected Sinuhe - and Princess Baketamon (Gene Tierney as the sister of Pharoah Wilding) who knew a deep and obscure secret about the ancestry of Sinuhe, and then tried to use it to put him against his friend, his brother, the pharaoh? Cool people, huh. <br /> <br /> Purdom's performance is really something to behold. It loads the right corner well enough so that somewhere before the end of the pix you want to hit it, grab it by the lapels and say "look dummy to compose, the glass is not half empty, it's half full! " "and then discover that you are personally disappointed with Horemheb - truly Sinuhe's best friend, (Victor Mature as Pharaoh's Top Soldier) for having a flaw in his character that prevents him from having anything positive. I wonder if the secret of the whole movie is that it reaches very quickly and then sustains the necessary "suspension of disbelief" and soon you become understanding and caring about the characters, caring that they really feel sorry for them and their lost chances of happiness, a happiness that otherwise was not so far out of reach. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why this is no longer on DVD and I hope it will be corrected soon.
