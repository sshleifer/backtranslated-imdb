An opera diva suffers an accident, which leaves the door open for her replacement to take over the role. Betty (Marsillach) is now the star of Beth Mac, but someone hiding in the trenches has an opera planned by him. He takes the kicks from tying Betty, putting needles under her eyes (so she can not close them) and murdering members of the opera company before her eyes. <br /> <br /> "Opera" is certainly one of Argento's bands. more ambitious films such as mixing with Shakespeare's Macbeth, it is clear that the opera presented in the film is Macbeth's version of Giuseppe Verdi, but also Argento, just as Shakespeare uses the crows as omen of death and misfortune. And like the crows that surround the Dunsinane castle, sensing the disappearance of the intriguing Macbeth, the ravens on the OPERA play a key role in the killer's downfall. In addition, as in the old play, the killer acts on the exhortation of his lover. But I do not want to say that OPERA is a remake of The Phantom of the Opera or Macbeth, the similarities are very subtle. It's just a typical Argento masterstroke, and with it he gives this rather basic thriller a vivid shade of Gothic mysticism. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has its drawbacks like the heavy metal soundtrack, with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a bit strange. <br /> <br /> All in all "Opera" is something of an imperfect masterpiece but still good.
