In the desert that Hollywood Productions has become lately, this movie - itself - is truly "MANNA FROM HEAVEN" !!! <br /> <br /> In what could be best described as a "fluffy" film, Approximately 350 years of film experience (alright - about 100 years!) brightly illuminates the screen to tell a story of deception, remorse and redemption over a Catholic family in Buffalo, NY. Truly well-positioned to take your place in the "feel good" genre of film, this small independent film from the Burton Sisters' FIVE SISTERS PRODUCTION COMPANY will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart, while renewing your faith in humanity. <br /> <br /> From the spectacular scenes of the opening scene from Buffalo, NY to the final credits, the film succeeds in telling a story that could have been told by any family, anywhere. However, somehow, this particular family reunion and "family by association" in a small house not described in Buffalo is more than adequate to the project. If you've never been to Buffalo, you'll leave the theater with thoughts of "shuffling" for a visit! Pictures of the sights and surroundings of the city help bring a picturesque and realistic tone to the film - which fits in well with it. The quiet beauty of the "Queen City of the Great Lakes" complements, rather than diminish the story being told. If only more films took advantage of the natural beauty of the "second cities" of that country, instead of fleeing to a studio somewhere, the end results would be far more compelling. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jones' great performances Frank Gorshin, Wendy Malick, Jill Eickenberry and the rest of the cast prove that true talent surpasses Hollywood's "taste of the week" anytime! <br /> <br /> LET'S SEE THIS MOVIE! <br /> <br /> You wandered in the Hollywood desert for a long time!
