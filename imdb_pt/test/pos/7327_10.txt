Yeah, it's "Flipper." But writer / director Alan Shapiro put together a beautiful version. Spectacular photograph above and underwater by "Jaws" veteran Bill Butler and the haunting music of Joel McNeely and Crosby Stills & Nash make this family entertainment truly memorable. Shapiro, whose latest film was unlikely to be "The Crush," shows up once again to be an extremely talented - and versatile filmmaker. For rent!
