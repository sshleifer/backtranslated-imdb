By many accounts, Stu Ungar was not a very nice guy. He spat on traffickers, hardened people to whom he owed money and was verbally abusive. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers may choose to sweeten the man, turning him into a sports hero who would triumph in spite of adversity. But High Roller does not do that. And that's a hard line for hoeing. <br /> <br /> Instead, we have to look very closely to see a man who has never matured passed the scared little boy from the streets of New York, despite all his successes. And the only real approval he gets is from his own death. Very brave (because people do not understand) and very touching (when you do). <br /> <br /> What is also courageous is the use of a Scorsese sensation. "Aha! As a derivative," people will say. Same? But there is practically no violence. And Stuey Loved gangster movies. Maybe the feeling reflects the man Stu and not the director Marty? And if it really is a low budget movie and it looks so good, bravo! <br /> <br /> Finally, the structure of linear flashback. Wow, this is going to be hammered. However, it not only works, works exceptionally well, even for those who do not see the connection to the "Seventh Seal". (Attempt: In SS, Knight plays chess with death: In RH, Stuey says "We can play a hand of cards for, you know" ... Death says "Never very good in cards.") No complicated effects or camera movements. No unstable camera. Nothing fashionable. Solid and solid storytelling. <br /> <br /> Maybe this makes the movie very basic and somehow flawed. But again, the guy too. And that makes it all right. <br /> <br /> 9/10
