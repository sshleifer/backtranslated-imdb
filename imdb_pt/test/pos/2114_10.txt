It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light mood of this year's best family film ... Great Champion. The story of a 12-year-old boy (Buddy) who, with the help of his sister, mother and best friend, is determined to create a champion ox. It's a fantastic journey to the big competition. After Hokey Pokey is crowned, Grand Champion, he is auctioned for $ 775,000. to pay college kids. Buddy discovers that the next time he comes Hokey ... it would be in a bun! The children conspire to steal the prize ox, promising to save him from the barbeque. This is where the fun begins ... Julia Roberts, Larry Mahan, George Straits, Natalie Maines, Steven Bland, Tommy Guy, Tuff Hedeman and so many other stars set the background for all the tricks. You will not believe who actually won the ox at the auction !!! (he looks good on a mustache) The soundtrack is rich in songs by George Strait, Natalie Maines, Willie Nelson and more. Where else can you experience movie stars, country & western stars and rodeo stars .... only in Texas ... only the Grand Champion. <br /> <br /> It's a little "simple" movie that may be the best movie you see this year. The film opens in select cities on Friday, August 27. 2004. Another great film by Rope the Moon and Michaelson Productions is IN THE WHISPER. Keep an eye on the cable networks for this one!
