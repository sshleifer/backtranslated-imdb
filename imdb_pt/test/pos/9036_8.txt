I have described this movie as amazing ... this is true in many ways. The subject's material (the black man accused wrongly), the characters (the people you expect to be stereotypes often show uncharacteristic attitudes during the film), production ... <br /> <br /> All these factors contribute for an unusual movie feeling, especially for his time (1949). The only possible spoilers are the sometimes extravagant dialogue and the occasional high moral stance. <br /> <br /> But if you happen to not be planning on watching a movie, you might find yourself like me - staying up in the middle of the night just to see what happens. <br /> <br />
