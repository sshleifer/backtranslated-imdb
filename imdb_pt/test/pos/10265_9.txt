It could not have come from a different country or a different time. This film simply exudes psychedelia influenced Italian cinema from the late 60's. So, pseudo-serious and sexually free. Sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and auditory pleasure. Besides, we have the lovely Dagmar Lassander, certainly at his best. The eccentric trips take a wild ride and if the games in the middle of the Mimosa at the end seem too much, it is just another charming feature of the time. You would probably share those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and that would certainly bring about a turnaround in the process. It might have been better if Philippe Leroy had not looked so weird with his red hair and twisted facial expression. He does well and has many moments of silence in which Dagmar is joking and he has to show a mixture of love and hate. It's not a common narrative film, but for those who like something different, it certainly is.
