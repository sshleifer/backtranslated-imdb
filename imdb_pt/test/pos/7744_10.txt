"Tempest" is a discursive film, somewhat self-indulgent and uneven. But as Lord Byron, another visitor to Greece, protested against his friend John Murray about his similarly self-indulgent and discursive "Don Juan", "It may be dishonest, but it is not life, is not it?" >> Connections to Shakespeare's "Storm" may seem, as another commentator puts it, to be a bit tenuous. But watch the movie again after rereading "The Tempest", and they will appear much closer. What makes this movie flawed is its uncomfortable mix of direct normal narrative and apparent sudden improvisation, particularly between Cassavetes and Rowland. But to be honest, these scenes are the most striking and thrilling in the film, if it's the hardest to watch. <br /> <br /> The music of this film, composed by Stomu Yamashta, is also ignored. Particularly good is the perfect piece to accompany the afternoon nap, as people, animals and seemingly the entire island collapse to sleep in the hottest part of the afternoon. It's a sublime and representative moment of the best aspect of this movie and the only thing that keeps it a bit unified, the fact that (plus long flashbacks and the ending) is the story of a day on an island, wake up tonight. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'd rather watch this movie a hundred times than see a Hollywood crap of junk once. And, in fact, I've probably watched it dozens of times. Most of the time, I see something that I missed before. <br /> <br /> (Confession: I'm biased.This was the second movie I took to see my Greco-American goddess wife.) <br /> <br /> <br /> Trivia notes about this movie: It was Molly Ringwald's first film, as was Sam Robards'; <br /> <br /> - Actually it was not filmed on an island, but in Gytheion, the southern tip of the remote peninsula of Mani, in the Peloponnese of Greece; <br /> <br /> The primitive special effects (by today's standards) were made by Bran Ferren, who later became head of Disney Imagineering, and was later a consultant to the US intelligence community; <br /> <br /> Paul Mazursky, the director, chose the title of his recent autobiography, "Show Me the Magic," from the script for "Tempest."
