A delight from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Muppets, then I just have to feel sorry for you. This fantastic film is not limited to profiting from the popularity of the Muppets - it is a well-designed and well-written film by itself. It has great music, and it has that melancholic melancholy that has always been present in Jim Henson's creations and is more personified in Kermit the Frog's character. I've always responded to this as a child, and that's what makes Muppets still adorable to me as an adult, when other kids-oriented stuff drives me crazy. <br /> <br /> A great cast of big names appearing in the movies this movie looks like a children's version of "Around the World in 80 Days" except that it's about 80 times better. <br /> <br /> Note: A
