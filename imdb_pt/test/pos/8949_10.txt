This movie is one of the funniest I've seen in years. A movie that deals with death and funerals without being depressing or irreverent. Christopher Walken offers much of the comedy in this charming novel and I could barely breathe for laughing so much. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie, and when it was over, the audience not only applauded, but applauded. . I'm telling all my friends to watch your arrival in the USA. I definitely plan to see you again at the movies and buy it on DVD as soon as it is available.
