After reading previews for this movie I thought it would be a let down, but after I got my region 1 dvd (the DVD was available before the movie hit the UK theaters) I was pleasantly surprised, strong performances from all members of the film Very nice movie cast. The fact that the script is very weak means that you do not get stuck in the story and therefore the repeated display factor is greater. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone <br /> <br />
