It occurred to me while watching "Imaginary Heroes" that any screenwriter who attempted to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing a boy or two in the opening as a way to get their characters to open up and reveal themselves. There must be something in this plot, for it seems that all the other familiar dramas that go down the pike use this device in one way or another ("Paradise" and "Mile of the Moon" are just two of the more recent examples that immediately arise the mind, though one could go back to a golden oldie like "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" to make the point too). It is not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious films to be explored. Far from it. It's just that, like any topic, it can be so used that it just becomes more of a movie cliché, a bit of convenient narrative to kick start and give the characters something to deal with the rest of the time we have Spend with them. The most recent of these works is "Imaginary Heroes," a film that relies heavily on what is one of the earliest and perhaps best known examples of the "family dealing with the death of a child" genre, the Oscar winner "Ordinary People." Like the characters in that previous film, the Travis seem to be on the surface the ideal suburban family, until, on a fateful day, their eldest son, Matt, who is the "golden boy" athlete and thus the girl the eye of his father, kills himself without explanation (a small difference is that the son in "Ordinary People" dies as a result of an accident, not a suicide). It's Matt's younger brother, Tim, who ends up finding the body and takes on the role of the movie's protagonist. Each of the remaining members of the family faces the tragedy in their own way. Matt, who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, becomes increasingly estranged from his father who has virtually ignored him throughout his life and begins to resort to drugs for the outbreak. Ben, the father, is swallowed up by feelings of remorse and guilt, moving away from both his work and his family. His wife, Sandy, is the most complex character in the film, a free-spirited child of the 60s who feels strangely adrift in the role of mother and wife while she supports a basically loveless marriage in barren suburbs. She spends most of the time after the tragedy trying to reconnect with her past smoking marijuana. <br /> <br /> As written and directed by Dan Harris, "Imaginary Heroes" emerges as a wildly unequal movie. For each scene that looks real and authentic, there is one that seems arbitrary and inauthentic. Sometimes Harris would like to understand every possible life situation in his screenplay, an admirable goal, but that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process. Instead of identifying ourselves with the characters and being caught up in trouble, we often find ourselves thinking, "Oh, come now? For teen suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the most important topics covered in this film; the script also addresses drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflict, life-threatening illnesses and even inadvertent gay incest. It's this "everything but the kitchen sink" mentality that robs the film of much of the credibility it needs to really make us care. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that "Imaginary Heroes" is a bad or unrewarding movie. Much of what he has to say about relationships and family values ​​in the twenty-first century is insightful, original, sharp and deep. The main credit for his success goes to actors Emile Hirsch, Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, who present incisive and sensitive performances in their respective roles. It is they who triumph over narrative excesses to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts. Moreover, Harris in his direction reaches an effectively melancholy tone everywhere, but one that is often augmented by a few flashes of daring and extremely necessary boldness. <br /> <br /> "Imaginary heroes" may seem unfocused and derivative in times, but their great performances and subtle mood changes make it a film worthy of being seen.
