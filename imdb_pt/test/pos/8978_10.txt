Charlie's Wilson's War demonstrates, with a veracity, how wars can be futile, especially for people who spend countless hours and finances to fund them. Virtuous presentations and remarkably memorable characters joined a sarcastically sarcastic script that propelled the film, directed by the continuously unpredictable Mike Nichols, to the best of the year. Politics has never been so much fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a Texas congressman who is credited with almost alone, winning the Cold War. Hanging around many drugs, women and whiskey, he also has an unexpected interest in events in Afghanistan and the terrors of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Relying on the help of Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a renegade secret mission specialist of the CIA and Joanne (Julia Roberts), a wealthy socialite, he raises money to supply Afghanistan with the rocket launchers and anti-tank weapons they need to inflict serious damage on the Russian military. . Eventually, by the end of the 1980s, the Cold War would come to an end, and the funds would be immediately cut off, thus removing all aid to the newly reformed country to rebuild and recover. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, although it is expected of the cast more than realized. A large part of this, however, must be attributed to the script, which allows each character to be undeniably well developed and memorable. And a generous help from that credit goes to the novel of the same name, which is hilariously honest. Tom Hanks offers another unparalleled performance as Charlie Wilson, the man who has done so much for many and remains relatively unknown. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Gust, a character who is vividly boffo both in his physicality and his ironic cynicism; the inimitable Hoffman shows once again an excellent range in the characters he portrays. Julia Roberts is perhaps the only weak link in the film, with its snobby, generic character and not too subtle accent. And then there's Wilson's jailbait squad of young secretaries running to keep him happy. Led by the ever-enchanting Amy Adams, each supporting role has its joyous moments. Defeating the Soviet Union was not an easy task, especially considering the many conflicting goals among the various political leaders. "Why is Congress saying one thing and doing nothing?" an unhappy politician questions. "Tradition chiefly," Wilson returns. Everyone seems to want the Cold War to end, but a blind eye is being turned to the atrocities that occur in Afghanistan. It takes a trip to the refugee camps in Pakistan to motivate Wilson, as well as with his main financial source, Doc Long (Ned Beatty). Wilson uses strategic ties with committees to increase arms financing in Afghanistan from $ 5 million to $ 10 million with a simple command, but the president of Pakistan mocks the idea of ​​winning a war for such a trivial value. At the end of Wilson's campaign, $ 1 billion is sent to the Mujahedin to shoot down Russian helicopters - the first step to victory, as Wilson predicted. Beyond the scope of the film, unresolved turbulence in Afghanistan has led to additional, less ignorable problems that Wilson supposedly predicted. <br /> <br /> During the course of the Charlie Wilson War, the main characters travel from the United States to Pakistan to Afghanistan to Jerusalem to Egypt, but wherever they go, sarcasm always follows. There is an astounding amount of comedy in the film, considering that political tones are usually serious. Hoffman provides jokes with almost every exchange of dialogue, as does Hanks, with his naturally witty ideals of chasing women. An early scene with Gust being continually led out of Wilson's office as he tries to straighten out a legal issue with his legacy of gorgeous girls ("You can teach them to type, but you can not teach them how to create breasts." ") reminds me of a roulette routine of the Marx Brothers. With the press focusing on drug claims against Wilson, rather than the important issues of the Cold War, and the conflicting desire of its budget authorities and of course, that by the end of the film, politicians are still oblivious to what is really necessary.And since the script is so insightful and insightful, some audience members may not be able to keep up with all the intensive dialogue events. demonstrated by politicians who ignore the difference between Pakistan and Afghanistan, is essentially another argument to support Charlie Wilson's argument. <br /> <br /> Mike Massie
