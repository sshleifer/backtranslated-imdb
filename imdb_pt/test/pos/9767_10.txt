I remember watching this series eagerly and being so disappointed when it came to an end. Over the years since then, I've tried to figure out if I could get a copy of it in any video or d.v.d., without success. However, I was delighted to find this site in detail, only to be disappointed again at the time of purchase, that the available videos will not be played on English recorders! This production was so marvelous, being absolutely correct with the novel of Nevil Shute, taking the plot to the end of the war, with the subsequent life of Joe and Jean together - absolutely wonderful - and I just wanted to be able to see it again, since is the original screening, there were no repetitions on British television.
