I am a happily married 49-year-old woman who just happens to love this movie to death. Geena Davis' character is strong, smart and kick ass ........... .... I thought she did an excellent (that's a euphemism) work in this movie . <br /> <br /> I'm not very big in action movies, but I thought it was soooo sexy and fun. <BR> She is my alter-ego ............. when she starts putting the rifle together in the old hotel room ......... ... ......... I got goose bumps ............... she did it like she knew what she was doing .......... .. this is one of my MANY favorite parts in this movie ........ <br /> <br /> I think she deserved an Oscar for her performances and physical roles ........ < I will have 'CHARLY' tattooed on my back .............. I am one of those girls who will NEVER BE A VICTIM ......... ............. I am like her ............... (shhhhhhhhhhhhhh secretly ........ and it is not that oh so sexy ?)
