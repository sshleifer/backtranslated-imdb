I was extraordinarily impressed with this movie. It's one of the best sports movies I've ever seen. The visuals of this film are excellent. I love the sequences in which the camera tracks the ball as it flies through the air or into the glass. The film moves well, offering emotion and drama. The cinematography was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Performance performances are great. I was surprised at the young Shia LaBeouf. He does well in that role. Stephen Dillane is also good as the thoughtful Harry Vardon. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth and Elias Koteas offer adequate support. The movie is thrilling and entertaining and for the first time in my life it really made me want to attend a golf tournament.
