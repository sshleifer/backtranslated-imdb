Let's suspend the belief for a moment and let's stop pretending that we could, we could or should know "how it is" or "should be" in space. Human knowledge in this area is probably primitive, since, say, the maps of the average age are compared to today's satellite maps, so we have no clue. 2 considering that this is "just" a docu-simulation of BBC TV, it gets a lot better than many big-budget Hollywood blockbusters, and that's just amazing. 3 in all, a spectacle worthy of being observed, for it portrays the improved and fictionalized CGI account of what we know of the solar system hitherto. 4 Probably fictionalizing and CGI-ing the whole thing is the only way to make it acceptable to a large audience. Have you ever watched clips of REAL space missions and REAL space probes? The quality is usually medium to poor and the comparison would be between looking at a chest x-ray (and what it talks about the human body) and comparing it to a cybernetic cyborg movie ... which would be the most fun? However, the chest X-ray is real, while the cyborg film is only fiction in SFX. 5 actors do a good job. None I'll tell my grandchildren about, but very fair for being a simulation of the BBC.
