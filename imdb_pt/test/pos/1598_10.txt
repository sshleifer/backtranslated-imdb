His music, especially what we hear here, is very slow. Around the time of Bach's death, composers were developing ways to make music progress at a slower, slower pace: over a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote pieces that are as slow as possible for the song to arrive. -Of course, one can cheat by writing a 4/4 march and then specifying a tempo of, say, semiquaver = 1, but that time would not be the correct time. Wagner and Mahler wrote music that is played CORRECTLY in the rhythm of a snail. Since slowness in no sense seems too slow, the "snail's rhythm" is the wrong expression. One critic wrote of a famous Wagner conductor: "He does not beat time, he beats eternity." As far as I know, that was a compliment. <br /> <br /> I have the impression that in the mid-1970s the directors discovered how to make the slower films: "Death in Venice" and "Solyaris". On the one hand, "Solyaris" crosses the line, or some line, and becomes soporific; "Death in Venice" is exciting from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Another way to cheat with music, by the way, is to write something that does not really have a rhythm. <br /> <br /> This song seems slow , but in fact it's not just music, as many movies seem slow because they have no rhythm and form. "Death in Venice" is not one of them. Beautiful in every respect, it will remind you of timelessness and lack of context of quality.You do not need theoretical knowledge to respond to the domain of Visconti, as you do to respond to the incompetence of a smaller director.It's a great job.
