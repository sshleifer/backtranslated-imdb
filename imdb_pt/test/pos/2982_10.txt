Michelle, Anic√©e Alvina, was so cool and I really fell in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. Elton's "reprise of the seasons" and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever ... Please, if you know where I could find a VHS movie, email me !! My 26 year old husband and I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend and still remains. I think we both cried our eyes. I think we were possibly attracted to the film by Elton John's song, but we were driven by the teen angst of it all. Paul and Michelle were just about our ages when we saw the movie- very easy to identify with !! It's wonderful to hear that Sean is doing well, I'm also in the "helping professions" (an RN). I thought his performance was good and very believable. "Michelle" looked very sweet, fragile and vulnerable. I think the main theme is that if they did not have to deal with the "real world," they could be happy and stay in love. How many times did we all just want to have a "Calgon Moment". If we all had no external concerns and could deal with our "basic needs," this could be a little easier. I have a 15 year old daughter and would not have a problem with her watching this movie .. Children see much worse these days that this is very tame. For those of you who are trying to locate the CD my husband (a big fan of Elton John) was able to get a set of 2 CDs that came out in 1992. He is called the "Elton John-rare Masters" studios of Polygram. This has all the songs of friends, as well as many others. As far as we know, this is the only CD with the song "Friends". We also had the LP years ago and were happy to find the CD. Good luck. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the theme "young love". I just wish it was on DVD now !!
