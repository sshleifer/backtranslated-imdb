Shtrafbat is the story that only the Russians could tell about World War II. The biggest front of the whole conflict was, ironically, the less apparent theme on the silver screen after the war. While the Western Allies' war effort was portrayed in almost every detail and mode possible, the East was left out or the work was left for only a few old propaganda films with little more than historical footage worth. <br /> <br /> There is no chance that Shtrafbat can compete with the Band of Brothers in every detail, but you also do not want to look at the screen by examining small visual effects in mind. That the soldiers are Russian is reason enough to forgive the less captivating battle scenes and you can focus on the story which is more interesting. So much difference was the war on the eastern front, and the nature of the Russian army, that you may want people to produce more dramatizations of other fronts and armies. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat is not a perfect way, but it has some rare specialties that increase the overall rating. It tends to end the myths people have about World War II, the real heroes were the Russians, not their leaders, who sent them to missions where they could only die. Another major failure of the myth is that it introduces the enemy, who does not take his weapon, as an equal human being - a breakthrough that has been difficult to attempt in many acclaimed films as well. Shtrafbat shows how the war on the Eastern Front was a war of survival and how the shock of isms crushes people into dust.
