The set up overlong of the previous week paid off in unmistakable terms with an episode that hit the heights. There was a certain taste of deus ex machina in the resolution of the cliffhanger, but it was a good start to it all. As is now common with this Doctor the moral, ethical, and emotional considerations of his actions were the center stage. They were always present in the classic series, but they were a minor issue, to be covered up when the Doctor was in the heat of battle. This regeneration even apologizes to a cyber man during the battle! This episode finally shows Mickey embracing the heroic side that had been suggested in previous episodes. His journey from zero to hero is complete and has been totally convincing. With fright, humor and scenes that brought a lump in the throat, this episode had everything. After much consideration, I can finally say that the new series improves the classic series in every respect. Coming from a whovian die you can not get better recommendation than that.
