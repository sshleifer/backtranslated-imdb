I had never seen a film by John Cassavetes until two years ago, when I first saw the Chinese in a Berlin cinema, which I found interesting, to put diplomatically but not so special, I immediately wanted to see more of your work. Since then, I have tried - with an emphasis on trying - to see his other work, SHADOWS in particular. I must admit, it took me a while before I really enjoyed the movie. At first, the unpolished, crude, improvised way that Cassavetes was filmed took me aside a bit, and I thought of it as an original experiment - absolutely - but flawed and dated. But now, in reviewing, these little imperfections make it look so new, to this day. Shot on a $ 40,000 minimum budget with a six-person team, SHADOWS offers an insight into the tensions and lives of three siblings in an African-American family where two of three siblings, Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), are light-skinned and capable of passing whites. Cassavetes demanded that the actors keep their real names to reflect the real conflicts within the group, but they saw the film as concerned about human problems, unlike those implied with the racial ones. Cassavetes filmed the film in ten minutes and irregular editing, a reaction against the "perfect" values ​​of Hollywood production. Cassavetes 'main inspiration - at least in the cinematographic style of the film - were the Italian neorealists, while professing admiration for Welles' pioneering spirit. The use of amateurs and improvisation may resemble some of the Italian neo-realist directors, but with their soundtrack of Charles Mingus and Shafi Hadi, the film looks very different, very American, unlike anything that has been done before. <br /> <br /> The music with the feathered girls, "I feel like a lollipop" (or something like that) seems light years back to me, ancient history. But no matter how dated it may seem, it still makes a delicious time capsule from the late 50's in New York today. I think this is one of the first films that made aspiring filmmakers realize that they could shoot an independent movie without Hollywood, improvised and with no real budget. Seymour Cassel, who performed and became involved in SHADOWS, states that it was THE NAKED CITY of Jules Dassin (1948) that was the first and inspired everyone, but I think it was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent American filmmakers. Camera Obscura --- 8/10
