(Note: I saw I SELL THE DEAD at the Glasgow International Film Festival on January 20, 2009.) I Seeing the Dead is a dark terror comedy set in late medieval times, and stars Dominic Monaghan (Lost, Lord of the Rings), Ron Pearlman (Hellboy), Larry Fessenden (Session 9) and Angus Scrimm (Phantasm). <br /> <br /> The film begins with the tomb thief Willie Grimes (Fessenden), still indignant and unrepentant, being dragged to the guillotine. and executed. His apprentice and partner in crime Arthur Blake (Monaghan) is locked in the tower waiting his turn, when Father Duffy (Perlman), a priest swilling whiskey with an unhealthy interest in the occult, pays him a visit with the apparent intent of recording the final confession of Blake. It soon becomes apparent, however, that Duffy's main interest is on the more ... supernatural side of Blake's exploits. Most of the plot from here is told in flashback as Monaghan regails Duffy with tales of his macabre career. Initially, Grimes and Blake begin as simple wise-cracking body snatchers, working on the job of the macabre Dr. Quint (Scrimm), an insensitive corrupt anatomist who uses blackmail as an influence on our two anti- heroes, and has an unhealthy taste in his work. The pair have their first encounter with the undead when one night Quint sends them on a mission to a gloomy, moonlit swamp to retrieve a corpse that has been mysteriously buried at a crossroads, seemingly in accordance with some customs old ones. But there is something different about this corpse. This was wrapped in garlic cloves ... and buried with a stake through the heart ... <br /> <br /> After a terrifying encounter, they not only plan a plan to get rid of the intriguing Doctor's. machinations, but they also discover a secret subculture of occultists who pay good money for corpses, and even better money for LIVING SPECIMENS of the undead. This takes our intrepid duo into the underworld of the "ghoul hunter," where they find themselves facing not only vampires, monsters and zombies (and another paranormal entity I'm not going to spoil the surprise for). but also rival hunters of ghosts in the form of the innate and murderous Murphy clan. <br /> <br /> I went into 'Sell the Dead' waiting for a discreet, slightly distracting, low-budget refrigerator. I was not prepared for the incredible imagination, dizzying humor, acting quality, great dialogue, thick atmosphere and sheer personality that makes me sell the dead a strong precocious candidate for my horror movie of the year. <br /> <br /> Except for a few edges, production figures are really fantastic for a low budget movie - it looks like it was made for about $ 20 million, and I was surprised when the director told the audience that was made for much less than half of that (although he was not willing to give exact figures because the film was still being sold to distributors). The "visual" and the tone of the film is a visual comic between Tim Burton and Hammer Horror, with little creepshow-esquire art inserts. The plot is wonderfully surreal, but the idea of ​​a hidden underworld, parallel to everyday life, but which the general population is unable or unwilling to believe, is one that really makes a lot of sense within the context of the film. <br /> <br /> The performance, as you would expect from this cast, is top notch. The characters are surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their well-defined lines with the right amount of expressionless language to make the dialogue hilarious and realistic. Angus Scrimm also performs well in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the kindly fiddler and anatomist Doctor Quinn. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - I loved it. It's been a long time since I had so much fun with a movie. I struggle to find something bad to say about it. Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with for 20, 30, 40 years.
