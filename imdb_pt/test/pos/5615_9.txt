I really enjoyed this movie and I'm not a fan of classical music. The difficult street kid's story of discovering classical music and changing his moods was great to watch, without being sentimental or unbelievable, although some details made me scratch my head (Frankie and his dog can live in the basement of the school without any students or teachers The owner of the school did not think it was important to notify the police about finding a missing child, but let him live in the house. basement indefinitely? :-)). But we can let the unreal details slip away and just enjoy the touching, fun and lightly suspenseful story (for me, anyway) and wonderfully talented kids. <br /> <br /> I loved the scene with the mothers standing shoulder to shoulder on the steps that keep the police from entering school: I doubt they would get away with it nowadays. And I enjoyed the nice touch about the kid Frankie stole by turning his table (though that never really went anywhere), and Frankie's friends helping him in the end. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie for everyone!
