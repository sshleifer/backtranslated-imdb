What a great movie that is. I found him filled with the deliciously unexpected pain of being a single teenager's father. And it is set on a tropical island "paradise" as well. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardeiux brings his special European talent to this story about a divorced father of a teenager. They are vacationing together and she starts to increase the excitement on the island in many unexpected ways. But you will need to watch the movie to see all the hilarious situations that they encounter. <br /> <br /> There are some cult classics that all teens should see. This movie should be added to the list. In addition to Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, the excellent adventure of Bill and Ted, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Animal House, My father, the hero must be required film study. Watch as if you had a teenage daughter and you would be rolling with laughter. Watch your teenage daughter and get ready to be ridiculed for months.
