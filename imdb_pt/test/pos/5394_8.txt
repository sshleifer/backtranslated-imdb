I will not tell anyone what happens in the end, but it did not fit the movie. The rest of the Imaginary Heroes, however, portrayed a realistic family, going through realistic issues such as death, drugs, relationships, and high school. I could swear they were my own family, no joke. Emile Hirsch was completely believable as a teenager struggling with his brother's suicide, and Sigourney Weaver plays a mother trying to keep the remains of her (a little) dysfunctional family together. <br /> <br /> Although this family can take their problems to the extreme, anyone can relate to what passes, be it graduation, meeting expectations or being a parent.
