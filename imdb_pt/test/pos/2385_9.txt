I'm a talent manager. I have been for 15 years now. I discovered a wonderful talent. They have been in movies, commercials, Braodway and television. In my opinion Eddie Monroe was wonderful cast. I love seeing the ability of real people. Not just a name. The actors in this film were very natural and believable. I was very entertained with this movie. I love a movie with a few twists. I also like when at the end of the movie the puzzle is solved. I would still like to know what happened to the large sum of money (when you see the movie you will understand what I am saying.) Do all the mafiosi seem real ?? I would like to see this movie on the big screen. The footage was recorded very well. The setting for New York was New York that I know. Have a happy 2006 and get this movie to the awards.
