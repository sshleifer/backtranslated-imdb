I really did not think this movie was bad. Of course, the detective sort of sucked on what he did, and he usually ran into Captain Howdy by accident, but he did the job. Captain Howdy himself was quite scary. The makeup artist did a great job. I really enjoyed watching Dee dressed all geeky. I laughed so hard when I saw that. I personally do not see how anyone can come across a crap like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and call it a great movie, and then watch Strangeland, which is more disturbing because a lot of it can actually happen with the internet being so popular bad . I personally think the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a bunch of crap. Probably one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. I liked Strangeland. It was a very disturbing movie because almost everything happens.
