This movie is complex and interesting in many ways. It is a multitude of subjects about emotion and taboos. Sex and love. The emotional abuse of men, the physical abuse of women by men, the sexual abuse of children, the new approach to religion in real life, and all connected to a very crude and powerful blues music. <br /> <br /> I promise if you will during the first 20 minutes, you will find the tie and the improvement of all the characters. And the end will be more enjoyable than you can expect. The music is great, the writing is powerful and everyone's performance was brilliant. <br /> <br /> And the DVD has great features, including Samuel Jackson's history of learning to play guitar and feel the blues. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for kids and I even notice parents of teenagers.
