This is the best 3D experience Disney has in its animal parks. This is certainly better than the original 60's movie that was in its place, it's better than "Honey I Shrunk The Audience" (and much more fun), just sizzling with MuppetVision's 3-D movie at Disney-MGM and can even beat the original "Movie Experience" 3-D Captain EO. This movie revives some of Disney's greatest musical hits, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid and others, and brought a smile to my face throughout the show. This is a totally kid-friendly movie too, unlike "Honey ..." and has more effects than the spectacular "MuppetVision"
