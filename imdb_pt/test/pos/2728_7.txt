As everyone already knows, 15 Park Avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her half sister. <br /> <br /> The manifestation of schizophrenia is still seen as a disease that many people feel may disappear if ignored. There are also those who, however appearing to appear in the film, feel that the disease manifests itself as the result of some kind of supernatural influence. I think Ms. Sen deserves a lot of praise for "15 Park Avenue." She did a good turnaround, not only to the general public, but also to those dealing with schizophrenics ... relatives, social workers, psychoanalysts. The film really helps to dispel many myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. I have been told that the film is largely based on your own personal experiences with a person very close to it, who suffers with this mental affliction. In this sense, I am sure that nothing of what has been shown is out of proportion ... on the contrary, it is a true representation of the facts. <br /> <br /> The performances are good, the whole, as can be expected. Konkona Sen Sharma, Shabana Azmi and, of course, Rahul Bose, are actually very good. They emerge as very "real" characters ... credible enough that someone can identify with them at times. People may find me very weird, but I think there are times when we can also identify with Meethi! I suppose we all have a trace of "insanity" inside us ... maybe more than others. These are the people who are chosen. After all, do not we all have our fantasies and secret dreams? Impossible sometimes? Would we be called "out of our rockers" if people could glimpse these areas of our mind? A person with low self-esteem would be considered schizophrenic for running away from the company ... preferring to live in a world of their own, because that is the only space where there is a sense of security? <Br /> <br /> Konkona, like Meethi, is excellent !! Her performance is so easy ... she lives her part. It showed the ability to lead the audience to forget the division between reality and acting! A case in point is the part where she is distressed in the scene, shown on TV, of Saddam Hussein's prison. Her reaction seems so uninhibited and intense ... as if she were really heartbroken in this tragedy! His Indian English brand is also so spontaneous and natural. <br /> <br /> However, the same can not be said by at least a couple of other actors. Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman, splendid actors, seem uncomfortable when they deliver their dialogue in English. Their diction is less than perfect ... affected and affected, the fact that they are making a supreme effort, becomes more than apparent. His delivery of dialogue is shocking and tends to break the smooth flow of unfolding the tale. <br /> <br /> The brutal rape of Meethi (Konkona), seems somewhat unnecessary. Any other incident would have been enough, I feel. The point here is that something triggers the extreme manifestation of the disease. As the psychiatrist explains, one can not, with any modality of conviction or certainty, say that the rape incident was instrumental in bringing the latent propensity for schizophrenia to the foreground. So why are we subject to the scene where the Meethi is bleeding and unconscious. Ms. Sen was trying to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who resort to violence to remain in power? If so, then the rape scene is justified, but not strictly in the context of the movie's main body. <br /> <br /> The ending seems a bit abrupt. Should the public find a solution? Where does the Meethi disappear? Ms. Sen wants us to feel that perhaps what the psychiatrist says about the reality of who is most real and therefore credible, is true? In other words, is she trying to say that we are not without prejudice in judging who is on this side of the fine line between sanity and insanity? I'm not that sure. <br /> <br /> A thought-provoking movie in general and worth seeing. However, if you are the kind of person who likes to have things cleaned and tidy ... everything is cut and dried, with a waterproof solution for every issue that comes up ... this movie is clearly not for you!
