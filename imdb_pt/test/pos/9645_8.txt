You may say that this is the director's first offer (which he also wrote), but you can also see the potential that this guy has. This is obviously a low-budget movie in the spirit of Boondock Saints. Of course Boondock Saints came out a few years after that, so you can see this as a diamond that needs some glaze. The acting was good - whether you're looking for DeNiro or Michael Madsen in a crime drama, remember that these are young, playing young people trying to be criminals. They will not be "super cool" (tm) like some of the veterans. I'd love to see Justin Pagel (Joe - the main character) make more movies - he was great at it. Good movie - 3 stars out of 5.
