The crafty charm of Errol Flynn really shines in this fun and exciting biography of the famous (and some would say infamous) General Custer, who follows his career from his first day in West Point, through the Civil War and west to the battle in the Little Big Horn , all the while beating head with rival Arthur Kennedy and dating the beautiful Olivia de Havilland. <br /> <br /> Some would say that Flynn, who does a great and extravagant performance like the general, is basically playing himself by playing Custer! <br /> <br /> A prodigious production (which should have been in Technicolor) well directed by Raoul Walsh, presents some truly well-staged battle sequences. In addition, it is a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse. The previous year, Flynn did Jeb Stuart opposite George Ruster's Custer, on Santa Fe Trail (also with de Havilland), another action packed event. Warner Brothers production designed to make you fail in history class!
