After his previous film "Videodrome", which definitely shows similarities to this film, director David Cronenberg again ventures into the world of virtual reality, where truth and fiction mingle. Virtual reality is taken to another level. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a highly original film that is well directed and staged, but above all very well written. The film features a fascination and a well thought-out concept, which is very much executed by director David Cronenberg. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a film that knows how to deceive you constantly. Just when you thought you figured things out, another surprise awaits you just around the corner. Things are never as you think they are, especially when the line between truth and fiction is explored. You never really know what the reality is and what the game world is, until the end. It makes the characters and events very unpredictable and also provides the movie with a great ending that will leave you thinking even more. <br /> <br /> The film has a perfect kind of game narrative, especially with its character. appearances and their intriguing events. They need to complete a certain step or task before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is. <br /> <br /> The film knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism, without ever exaggerating in either. The narrative keeps the film as simple as possible, although, of course, the film is not always so simple to follow because of its events, dialogues and unusual environments. <br /> <br /> The film is not just weird. I was really surprised to see that "Videodrome" has a higher rating here, I thought it is a much more inaccessible and "strange" movie. The film is still fun and has a good fast pace. It never lets the film get caught up in its most philosophical moments and deeper meanings. It also makes this movie perfectly watchable for people who do not normally watch this type of movies. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful, with subtle and effective special effects, a great look, which also gives the movie a certain feeling of 'game' required. <br /> <br /> The film is well released, with Jude Law in a role you do not often see, that of a timid and insecure person. Again, it shows how Law really is versatile as an actor is and that he is much more than just another handsome little face of Hollywood. Jennifer Jason Leigh also was a great female protagonist. She has never played much in big productions in big productions, but with this film she shows why she was always considered a big movie star. The film also features some other well-known actors in much smaller roles, such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe. <br /> <br /> A highly original movie that is worth watching, especially if you've seen "Videodrome" before. <br /> <br /> 8/10
