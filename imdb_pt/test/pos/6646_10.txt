Bergman's Skammen is one of the most realistic representations of the war ever filmed. This is not an action movie, by any means, although the pace is faster and there is more action than in any other Bergman movie. Nor is this a romanticizing of war or patriotism, unlike most war films. In fact, the brave realism and deliberate ambiguity of the character's loyalties have a very contemporary feel. <br /> <br /> Skammen is a darkly illuminated movie, which must be watched at night so as to let it work, it is magical. . Many of the effects are transmitted indirectly, but so efficiently that some scenes compete in intensity with an insanely huge contemporary budget film like Saving Private Ryan. Of course the action on Skammen is on a much smaller scale, but it is impressive, nonetheless. While the cinematic style seems contemporary, the film's setting looks timeless and without place. The war-torn countryside and even the still-intact provincial village could be anywhere, anytime. And this film is not so much about specific historical events, with specific names and dates, but about universal human reactions to adversity and chaos. <br /> <br /> The acting in Skammen, though typically impressive by Ullman and Sydow, is not of paramount importance in this film, unlike most other Bergman films. Through much of the film they are spectators, just as we are. Bergman has war imposed on them, and through them in the audience, and his reaction may be what any of our reactions may be. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 10/10
