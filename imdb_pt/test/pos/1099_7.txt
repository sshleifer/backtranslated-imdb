This was a good movie. It had an interesting storyline, which ran nicely in the back of the movie. The tangle kind of reminded me of the City of God. But this is done in a more enjoyable way in comparison. It had what I really loved: a touch of surrealism. Some very interesting cinematographies (through the wooden camera) I'm not sure if it was culturally correct, but definitely broadens the view of South Africa. The actors were good (for beginners, most of them anyway), I especially liked of the character Estelle, which made this movie very enjoyable. What's interesting, though, is that it makes you ask about your own life. Are you really doing what you really love? Either you agree with the norm, the conventionalism around you. Definitely worth watching.
