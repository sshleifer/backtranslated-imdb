My dad worked with secret information on DIA before and he's the one who mentioned this movie to me. When I was a kid I always asked him what would happen if he gave the secrets and recommended this movie. <br /> <br /> In the movie he really puts 2, almost completely different FRIENDS! in a tangle, they never really knew what the outcome would be. The snowman, Daulton really caught me by surprise because the film portrayed him only as a drug dealer who did not know what he was discussing, and in the movie it seemed like he had the worst of it all. The hawk, Chris is just a guy who wanted to express his feelings about the US government in a very radical way. <br /> <br /> For movie lovers, this is a must see !!!
