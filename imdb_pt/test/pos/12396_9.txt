This French study of the disgruntled youngsters (in their twenties, in fact - "adult" but not yet established in the adult world) probably lost the mark by a mile in terms of being a precise representation of the French youth of 1958. (Are not they virtually all adult films made by adults? Those who do not - River's Edge comes to mind - are really rare), but the director and screenwriter Marcel Carne, famous for Les Enfants du Paradis, is also famous . I need an observer of humanity not to provide insightful insight into the essence of these characters. In a way, the details are not important - you could change the details and define this movie today and it would work the same way - but the solitude and insecurity, the superficial passion and the hypocritical rage of the characters are well captured. The young Pierre Brice and Jean-Paul Belmondo are in supporting roles, but leads Jacques Charrier, Laurent Terzieff, Pascale Petit and Andrea Parisy play the roles with subtlety and depth. There is also a good jazz score, which you can get on CD JAZZ IN PARIS - JAZZ & CINEMA VOL. 2. Unlike some who commented on the film, I do not really see the director and screenwriter Meat as a judge of these characters - he seems to be an objective observer to me. Of course, these middle-class characters may look like spoiled people who have nothing to complain about from working-class moviegoers, and I think Carne certainly knows that. For this American viewer (I watched a dubbed version, literally I would say, the version of this entitled THE CHEATERS), the film provides an interesting window to the France of the 1950s. He is also consciously poetic (the scene on the edge, saving the cat, is just one example of this) and has intellectual aspirations in that enchanting way that only French films can do - I can imagine the heavy hand superficially and melodramatically, this kind of material would have been treated by a studio production in the USA, and the sensationalistic, moralistic, and suggestive way that such material would have been handled by US drive-in / holding filmmakers. I feel that Marcel Carne has captured the essence of this period between, say, high school graduation and when, at the age of 30, people have settled into a routine, whatever the routine. Those willing to watch the movie with an open mind and not shoot the many easy targets it offers should find serious and valuable study of people in their twenties. And even if you do not want to do that, you can go to the other room while the movie is playing and just enjoy the great soundtrack with great jazz and instrumental pop from the 50s, including the wonderful original soundtrack of American jazz . the Philharmonic group, including Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz (written "goetz" in credits), Roy Eldridge and Ray Brown.
