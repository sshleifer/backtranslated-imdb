When The Stranger Calls is actually a very good movie. I had never seen the original and then, when I saw it, I thought it was unique. When When A Stranger Calls was announced on television, the trailer revealed the end. Well, I've never seen the trailer, so when I saw this movie, I was surprised at how good it ended up being. I walked by it one day and decided that I would buy it and now I'm lucky because I thought it was a very nice movie that is a cool little movie to own. You're getting a lot of unfair treatment, and if you're interested in this movie, do not listen to all the negativity. Camille Belle is not as bad as an actress, as everyone does on the outside, and she did a great job on this film, so everyone who hates it outdoes themselves, enlightens and really tries to take advantage of this movie for what it is; A fun, wee bopper, popcorn. If you have not seen it, please, it is much nicer than many other slashers being made recently ...
