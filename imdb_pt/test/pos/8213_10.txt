Finally!! Sandra Bullock is a really beautiful woman, but finally I found a movie that she can be an actress! Forget the foreseeable Keanu-fodder of SPEED, forget the predictable Kleenex-fodder from when you were asleep - that's the forehead! <br /> <br /> And she's great! A techno-feminist paper that really works well on the screen, on a subject very close to the bone. The issues raised do not seem exaggerated and the whole experience, aided by an excellent cast of support, generates a couple of hours of relaxation. <br /> <br /> You can never get into another chat. again, I'm actually getting very nervous just writing this review ... er ... bye!
