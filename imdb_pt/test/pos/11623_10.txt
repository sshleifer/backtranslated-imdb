Recently made available on DVD (11/11/08), Severo Pérez's film ... and Terra não o Engoliu (1994) is based on one of the most highly regarded and discussed novels in Chicano literature. Tomás Rivera's work ... and the Earth did not devour him (1972) is still generally recognized by many serious critics and readers as the classic Chicano novel. Originally written in the Spanish feature of southern Texas and also translated into English, Rivera's novel remains an indispensable presence within the Chicano literary landscape. <br /> <br /> Perez's film, originally produced as a highly rated production of American Playhouse PBS, took some time to be released on DVD. One can only think about this subject because its high quality is not a problem. The film and now DVD, however, remains, as far as I know, the only cinematographic adaptation of any Chicano novel and clearly is a tribute to the incredible power of permanence of the Earth. This cinematic version also strikes an exceptionally ingrained nerve which, as sustenance, is both ethnic and universal. Doubts about the Earth may have arisen because it is very "ethnic," very alien to a basic American current, an indie of "foreign" art too, too limited in economic resources. However, in his art version, Perez, in my opinion, connects very effectively, artistically, and creates a well-engraved portrait of a Chicano migrant collectivity that focuses on daily family life. As for a production made with relatively limited economic resources, his charming cinematographic work and haunting music go far beyond his available funding. The simple visualization of the film makes manifest the artistic value of this film (or DVD). <br /> <br /> In a few words, the Earth has not swallowed it portrays in a neo-naturalistic way the situation, the suffering and the suffering. despair of Chicano migrant workers as they follow plantations north from southern Texas to Minnesota in 1952. Local priests bless the overcrowded vehicles of these Chicano workers who can no longer find work in the area and must follow the agricultural trail of the worker migrant to the north. This Chicano collectivity, like the Joads of the depression era, in Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, forms an epic tide, driven by economic necessity, an instinct for survival and anguished despair, and finally by an almost trembling faith . A tribute to these peoples of the earth, a collective hero, the DVD is centered on a focal family and, most especially emblematic, is a young protagonist within the family, a boy, perhaps about twelve. This work also works as a bildungsroman. Ultimately, the sense of identification of the viewer is generated through the experiences, the subjectivity and the struggles of the protagonist. Poverty, alienation, child labor, illness (sunstroke and death in pregnancy), discrimination, school truancy (the boy escapism of the bullies of discrimination is spent lying in a lovely and peaceful cemetery) are put in sight as a matter of fact. also symbolically. Worse still, the problematic conflict between the young man and his mother goes beyond socio-economic and political conflict, into deeper domains of psychology and metaphysics. In a desperate but artistic struggle, the youth fight against their mother, an archetypal Mexican-American traditionalist, representative of the will of God, satisfied with prayer, resignation, consolation and acceptance. Young rebels can not believe in a god who allows such ills and sufferings to be visited on them. How can God be so cruel, he asks, since your little sister is certainly purely innocent, as if she had a serious illness in the fields? At this point, the boy must overcome obstacles even more frightening than poverty and discrimination. Issues now include death, doubt and despair, and lack of meaning. And he has few resources available to him - strength of character, his own willpower, his intelligence, and a powerful instinct for survival. In this desperate but artistically represented struggle, the nameless young man, the central figure, feels the need for his permanence, to achieve a high sense of meaning and, the spectator expects, a renewed and strengthened Vital Force that can serve as an inspiration for Chicanos and others. <br /> <br /> This hard battle makes use of a plot device that has just been touched by the original work to unite the episodic work: migrant workers disappeared of Mexico that leave no vestiges after his death, although this DVD does not Mexicans, but Mexican Americans. A highly existential work: anguish and despair; a mission; a focus on a project; and redemption - all under the auspices of free will, despite deterministic socioeconomic and religious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Perez has a long list of credits, basically as a documentary filmmaker. His many awards are corroborating. Producer Paul Espinosa is also known and has also been honored for his work. The 1994 film, in fact, won and won several awards: first place, the public favorite at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1995; first place at the Cairo Film Festival; and a host of other well-deserved prizes. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film and DVD, Earth, by Perez, is the best Chicano movie ever made.
