I saw this movie at the Lowland Festival (23, 24, August 25) after a friend of mine said that this is a really cool movie about the history of skateboarding. I did not know what to expect from this movie. Was it recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do some cool tricks, or was it a skating documentary? <br /> <br /> So I went in, after waiting for an hour, without any expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a good job on the beginning of skateboarding. It all started with the zephyr team, who is a great group of surfers. This is occurring in an area not so pleasant to live in. At one point, the waves are no longer so good for surfing. So they try something else. to skate was a fact. <br /> <br /> If you were part of the zephyr team back then, you're one of the cool guys / girls. Because many people saw an escape from the place where they were living with the zephyr team. So they were trying all the new tricks now on a skateboard. <br /> <br /> In no time was skateboarding popular again. There were some competitions and a national competition. The zephyr team was participating in several competitions and also national. But what they were doing there skates was unbelievable. But the jury did not know how to judge them now. So they put the whole world of skateboard in his head. <br /> <br /> Anyway I can tell you the rest of the movie / documentary, but you should see this with your own eyes. Because then you can feel the vibe of this movie. This film won a lot of style for me, so I rewarded with 8. Greetings from Gijs and the rest of Holland. See you later.
