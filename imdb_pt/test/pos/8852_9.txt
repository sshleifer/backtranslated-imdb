John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful film is a great fusion of science fiction and horror, adopting the classic subject of body swapping and taking it to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced the original 1951, Carpenter retains the Cold War paranoia and confidence themes as a backdrop of alien control and imminent destruction amid the madness and isolation of the Antarctic scenery. As always, Carpenter's direction is excellent as his camera slides through the lonely world of characters whose habitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of acquiring the body. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter did not restrain himself from the incident, for through some fantastic special effects we are witnesses of some insane moments of surreal blood. However, he never loses contact with the human side of history, because before everything that happens shockingly in front of us, we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion. <br /> <br /> 9/10
