William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Faulkner wrote mainly about life in the South, particularly during the Depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to the screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is a story of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee, to enlist as hundreds of thousands of young people, some who would never return home. Your little brother does not do well. He gets a bus ticket to Memphis with no money to find his brother. Surprisingly, he becomes a soldier of another type, since he also wants to enlist at age 10. Ron Perlman performs an astonishing performance as the military leader who manages and cares for the boy. This short film won an Oscar for Best Short Film Live, which is well deserved. If it were longer, it could compete with the longer films. Everything else like fantasies, art direction and recreation of America's era in 1941 is perfect. The film also shows the devastating war at home, since most Americans survived the Great Depression. Actors and actresses are not known, but perform first-line performances. If Hollywood made more quality movies, I'd probably go to the movies more. If Broadway had more quality shows, I'd go to the theater more.
