I watched the premiere of "Road to Paradise" way back and was shocked by it, dramatic license and all. I lived in New York (Brooklyn) a few years ago and had in mind. Today, given the links with groups like Al-Queda, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, I see it as a warning not recognized by our government. So I put the blame on our bureaucracy and leaders. 9.11.01 was a new tactic to decapitate two of our branches of government and there is no excuse for our government to stop it, period. "Path to Paradise" was just a dramatic view of the 1993 preview, and no one cared. Now, nearly 3,000 deaths later, and years ago, we strive to find a response that takes decades to be resolved.
