I totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who spoiled the movie. After reading the book, being impressed with it, although this is a type of literature that you may not really like (similar to the writing of Hubert Selby), I expected to be shocked, but the effect was more subtle than that. Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress who can convey a multi-layered character. There are many scenes that focus entirely on her and her subtle changes, and I can imagine few actresses who do so well, with so much disrespect for their own reputation or image. There is this coldness, distance, cruelty and at the same time there is this helplessness, hurt and pain. There is one person who is in control and controlled at the same time. This may not be realistic - although when you read the newspaper you read about much worse than that - but there is a truth that is very hard to bear. I think it's a great movie, but I did not enjoy watching it. It's not boring, but there are times when I wish it was over. BTW, your male counterpart is very well-acted too (and I think well chosen, too).
