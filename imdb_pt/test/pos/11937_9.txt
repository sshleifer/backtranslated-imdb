I think Toy Soldiers is a great movie. It is one of the only films that, in addition to some well-known actors, has an unknown cast that can really act. In my opinion, the plot is captivating. It keeps your attention without having a scandalous story that could not happen in real life. I think everyone would enjoy this movie. Sean Astin always seems to choose the perfect movies to show off his talent. He is greatly underestimated and does not receive the recognition he deserves. Other films he's been in other actors have been the spotlight, but this film and Rudy really show him because he's the main character in both. I hope he will someday receive the praise he deserves for his performance. If you want to see a great movie, you need to check out this and if you are a fan of Sean Astin, you definitely will like this movie.
