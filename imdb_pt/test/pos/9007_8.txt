The new voices frighten me! Kuzco does not need to go through any gym to become emperor again! It's the same thing over and over, is not it? This is a kid show, right? Yzma turns Kuzco into something stupid, like an animal. He learns a lesson. IT'S ALL THE SAME THING!!!!! David Spade and John Goodman never came back ... * sniff *! Nothing changes because Disney will not do anything about it. It's probably one of the most retarded shows of all time! The first movie was so much better! Malina is probably the only person I like. Kuzco is so whining! Kronk is retarded! And the Yzma retarded-ER (if it's even a word)! What I meant is ... How could you, Disney ... why?
