I copied my video to the DVD so I can enjoy it whenever I like and makes a very successful (and rare) wedding gift too! This is just an absolutely wonderful adaptation of a much-loved novel. Everything is perfect and has aged surprisingly well. There is always a chance with something so old that it may seem a bit shocking alongside more modern dramas, but "Precious Bane" is more than the self. The acting quality is incredible with Janet McTeer. making a superlative Prudence and a young Clive Owen walking like the taciturn Gideon Sarn. <br /> <br /> I challenge anyone to watch the final sequence without at least sniffing a bit at the sheer romance of it all. It's the perfect movie to watch when it's cold outside and you're snuggled on the couch. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this enough.
