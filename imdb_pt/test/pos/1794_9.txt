In Fassbinder's earlier films, his ideas sometimes outweighed his ability to execute them. He was always a great writer, but it took some time to get his style of camera work and storytelling. The Merchant of the Four Seasons is one of the first Fassbinder films to make great use of colors. , from the bright green pears in the merchant's stand to the bright red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a Fassbinder movie? I would have thought). <br /> <br /> His camera work was getting there too, but it was still quite minimalist. The occasional zooms seem a bit uncomfortable at times and not natural, but again, Fassbinder was still coming out of his purely avant-garde phase. This may be because Michael Ballhaus is not behind the camera, but rather the slightly inferior Dietrich Lohmann. <br /> <br /> Still, this is Fassbinder, and you get your fix here. Broken dreams shown so vividly and inflexibly, to the point of alienating the audience and leading them to a state of depression. Just what the doctor asked for. An early classic that shows remarkable progress compared to its first films released just two years earlier.
