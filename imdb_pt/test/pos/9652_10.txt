This is the best French film of the year! I've seen it twice and found it great both times. I did not find it boring even if it was too long (3 hours). I'm seventeen, so I obviously could not live the events of May 1968 that marked an extremely important turning point in French history, but that does not really matter, as I still really enjoyed the movie. In fact, it's pretty universal: people my parents' age can identify with characters and people my age as well. Garrel seems to understand young people perfectly, the way they think and the complications of love, as well as the loss of illusions about the possibility of changing the world. Maybe it's because the character played by Louis Garrel (his son) is actually representing Philippe Garrel himself. Well, anyway, great movie, no action (have to be honest at that point), but feelings so strong that you can not be indifferent to it. If you are looking for a relaxing Sunday night movie, do not waste time on it, you will be disappointed. But if you like movies, you'll like Les Amants RÃ©guliers, which is a fascinating film, close to those made in the 50's and 60's by Nouvelle Vague artists.
