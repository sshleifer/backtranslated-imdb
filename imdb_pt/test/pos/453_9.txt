As a great Dostoevsky fan, I have always been disappointed by Hollywood's indifferent attempts to enter into Russian romantic aesthetics - for example, Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov. I thought the whole problem was a bad choice, but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and I changed my mind. When he received a clever script to work on, he suddenly came to life and was as noble, sexy, and conflicted as you could possibly want a neurotic Russian cop! So he was a better Dmitri like Major Surov than he was like Dmitri. But this is because the writer Tabori did indeed give Yul, as the Russian Official Conflict, the kind of lines of Russian Officials Conflicts that are worthy of real literature, and which have real meaning and pathetic in them. For example, a proposal for folk music, he says thoughtfully, "You hear a man crying in the dark." And if you listen closely enough, you know what he cries. having heard, tractors and Marxism are not the only things Russian cares about.There is always time for music. "<br /> <br /> Brilliant !!
