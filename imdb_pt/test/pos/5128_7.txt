This is a good family movie with a few laughs. I wish I did not have much of the school supplies as the bully to fill the movie. In addition, it seems a bit easy to save a piece of land from being built. I mean, it flowed very easily. Makes you aware of the wildlife. It had a cute way of presenting the piece of land that the corridor was fast, but a bit too slow for me. Slightly cheesy to me and it reminded me of going back to school. Oh, the DVD is full of goodies, so do not be left out. 7 out of 10 for the movie 10 out 10 for the DVD with the extras that are well worth watching. Well worth your time to see it!
