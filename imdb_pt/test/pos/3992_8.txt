That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What impresses me most is the message that this movie can address to all of you there. And the message is sad. He says it is very difficult to do anything that is incredible or even brilliant without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you may not be able to stand it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems. <br /> <br /> A great film by this wonderful Korean director. Please see if you have a chance.
