Well, there is not much to say about it. But it's very good. Very good job of Softley's board and the film has a good acting cast. The movie plot is also believable and ... hehe good. So good is the main word in this case. I just hope there are more science fiction films. That is why this is pointed out in the crowd. I give 8.5 out of 10
