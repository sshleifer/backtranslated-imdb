While some of the things in Haggard are stupid and unnecessary, the overall package is good. <br /> <br /> Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) trying to recapture Glauren (Jenn Rivell), formerly Ryan. <br /> <br /> The story is followed and developed surprisingly well, it is no wonder and become an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, although it has a side story that does not disrupt the main story. <br /> <br /> And for all Bam fan boys (And girls), there are several sequences of Bam skateboarding, perhaps the weaker aspect of the film. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances, even Don Vito got a larger (but pointless) test. <br /> <br /> If you expect to see a comedy and escape from Bam's madness, stay away from this movie, otherwise take advantage of the time you spend with it if you can find it. There are some really funny scenes in this movie.
