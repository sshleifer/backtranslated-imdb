I was never sure if I liked this documentary or not. It was shown on Channel 4 before a shortened version of Revelations, and is on Revelations videotape before the uncut show. The documentary is basically a friend of Bill's telling how great he's been for an hour with mixed video clips, a bit like a movie trailer you're about to watch. He also features David Letterman crawling like a worm by dumping Bill's show before he dies, the reason? Bill made a joke about how pro-life people should do funerals, and Letterman had pro-life ads. Anyway, look at the video as Revelations is Bill at his best ranting :)
