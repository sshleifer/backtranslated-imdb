I totally agree with the other poster. NEMESIS is one of the best adaptations of Christie with a superlative plot and cast. <br /> <br /> The scene involving Liz Fraser as the murder victim's mother is a study of how to perform at the highest level. This underestimated woman was a favorite of the British films of the 60s, which never achieved great success in American films. See her as a friend of Julie Andrews in 1964. THE AMERICANIZATION OF EMILY. <br /> <br /> All the perfumes in this series have a chance to shine with and without the unmatched Mrs. Hickson, who has never been nominated for an Emmy. for your work Marple. Shame on them! And dig the lesbian CID agents! :)
