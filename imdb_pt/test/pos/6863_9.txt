I was shocked at how good this German version of films like Scream was. Going beyond all modern American endeavors in horror films. <br /> <br /> That's what all these movies do not do. Sympathetic characters, genuine mystery, suspense, graphic assassinations and a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This stylish horror movie is one of the best of its kind to come out in years. German cinema is getting stronger lately. It's a shame most people will not see these movies because they are missing out. It's easily available on DVD, so even if you hate subtitles, I think you should see it. It will be one of the best horror movies you will see all year long.
