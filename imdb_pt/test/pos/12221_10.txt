I bought the full season of Surface. I watched it in 3 days! I was so caught up in the plot, theories and basically everything about this show. The actor who plays Miles is great. Mile's sister, mother and father acted like a real-life family. You can connect on many levels, it's fascinating. <br /> <br /> I think the animals are so wonderful that you can almost connect with them as a parent is for a child. It would be something if a creature of this nature really existed. <br /> <br /> I'm saddened that Surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows. I have so many questions that need to be answered and I hope they can create more or maybe in a book. <br /> <br /> I really love the show. For those who did not watch the Surface, if you like science fiction, you need to watch this !!!!!!!!!!!!!
