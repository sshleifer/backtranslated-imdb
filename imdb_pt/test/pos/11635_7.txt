Mighty Like A Moose is one of the many short films that director Leo McCarey made starring Charley Chase. What a dandy it is! Charlie and his wife undergo plastic surgeries to improve their hideous, unfamiliar appearances. They then meet at a party and fall in love with each other. Now they can not allow each other to find out they are cheating. This is the absurd premise of this frenetic farce. Vivien Oakland, one of the few comic strips that leads to a thriving career long after the silences, is perfect as Charley's long-nosed wife. Charley has a terrible case of seal teeth, which are quickly dispatched to the dentist. After a party is invaded by the police for no other reason, to practice the attacks, Charley and his wife frantically try to avoid themselves at home for fear that the changes in appearances will become known. Both were photographed with their new features at the party. The joy of returning home culminates in Charley trying to teach the lesson of no-good-entry with his wife. The not-good-nick is the new Charley, whom his wife realizes long before Charley teaches a lesson in loyalty. This is one of Charley Chase's best efforts. *** of 4 stars.
