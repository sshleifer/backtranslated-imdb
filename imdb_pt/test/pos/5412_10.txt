Wow. When I went to this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, I had no idea what I was doing. This movie takes you to an emotional roller coaster in the best sense of the term. Sigourney Weaver was better than I've seen her in years; Emile Hirsch was great and Jeff Daniels broke my heart. I can see how this is not going to be everyone's cup of tea as it sometimes deals with some pretty tough things that can happen to the family. Do not get me wrong - it's very funny too - in my performance, the audience burst into applause after laughing again and again. I just think if you're open to examining your own life, Imaginary Heroes will sincerely touch you. I can not wait until it's out in theaters.
