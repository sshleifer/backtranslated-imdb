I saw this movie on September 1, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges of the Heartland Film Festival that exhibits films for the Truly Moving Picture Award. A truly moving portrait "... explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values ​​of life." Heartland gave this award to this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a golfing story in the early twentieth century. At that time it was the game of the "gentlemen" of the upper and rich class, and the workers could only participate being caddies in country clubs. Against this background, this story based on a true story unfolds with a young working class boy facing the golf establishment and the world's greatest golfer, Harry Vardon. <br /> <br /> And the story is inspiring. Against all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of "Holes") begins to compete against the greatest golfers of the US and Great Britain in the 1913 US Open. Francis is ill-prepared and has a son for a caddy. (The caddy is hilarious and motivating and steals every scene in which he appears.) But despite these disadvantages, Francis demonstrates courage, spirit, heroism, and humility in this world-class event. <br /> <br /> And we learned a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the provision of short holes, the hand scoreboard, golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of greens and fairways, and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain. <br /> <br /> This film has stunning cinematic direction and art direction. And without big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable. <br /> <br /> This contributes to the inventory of major sports films in the vein of "Miracle" and "Remember the Titans." <br /> <br /> FYI - There is a website of Truly Moving Pictures, where there is a list of previous winners dating back to 70 years.
