It's a pity that this wonderful bright spot on the small screen had such talent in writers and actors, such a wonderful setting that it was the ultimate escapism for those in a locked, sunless state of land. Many of the actors went on to bigger things ... Another indicator that there was something wonderful, unfortunately lost. I lived in Columbus, Ohio at the time, with my husband's (my ex's) very large family in a choir of 'NO NO!' every time it would be taken over again by a baseball game broadcast. <br /> <br /> Someone who wrote here mentioned that it was against 'Rosanne' ... all my ex and I noticed was that there has always always always been preemption by BASEBALL !!!! Yes, FOX really wasted something wonderful that one and nothing will ever be equal to ~! Thanks for the memories of that.
