Sergei Urusevsky's fabulous cinematography helps make this work astounding. The opening scenes are as if someone is flipping through some master photographer's album, and as the story begins to unfold, we are swept away with the events portrayed and the beautiful look. Everything is well filmed, but there are several whole sequences that are simply stunning. Hard to describe without "spoiling," but suffice to say that one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady has been left behind and her lover's brother is at odds when the sirens groan and the windows shatter. Another superimposes a spiral staircase and a rotating socket of treetops and even develops into a fantasy sequence. Soviet film of the highest level.
