I've seen this movie for many years (along with another of Shepitko's films, Wings) as part of a series of Soviet films in a local movie archive. But none of Shepitko's films have come, as far as I know, to a video or DVD in the United States. The Ascent is a great movie of any standard, with stunning black and white photographs, hypnotic direction, and actors so deep in their roles that you have no notion that they are just giving a performance. Although the period of detail of the Russian resistance to (and collaboration with) German occupation is very revealing, the story is timeless. Two Russian partisans are captured by the Germans, and the interrogation tests their integrity and their courage. I suspect that the reason why it was not released on DVD by the Russians (here comes the spoiler) is that the Jewish intellectual (and not the Russian peasant tough guy) is the supporter who resists both threats and temptation, goes quietly to his death, and sets a heroic example for the villagers.
