I got this movie late at night and never knew what hit me. This was one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen, but it left me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. Alan Rickman is an excellent "villain", but this character outstrips all others. I've never been so affected by a movie! It's been 6 years and I still can not forget "Closet Land".
