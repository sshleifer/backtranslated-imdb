The debut in the direction of Jacques Audiard See how they fall aka Regarde les Hommes Tomber is our old friend, the film with two different stories that gradually converge and end up being the same story after all, simply told of different sides. It is a hairy dog ​​story, with the simpleton of Matthieu Kassovitz following the unlucky Jean Louis Trintignant with a devotion that even strives to kill when he is asked to pay his gambling debts. Meanwhile, in a slightly different period, Jean Yanne's hawker becomes increasingly obsessed with finding the killer who puts his cop friend into a brain-dead coma, his life, income, and relationships gradually dissolve as he it gets closer to its prey. However, while it may offer the perfect setting for a modern neo noir, the film is more surprisingly playful, more interested in character quirks, and a slightly distorted sense of humor (appropriately served by occasional ironic legends and Alexandre Desplat's middle-term ). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is poorly served by one of Region 1's worst DVDs released in recent years: the image quality at Synkronized's. disc is so bad that sometimes you expect to see the heads of the audience in front of the image as a pirate disc.
