On Monday, earlier this week, sometime in July, I happened to be under the influence of the sweet leaf, and I being a horror fan, I wanted to see something scary. I was thinking of The Amityville Horror 2, but I got something better. I was at my friend's house and he had the VHS Evil Ed. Without cover or anything, he did not even see the whole thing, but he told me it was about "A guy who drives a lot and kills a lot of people." Well, this movie was very shocking, I've never seen the real brutal nature of the sadistic violence until this movie, buries Ted Bundy and Ed Gein both! It's very funny too, with references to the trilogy The Evil Dead (plus the Evil Dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie!) The movie is about Edward, an obsessive-compulsive, cool guy who happens to be a publisher of movies. He is then loaned to another department of the building and is sent to the elegant and violent world of Sam Campbell, the department of Splatter and Gore. Sam Campbell, Eddy's new boss, is telling Eddy about the great success in his films, the horrible Loose Limbs series, and he needs Eddy to make the film a little less violent so they can be shown across Europe. Eddy has his regrets soon, as the pictures and scenes that are displayed to him from the lonely suburban house in which he is sent to work, and then, what happens from there is truly a nightmare. Imagine yourself in his place! The acting is great, overdubbing is a bit funny (Sam Campbell's voice is often considered funny, even with the other actors). However, the overdub work was done very well, I give this film a 10/10, and it's a good introduction to the subgenre Gore for Horror. Very good, nightmare, bloody ....... You just have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> quote from the movie: "Where in f ** k is my Beaver rape scene ?!"
