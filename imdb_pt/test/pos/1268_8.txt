There are two things I noticed in this movie. (This is not a spoiler, just an error in the narrative.) When Cole takes Bill to his first B & E, he finds the "box." As Cole finds, he says, "The box. Everybody has a box." A minute later, shortly before dumping the contents on the floor, he says, "In fact, we are very fortunate. You do not see them often." <br /> <br /> Notice # 2 (Spoiler Alert!) <br /> I had to watch the thing three times, I could not figure out a few things. Then I watched the chronological version and saw that they were having flash backs from this last to the previous one during the time changes. So at some points we were actually watching three different times in about 1 min of wall time. <br /> <br /> That was a good thing because I do not know how many more times I could watch it before returning it to Netflix. <br /> Color obsessive.
