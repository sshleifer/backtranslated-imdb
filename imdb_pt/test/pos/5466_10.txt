Excellent story with supperb acting all over the cast. The heat and the perception of whom Joad represents came out of the screen and entered the heart of this spectator. The frustration and tenacity of Mother Magdalene in her quest to do her job to the last breath were also made with excellence by Barbara Hershey. The interweaving of the personalities of Joad and Mother Madalyn grew along the plot with a rising breath in the final scene.
