I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and stories. One exception to this is the film Ramgopal Verma. This is a good movie with great star cast performances. This is must see movie for those who are tired of watching the stupid stories of dance and love. The adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptionally good. You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. Based on the life of Mumbai police officer Daya Naik, this movie deals in a more realistic way. The film plunges into the life of the common man, which he has besides being a specialist in dating. I rate this as one of the best movies of the year
