It looks like an Impressionist movie; if there is such a thing. <br /> <br /> The story is well told, very poetic. the characters well developed and well represented by the performers (or interpreted by the actors :)). <br /> <br /> The film delights in its sumptuous emotions and works well, unless you hate such emotion in the movies - not so in my case. <br /> <br /> It's a very humanist film. <br /> <br /> The landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in and of themselves. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> A good classic for any good movie collection.
