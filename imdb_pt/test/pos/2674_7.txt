As far as Christian cinema is concerned, it is typical. Lacking a mega budget they try their best. Sometimes they fall short of expectations, sometimes they hit the mark. This is almost a success, a great acting can only take a movie so far. A combination of H.P. Lovecraft and Frank Peretti was a good idea. All we needed was a better story and a better character development to make it a great movie. The visuals are not so bad, so hold the demons until the last few minutes help keep the suspense going. at a good pace. I could use a better ending though. It's not a bad premise to have terrorist experiments go awry. Much better than the typical Hollywood treatment of the demonic realm. Maybe someone will finally make "This Dark Gift" as a movie.
