I recently bought this on DVD as I had not heard of it and like Robert Carlyle. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie will not have Hollywood's special effects of success in saying that although the special effects were decent enough And the acting was also good. <br /> <br /> I found the film enjoyable and did not regret buying it. With almost 2 hours in duration, it is the right size for this type of film. Do not expect exciting explosive action from beginning to end, it's a pretty balanced movie with a decent enough storyline!
