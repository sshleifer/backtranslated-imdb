a great romantic comedy. Errol Flynn shows the deft touch of comedy he possessed. a talent that probably shows some of his real pranksters. the comedy written in this movie is excellent. Eleanor Parker does a good job as Flynn's ex-wife whom Errol is trying to regain. Eleanor is also easy on the eyes. the sets exude the glamor and style of 1940, when appropriate. Flynn's comic timing and wit are displayed with full effect here, watch his double takes, his ability to verbally respond to punch with a grumpy comeback or act like a straight man. , and your full credibility and sincerity when necessary, this guy could take action! It's a shame Errol not having the chance to do more roles like this throughout his career, he was multi-talented to the extreme. if you liked "happened one night" with gable and colbert or some of the comedies william powell and myrna loy you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> well rhythmic and lots of laughs. a diamond lost from a movie.
