It is not always true that by mixing the comedians, you will produce laughter. The comics involved have to really like or admire one another, or be willing to put up with each other's moodiness. GO OVER with the Marx Brothers, Buster Keaton wrote the screenplay as a gag man. Groucho did not think much of Keaton's ideas and embarrassed him in a screenplay meeting. And although some of Keaton's jewels still appear in the final film (like the gun that turns into a brush that turns into a gun), the film was one of the weakest the Marx Brothers ever made. best film, but also affected by egos in duel comics, was WC Fields and Mae West in MY LITTLE CHICKADEE, who discarded the script of a series of duels of a liner between the leaders. But the pamphlets were just as funny, so the movie remains a hit. <br /> <br /> But SIX OF A KIND is an example of six comic books that worked well together. The reason is simple: there are actually three comic teams working together: Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, George Burns and Gracie Allan, and W.C. Campos and Alison Skipworth. Ruggles and Boland were paired up in about half a dozen comedies during the 1930s, usually with Boland as a somewhat bossy wife, and Ruggles as a nervous husband. The fields (usually a single act) were paired three times with Skipworth (TILLY AND GUS and IF I HAD THE MILLION were the other two times). Skippy has always figured out how to control or combat his man's robbery activities - the current movie takes action in his own hands with the stolen money being sought (she knows that local sheriff Fields is not the only one to trust that). As for Burns and Allan, they manage to get involved effortlessly with Put on Ruggles and Boland on their car trip across the country. Ruggles quickly realizes that it was a mistake to agree to travel with Gracie - at one point she succeeds in getting him to fall off a cliff, and rocks from a branch. He is relatively impotent when she insists on 1) photographing him on his perch and 2) correcting his grammar. The presence of George and Gracie's gigantic dog ("Ran Tang Tang" is his name) does not make it easy for Charlie and Mary to travel. <br /> <br /> Fields has a few moments of choice. When he insists on yelling at the quartet, he says he's allowed to do it - he's the sheriff! He also explains, during a game of billiards, the unlikely story of how he received his undeserved nickname "Honest John". You have to listen carefully to the tale as it is interrupted with your attempts to play billiards a few times (once you are accidentally hit by a billiard ball), but it shows that there were items that even Fields would have no reason to play. to steal. <br /> <br /> Oh, in the "Summary Line," I mentioned a forgotten actor named Bradley Page - he was the man responsible for the problems that Charley Ruggles is suspected of. Bradley has to have a reason to leave the city to reach the unsuspecting Ruggles and Boland, so he calls his girlfriend. He tells her to call back his work and say that he has to leave town because someone has died. There is a pause as he apparently hears a question from his girlfriend. "ANYONE!", He says - clearly irritated. Although most of the humor in the film is taken by the sextet of artists, Mr.Page ended up having the most unexpectedly entertaining line of the film.
