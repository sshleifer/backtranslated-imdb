Flash Gordon was a first-rate serial. I know there were some bullshit, however, I did not watch for the flaws. Buster Crabbe is Flash Gordon. He was not a trained actor, but he performed very well and convincingly. Jean Rogers is handsome and at 20 years old. old, in my opinion, a good job. Charles Middleton as Emperor Ming, is superb. He was in many other films, quite versatile, he could sing and dance. His interpretation of "Ming The Merciless" on all 3 episodes of Flash Gordon was top notch. The rest of the cast also did a great job. Well, boys and girls, eat popcorn, relax and enjoy. John R. Tracy.
