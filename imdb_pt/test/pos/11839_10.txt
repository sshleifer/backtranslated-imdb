An old and moody baron, happily single, decides to send his three illegitimate children and give them a home in his mansion. To his surprise, he finds himself joining his uninhibited American daughter. Can he find satisfaction in his new role as THE FATHER? <br /> <br /> This 1931 film, in which he gives a robust performance, marked the arrival at MGM of the elderly Sir C. Aubrey Smith, very soon to be one of the most valuable actors of Hollywood. With his big nose and furrowed brows, Sir Aubrey seemed every inch the duke, the general, or the statesman he would do so often. Well-known leader of the British community in Hollywood, Sir Aubrey, would also defend the cricket game in Southern California. He would remain heavily in demand throughout the city's studios until his death in 1948. The main star of the film is Marion Davies. Long remembered today as the mistress of media mogul William Randolph Hearst & the chatelaine of Hearst Castle, the most fabulous residence on the West Coast, she was truly a very talented and beautiful comedian. For a few years, Hearst tried to make her the MGM queen (with his own producer and a huge locker room), but the studio already had several other queens - Dressler, Garbo, Shearer, Crawford - and he eventually changed it. for Warner Bros. Here, Miss. Davies gets a chance to play and clown and his scenes with Sir Aubrey are fun. <br /> <br /> His love interest is played by Ralph Forbes, a young British actor who was beginning to find good movies (THE RAIL OF '98) as the silent days ended. He had all the qualities for great stardom but unfortunately it was not to be. The celebrity would come to Ray Milland, here making one of his first onscreen appearances. Halliwell Hobbes and Doris Lloyd also appear to be at an advantage.
