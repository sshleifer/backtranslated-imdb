This was a wonderful little film that really was creative and entertaining - something you rarely see in movies. The film begins in Russia shortly after the fall of communist rule. As a result, society seems to be in chaos and life still needs to improve now that the old regime is gone. Dirty cities, crime and homelessness still plague the poor residents of St. Petersburg. <br /> <br /> In this scene of desolation and uncertainty comes an idealist music teacher. He is among those without a home and he FINALLY receives a letter from the government telling him that he has a small room in an apartment nearby. When it arrives, the place is a mess, but people seem friendly enough for everyone to have a lovely party. In the middle of the night, they are awakened by an old lady coming out of the giant wardrobe in the living room (I was kind of hoping that Lucy and the other children of THE LION, WITCH and THE WARDROBE would leave, but they did not). t). They are very shocked to do anything at first, but decide to investigate soon. Instead of just being a closet of clothes, the wardrobe opens in Paris! As the apartment residents respond to this magical portal is really intriguing. Some, like the music teacher, are thrilled and amazed. Most of the others are more pragmatic and more concerned about plundering everything from Paris before the door closes once and for all! These Russian thieves are terrible people - greedy, coarse and coarse, but deep - VERY DEEP - are hearts of gold. I like how this is a metaphor for the nation now on the verge of capitalism. At first, they run wild for all they can and only later reveal some depth - but most of the time they act like the guests of THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW! The film has many twists and turns and is both funny and mesmerizing. About the only negative is that due to some harsh language and a nudity scene (though, very funny), this is not a kid's movie. This is a real shame, since with some very minor issues, this could have been a great family movie.
