It took years for cult icon Bruce Campbell to get this project off the ground - but he finally came, he's here - and what a great entertainment this is! Looking at the plot; sounds like two things. A great base for a very silly B movie, and an unashamed excuse for Bruce Campbell for what he does best - Evil Dead II style slapstick humor, and this movie delivers on both aspects. The Man with the Screaming Brain is a comic nonsense throughout the process - but there are really great scenes, and it's almost impossible to get bored with this movie. Bruce Campbell wrote, directs, produces and stars in this film - and despite not being Citizen Kane, it has to be said that this is an achievement for the most famous man to fight by his own hand in a hut in the forest. The plot follows American businessman William Cole on a business trip to Bulgaria with his girlfriend. The trip goes awry, however, when he, his girlfriend and his taxi driver wind up dead; thanks to the same woman. Mad scientist Stacy Keach is on hand to merge Cole and the cab driver's brains into one; and we have a cult movie in our hands. <br /> <br /> The first half hour or so is fun and laughter; but once the main point of the parcel has been executed; the film really catches. Bruce makes the best use of the scenario in all sorts of stupid situations, from changing clothes in a dustbin to deciding (with the driver in his brain) what to eat in a restaurant. The mood is mostly of the assortment of clowning, and anyone who has enjoyed Evil Dead II (who should have been anyone who has seen it) will undoubtedly appreciate that too. It seems Campbell is playing his strengths a little too much with this whole project, but if you tuned in and did not see Bruce doing what he does best, disappointment would happen. Moreover, no disrespect to man; but he was never the actor with the greatest range. Although it's a lot of fun; the movie is not great, because it gets a bit silly sometimes; and there's a whole sub-plot with a robot that I did not like; but overall, The Man With the Screaming Brain is a movie that we, unfortunately, do not see much these days. The film is a B movie, without restrictions; and deserves respect for it, if nothing else.
