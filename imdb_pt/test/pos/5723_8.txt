I've always been fascinated by silent movies. There's something about watching actors and actresses from 100 years ago. Annoyed by today's high-tech special effects, I always try to imagine what it was like to watch a particular movie at the time of its original release. This helps to appreciate the roughness of the early film. "The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ" is a very charming production of Pathe, originally filmed in 1902, but expanded and finally launched in 1905. Imagine a series of famous religious paintings coming to life, separated for title cards, and you'll have a good idea of ​​what that movie looks like. For example, the scene in which Mary and Joseph rest when they are fleeing to Egypt is almost identical to the painting of 1879 by Luc Olivier Merson, "Rest on the Flight to Egypt," to Mary, sitting on the famous Sphinx. While some may find these "living paintings" an unimaginable excuse, I found them very charming and very nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Scenarios and costumes seem to be certain of a theatrical production of the theater. life of Christ. Possibly from and elaborate passion play of the day. The makeup of the cast is very theatrical, so much so that a close-up of Jesus is almost comical. Once again, where others may be bothered by their idiocy, I was quite delighted. <br /> <br /> Having been filmed for a period of 3 years, continuity is not so bad. The biggest flaws are in the casting changes made during that time. The characters of John the Apostle and Jesus of 12 years change in the middle of the scene, to the surprise of the public! <br /> <br /> The best involuntary mood of the movie is in the scene of the Birth of Jesus. The baby LITERALLY appears, as if by magic, in the manger between Mary and Joseph. Perhaps it was simply my state of mind the moment I saw him, but I laughed aloud! If only the birth of the child were so easy !!!! To conclude, the actress who plays Mary seems bored throughout the whole scene (actually, throughout the movie), as if this kind of thing happened every day! Dude, how times have changed! <br /> <br /> As simple as this movie is, compared to today, it really is a wonderful window into the past. I recommend! <br /> <br />
