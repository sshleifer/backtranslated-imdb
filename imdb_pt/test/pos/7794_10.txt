AAA is my favorite movie ... I've seen it several times (I can not remember the count now) and every time I just love ... This is the best film by Raj Kumar Santoshi ... The comedy, dialogues and performance is incredible .. All the actors and actresses have done an excellent job ... You can not stop laughing while watching this movie ... it's just hilarious ... Amir Khan and Salman Khan did a great job .. and act for Paresh Rawal was excellent as always ..... The song is inspired by the old Hindi movies (music of the 60s) and it's good ... the whole cast of the movie did a great job ... <br /> <br /> < > Overall it's a great Indian comedy movie to watch ...
