After a decade of turbulent turmoil, American films have begun to shift course and move their cameras from war-torn battlefields, political corruption, and general social discomfort to the most intimate world of family dysfunction. The toll that selfish Baby Boomers began to conquer in the American family as they grew up and had their own children making themselves felt. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs. Kramer" is one of the first of these dysfunctional. family dramas that would continue to be so popular during the '80s, and is one of the best. Nowadays, it is best known as the movie that won "Apocalypse Now" for the 1979 Oscar for Best Picture, but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana to a marinated chicken breast: they are not even remotely but not Can we enjoy both? Director / writer Robert Benton does not try to do anything extravagant with his film; his strength lies in his performances, especially those of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, playing a divorced couple quarreling childishly and selfishly with their son. The court scene in which they fight in custody, and where each is forced to hurt the other in terrible ways, is devastating and feels authentic. The film does not feature Hoffman's solid father as a hero, or Streep's lost mother as a villain. They are neither good nor bad like people - they are simply bad at getting married. <br /> <br /> The film is strident at the end, but not in a manipulative way. It earns the right to cause sobs. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
