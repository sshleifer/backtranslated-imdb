Dark Harbor is a short-tempered excursion into dark emotional waters that are extremely deep. It's basically a 3-character piece, featuring a fine-layered performance of always great Rickman, with Polly Walker and Norman Reedus (also great) forming the other two sides of this strange triangle. A perfect cable movie at the end of the night, with an amazing ending.
