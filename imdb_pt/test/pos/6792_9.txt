This is a delicious movie. Elizabeth Taylor does a wonderful job, just like Mickey Rooney. The movie just makes you feel happy. It's inspiring, and although some parts are a bit overly sentimental, this is easily forgiven. I could watch this movie again and again. The race at the end is exciting every time I see it. Highly recommend this movie.
