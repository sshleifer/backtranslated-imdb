one of my favorite lines in Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> * We did not finish with you for a long way * So not only did Shylock not get his pound of meat, or the 3,000 or 6,000 or the 36,000 (each of the 6 parts were a duchy) ducats , in a matter of minutes he is ruined by having to lose all his possessions. and his daughter has long since abandoned him. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a dish that is best served cold. but Shylock's attempt at revenge is totally counterproductive. <br /> <br /> I suspect this game was and is popular because it meets the desire we have for justice. but the harsh reality is that the world is engulfed by injustice and most remain. some big names get thrown in jail, but gang punks lose their territory to the "good guys," but in reality, most of the time, it's the other way around. <br /> <br /> but not in this part. the long howls of racism and anti-Semitism forget that it might have been any other marginalized social group that gets the punishment, is that the money lenders of the day were Jewish, and therefore the needs of history put Shylock the Jew on paper. of the villain. <br /> <br /> Merchant of Venice is my third favorite work of Shakespeare, 1 and 2 being Hamlet and Macbeth. this production gives excellent treatment of the moral of the story. the scenes with the suitors are only worth watching. also the embarrassment of the new husbands squirming and minimizing the fact that they let the rings escape so easily that they swore to keep forever. in real life this trick is what spouses often use to remember their better half that the promises MUST mean something and should not be made frivolously. there is a deeper meaning for this piece than just the comedy / drama aspect. it is about loyalty, commitment and love. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting repeatedly.
