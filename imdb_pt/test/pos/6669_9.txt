finally, a movie that deals with the likelihood of alien visits with proper depth and warmth. if we are not alone, I believe that these visitors are too much tourists to take care of us or give those straying gangs of anthropocentric a stable proof of their existence. we would not interfere in the battle rituals of some bustling desert tribe unless we're out playing with our travel insurance, eh? <br /> <br /> Either way, the film portrays the transient cathexis of a tired mind and body by a superior entity. It happens without being spectacular and unrecognized, but we're dealing with a movie here, right? thus, prot hospitalization is only a trigger for the plot. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges acts as always, but spacey is hilarious. the paper seems perfectly suited to him, convincingly and affectionately "crazy." eating bananas in bark, sitting on a tree, giving your doctor a difficult time with speed, wisdom and (most of all!) impressive quotes. they made me think and philosophize for hours already. <br /> <br /> It's an encouraging film, to say the least, and the soundtrack of edward shearmur is simply beautiful. just go and get a copy. Take a ray of light. now.
