History involves ancient demon being cast in a small town on Halloween night. In all my life I've never seen such a tacky movie, but it's so much fun that you can forgive its bad acting, effects, direction and screenplay. This is the best film created for the Halloween season since the original Halloween. And when they introduce Linnea Quigley's character for the first time, she's naked in the shower for about 5 minutes. God, they just can not get any better than that. Run and buy this tape immediately. 5/10
