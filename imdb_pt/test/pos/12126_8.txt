a surprisingly underrated film. very realistic. and authentic. with great dialogue. Being Italian, I can definitely relate to the situations and phrases used. I thought Joe Cortese was great. like a kind of crazy cowboy, and Pesci and Vincent were good too. I liked the actor Criscuolo who played the boss. He was very authentic. I think director Ralph Devito was on his way to great things, but it was cut too soon, maybe because he knew too much. I thought it was great. deserved more airplay and recognition. it was a sleeping movie. great. very good. really had good authenticity. was well done.
