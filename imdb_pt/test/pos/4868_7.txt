Chuck Jones's "Beep Beep" (so named despite the fact that the Road Runner clearly says "Meep Meep") is the second of the exceptionally popular Road Runner series and is a major improvement on its predecessor, the historically important but dull . Furry-ous'. Despite making several quick and predictable jokes, "Beep Beep" also expands the initial design with more ambitious and longer sequences. The main one is a fantastic and prolonged chase through an old mine in which we see the Coyote and the Road Runner represented by two small lights. There's also a funnier joke involving some rocket-propelled skates. 'Beep Beep' also sees a great improvement in the representation of Wile E. Coyote. It not only looks more handsome than its bumpy prototype in "Fast and Furry them," but it also draws audiences to the cartoon with a greater amount of looks at the camera to indicate the brightness of its idea or its imminent fear. pain. Although it's a little slow to go (many time-consuming schematic photos hamper the pace in some of the first gags), since 'Beep Beep' comes in the wake of the mine pit, of course Jones was beginning to deal with it. characters and the greatest possibilities of what he could do with them. There are better Road Runner cartoons than "Beep Beep," but there is a real sense of triumph over this cartoon, as if it were the confirmation that there was a series to be drawn from this scenario.
