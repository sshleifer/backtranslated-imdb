I'd like to tell you a few things before you think about watching this movie. If at any point you thought you saw a good camera job, be prepared to be surprised by this movie. For the record, this movie was made in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something we saw much later in the western world ... about 20 years later. The level of emotions through the film varies greatly: happiness - love-war - despair-joy, but in the end you remain with something unique: the joy of seeing a masterpiece of cinema. The young directors of our time should study more such films and maybe they can create something similar ... even so I think films like this are very difficult to find ... If you saw "I am Cuba", then this film will appeal a lot to you, but if not, be prepared for a unique experience. The Russian directors have something in common: very small budgets, great actors and a joy of creating art ... and yes, they are able to create more masterpieces than the entire western world together. I'm not a big fan of Russia, in fact, I hate everything that is communist, but the film does in this part of the world, manages to create such feelings that are difficult to describe. <br /> <br /> Enjoy. <br /> <br />
