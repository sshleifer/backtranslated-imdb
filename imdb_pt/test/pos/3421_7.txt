POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> It is unlikely anyone will buy a Red Dust DVD without knowing it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile returning to her hometown a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who seeks to escape from prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They certainly could have found an actress who has or can imitate a South African accent; Mrs. Swank makes no attempt to cover her unmistakable American accent. However, she is the only actress known in the movie, and probably would not have been made without her or someone equally known. She does an acceptable job. However, Ejiofer and Muller (pronounced in German with an umlat on the "u") stand out, as well as Jamie Barlett as police chief, responsible for the murder of Mpondo's companion and prison mate. The scenes of torture are shown in brief flashes, but they are vivid and believable. What is not credible is the process of Truth and Reconciliation - except it actually happened. "Red Dust" should be seen only for this reason, because it was and is unbelievable that ANC prisoners could truly forgive the torturers, and this is the closest we are likely to see the lawsuit in action.
