I've been a Rachael fan since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I've seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen because I saw how Oprah got her, and with good reason: she seems very natural and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The setting is attractive, and there are some new ideas (I love the lazy Susan in which the audience sits). There is just enough of a celebrity segment, and it stays away from controversy and debate (there's enough of that on TV during the day). The show is a light break, and she has not strayed from her strength (cooking), which is very good planning. I know there are people who hate her and hate her show; All right, you can not please everyone. And somehow, I think Rachael knows and accepts that. Then just turn the channel; I do not think she would care.
