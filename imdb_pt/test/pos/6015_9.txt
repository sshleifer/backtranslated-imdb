and I think that's a good thing. I was never a fan of Rosalind Russell, although the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bette and I was thrilled to know she was doing it. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the production, I think it was a little less than the original movie. One of my favorite minor characters in the original was Mazeppa with the harsh voice of the blackboard fingering "HEY! It takes so much more than any talent to be a strippah!" and although I lost, I was happy to see that the producers had the courage not to make a carbon copy. <br /> <br /> I also liked the fact that there are large parts of this movie that were filmed as if you were Looking at a stage, it gives you the feeling that you are in the theater, not just in the movies. <br /> <br /> I think the other thing I liked about this production was that there seemed to be a little less repetition. the song "Let me entertain you", which is completely annoying after the fifth time you hear it.
