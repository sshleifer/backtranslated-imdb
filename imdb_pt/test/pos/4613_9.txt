Good sethrp-1 pain, you COMPLETELY missed the point. The girl was only seen briefly specifically because she was the only one who was going to kill herself ... everyone was so engrossed in their own stories that they did not notice it, nor did we. As one of the other students says in the end - we are all so involved in our own problems that we do not realize what is happening to another person. The director himself said that if he had killed one of the others, he would have suggested that his problems were worse than someone else's. The main point of killing Kelly was that she was unnoticed by all of us. Get it now ??
