Video clips are often disregarded in any discussion of movies, with most people considering them a minor art form. While a large majority are just flamboyant clips to announce the latest single from a popular artist, a few truly rise above the rest by becoming works of art by themselves {something directed by Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry is always worth it watch}. Although "art" is not exactly the word I would use to describe Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983), "it is an intensely pleasing hybrid of horror and music, and an outrageously extravagant short film that remains remarkably amiable 25 years later. thirteen-minute video, the longest and most expensive of all time, was directed by John Landis, a filmmaker with whom I'm not very familiar, although 'The Blues Brothers (1980)' is a classic, and I heard that "An American werewolf in London (1981)" is a comedy / horror super fun. If Thriller truly qualifies as a music video will certainly be discussed, given its extensive extent (although Jackson has improved this effort with Ghosts from 1997, at 38 minutes}, and the fact that the title track includes less than half the total execution time. The video begins with a short film within a film while Michael, in a n quiet and well-lit, reveals to his girlfriend (Ola Ray) that he is "different" from the other guys, turning himself into a heinous werewolf. the night clouds open to reveal the full moon. As he supposedly beheaded the unhappy heroine, we came across Michael and his girl in the movies, actually watching this drama unfold in a scary image. When the girl gets scared, they both leave the theater and start going home, when Michael begins to sing the opening lines of his last song, "Thriller." However, when a treasure trove of bloodthirsty zombies emerge from the local cemetery (its macabre entry narrated by Vincent Price), the situation begins to get interesting. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say exactly why 'Thriller' is considered one of the greatest of all video clips. It can not be simply that the song itself is a lot of fun, and Michael Jackson? although he has become the target of the jokes of all comedians for his personality and peculiar deeds ?? There is no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer. Perhaps a decent explanation for the film's popularity is the incredible amount of work that must have taken place; nothing like it had ever been seen before, and still remains a kind of weirdness in the world of video clips. The monster monster makeup effects were created by Rick Baker and are amazingly graphics for a music clip, although everything is done with a good sense of fun. Several moments create a genuinely exciting suspense, successfully capturing the atmosphere of the movies she's parodying (though always with a touch of cheese in the usual formula). Simply put, you'll never see a zombie movie the same way again!
