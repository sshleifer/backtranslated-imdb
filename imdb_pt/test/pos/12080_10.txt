I watched this movie many years ago on TV and recorded it from there, I could never really understand why my mother was upset watching it! It was because I was so young back then. I just sat and watched this movie again I now have 2 kids and I had to try to fight the tears but it did not happen I was crying for most of the movie It's just going to show how different you feel when you have children! Such an amazing family as a truly wonderful heart painful movie! Someone said that about eight people are still living more news, if you are still in contact, I would like to know! Touched by the whole movie!
