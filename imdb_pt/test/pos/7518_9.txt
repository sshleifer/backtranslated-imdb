Anyone who goes to the Manhattan Hospital Center is taking their life in their hands. This includes the Hospital staff. <br /> <br /> I had never seen the Hospital before and was intrigued by the similarity of the characters and situations of the plot with Paddy Chayefsky's other masterpiece, Network. There are elements in George C. Scott's character that have both Al Schumacher and Howard Beale. <br /> <br /> He is the administrator of The Hospital and he is too crazy and can not stand it anymore. He is completely estranged from his wife and children. It takes a Faye Dunaway character in the person of Diana Rigg to get him out of this. A roll in the hay with her and he is shocked back to reality and the fact that he can still contribute in the world. <br /> <br /> But first he has a real problem. Someone is killing hospital staff, four of them in a 48-hour period. And the good part is that their deaths can be attributed in large part to the general incompetence of a medical bureaucracy. That's where comedy comes in. <br /> <br /> There is a real Howard Beale character in the person of Barnard Hughes, Diana Rigg's father. His end is not as dramatic as that of Beale. Back in my working days, it was part of my job to pay medical providers. Some of them can be as large as you will find pictured in the hospital. The satire of the black comedy gave me a real bite. George C. Scott was nominated for Best Actor, but having won and refused to accept the Oscar the previous year by Patton, he was not about to get a second chance. He lost to Gene Hackman for The French Connection. Still, his way of dealing with the role is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to see the Hospital back to the Network and see how many similarities you find.
