We saw this movie in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly exciting experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconciliation process, but, as others wrote, I did not know much about the details of the process. This film has demonstrated the process and growth that can occur when people are able to face their past, understand the events from the points of view of others involved and whine together. Archbishop Tutu and others involved in the development of the T & R process deserve recognition for the understanding of human emotions. Watching this movie gave me hope for the human race. If we can do T & R, we can not destroy ourselves. People will look at T and R as the first step out of human adolescence and toward maturity. Like a movie, of course there were flaws. I did not notice major problems in acting, directing or writing - but for the first time in years I was totally lost in a movie, so maybe I did not realize it. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. The public in Toronto would not give up the stage for the next movie, we had lots of questions and comments for the stars and the director. Tom Hooper, Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor went out onto the sidewalk to continue the conversation. People came just to shake hands and thank you for the movie. That moved us all.
