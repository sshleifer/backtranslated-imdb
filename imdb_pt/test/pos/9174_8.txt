Hitch is a carefree comedy that will entertain you with some great performances. Will Smith turns into a credible performance as a cloak and dagger, which must remain invisible to protect his clients and their profession. Smith was excellent, never forgetting too much. <br /> <br /> The best piece of acting goes to the actor (I do not know the name) playing this accountant who fell in love with this woman who is out of his level. . This actor did a great job in character development while listening to Smith's instructions, but in the end, he just can not stop being who he really is. <br /> <br /> And, in the end, that's the main message of this movie. Be who you are passionate about, and you will be fine. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Will Smith meets this attractive woman and the date doctor tries on her own medicine while he falls in love with woman. I do not know her name, but she was also very good. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a delightful and lightweight movie that is definitely worth seeing.
