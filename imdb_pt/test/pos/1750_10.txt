When HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN, he discovers nothing but bad news for his small insect neighbors in the Lowlands. Can this honest, good-natured grasshopper save his girlfriend, Miss Honey Bee, from the machinations of the evil C. Bagley Beetle - and also lead his friends to a safe new home - before it's too late? <br /> <br /> Although not one of the great animated features (a very new art at the time this movie was created), HOPPITY is a nice movie that should bring pleasure to non-critical viewers. Technically it is well done, with animation of a generally high quality. The main drawback of the movie is that none of the characters actually have a "heart" - they do not get "alive" on the screen the same way Jiminy Cricket did a year earlier on PINOCCHIO. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is unfair to compare the output of Fleischer Studio with that of Disney. Max and Dave Fleischer had their own star to follow; his contribution - and it would be considerable - would be in the realm of the cartoon of a roll. With their series POPEYE and BETTY BOOP, they created alternative realities as viable as those produced by other cartoon studios. HOPPITY was their second full-length animation experiment (after GULLIVER'S TRAVELS in 1939), and from then on they would spend their energies on the animated short film again. In fact, the first of the highly acclaimed SUPERMAN series was already in release. <br /> <br /> The story of HOPPITY owes much to Frank Capra, with his energetic hero against powerful forces of society. In fact, the original title of the movie was MR. BUG GOES TO TOWN, which immediately puts Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart and his Capraesque adventures in mind. <br /> <br /> Jack Mercer, famous as the voice of Popeye, speaks here for two very different characters, old Mr. Bumble and strike the fly. Film experts should be able to capture veteran voice actors Pinto Colvig & Mae Questel, both in uncredited roles. <br /> <br /> The film has some nice songs provided by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, of which "Be My Little Baby" Bumble Bee is the most familiar. "We are the couple in the castle" is a romantic melody that deserves to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the initial animation of the movie, with its sweep of the sky and the past depth of New York's skyline, is obscured behind the opening credits.
