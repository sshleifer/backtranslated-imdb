Of course, before seeing House of Wax, I assumed it would simply be a low-grade second-rate movie following in the footsteps of such films as The Darkness or Amityville Horror. After attending an advanced presentation on my college campus, I can honestly say that the people of the Dark Castle did a great job with the task of making a slasher. <br /> <br /> Beginning with the usual clutches of a teenage horror movie, like the small group of friends who set out on a car trip, going through a strange detour, passing by side roads, finding scary villagers, then of the slow but compelling back-story this movie really strikes a fast clip. Paris Hilton appears in this movie as many already know, but I really have to give it to her for her brave performance. Clearly her acting was not worth an Oscar, but the filmmakers use their looks to the full, squeezing two blatant satires from her, let's say, a less-than-noble media appearance in this film. Hilton also claims the title for the film's biggest death scene, not simply because it was her death scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is packed to the brim with scary moments and cheap scares, but Jaume Serra definitely created suspense and quality tension between the characters. The causes of the horror are partly based on making the public care about the characters, what we do. By doing the usual accumulation followed with a loud noise and pushed camera some other scary moments. These standard film techniques adopted in many films of the past are almost perfect with this film, and provide many good scares. In fact, there is not a slow time after they arrive in the small town where the dreaded Wax House Museum is located. <br /> <br /> This film owes much to many earlier films of this and other genres, though I'm not sure how much came from the original 1953 film of the same title. References to movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacres, Saw, and even Titanic, (see the big death scene of Paris Hilton and you know what I mean) are common, but in the end the reward will leave you scared and satisfied if You're looking for a good scare with a few laughs. It is not bad.
