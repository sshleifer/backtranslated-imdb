I like the previous description of this movie as a living poem. I totally caught it at random on the Movie Channel last night, and I was captivated enough to be with it all the time. There is really only a toally unique voice for the film, a narration poetry that is meaningful without getting lost in pretense. There are also many hilarious moments from Wirey high school times that are rudimentary without being a good mood. It's sad that this movie is low rating. The fact that there are so many 1s makes me think the numbers are cooked - I do not see how anyone could see the film as abysmal. Of course, this is by no means a typical romantic comedy, but it is a very unique point of view of a very unique life, of a man whose own appeal comes from his detachment, a detachment that he must overcome before destroying him. Give this movie a chance. It came from nowhere for me and I feel richer for it.
