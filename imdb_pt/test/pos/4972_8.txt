Brian Keith as Cole Wlikerson and Richard Jaeckel as Wade Matlock are excellent villains. They love to intimidate the locals in the most brutal way possible, and sexually mock any suggestion that there may be a more humane way to achieve their goals. It's a shame that good Glenn Ford gets in his way.
