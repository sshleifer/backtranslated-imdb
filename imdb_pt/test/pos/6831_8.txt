A fairly pleasant kidnapping prank set in New Orleans, but its main fall in my opinion is that it packs a lot of political intrigue and double-crossing, and not enough of the sexy young actors, vibrant color scenes, original cinematic style and biting humor. These aspects combine to give a daring and refreshing cinema, which makes a lot of recent things seem unbearably tedious. Let's hope that SÃ©bastian Gutierrez continues with this talent - he seems like a talent to be taken care of. The group of the film's impractical cheaters are overshadowed by the investigative partnership of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, whose humor is much needed to make the film what it is. The pair pulls their obligatory southerners as well as the Yanks, and it's a delight to hear these two strongholds of British cinema sneaking into each other with the Lethal-Weapon style fluidity ... just a pity that the only scenes they have opportunity to steal are exclusively theirs. Anyway, with a little less politics and authoritarianism (!), The movie would be almost perfect, so I'll give a healthy 8/10 and hopefully some people will remember a little bit better than the box office.
