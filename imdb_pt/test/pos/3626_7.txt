Mystery of the 1930s comedy about "The Crooked Circle," a band of hooded thugs who plotted to plot the murder of someone who had sworn to oppose them. Pleasant but very little noticeable film, the film works simply because the cast led by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both later would appear together in a pair of films of Hildegarde Withers after Edna Mae Oliver abandoned this series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (not the lack of naming). An airy hour's play, the movie does not make much sense with mistaken identity, secret passages, ghostly music and people who are not who they seem. It is the perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or a night view when one is nostalgic for the late show.
