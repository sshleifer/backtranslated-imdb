Even with just $ 6,000 and a cast of part-time actors, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is in my opinion, the next big one and our first taste of Nolan does not contradict this. <br /> <br /> None of the problems that constantly plate and discredit the independent low budget frame haunt Nolan and crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young, but they deliver us and engage us in this story. In all honesty I think Next is Nolan's best script, because that's what he has the most control over. It's a beautifully imagined film. It takes us into a world where we do not feel constrained by budget constraints. Dialogue and atmosphere are bold and intelligent. <br /> <br /> Nolan's trademark method for telling the story of continuity is first applied here and here it is done in a way that launches the complete story for you. With Memento and The Prestige you have to think a little to really get a full sense of genius, but Nolan does not try to confuse people with his movie prototype. We can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist. This method of telling a story is creative and engaging. I'm glad Nolan was so successful about it because his films became more than they could be with this method. The rewards in the Prestige and the Memento would not have been anything exciting if the film was counted in a conventional format. This idea was made with moderate success before, but Nolan actually made it his own. <br /> <br /> The script here is the best of Nolan. I had some doubts about his writing skills, I always imagined that his brother Jonathon was the writing talent, but he proved me wrong with Follow. It's a thought-provoking story that makes interesting observations of people and how they work. Cobb's assessments of theft and how this can lead him to discover what makes people work really sound plausible. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that the camera work gets unstable at times, but it does not take away anything from the story or the acting. <br /> <br /> It follows the first man movie that will embody the 21st century cinematographic production.
