this is about a homicide detective who fights a wealthy young couple who has nothing better to do than plan an intricate murder and cover it up, they seem to fool the police force seemingly at ease. they tease the detective, planting clues and leading them to a wild chase. This one has a decent plot with some good twists at the end of the movie, Sandra Bullock does a good job on this one as a woman on the edge, not sure of herself and fighting her inner demons, she can not keep a man in her life, especially the partners, they seem to continue to leave it for some reason. All in all, this is not a bad movie, it keeps you guessing all the way to the very shocking end.
