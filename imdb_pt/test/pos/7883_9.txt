This is a classic film that dramatizes the suffering of a man who can not adjust to the changes taking place in society and feels increasingly alienated, which leads to violence. Joe is a hard worker, and he's dissatisfied and angry, and all he needs is a pretext to attack, and that's what story is about. Alone, Joe is quiet; along with another person, it becomes lethal. And what makes Joe's character even more chilling is that he totally rationalizes his violence, so for him it's not just bad, it's necessary. For Joe projects his own violent tendencies to those he considers "the enemy" and therefore is considered to be in a war, and in this film, the "generation gap" is portrayed as a war. But it's a war only in Joe's mind, because "the enemy" in this case is in his imagination. No one wants to fight Joe, but Joe feels he needs to defend himself. Although this film was released in 1970, the message is as relevant now as it was at a time when society continues to undergo major changes that lead to the kind of intense alienation that the film effectively dramatizes.
