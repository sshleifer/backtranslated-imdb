If you have ever seen a Bollywood movie, you know they are longer than most movies, due to multiple music and dance routines (each one is more than five minutes long). Fortunately, this one has fewer music and dance routines and fits the length of the "standard" movie. Do not get me wrong, I like Bollywood movies, but they tend to move quickly through the parts of music and dance. I bought this DVD because I'm a fan of Ian Bohen. Although his role was not as great as I expected, he still had a fair amount of time on the screen. And his character was very different from his other roles. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a good movie. Like most Bollywood movies, there is at least one element of controversy / conflict in traditional Indian culture. But true love triumphs over adversity and a happy ending is enjoyed by all.
