The Killing Yard is a great movie, though patchy at times. Morris Chestnut makes a phenomenal effort as a mentally injured prisoner and judicially rejected, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense lawyer is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in the flashback scenes of this film have the ability to put viewers directly in the midst of the events being portrayed. I was not even born when the Attica riot occurred, however, through extensive research, I think "The Killing Yard" makes the story of all just judges. I would definitely recommend this movie to be seen by any educational group or activist as a much needed learning tool.
