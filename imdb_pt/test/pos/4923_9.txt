I watch this movie at the beginning of every summer, and it never ceases to amuse me. Here the jokes are packed in almost every line of dialogue, giving it more impact than the average episode of the Simpsons. Some of the jokes are weak or just make a slight laugh, but others will let it roll and then there are those that stay in your brain ... "The audience is now deaf." <br /> <br /> Video knows it's a video and does not pretend to be anything else. It's easy to sit back and let the mood bombardment begin. A good mix of clowning, pop culture and ironic comedy ensures that there is something for everyone. I was in the sixth year when I first saw this video, and I have to admit I still find it hilarious now that I started college. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch over the summer, much in the way you can watch "It's a Wonderful Life" at Christmas or "Ten Commandments" at Easter / Easter. More than that, it's funny as hell.
