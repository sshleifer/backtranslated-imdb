WARNING: MAY contain some minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> Difficult to say anything bad about this movie except for one thing. <br /> <br /> YOU CAN NOT SEE A LOT MORE !! !! Then again, maybe it's because you have to be home in the morning or at 3 in the morning to pick you up on Fox Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> Too bad, as this is another jewel lost in time, Clifton Webb takes his patented, sour, know-it-all behavior he had perfected as Lynn Belvedere ("Sitting Pretty" and sequels), and turns 'Nature Boy'. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is so. Webb plays Robert Jordan as host of an educational program for Sunday kids that is losing audience participation, and the network tells him he needs to do something about it, or else. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married host does not have children. <br /> <br /> BUMMER !!! But when that happens, the local church pastor needs a leader for an uncontrolled troop of scouts, and he finds a willing victim ... ahhhh 'VOLUNTARY' ... in the army, then Jordan takes the stand. <Br/> <br /> Problem solved, RIGHT ??? <br /> <br /> WRONG !!! Being this a movie, there are other problems. <br /> <br /> For example, it turns out that one of the Boy Scouts is the son of his boss on the TV station, which causes a bit of friction; especially since the boy is overweight, has asthma and also an attitude. <br /> <br /> And he's the most reasonable. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is this Boy Scout, Mike (George Winslow) who wants to be around, being a "stray dog" type. <br /> <br /> As it turns out, the reason is that he has no staff of his own but is taken care of by a relative who does not have much time for him. <br /> <br /> These are things that make your job harder than expected. <br /> <br /> All in all, Webb becomes more sympathetic to children, and not only does he save his program, but he learns a rewarding lesson, and eventually adopts Mike. <br /> <br /> Still a great movie after all these years.
