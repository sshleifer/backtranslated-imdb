One of the two best films of the year. A well-filmed, well-written, well-placed film along with an excellent cast. Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, Anthony Wong Chau Sun, Francis Ng Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Cheung Man Tat) had a great chemistry before the movie and their friendship shows in their performances. Theresa Lee plays her comic role well. (Though it sounds like a female version of Michael Wong, her joke seems to be foreign-born Chinese surrounded by native HKers), and I found myself cheering for groundbreaking explosive scenes, something I have not done since 1 the fan boys took alt.asian-movies and 2. John woo's Hardboiled. Of course the ending was expected, but I feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members. Highly enjoyable
