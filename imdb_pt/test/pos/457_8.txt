I've seen several of Yul Brynner's films - still this is his best performance while the camera captures his emotions closely as he growls, smiles and laughs. Brynner could have been equally imprisoned in Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot, but none of these films captured his range of talents in close-ups like this one. It is sweeping and tempting to watch in every scene. <br /> <br /> Equally fascinating and sexy, without undressing, is Deborah Kerr. The script allows her to exalt a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive - she reprized that type of paper years later in The Night of Iguana. The film does not suggest that she slept with someone to help with the liberation of the group from the clutches of the Russians, in fact she is shown as fleeing from the Russian major (in contrast to Maupassant's story or the story of Isak Denisen). However, the film explodes with the suggestive but real physical allure of Kerr's character. <br /> <br /> Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my opinion, but she is an excellent actress. She puts her soul into dignifying the characters she portrays, which often clashes with the character's spirit. It is this contradiction that makes his roles in The Journey, Quo Vadis and The Night of Iguana memorable. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie unusual? It is not easy in Hollywood to see Russian characters portrayed as good people - Dr. Zhivago was an exception. The novel of a Brynner horse thief was once again a great cinema by Abraham Polonsky, but was never recognized as such because of the intolerance towards leftists in the post McCarthy era. <br /> <br /> The film is also unusual in its cast. French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee - meet Jason Robards Jr and British actor Robert Morley. In many ways, the film is international rather than American. All four are great actors and increase the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Those who have read the works of Maupassant and Denisen will find that the film is not faithful to either work. However, the film can stand alone, since its sanitized version (censored?) Has a dignified charm - provided by the reality of the night that led to the group's release. I think Litvak deserves the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the film's production, as it interwoven pieces of both written short stories (eg the last bus trip and the last kiss) > <br /> But I have a partridge - why does Hollywood never recognize the sources that inspire the stories? Just recently (for example, Insomnia) the original works began to be mentioned prominently in the credits.
