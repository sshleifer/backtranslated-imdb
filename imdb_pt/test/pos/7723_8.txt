This film is a fairly fair adaptation of Prosper Merimee's novel. In the novel Merimee himself is a character, Don José is from Navarre (North of Spain, and historically an area of ​​the Basque Country, they can speak the Basque language). They are in Seville (Andalucia, Southern Spain) and they only speak Spanish with an Andalusian accent, they do not speak Basque at all, but Carmen explains to Don José that she was living in Navarre. You may believe it or not, anyway this is the book version, so you can not be critical of the movie about it, be with the book! You have to note are different the novel of Merimee and the opera by Bizet, and this film is an adaptation of the novel, anyway in the opera Don Jose is still Spanish from Navarre, he is never French. Why do so many people still think Don Jose is French? I do not know, but I think because the novel and the opera are in French, despite supposedly being in Spanish. <br /> <br /> The only important difference between the film and the novel is that in the film Don José also kills Carmen's lover "torero" and in the novel he does not do (nor in opera). I think they wanted to keep the movie a little heavier! I think the movie is very good, anyway.
