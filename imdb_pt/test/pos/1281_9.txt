The directorial debut of Christopher Nolan is memorable. The film was very well received and helped close contracts to make 'Memento' and with good reason. <br /> <br /> The following is an excellent example of how movies should be made. No extravagant effects or blood dripping blood ... just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to captivate us once more with his writing. The actors, all unknown to me and I suppose most people did a good job of bringing the characters to life. They were all believable and that's all they need to be. The movie is confusing because it plays a lot with the chronology, but it's very gratifying in the end. The film is a bit short to be a feature film, but any additional duration would have ruined the style of the film and the writing brightness would have diminished. Although short, the film has all the aspects that makes it an attractive film (IMO): an intriguing start, an exciting medium and an amazing ending. <br /> <br /> I dare say that Following is almost as good as Memento, his best film by far. The shuffled chronology is equally magisterial used in both films, the incredible twists are present and the acting is very good. <br /> <br /> This movie was made with only $ 6,000, but the quality is much higher than most (almost all) billion dollar box office hits. The use of b & w can be a difficult pill to swallow for the general public, following mainly Nolan showing his skills to the heads of the studio :-). And what skills they are ... I rarely enjoyed writing as much as in "Following". Even Pi does not even come close to the IMO, although it's also very good. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that certainly will not be left aside by any movie lover who cares. If you liked Memento, 'Follow' is definitely for you.
