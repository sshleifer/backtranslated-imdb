I loved this movie It's a very simple storyline and from what I understand it's based on a true story. Growing up in the 80's with hard rock / hair metal may have something to do with my love for this movie, but even apart from the music is a very fun movie to watch. Try it, you'll like it, unless you're the toughest of critics and just like "Citizen Kane" caliber movies.
