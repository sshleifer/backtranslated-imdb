Thirst <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was very well worked out. The cinematography was well above excellent. Although almost all the pictures could be frozen, you would have a great photograph. The use of color stands out more. In many cases, the camera was sliding across the scene and the work was flawless. <br /> <br /> The direction of Park Chan Wook was fantastic. He made me believe unshakably in his forced universe. There were several touches of verbal and visual humor (of a somber nature) that only added another depth to the image as a whole. <br /> <br /> The performance that I would not call excellent, but suited the movie and worked well. enough. <br /> <br /> For me, the only place where this movie was missing was in history. Sometimes I will not lie, the events between the characters just do not make sense. Sometimes the flow of history was awkward. Overall, I was disappointed with the narrative contained, and felt that it went a little too much. <br /> <br /> But I still recommend this movie, because of its vision, its visual flourish, its black humor and end of the day, it is an interesting film even if imperfect. 9/10
