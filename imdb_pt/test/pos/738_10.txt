In the 1970s, a small Texas filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent, low-budget horror films that seem to have developed a small cult following over the years. Before seeing his first film, Do not Look In The Basement, I was not sure what to expect, but I certainly did not expect it to be the only Texas terror I thought was better than Chainsaw. Massacre. I do not know, this may actually be my favorite horror movie of all time. <br /> <br /> We started in an insane insane asylum. At first, it seems a rather relaxed place to stay mentally healthy, considering that all patients can walk freely and do nothing, as if it were their home (I think it is). none of them seem so dangerous, just delusional. The villagers include a love-nymphomaniac, a 700-year-old woman, a man-child, a spaz, a guy who thinks he's in a war, a woman who thinks she has a baby and a guy who thinks he's a judge. One day, out of nowhere, the judge kills the doctor with an ax, soon after, the beloved mother kills the nurse. Ten minutes into the movie, and things are looking pretty ugly. Maybe the new nurse knows what to do, then again, maybe not. Giving more would do more harm than good. It's best to dive in here, knowing as little as possible. If you can appreciate honesty toward God, indifferent to terror, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you liked Scream, if you liked the Wrong Turn, if you opt for Hollywood digital trash, overproduced and overrated, then chances are high that you will not see the beauty in this movie. . Do not look in the basement, being a first try makes the quality even more shocking. The atmosphere and the granulation fit the place and the score is like a glove. Unfortunately, good ol 'S.F. He used most of his good ideas in his first movie, although the next entry in his Texas-sized quadrilogy is a bit of a masterpiece, that is, if you like Hixploitation as someone I know. If you fall in love with the first two of Brownrigg, and absolutely need to find out what else he had to offer, check out Do not open the door, and The house where the hell passed. Do not Look in The Basement has everything that successful terror needs, no stars, no budget, no digital effects, just an original story brought to life in a hospice, with a dozen cast members and a somber, subtle. of course, the twist. This is a real horror for the true horror fan. 10/10
