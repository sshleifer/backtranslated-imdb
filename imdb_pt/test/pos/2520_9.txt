A simple X-file that shows that action is always equal to intelligence. Rob Bowman's direction is clear and precise, the episode looks as new now as almost a decade ago. David and Gillian give great performances and both seem to like the lack of luggage - it's a standalone X-File that even non-fans can find and enjoy. Junior Brown gives both leads a chance for money during the scene with them, he is so convincing that you could believe that the team drove into the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came. Bryan Cranston is as intense and energetic as Patrick Crump, he has admitted in interviews that he knew almost nothing about the X Files before this role, a fact that makes his performance of hitting the ground even more incredible. A brilliantly idiotic episode.
