I think the title of the movie describes well. If you are looking for a documentary about louis kahn and his work, you will have to look elsewhere. although some of them are covered in this film. <br /> <br /> Of course, I eat almost anything I get, and I do not know much about the family history related to this case. So I believed what I was told about Nathaniel and his father, etc. <br /> <br /> For what this movie was, I thought it was very good. a little slow and drawing attention at the moment, I wish Nathaniel had focused a little more on his father's work than on his family drama (although much of the story was interesting, louis was kind of a gambler). <br /> <br /> This really is a journey through someone's life, and I was happy to follow the experience. a learning experience for me and, it seems, for the filmmaker as well. <br /> <br /> oh, and the filming of some kahn works are * awesome *
