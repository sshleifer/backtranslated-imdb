it would be a shame if someone still needed to watch the speed racer, be it dubbed or subbed (I prefer the dubbed version (which is rare) because it was funny ... in a good way. what's great about speed racer is that you're never too old to watch it. goes red and yellow !! I first saw it when I was about seven and liked to hear the captivating opening. it disappeared for some time, so I saw it again a few months ago (I'm 19). imagine the sense of nostalgia coming up, singing "here he comes, here comes the speed racer! he's a demon on wheels ~~~" again and again. however, the mach 5 concept has generated so many 'multi-multi-functional special cars', but none have managed to overcome its genius in construction. the other cars seemed too much. and it was not just racing or battling with different bosses that made it interesting to me.
