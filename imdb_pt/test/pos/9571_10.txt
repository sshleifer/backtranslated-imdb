This movie should be considered one of the funniest movies in history. His cousins ​​A powerful wind, Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman are great on their own, but Best in Show takes the cake. <br /> <br /> A movie about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners who show their dogs competitively are the intricacies of the characters that make them so good. After watching the movie about 75 times I came to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this movie. There is very little interaction between any of the "groups" of characters, but this just seems to increase the beauty of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and do not find it as funny as I am watching, watch it again. The first time I saw him I thought it was useful, but not very hilarious. It's a movie that grows in you. Definitely a movie you will find yourself quoting often. <br /> <br /> Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: A + if you get the DVD check out how these characters were "born" incredible that these two could hit the head. And to find out that they did not really follow a script and kind of invented what they did. <br /> <br /> Gerry and Cookie Guggleman: A Cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the Cookie character. Gerry (Eugene Levy) offers his hilarious and bewildering middle pattern stellar performance of the weaker type. <br /> <br /> Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan- A + Find me a funnier character than Scott Donalan, I DARE YOU! It will forever be typed as this character to me, as it was so natural and did not seem forced at any time. Stefan (Micheal McKean) was very good too and they interact here (and a brief appearance with the Gugglemans) will show why he is always in these movies. A great actor with razor as wit. Harlan Pepper- B +, I do not want it to look like he's not funny, he sure is, but being the only solo act, he can not be as funny as the others. above. He uses the dog more than others and has other idiosyncrasies for him. <br /> <br /> The rest is great too, there is not a weak character. Watch this movie at least twice. Buy it, you will not regret it.
