Damien O'Donnell has a good record and in this film he deals with a very delicate subject with sensitivity, but he manages not to let the film turn into schmalz. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie, it's funny with sad chunks and makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see now - FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This movie will change the way you view people with disabilities and also offers a very fun night at the movies. I can not wait until it comes out on DVD.
