This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. A 14-year-old boy, Jason Shepherd, wrote an article in English called "Big Fat Liar." When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to school on time and he got a limo. When he got into the limo, he met a famous Hollywood producer, Marty Wolf. When he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his newspaper! So Marty Wolf picked up and turned Jason's English newspaper into a movie! When Jason admitted that he left his paper in the limo and Marty accepted, his parents and his English teacher did not believe him! So Jason and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood to make Marty admit that he stole his story for Jason's parents. When Jason told Marty to call his dad that Marty stole that part, Marty cheated on him and burned his role! Jason was so angry that Marty burned that role, so Marty called security to get Jason off his site! Jason and Kaylee realized that Marty will not admit the truth. In order to overthrow Marty in Phase 2: The Takedown, Jason and Kaylee put permanent blue paint on the pool and when Marty jumps, his body turns all blue and does not come off! Then they put permanent orange dye in Marty's shampoo and when he wears it, his hair looks all orange and would not come out too! Finally, they put a lot of glue on Marty's headset to make him call Jason's dad and when Marty wears it, he stays in his ear! It was funny when Marty's hair and body were all blue and orange and his headset was glued to his ear! After that, they tricked Marty by telling Monty, who is Marty's assistant, that Duncan moved to a house where there's a party going on. When Marty came in to see Duncan, he was in the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up! When Marty was in the house, Jason and Kaylee changed the controls of their car. When Marty drove his car, he knew that all the controls were changed and he did not know which button to push. He's stupid enough to fall in love with it. When Marty hit the back end of the squeezer, the squeezer destroyed his car! It was so funny. Then Marty starts calling Jason's father and cheats again! He was on the phone, but it was not his father, he called security! After security took Jason and Kaylee off Marty's site, they suggested they go home. Monty would be on Jason and Kaylee's side because she knew Marty was a liar and an idiot, so she told Rocco, who is one of the security guards she will take care of the kids. Jason told his father the truth about what he's been doing for the last two days and that his parents came to Los Angeles. When Monty came to the kids, she will help the kids get into Phase 4: The Return. Jason divides the team into 3 teams for Phase 4. A team will distract and deceive Marty until Jason's parents arrive on set. Marty rode first with Frank Jackson, but his car broke, so he traveled with Jaleel, but he took him into the desert and left it there. When Marty was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. After that, one of the blades is clogged, so Marty and the pilot got out of the helicopter. After that, he was on his way to the set and when Jason saw him, Marty stopped and saw what Jason had: his monkey! Then Marty followed Jason and Kaylee and when they saw Lester, he released the water and when the water arrived, he pushed Marty away. Marty was still behind the kids and when Kaylee went the other way, Jason took Marty to the top of the building. At the top, Jason was challenging Marty, making him admit the truth and Marty will never tell the truth. When the crew took Marty in surprise, everyone, including Jason's parents on the set, knew what Marty was doing. Marty was going to kill Jason, but the only way for Jason to escape is to jump off the top! After that, his parents believed that Marty took his story. When the people on the set left, this is the end of Marty. In the end, Jason's story, Big Fat Liar was a movie. I can not get enough.
