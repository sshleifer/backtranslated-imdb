In the veins of Jeepers Creepers and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Man of the Monsters surprisingly well-done - though irrational - little horror. Play some comedy, good blood and intense fright. It's hard not to say that Monster Man is really fun. The low budget seems pretty obvious, but it does not affect the film's overall presentation and puts more shameful horror films on the budget. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is as generic as possible. A couple of friends, Adam (Eric Jungman) and Harley (Justin Urich) are driving the country to stop the marriage of a woman Adam has always loved. While Adam is a more nerdy guy, Harley is a self-proclaimed housewife and a very offensive assailant. Adding a bonus to the plot, they picked up a sexy hitchhiker, Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Things turn into nightmares when a monster truck with a scary face chasing them. When the dead body begins to count, they must make the race against time before their own life at risk. <br /> <br /> The plot is obviously reminiscent of many famous earlier horror movies, but Michael Davis as the writer and director succeed in keeping up the tension. The scare is building well enough, where characterization is never the best, but quite well. The screenplay is also filled with comedies that work for the funny moments and are quite enjoyable instead of annoying and also wait for the turnaround at the end. It's hilarious and shocking at the same time, which is a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> As a conclusion, Monster Man surprisingly entertaining. It deserves more attention on the big screen. This proves that big budget does not make an effective horror movie, but the skill does! Something the director showed and delivered.
