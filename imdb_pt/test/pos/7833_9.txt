The slogan in the box is: "100 PASSENGERS WANDERED ... 3,000 POISON VIPERS!" You almost have to admire this degree of "no chance in hell we will ever keep this promise". I could admire more of the Asylum hucksterism if they made movies that, well, you know, were good or, at least, worth it. Haha, and that's what I like about these movies. They are rubbish. You put them in a bathroom and then it downloads. Well worth the price if you are a fan of cheesy movies. It can become a cult classic among many fans. The bloody scenes are effective, there's not much I can say, it's a Z movie that spoofs the new movie with Samuel L. Jackson, hell, it might be better, then who knows!
