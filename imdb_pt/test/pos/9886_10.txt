I saw the premier of this film during the Phoenix Film Festival 2005 and was very impressed with the director of skill, Jeff Hare, exhibited in bringing this timely topic to the screen. The cast of characters blended in perfectly and allowed us to examine the question of an old man who wanted to die "on his own terms" in a very warm and humorous way. Peter Falk was brilliant as Morris and the support group of family members and friends were perfectly chosen in their roles. The interaction of family, friends, and outsiders with Morris has created a realistic view of how families deal with their parents' aging and their desires to die with dignity. <br /> <br /> Although this film is ostensibly a movie about a Jewish Actor and his family, it is truly a movie about all the families. The jokes that family and Morris break during this joke during the life of a "Nature Force" are cool and realistic. Childhood rivalries, adult successes and failures, and hope for children are essential to this road map. While many will question how you can do the "humorous" suicide theme, I found the treatment logical and timely. If you are not afraid to shed some tears or laugh at the jokes of a family that is struggling with this issue then you MUST SEE THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> The film was awarded as "Best Film" in the Phoenix Film. Festival.
