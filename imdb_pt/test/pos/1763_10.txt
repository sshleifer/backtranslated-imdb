Could this be one of the first colorful films? Actually, it's the second. This is a beautiful film produced by Thomas Edison. This was one of many of his other films. <br /> <br /> I think this is the most beautiful of all the films of Thomas Edison. He shows a girl dancing and moving the dress around, which turns red with the movie. It's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> You're watching the story when you watch it. You're watching what started making great day's movies! This may not have a plot, or something very interesting, but this is the second color film of all time. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to everyone, especially if you're teaching students about filming or something, you have to show them what started with colorful movies!
