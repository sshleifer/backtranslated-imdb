One of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Louis Jouvet's performance is fantastic. It really 'fills' the part of it, and that's wonderful. He is such a good actor that you can not think of anyone else to do your part. <br /> <br /> And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are good as French, trying to defend themselves in the fight born with a murder ... <br /> <br /> The story is breathtaking and well built . You can feel the atmosphere of Paris during this period (which is around 1930-40), between two wars ... The clubs, the small old buildings, the neighbors. <br /> <br /> All this helps to make a great movie.
