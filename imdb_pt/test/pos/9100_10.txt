This movie is all that Tenacious D fans can expect. Director Liam Lynch in partnership with the "D" is a mix of epic proportions. Of course, you need to understand Tenacious D.'s mood and format. When I saw him, there was not much laughter from the audience, but the motive is not lack of humor or clever jokes. This film seems to have been released to an unsuspecting audience that has not become familiar with the musical duo. This film remains true to its roots. For the few who watched the HBO TV series and listened to the album, they did not forget what the audience loves. As in the TV show, people noticed in the trailer the apartment scenes of JB and KG and of course the Mic nights open that every episode of Tenacious D would begin and end. The soundtrack is phenomenal and every song surprises you. <br /> <br /> And Dave Grohl plays a fantastic Devil. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect movie for those who are looking for a tough times and a rocking musical.
