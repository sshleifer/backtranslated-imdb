This was the movie that started the film love affair between the Jaundiced Eye team and Matthew Ferguson. His ability to portray relatively normal characters as Birkoff in "La Femme Nikita" is counterbalanced by his equally fearless manipulation of strangers. as "Kane". It is hoped that he will only have more roles, larger roles and even more complex roles to test, to push the limits of his abilities. There were four or five memorable scenes in this movie, and Matthew Ferguson stole two of them from much more experienced actors. This film itself is good, and worth watching on its own merits, but Ferguson makes it a bit more special. His * ouevre * may eventually show how Anthony Perkins' career COULD be if he had not been labeled "Norman Bates" for so long. back. "Kane" is not as crazy as Norman, much less people have seen "Love and Human Remains than they have seen" Psycho ", so we can hope that Ferguson will show us some clue of what Perkins COULD have if you had permission to do so.
