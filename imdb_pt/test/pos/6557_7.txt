A few weeks after seeing this movie, I began to remember John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness (not for the story!) For the atmosphere, the quick elements of surprise and the dream sequences. On the other hand, this film mixes the image and the music very well (note the fourth chapter of the film)
