I was delighted when I saw that my husband was renting "Labyrinth of Passion". I love the Almodovar movies. We both love the movie. We both could not stop laughing. We especially enjoyed the scene where the transvestite is filming a photo novel, and while supposedly being threatened by a killer with an electric drill, he is told to answer the phone and say, "I can not talk to you now, I" I'm being attacked by a sadistic serial killer. If I survive, I'll call you back. "(That would make a great answering machine message come to think of it.) We also love the girl telling her she's loved," I went to an orgy after the show , but I could not stop thinking about you. "(I'm waiting to use this line on Twitter.)" Labyrinth of Passion "is a joke with a lot of joke, hilarious and sweet talk for everyone.The movie has aged well: the costumes and hairstyles I would give a 10 out of 10 rating, but I am giving an 8 for two reasons: The first is the scene involving laxatives which includes a scene from a woman getting dirty: totally unnecessary, and this reduces the film's tone to Hollywood's coarse comedy for a moment.The second is the suggestion that Queti is sleeping with his father: shocking, yes, but again, that spoils the tone of the film.Even though, I would recommend the movie for those who want a sophisticated, spicy and fun time.
