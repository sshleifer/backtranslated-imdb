One of the most enjoyable aspects of watching movies is getting lost in a movie. So that it is totally washed over you, so that you absorb as is, and thus, try it to the maximum. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a movie. Over the years, photography critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at their vulnerabilities. But maybe it's because of the tone the movie brings with it, rather than its more obvious characteristics. It is at once prohibitive, remote, possibly dangerous; Beware of what's inside! The haunting chords of the song, seen through the 20th-Fox logo, lead us to titles of turquoise letters from another world. <br /> Strange! Archaeological! Decadent! It is as if we were descending to a vault of antiquity, where they could be great treasures, mingled with uncertain dangers. (One can imagine Darryl Zanuck commanding: "Turn ancient!") So what a darkly dramatic story unfolds, all in the same tone set at the beginning. The Ten Commandments' portray the severity of civilization, the phenomenal 'Land of the Pharaohs' their nuts and bolts, while' The Egyptian 'shows them all , from glamor to tragedy, for us to admire. <br /> <I do not have to say much about the players here, but I think over time Bella Darvi is being redeemed. What a perfect face for the paper, straight from a Symbolist painting. If her acting does not please some, it may be argued that in her "courtesan" role she is obviously better in bed than talking to some poor helpless admirer. I think Curtiz captured the perversity of his sadomasochistic relationship with Edmund Purdom's character with aplomb, and censorship was what it was at the time. Sir Peter Ustinov, in his memoirs, was very kind to 'The Egyptian', writing that it was' like being lost in a huge set for 'Aida'. His pronunciation of the word "beer" I adopted forever (one of the historically accurate references of the film: the beer invented by the Egyptian!) Henry Daniell, egads, what a perfect performance. Gene Tierney, what a treasure of the screen. Bless DFZ for giving her this role of "backwardness." Come on guys, do not be so hard on Victor Mature! He is the son of a cheese-maker! Who rose to be Pharaoh! Sounds like a peculiarly American opportunity. One of the best moments: the existential observations of John Carradine in the sands of time. And Purdom's statement about living beyond the world's sunsets. If that is not the epic of Grade A, what is it? <br /> <br /> Of course, along with everything else, the music is sublime. It is common to note that Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann have created one of the most compelling scores on the screen, perfectly harmonious, but each theme is well developed, with a life of its own. Newman, pressed for time by DFZ, called for Herrmann, someone he could implicitly trust, to take on half the weight. <br /> <br /> Benny, not the easiest guy to work at, obviously respected Newman enough to actually deliver inspiring music. They alternated suggestions, an ingenious approach. There are no spoilers about who did what here, but Benny brings an edge with him, incredible and mysterious sounds. Alfred brings soot, nostalgia and pungency. Both are consummately epic. Even when viewed on a squeezed TV screen, the effect of seeing the names of the two composers side by side in the main credits, which the ultra-wide anamorphic screen could comfortably accommodate, is chilling. <br /> <br /> Leon Shamroy, the dean of CinemaScope, does not leave us here. The sinister greens and moody shadows (probably distortions in all the terrible TV impressions I've seen over the years) perfectly fit the multidimensional script (by the great Philip Dunne and veterinarian Casey Robinson, whom Curtiz must have brought with him 20). As it is remarkable that Shamroy, who was as much a institution of photography in Fox as Newman was with the music, was the lens "Cleopatra" a few years later, but in the most brilliant and clear images of the 60s, Todd A-O. These guys from the old studio are my heroes. <br /> <br /> For me, who wants to worry about all the imperfections and opportunities of criticism in a photo like that? I'd rather give way entirely to his spell, and plunge into his sea of ​​lust, to emerge after the inspiring climax of 'The End' reinvigorated, moved and hungry for more. <br /> <br /> And yes, we should shout at 20th-Fox for a DVD release worthy of DFZ's legacy.
