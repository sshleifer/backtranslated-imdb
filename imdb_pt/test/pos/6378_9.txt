I saw Teen Devian in 1993, telecast in Doordarshan on a Friday night, and could hardly believe that such a remarkable film has ever been made in Bollywood. Was it amazing? a movie with a "modern" plot, superb music, three lovely ladies and my superstar fave Dev Anand. In this unusual plot, Dev falls in love with three women? the simple Nanda, the rapturous Kalpana and the sophisticated Simi. They are also in love with him and want to marry him. This puts Dev in a dilemma (which is the crux of the plot) - with whom to marry. He consults a hypnotist who asks Dev to look into a crystal ball. Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda. Beautifully directed (probably by Dev Saheb himself and not by Amarjeet the official director) The B & W classic has perennial music ?? some of SD Burman's best compositions (generously helped by RD Burman). "Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth" is probably the sexiest song ever made in Hindi movies. One should also give credit to Majrooh Sultanpuri for writing the memorable letters. Teen Devian is a cheery musical that fits completely in the style of Dev Anand and did justice to the role. Unfortunately, Teen Devian has never received the recognition and popularity it deserves. <br /> <br /> Must do for any Hindi movie fan, I will evaluate the eternal favorite 9.5 out of 10.
