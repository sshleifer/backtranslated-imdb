The two new OSS 117 movies have a kind of humor that is both smart and stupid, which I find extremely entertaining. This really reminds me of the classic Pink Panther movies with a leader almost as good as Peter Sellers in Jean Dujardin. And unlike Steve Martin completely ruining Clouseau, Dujardin is brilliant. <br /> <br /> Comments about the fact that films are anti-Semitic are obviously a case of complete lack of humor and understanding. <br /> <br /> Whether you will like or hate this movie really boils down to the kind of mood you have. I can not wait for the continuation!
