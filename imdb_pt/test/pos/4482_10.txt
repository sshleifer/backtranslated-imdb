Passion in the desert exemplifies space grander. It is a visual narrative, illuminated by the magnificent cinematography. The passion was filmed in the deserts of Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Namibia and Tunisia. <br /> <br /> We are in Egypt in 1798. Augustin, a Napoleonic soldier, is accompanying the writer and artist Jean-Michel Venture De Paradis on an official mission to document, measure, draw and paint the region's cultural landmarks . Egypt: its dunes, stupendous ruins and mysterious people. <br /> <br /> But, can you really "document" majestic landscapes, fractured buildings and wild Bedouins? Can you really capture the essence of Egypt, of nature, of man and of time? <br /> <br /> Jean and Augustin get lost in the sparkling, shimmering golden desert, whose vastness dominates the senses. <br /> <br /> "You can not get lost in Egypt! There is the Nile and the sea!" says Augustine dehydrated, and soon discovers an ancient and sinuous cave that leads to a palace ruin. <br /> Delirious and almost delirious, he tries to rest; a bewildering sound awakens you; his eyes, body and emotions become hypnotically locked in time as he comes across a sensual and sensory experience .... A savage and elegant leopard looks back at him, and his affair Love begins. ... <br /> <br /> A daring love affair, a daring movie.
