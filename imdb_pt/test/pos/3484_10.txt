This movie looked so real. I really felt all the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - both from Rory and from Michael. I have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy like Rory, so what you see here is exactly what I really felt. Some will not believe that there are people with disabilities like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I am one of them. <br /> <br /> The story is great. For a drama, directed by characters, the story moves quickly. I never got bored, maybe in part because I was seeing things that were close to my heart. But I think most people, smartly, will stick to the screen and care about the characters. The acting is phenomenal! James McAvoy is perfect as Rory O'Shea, who has Duchene muscular dystrophy. He Steven Robertson deserves an award for his performance as Michael Connolly, who has cerebral palsy. <br /> <br /> Michael's love is not returned by a girl and Rory helps him accept it. I've felt it many times and the question is, "Does not she love me because I'm not alone or because my disability has pushed her away?" No matter what the girl says, we will always be skeptical about the truth. It's natural and it hurts anyway. <br /> <br /> Some parts made me cry a little because it's sad and I have to face the issues myself. People without terminal deficiency simply can not begin to understand how they can feel. This is a must-see movie for everyone. People with disabilities are everywhere and very misunderstood. This film brings a little light on some of the facts of life, which are so accepted by the healthy. We want to be just like you - live on our own terms, get out, get drunk, be loved. From the outside, we can not do much, but inside, we're dancing!
