Being a child of the 90s, I really enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it a lot and even more so than the classic cartoons from WB. <br /> <br /> I do not know why; early 90's cartoons had something special; I do not know if it was the atmosphere of uncertainty, a generational change, whatever. But "Tiny Toons" kept the vibe of the 90's and produced one of the most popular, funny and underrated cartoons ever created. <br /> <br /> Memories are obscure, but I can only say that I enjoyed every episode and product related to the show. Easily, no other cartoon made me laugh in a caring way (before going into teen-oriented dark serials). <br /> <br /> The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a real main character. Each character was hilarious and deserved to be called the lead.
