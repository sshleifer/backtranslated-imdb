Years ago, with "Ray of Light," Madonna achieved a truly incredible level of musical art, and since then she occasionally transcends her own standards. This production of concerts, with its hypnotic editing, incredible dancing, hallucinatory lighting effects and trance-inducing arrangements, dispels all previous efforts. Madonna's apparent ambition - alone, to bring world peace through music and dance - may seem arrogant or absurd to some. But hell, someone has to do it! Thanks to her set-up of the remarkable talent of everyone involved in this production, "Confessions Tour Live from London" puts her again among the top ten artists working anywhere in the world in any medium.
