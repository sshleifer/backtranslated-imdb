That's not far from the trash Bollywood usually does, but there's something really good about it. <br /> <br /> The title song is one of the best in Bollywood and it's haunting everywhere. This is one of the films (along with Baazigar - a must-see Bollywood movie) that made Shah Rukh Khan and that's what you have to take a look at. <br /> <br /> Other criticisms reveal the story - it's a pretty basic idea - ShaRukh definitely stands out and one of his last expressions in the end made me give this movie an extra star. <br /> <br /> It's quite tacky, but definitely worth seeing if you're new to Bollywood or not! 8/10
