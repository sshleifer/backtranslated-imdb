A lot of full Muppet movies, created by Jim Henson & Co, were made, but "The Muppet Movie" was the first of them, and the first of the original trilogy, which also features "The Great." Muppet Caper "and" The Muppets Take Manhattan. "It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously could not see it at the time (nor could I see its two successors when they were released). my childhood, especially after Henson's untimely death in 1990. I finally got to see this movie for the first time in the mid-nineties after listening to the soundtrack. Not surprisingly, I liked that at the time, and revisit it in Kermit, the Frog, sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing "Rainbow Connection", a Hollywood agent named Bernie arrives on a boat and asks him to pursue a career in Tinseltown.Kermit follows his advice and goes west.He soon finds Fozzie Bear, a stand-up comedian at a restaurant, and persuades him to go along.Frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a rest chain earrings that want Kermit to be her mascot. As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie. As they travel through the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, as everyone tries to get to Hollywood, Max Hopper is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become the mascot of his restaurant chain, so Kermit sees himself in increasing danger! <br /> <br /> One thing that many people praise this movie is the songs, and I can understand why. There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated "Rainbow Connection" at the beginning, and more good songs follow, such as the captivating music of Kermit and Fozzie, "Movin 'Right Along," and "I'm Going to Go There." "Never Before, Never Again", the song that Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I consider to be very weak, and her novel seems suddenly sudden. in this film are generally lovely as well as they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of humor, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the movie hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up. If you are familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them. "Some of the live actors appearing briefly in the film may also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as" Insolent Waiter. " <br /> <br /> Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was the first time I've seen one of them since the movie, which is not 100% comedy. and saw "Muppets from Space" (one of the Muppet movies). made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year. I was very disappointed when I saw that movie, which had never happened before, when I watched any movie or TV show with the popular dolls! Not only is this film not very funny, I also think it's a bit too dark and too cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review! However, I can not say that I find the same of any of the film's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier. "The Muppet Movie" seems to be the most popular of the group, and since it has a lot to like, not just for kids, it's understandable. I doubt very much that there is much to say about "The Muppet Movie," which has not been said for some time in the last thirty years, but today it remains a good family entertainment.
