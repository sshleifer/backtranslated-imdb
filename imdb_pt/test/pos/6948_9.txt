This show came to Canada on PBS in the mid-90's and I really loved it. Even ten years later, watching the various news networks, I can not help but think of the cynical manipulation that goes on in the name of the classifications and the various "demonstration ponies" we all see on TV as described in several Frontline episodes. The scripts are well written and the actors have an impeccable comedic timing, and none of them are overwhelmed by a dumb laughing trail. There's a lot of funny material here really well executed and we do not need to be told when to laugh and what to laugh at. I do not understand why this show never took off in North America as its true gem! I was very excited to see the DVDs available, even if they are in PAL format. I figured I would rip them to my computer and then watch the converted files. I risked and asked for the ABC ?? 6 to 8 weeks later, I had all 3 seasons. Better yet, it worked on my NTSC DVD player. I suspect that any player has bought in the last 2 years that xvid / divx will play them. Good stuff! 10 years later, the episodes last very well! You do not need to know anything about Australian politics to get the humor, as everything will be familiar to the Western public. My wife and I had a 10 day Frontline fest and we are still laughing weeks after watching all 39 episodes
