I saw this movie in a preview, and it's delicious. The cinematography is extraordinarily creative, the acting is good and the story is fabulous. If this movie does not go well, it will not be because it does not deserve it. Before this movie, I did not realize just how charming Shia Lebouf could be. He does a wonderful and autonomous job as a leader. There's something incredibly sweet about him, and that makes the movie even better. The other actors also do a good job, and the film contains moments of great suspense, more than you would expect from a movie about golf. Sports movies are ten cents, but this one stands out. <br /> <br /> This is one that I would recommend to anyone.
