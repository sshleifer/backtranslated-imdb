Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny / Daffy Duck / Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wit about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy shaking "pronoun problems" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun, resulting in his ever-disfigured beak. Then there is the transvestism of the rabbit that always leaves Elmer in his way of love. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always my favorites in the category of screenwriter and director because of these hilarious cartoons of the hunting trilogy that I laughed at as a child. And at least two of them end with Daffy's exclamation to Bugs: "You're despicable!" It can not get better than this!
