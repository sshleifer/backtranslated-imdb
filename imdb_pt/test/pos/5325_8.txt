There are subtleties in this movie that I think many people can lose if they are not careful. You really need to follow what Leland says and read your character to find out the "why" that film presents at the end. Nothing is solid, it is not definitive, it is about what the individual spectator takes from it. I think this was the plan from the beginning, people are not wanting to understand the same way, it's almost about forming their own personal relationship with Leland in order to maybe feel a little better. <br /> <br /> The plot is interesting, but your resume could never explain what the movie really is. It's dramatic and thought-provoking, a lot of heavy ideas, but the pace of the movie is almost comforting, even with its most intense scenes with screams. I think it's probably Leland, he's just calm and almost serene, even for all his sadness. The film personifies Leland in a certain way. <br /> <br /> Of course it's catchy and attracts you if you let it, but there are some recycled ideas. I mean, Leland has a very impressive dialogue, he's anything but typical, but he's not a prophet. Everything he says is not a revelation, many people I know mentioned things he mentioned, until I noticed some things he observed. Leland is the unique and attractive character he most likely is mainly for Ryan Gosling's portrait. <br /> <br /> In the end, the acting is all exceptional, there are no real thugs, there is no way to psychologically evaluate Leland, just maybe to understand him and life a little better. <br /> <br /> Comparable to Igby Goes Down, I think, not comic but similar in his overview of life.
