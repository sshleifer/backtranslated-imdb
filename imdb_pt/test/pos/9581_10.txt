Another masterpiece that needs a DVD release, but some libraries have VHS and are worth looking for. Just a brilliant piece on many things, especially euthanasia, respectability, religion and fundamental human relations. The script effectively uses intelligent humor, not only to deal with an issue as a seriously poor child, but to tie parents in their love for "Jo" and each other. As the couple, Alan Bates and Janet Suzman are perfectly matched in virtuosity and in bringing their deep and intelligent characters to life. <br /> <br /> I've recently seen Bates's brilliant performance in "Butley," which was released as a movie a couple of years after "Joe Egg" and he plays a teacher in both cynical, intellectual and funny , although Butley is much darker than his character here. If you do such good performances in The Go-Between, Women in Love, Whistle Down the Wind, The Caretaker and Georgy Girl, not to mention the more obvious "King of Hearts" and "Zorba , the Greek, "and I would say that Alan Bates had a career comparable to Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and other great British actors of his day. Director Peter Medak also had one of my all-time favorites "The Ruling Class" released the same year (1972) as "Joe Egg," which comprises a career year in the book of any one. He had a sort of uneven filmography ("The Krays" was another highlight), but these two jewels will mark him as a great director.
