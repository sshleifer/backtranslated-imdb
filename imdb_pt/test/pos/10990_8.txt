Being from the Buffalo area I was well aware of the movie having read many articles in local publications. I was very impressed with the film, especially its clever plot, the acting and the local scenes. It is good to see so many old stars and quality in the various roles. I feel that especially those of us over 50 will find the film excellent and you can leave the theater feeling that your time was well spent.
