"Plots With A View", 2002, is a small and delightful comedy, as only the British have managed. The film's sense of humor is both slightly morbid and black and yet very amiable and sometimes very rude. It's the only film by director Nick Hurran that I've seen so far, and although I do not intend to watch any of his other films right now (I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies), this is very enjoyable and fun. very funny. The film takes place in a small town in Wales, where Betty Rhys-Jones (Brenda Blethyn) is married to the drunken major and adulterer of the town (Robert Pugh). Local healer Boris (Alfred Molina) has been desperately in love with Betty since childhood, but has always been too shy to confess his love for her. In addition to being desperately in love, Boris has a few other problems, as the eccentric American funeral director Frank Featherbed (Christopher Walken) has opened a flourishing funeral business in the same city ... The strange and very British humor of the movie should amuse everyone with a sense of humor, and the story sometimes becomes quite bizarre. In addition, "Plots With A View" profits from a wonderful cast. Brenda Bethlyn, who once proved to be a funny lady in 2000's "Saving Grace", leads the way, and she is again very funny and very kind in her role. Alfred Molina, who plays his timid admirer, does a great performance as always, and Robert Pugh fits perfectly into the role of Betty's despicable husband. Linda Naomi Watts is also great as her husband's "secretary", I'm becoming a big fan of all the movies I see her in. The biggest role, however, is played by the incomparable Christopher Walken (one of my favorite actors). Walken is brilliant as he is always in the role of the eccentric undertaker who organizes funerals that are quite unorthodox. Overall, "Plots With A View" is a very entertaining British comedy I recommend!
