Latcho Drom, or Safe Journey, is the second film in Tony Gatlif's trilogy about the Romani people. The film is a visual representation and historical record of Gypsy life in European countries and the Middle East. Even if the scenes are planned, rehearsed and staged, there is no conventional plot and the dialogue does not explain scene-to-scene activities. Instead, the film allows the viewer to sometimes have a glimpse, sometimes a deeper insight of these people at different times and in different countries, going from India, Egypt, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain. /> <br /> The importance of music in Roman culture is clearly expressed throughout the film. It is a vital part of all events and an important means of communication. All they do is expressed with music. Dance is another important activity. Like gypsy music, it is specialized and deeply personal, something only they know how to do properly. We are provided glimpses into their daily activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. On the contrary, it is a testament to their culture, focusing on the music and dance that they created and made them unique. <br /> <br /> Gatlif portrays the nomadic groups in a positive way. However, we also witness the rejection, mistrust and alienation they receive from the non-Romani population. It seems that the culture that they have developed over countless generations, and inspired by various countries, will disappear into oblivion, because conventional society has no place for the nomadic paths. <br /> <br /> The other films in the trilogy are Les Princes (1983) and Gadjo Dilo (1998).
