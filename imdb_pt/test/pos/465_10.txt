One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Bechard has a way of looking at things that are completely unique and this movie does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you guess completely, and with the seemingly taboo topics covered, you get stuck on the screen. There are no bad guys or good guys, Bechard makes sure of that. The characters are so perfectly complex that you feel for each of them, you worry about what they've gone through. <br /> <br /> Bechard's use of attention to detail is unparalleled in this world of "FAST FOOD MOVIES" and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable - you just love the feeling it gives you. <br /> <br /> I've heard that there are NO NEW stories to tell. Thank you Gorman Bechard for proving this false. <br /> <br /> Run, do not walk, to see this movie.
