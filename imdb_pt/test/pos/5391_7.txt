Dallas stars Gary Cooper, Ruth Roman, Steve Cochran, Barbara Payton and Raymond Massey. It is directed by Stuart Heisler, the photograph is by Ernest Haller and the duties of the pen were attributed to John Twist. Produced out of Warner Brothers, Dallas is vividly filmed in Technicolor off the Iverson & Warner California farms. Quite a film with tongue firm in the cheek, the film is a retrocesso for the faroestes of old that exist without pretensions or deep meanings of penetration. The plot sees Cooper's Civil War renegade Blayde "Reb" Hollister, pretends his own death to kill his reputation and free himself from the persecution in Dallas of the brothers who massacred his family. In essence, a routine plot, Twist's story is animated along the way by many a fun and exciting detour. There are reversals of roles, dandy fashions, horse chases, shootings, a love triangle, vigorous dialogues and little twists to keep the piece purely from painting it by numbers. <br /> <br /> Cooper seems to be enjoying himself as well, which further increases the good factor on offer. It is true that he is not really asked to do anything other than being a laconic guy on a mission. But when called to action tasks, he delivers the goods his fans expect during his successful career. The villains are amused (particularly Bryant Marlow, vile and unpredictable of Steve Cochran), because each one has its own pecadillos not to leave them familiar with the smoothness. The two ladies in the play are beautiful and get along in the midst of machismo, while the high value of the production allows Haller to really treat the eyes with the exuberant Technicolor and involve camera work around the venues. <br /> <br /> It has ideals to be a list Oater does Dallas, something that simply can not achieve. But it is not for lack of attempts and the end result is pure entertainment, which, in fact, should be enjoyed on a cold winter day, when the viewer needs a pick up. 7/10
