'Identity?? . . . . I am part of what surrounds me and I become separated from them and is able to make these differentiations clearly that allows us to have an identity and what is within our identity is all that has already happened to us "(Ntozake Shange qtd in" Fires in the Mirror "). ") Things like the Decalogue V used to intimidate me.I felt that if I accepted, I would be compromising something.What I thought before really is not worth getting in.I understand what naturalism is trying to say.I experienced a tangible katharsis, and one that has fallen into existence gradually, and one that is still alive, which I still have to tell. It is still working inside of me. <br /> <br /> The film was not sympathetic by itself What the Decalogue shows is that there are good and beautiful people who kill other people when society and the people are going to die. primordial impulses stimulate them. <br /> <br /> The 'science' of naturalism is what helped me to appreciate Decalogue V. It is not worth writing about why I did not allow myself before, but now I see the value in making art so as to "make" people, or perhaps to make people do something. <br /> <br /> There is a method for Lazar's commitment. . . Light. Much of this meaning only makes sense in retrospect. This should not be a very strange idea: after all, how much of respectable science does not make sense in retrospect. I shudder when I say this, but naturalism seems much more productive and much less nihilistic when I have the power to say to myself: "This ruin, this process, this natural process, makes me want to resist the system." <br /> <br /> I do not think naturalism is painting a picture of mankind's final judgment, telling us to give up our powder wigs and go into the forest. Instead, I think it is the cataloging of evidence and experience, which we are obviously free to ignore. We can ignore everything we want if we want to give the Naturalists more corpses to bury. <br /> <br /> Certainly, despite their aesthetic specifically designed without sympathy for the likely and catastrophic fate of their characters, they are passionate about reader inactivity and scriptural snobbery. I see the delicious risk in the hope that the public will understand what should be done with what they see. As already mentioned, there is danger in the desperate to see their destiny immortalized in stone. There is danger in the hope of depreciating the Natural because it does not correspond to your worldview. <br /> <br /> And I do not think the 'hopeful' needs to be rich or lucky. I have not seen this, but it seems that the movie American Beauty proves the inadequacy of circumstances as a provider of vision or comfort. There are ascetics and gluttons, as well as beggars who wonder where their humanity is, who suffer because they can not find anything that separates them from their landscape. <br /> <br /> Landscapes can be portrayed with beauty and beauty, but in reality, landscapes are not represented. They change, certainly, and dramatically, but only by a large set of natural laws that no one has real power. But this can not be changed in itself.
