Coming into this movie I knew two things about it. I knew it was an extremely radical film and I knew it was a little artistic. Both of them appeal to me in their own right, but when put together, it can be something truly unique. And that was right, undoubtedly, unique. Like I said above, it's an art film. The way they used an intense sound reminded me so much of an Aronofsky movie. Visually, I did not see anything like that. Cinematography and lighting were very well done. The movie uses visuals and sounds seriously better than anything I've seen in a while. Especially when you consider the experience that these young filmmakers had (young 20s), you really have to take your hat off for them. <br /> <br /> The movie is not easy to describe or even discuss. There is no real story, you could say that it revolves around the right and left side of the brain and how they control their life, I think. They are four segments, or four ideas brought to life through visual and auditory extremes. There are some who speak and listen, but it is mainly a film that does not speak. <br /> <br /> The first segment is the shortest and revolves around a naked body and an eyeball. Try and guess what happens ?? wrong. The second segment is my favorite. It involves a brother and sister (who looks a bit like Sarah Silverman, but with larger breasts). The brother is crazy and the sister is a prostitute. I would say this is the most extreme of all threads, and the most well done. The bloody effects on it were great. The third segment revolves around a bunch of naked people sexualizing themselves with Mother Earth. It is probably considered the weakest of the group, but it is still smart and well done. The fourth segment is probably the strongest in the movie and I would also say the deepest. For me I'll have to see this a few times to understand what's actually being said. I know he approaches Christianity in a way that would probably make his mother fake or vomit. "Try it! <br /> <br /> Subconscious Cruelty has been recommended to me and I am proud to say that. is now in my movie collection. It's extreme, violent, bloody, very sexual and surprisingly provocative. The next line I'm about to say was used in almost every review I read for this movie. "This movie is not for everyone." Now is not the truth. If you enjoy extreme movies and / or are just a movie lover who wants to see something different, check this out. 8 1/2 outta 10
