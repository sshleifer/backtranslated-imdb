Although this movie changes reality to make it more heroic and fun, sometimes the fantasy is more enjoyable than real life, and also nothing could be more real than Errol Flynn playing Custer. This remains the best film ever made about Custer. The music of Max Steiner is magnificent and also throughout the film the Irish music "Gerry Owen", which was Custer's favorite, is played. The movie must have more villains because they try to concentrate all thugs on Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between Flynn and De Havilland flows like nowhere else out of his films together, and director Raoul Walsh with his experience in outdoor scenes with a lot of actors is at his best.
