Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argento Cast: Cristina Masillach, Ian Charleson, Urbano Barberini, Daria Nicolodi Comment: The only other Argento movie I had seen was Suspiria and this one surprised me with its scary style, color and plot. Then I decided to go with Opera, as I was told it was one of his best. Dude, I think I'm figuring out what turns out to be one of my favorite horror directors. <br /> <br /> Opera is about a young opera singer who makes his big break when the main star of a scary modern opera assumes Mc Beth is run over by a car. Betty is the replacement so she can do the part on her own. Too bad for her, there's a psychopath behind her who makes her watch the brutal murders of her friends and co-workers. <br /> <br /> Wow, I heard good things about this movie here, but I was not prepared for the level of greatness that this movie would take me. Yes, the movie has its flaws that I'm going to come up with later. But most of the time the movie surprised me. <br /> <br /> First, this movie is not as colorful as Suspiria's. I was hoping it would be a little suspicious in that department, but no, to my surprise, it had its own appearance. The film is somehow devoid of color. It has lots of color in certain scenes (such as the kitchen sequence / masterful living room) where Argento fills the screen with lush greens and blues, but for the most part the film has a greyish gray tone at all and I wish I had the his own distinct appearance. <br /> <br /> The true stars of this program are the incredibly well-orchestrated death sequences. Wow. Every death scene was like a work of art. Beauty in destruction. These are not just their typical death sequences, these deaths were carefully constructed to shock and take full advantage of their situations. I loved every second of them, there is so much blood and chaos here, but with style. I will not ruin everything. <br /> <br /> Then there is the direction. Dude, there are some really original and beautiful photos. I loved the inventive use of the camera in this. You thought Tarantinos shot Kill Bill vol. 1 where do we see the bullet coming out of the gun chamber was original? Well, this is the movie he took! I honestly believe that Tarantino was heavily influenced by this particular film with certain scenes in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Heck in the making of it mentions that the whole scene with Beatrix in the hospital and Elle Driver coming to kill her was influenced by the Italian Giallos, and here my friends are proof of that. Anywhere, Tarantino references aside, this movie has some amazing camera photos, like those scenes of crows flying in the crowd in the opera house ... great stuff. And the main reason why Argentos has become one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The performance of most of the cast was good, but the best by far was Cristina Marsillach as the tortuous young opera singer Betty. Her looks while the murders were being committed were great. The rest of the cast was a bit of wood and hard, but nothing that could stop their enjoyment in the movie. <br /> <br /> There were few things I did not like about this movie. The first logic was thrown out the window in certain scenes. Especially those involving reactions from Bettys after she saw the murders. It seems to me that for a long time she just talked about her business, not telling anyone about the whole thing. Not even the police. I mean, if you see someone brutally murdering a loved one in front of your eyes ... you will not walk away from the crime scene and go on with your life. Someone would have linked her to the murders. She may even have become suspicious ... but no. Also the end is a bit anti-climatic. You will have to see this to understand, but it seemed a bit unnecessary the way the movie ended, it looked like it could have ended sooner. It would not have been so redundant. But that's about it, they're no big problems for me really since I was enjoying the rest of this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I still have a lot of Argento territory to cover ... but I'm devouring every step of the way as if I were eating a platter of the most expensive caviar. These people are very good. I think of his films as works of art, and I only saw two of them! I can not wait to find out the rest of your movies. Argento, you're the guy! <br /> <br /> Rating: 41/2 from 5
