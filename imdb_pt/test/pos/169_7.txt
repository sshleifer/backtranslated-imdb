This movie is great. Film slasher of the 80s about three children born during an eclipse, so they kill all who see. The reason they kill makes almost no sense, but only increases the charm of this movie. And these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. If you saw the movie, you know who I'm talking about. That boy is vicious! Although the film does not have a lot of blood, it's fun and for some reason you care about the characters. It also has some nice nudity. It has some decent acting, well, a decent 80's movie, it's worth taking a look if you get the chance to see it. You'll have nightmares about those damn kids, I assure you!
