This set of two discs is amazing! If you're like me and never had the opportunity to actually see the band live, then this is the next best thing. Jimmy Page, who in my opinion is the second best guitarist to walk the face of the Earth (second only to Slowfingers himself), he does an incredible show in every part of the film. John Paul Jones, though not as honest as Page, puts on an infernal show. Although in the live atmosphere, his bass rhythmic lines are not as definite as in studio recordings, except, of course, in songs like Dazed and Confused or What Is and What Should Be Be), but his wide variety of instinctive talents is well displayed on these DVD's. John Bonham is John Bonham, what can I say? There is no comparison, their beats stand out like no other and this DVD is a test. Last but not least, Robert Plant regrets how no one else can regret it. If you've read Hammer of the Gods, you're wondering the same as Page when you first met Robert Plant, why the hell is not this guy famous? And so concludes my comment, sorry and spelling or grammatical errors, Zeppelin rocks.
