I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it attracted a huge crowd and a rather intense discussion. I really admired the story and the visual approach. The action is scary and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is incredible. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not only in the desert, but also in the city. My best scene was after the boy discovered his friends in the apartment and then rode his skateboard through all the city's remarkable lights. You really feel for this guy. I've never heard of the actors before, but I really enjoyed the three of them. I think they did a great job on their journey to self-discovery. All in all, this is an incredibly cool suspense thriller. I still carry many of the images in my mind.
