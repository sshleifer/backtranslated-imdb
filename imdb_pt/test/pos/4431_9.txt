As a practicing architect of over 30 years, my heart ached and rejoiced with the film and is very direct, despite honesty and emotional sincerity. <br /> <br /> I had the honor of seeing this movie being shown in Chicago at the National Convention of the American Institute of Architects. The film was presented by Daniel, and he was kind enough to have a question and answer session later. Throughout the film's presentation, there was no sound, no cough, no distraction. The entire audience sat hypnotized, and the true delight, was Daniel's mother was present during the film's screening. <br /> <br /> I will always remember the movie, and touch it constantly in my mind every time I listen to the soundtrack ...
