I really liked this movie. Yes, there was disrespect throughout the film, but Bruce Willis learned from The Kid that there is more value in caring about others, and his life of disrespect needs to change. This movie was a refreshing change from the rubbish that Hollywood is trying to push our throats. There are some very good lessons to be learned in this film. I truly believe this was one of the best of Disney even though some things could have been left out. I was impressed by the lack of profanity and lack of sexual inuends. It is not perfect, but much better than anything else.
