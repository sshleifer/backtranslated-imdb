Being the second of Chaplin's Essanay films, CARMEN is a parody of Cecil B. Demille's drama with the same title. It is obvious that Demille's renowned film did not impress the comedy king so much, which he later admitted in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> Parodies were not a new experiment for Chaplin. He had already done several of them, namely PRE-HISTORICAL HIS PAST and HIS NEW JOB, and would continue to do so until the end of his film career (for example, A KING IN NEW YORK). Chaplin makes a very good portrait of Don Jose, and Edna Purviance's as good as Carmen. Do not act as we are accustomed; Charlie is not the kind Tramp, and Edna is far from being an innocent little woman, but that was not Chaplin's intention either. BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is a somewhat strange, very different Chaplin movie, but it does include good material, though. <br /> <br /> The main story is, though very different, structured, as in the original drama. Don Jose is very in love with Carmen, but he is not alone in this field; "Carmen, Carmen, (a) beautiful Carmen, is loved by all men under the age of 96," but he has the great advantage of being an officer, and there we are; this is the famous story about rivalry, love, greed and honor, from a humorous perspective. Thanks to the performances of Chaplin and Purviance, and to the wonderful and wonderful music of George Bizet, which I greatly admire, this could be an almost comedy masterpiece, it's time to be taken into consideration. It could have been. But, alas, although it is a good and good comedy, I do not think it fair to blame the people who claim that THE BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is far from being a masterpiece. But it is important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with the lack of talent, but rather with the result of business-related conflicts. When Chaplin refused to re-sign Essanay's contract after completing his latest film for the company, POLICE, they took revenge by editing all the scenes that Chaplin originally edited at CARMEN. Thanks to that, the film is a bit confusing and has several nonsensical scenes that are more annoying than funny, and the movie turned out to be a feature of Ben Turpin - Turk played Patchs - than a short Chaplin. Of course, Chaplin was in despair when he found out what Essanay had done, and had to stay in bed for several days. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, a BURLESQUE DE CARMEN is highly recommended for Chaplin fans and fans of beautiful music.
