Strange and slow pursuit means that it has a rhythm and ... interesting and unique. Fortunately, there is no other stupid shot on top. I thought that would suck at first, I ended up getting involved ... good treasure ... good job! I have hopes that no one dissects this movie. When the entire movie unfolds, you have many unique twists, impossible to determine what will be next. The characters are human and have honor or not ... passion or not ... forgiveness or not. He ended up loving the White Horse, the Indian, the Same damn desert. It's OK.
