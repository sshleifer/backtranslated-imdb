I hope so and how can I get involved? <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic and full of laughter, adventure and a star of all the 80's! <br /> <br /> What happens when you gather a group of athletes and sororiety, a group of nerds of debate, a bunch of misfits and pair of cousins? <br /> <br /> A load of laughter you'll have to beg for more! David Naughton stars as Adam, the leader of the "yellow team," a kind and fun college counselor who helps students with everything from getting the classes they want for their first encounters. <br /> <br /> Your enemy is Harold. , the leader of the "blue team," played with fury by Stephen Furst of "Babylon 5," the good son of a wealthy former college athlete with trophies enough to leave any room jealous. <br /> <Put the two together and play a "red team", a "white team" and a "green team", an unbelievable "vision" in an observatory, consequences of miniature golf cheating, super tour at the Pabst B lue Brewery Ribbon, and a hateful old-time owner among other adventures, and you have all the ingredients of a night to remember! Look for appearances by Michael J. Fox, Eddie Deezen and director Andy Tennant in one of the last films he starred before becoming a director and you have a star, hilarious, cast. <br /> <br /> The only downside to this movie was the performance of Debra Clinger as Laura. She overcame too much, but the rest of the film is so good that it can simply be ignored. <br /> <br /> I own this movie and I can never watch it enough! <br /> <br />
