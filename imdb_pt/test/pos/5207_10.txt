If we compare the film industry with the ocean, we have the tendency to observe only the surface. Driven by the strong Hollywood marketing force, we've all seen war movies like Private Ryan's Rescue, The Fine Red Line, Apocalypse Now, or Full Metal Jacket. But underneath the spirits grow quiet, now and then, lesser-known pearls. When you choose one and look closely at it, you wonder why this pearl is almost unknown and why it is not yet in the crown. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is a gem. Why, do you have a lot of multi-million dollar actors? No. Do you have thousands of extras? No. It has breathtaking, spectacular computerized visuals. Not at all. So, what is so special? Well, in a word, it's pure past reality re-created and transposed into celluloid fifty years later. The tragedy of the bloodiest battle in history is here. Filthy and wounded soldiers, Russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion, burning villages, collapsed buildings, deteriorated suburbs, bonfires, explosions, burning tanks, soldiers shot, burned alive, ground by tanks in their wells or shattered - all. But the real horror is somewhere else. People are reduced to mere pawns, without the power to change anything. The soldiers that we follow in the film try to leave the zone of combat and they fail. The civilians are in prostration in the middle of nowhere, crying only because their children are dead. Without mercy, the huge war-grinding machine melts humans, equipment, villages, cities - and calls for more victims and destruction, more and more. <br /> <br /> Amid all this collective insanity, a group of German soldiers struggle to survive and maintain at least a minimal level of normalcy. They do their duty and fight bravely. But, as everyone knows, a battle is almost lost when people begin to lose faith and trust. We see how all these people are abandoned, how they plan to desert, how they struggle to get the last plane to Berlin (full of wounded), how some very badly wounded soldiers were treated like simulators and shot, how they were forced to execute a small group of Russian civilians, including a boy, as they later discovered a place literally filled to the ceiling of food and drink - intended only to some "top" officers, of course. One by one, they fall dead. The finale of the film is one of the most bitter, depressing and moving finals I've ever seen, all about the magnificent track of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. The war destroyed everything in its path. <br /> <br /> This film is a must see for everyone. A true lover of movies must have it in your collection. The strong anti-war message should be a warning to all of us. Unfortunately, mankind never learns even politicians. Self-destruction is in our DNA and human pain seems to last forever. Can we be reasonable enough to stop the war?
