I must say that this has to be the best documentary I've ever seen in my life. I first say the movie at my friends' house and I did not get a chance to finish watching it. From that point on, I spent my free time trying to find the movie. I never met, but on my birthday, my friend who knew I had more trouble finding the film, got it for me as a gift. Sean Penn does a great job of telling the documentary. I loved how it told the story of each of the Z-Boys and the history of Dogtown. I've been to and around Venice many times, and never knew what had happened, until I saw the documentary. I did not get a chance to see the movie, and I heard it was not even close to the documentary. I do not know if I really want to see the movie, but who knows.
