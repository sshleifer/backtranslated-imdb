I was fortunate to have seen this movie at the Seattle Film Fest screening, and was impressed by how great it was. This is undoubtedly one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen, (and I've seen a lot!) This is a loving look back at the life and times, music and relationships of one of the true legends of music. Harry Nilsson deserves to be up there with names like Gershwin, Cole Porter and all the other great songwriters of the twentieth century. He was considered a pair by all four members of the Beatles, who called him the 5th Beatle, and one with the same wavelength as themselves. <br /> <br /> Harry refused to tour, so many do not remember him today. and those born after their heyday do not know who he was. This is tragic. Everyone should have the opportunity to expose themselves to this wonderful talent. This movie is a step in the right direction, to finally give man what he deserves. Unfortunately, the film still has to have wide distribution, or even a DVD, for now, good luck in getting to see it. <br /> <br /> If you are someone with the power to mount a DVD distribution Please contact the filmmakers. This movie must be available. Hey VH-1, how about crawling it in the air then maybe put it on DVD? Harry Nilsson deserves nothing less.
