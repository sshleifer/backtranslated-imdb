Last night I had the incredible pleasure of watching the movie Hitch. I was stunned and stunned. Will Smith did a phenomenal job in a role that he is not always associated with. He has proven once and for all that he does not need to be holding a gun to be a great actor in a movie. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit I always liked him in "The King of Queens," but that role really brought him to light more, and I hope to see him on the big screen a lot more in the near future. The movie was funny and adorable and I would highly recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could imagine. The mix of comedy, romance and drama left me full. It's nothing like most "girls movies" in the sense of tears and sadness, but it retains its own and I think it can be equally appreciated by males and females. I encourage all couples especially to watch this movie, but even if you're not involved with someone, you can get some great ideas from Hitch. <br /> <br /> TWO GREAT THIGH ROADS !!!
