Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge follows the lives of two criminals: Vogel (Gian Maria Volontè), a murderer who gives the cops the glide while he is transferred from one city to another by train; and Corey (Allain Delon), a burglar recently released from prison. Fate decides to join these two men to perform a spectacular assault. In the background there is Matei (André Bourvil), Detective Vogel escapes, relentless in his pursuit and sometimes relentless in his methods. Throughout the film, the viewer meets other smaller but fascinating characters, the best of whom is Jansen (Yves Montand), a former dishonorable police officer and an excellent marksman. <br /> <br /> Melville has such a unique style that one does not. I do not need to watch many of your movies to watch. Le Samourai, Un Flic and Le Cercle Rouge are clearly made of the same fabric: the symmetrical angles; the long shots; the silences; coats and hats and cigars; the quote at the beginning; the incredible assaults, fatalism; the criminal life without glamor and inglorious. Everything that is great in Melville is present here at its best. <br /> <br /> And his shortcomings did not bother me so much this time: the illogical, disconcerting behavior of his characters and confusing stories, which detracted from my enjoyment of his other films, are almost invisible here. Since Le Cercle Rouge preceded Un Flic, this does not mean that it has improved over time; maybe I'm just getting used to it and attaining a mentality that does not bother me anymore. <br /> <br /> Melville has made unique crime films. As old as they can be, they show more naivety, realism, and grace than modern techno-thrillers, in which entertaining thieves use computer systems and James Bond-esquire apparatus to perform impossible crimes. Melville's criminals are not cool: they are lonely, socially clumsy, and probably aware that they are not good for much more than planning robberies. They are unwanted from society, living at night, always one step ahead of the police in a game that they know they will eventually lose. There is nothing romantic about them. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, for such a movie, cops are not complete idiots, either. Matei is intelligent, smart, patient and even compassionate. He's not a villain or a cliché, he's just an old man doing his job and doing it right. He knows when to use force and when to use brains. Many movies could learn from it. <br /> <br /> It's this realistic style that makes Melville movies so fun to watch and puts you on a special pedestal as one of the great masters of cinema.
