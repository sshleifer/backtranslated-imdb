This era was not only the emergence of sound in cartoons, but of a cartoon character who would go down in history as the world's most famous mouse. Yes, Mickey makes his debut here, in this joyous tale of life aboard a steamboat. The animation is good for your time, and the plot - albeit a bit simple - is quite cheerful. A true classic, and if you manage to put it on video, you will not regret it.
