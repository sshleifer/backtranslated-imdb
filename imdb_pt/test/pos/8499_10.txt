My wife wanted to see this movie and I was reluctant. I've never been a big fan of the biopic - believing that cinema is more exciting when it's not structured in non-fiction. Besides, although I really enjoy Ray Charles's music, I do not consider myself a fan of him or his music. <br /> I hoped to suffer or go through this movie. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This is an engaging story told in a classic cinematic style. Realism lies in the nuances - the tilt of a character's head after a dramatic moment or the look in his eyes as they sing. I literally found myself involved in this movie during the course of viewing it. <br /> <br /> Jaime Foxx, of which much has been said, spearheads a cast of immaculate recreators of not just a time, but an ERA, a life that never existed for those under forty. This film sinks the audience in time without the grandiose tricks and panoramas of the Titanic or other pieces of that period. This movie does not feature the music scene of the 50s and 60s, it takes you there. <br /> <br /> This is a film about Ray Charles, but his appreciation should not be limited to the history of his film. life. This is the kind of movie, like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List, which does what a movie should do - bring you somewhere else, another time.
