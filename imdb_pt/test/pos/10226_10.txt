I absolutely love this movie. I just got a copy and kept it to watch for my birthday. This movie begs several questions. One and. Who are the monsters of this world? Being different is just that. Different. The real monsters hide behind masks of ordinariness. They are the ones that everyone considers "a good quiet face" that "does not bother anyone". Or worse are the characters as played by Croneberg. Men who draw pleasure and power by carving people and creating their own Blood Books. I love shapeshifters, people with gifts and those who can be abominable for people to look at. This movie touches and explores what is normal. Who are "others" and what does fear do for some. Even though I have given this film, I am still fed up with women who either scream or are so neat that they can not see what is happening and be a vehicle for the things that have destroyed Median. My other complaint was because they never made a second movie. I would at least have loved to see a continuation of this most intriguing story that keeps me captivated from beginning to end.
