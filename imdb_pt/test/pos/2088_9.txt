I watched "9 souls" at the 12th Athens International Film Festival (September 2006), where Toshiaki Toyoda, the film's director, was also present and answered many questions from the audience. This road movie is about 9 fugitives, all characters very different from each other. They decide to be together traveling with their red van through Japan. Every time the van stops, we see these 9 fugitives trying to escape the past to build a new life or realize a dream. However, no matter how much they try, it seems impossible and their violent past comes after them and leads them to their ultimate destruction. <br /> <br /> Although it is a very pessimistic film, it is not a dark movie. On the contrary, it is full of beautiful images, surreal elements and elegant humor. Toyoda's heroes can not escape their "prison" and face a divine punishment (?) For their "crimes." They are small pieces of a beautiful painting, where the Tokyo tower portrayed as a huge upside-down knife prevails!
