I am not surprised that this short black and white film that was made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called "ottepel" or "the thaw" has won so much love and admiration among film lovers in Worldwide. It's sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes seem to have been made ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative breakthroughs have been included in textbooks and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by the merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman. It is also the film about loyalty, memories, ability to live when it seems that there is nothing to live; it's about forgiveness and about hope. The film received (with absolute merit) the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as the winner of a special prize in Cannes for playing Veronika, the happy young woman in love with the best man in the world at the beginning of the Festival. movie. After the separation with his beloved who went forward, the loss of his family on the pump tour, and the marriage with the man she never loved and only wished he never existed, she turned to the shadow of herself, she was dead inside. His long journey to redemption, to finally accept the death of his beloved and learn to live with her, is fascinating and moving and simply will not leave any onlooker indifferent. <br /> <br /> For me, the film is very personal and dear because I was born and raised in the city where his characters lived and were so happy at first. I walked the same streets, squares, and bridges over the Moskva River. All families of the former Soviet Union have lost at least one, but often more than one family member in combat, concentration camp, ghetto or starvation, cold and illness during World War II and my family is no exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healed the pain of loss, not just of movies and books. "Cranes are Flying" speaks to me with clarity and honesty and touches me very deeply. It is a masterpiece of cinema, but it is part of my life - my past, my memory and my past.
