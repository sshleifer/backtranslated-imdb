Of all the Mafia movies I've seen this is one of the best for many reasons. The performance of Pesci, Cortese and Vincent. The story is one of the best ever (in the mafia genre), as realistic. Characters are people that many other people can relate to. This movie is also great because the dialogue is good. It also has very realistic fights and action scenes. This film also launched the careers of Pesci and Vincent. If it were not for the success of this movie, the Casino and the Goodfellas may not have been as good as they were. <br /> <br /> History 10/10 Acting 9/10 Realism 10/10 <br /> <br /> TOTAL 10/10 <br /> <br /> My favorite mafia movies are <br /> 1: Goodfellas 2: Casino 3: The Godfather Trilogy 4: Enforcer Family (The Death Collector) 5: The Sopranos (I Know It's Not a Movie)
