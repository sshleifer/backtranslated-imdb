Of course I'll think it was a great movie. I recognized several people I did not see during filming as well. It was I who was throwing the guard about an hour into the movie on the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette. I also changed that scene. Initially, they had prepared to go to the playground and straighten the inmate and deliver it and take it out. The director said, "It's taking too long, what would you do Gower?" I said, "We need to get in and hook your arms and drag you back. That way, your camera can stay on your face while we take it off the set." I also lived in this same prison as a child, because my father was the assistant security director. I am also a current employee of the Tennessee Deaprtment of Corrections as a supervisor at Riverbend's Maximum Security Institution. Although much of the film was a joke, the part I was in was reality enough. Also on the bar scene, the dancer kicking high in the air and coming off the stage was a stripper with whom I used to work at a club called "The Classic Cat."
