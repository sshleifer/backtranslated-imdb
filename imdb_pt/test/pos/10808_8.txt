If there were two parts in which the physically tall, ugly and charismatic actor GÃ©rard Depardieu was born, as a Frenchman, to play, it must have been Cyrano de Bergerac and the speaker Georges Danton. Here he dominates the film both by the breadth of his shoulders and by the power of his voice; his charisma takes the part despite the fact that it is clear that the character has as much blood in his hands as the rest of them. Danton celebrates while the people of Paris starve ... but he is the only man who can challenge the tyranny imposed by the dreaded Public Safety Committee in the name of "freedom", and he is presented as the hero of the film - despite the fact that the fountain game practically idolizes his opponent Robespierre! <br /> <br /> For those who know the characters in the story, there is an interest in identifying the smaller parts: Tallien frog, Couthon the cripple, Fouquier-Tinville, court solicitor, energetic painter St-Just, epic painter David. But the script does not give much importance in this respect; names usually arrive late if secondary characters are identified, and there is no Hollywood-style info-dump to ensure that the audience can put events in their historical context. The movie takes for granted that you know what happened before, and what will happen next - sometimes it takes a lot to be granted, as when it depends on a near knowledge of the dates to give at the foot of the stone the fact that Robespierre Danton followed soon to the scaffold. Considered as a movie, it is not entirely satisfactory, as it is gone until the end. The structure of the story leads to a major confrontation between the protagonists in the courtroom or some dramatic climax to the trial, which, thanks to history, never really happens. Things simply fail: there is no revolt, there is no overthrow of tyranny, there is no supposition of power for the winner, there is no triumph on either side. It may be historically accurate, but not entirely satisfying as the result of a screen scenario - it seems like a strange place to stop. As others have commented, it may have been more logical to take the events to the end of the Terror and show in apposition the fall of Robespierre.
