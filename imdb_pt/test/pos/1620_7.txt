As is the case with many such films, my non-Catholicism prevented me from understanding it. The church has this mass of rules that have been gathered over the centuries. We have little time to learn them and accept them by face value. So throw some bandits avenging themselves for a long and distant act against them, working under these rules and trying to get around them, and you have this book and movie. I found myself thinking, "That's really cool. Why did they do this?" There is this casual thing in the character of Robert Langdon, where no matter what the problem, he always seems to take the first step right. I suppose it's like watching the CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know the configuration of the earth. In this movie, there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is happening. But if you create Robert Langdon, you need to put it to work. All right, because heroic nerds like him save the day forever. I found the movie amusing. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think. It's a wonder to look at and it never stops for a second.
