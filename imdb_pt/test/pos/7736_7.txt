William Shakespeare probably did not imagine Stephanos as a gay doctor, Antonio as a faithless wife, or Caliban as a goat herder with a trinitron, but the bard had done worse for his good work over time, and may even appreciate the sumptuous contest of life. this is his "Tempest" as reconfigured by Paul Mazursky and co-writer Leon Capetanos. <br /> <br /> This time, Prospero is Philip Dimitrius (John Cassevetes), a Manhattan architect tired of designing Atlantic City. casinos for the amiable Mafioso Alonso (Vittorio Gassman), especially after discovering Alonso is having an affair with the wife of Philip Antonia (Gena Rowlands). Along with his daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald), Philip flees to a remote Greek island with Miranda and his new lover, Aretha (Susan Sarandon), a good Catholic girl who struggles with Philip's bachelor lifestyle. Will a sudden storm bring everything right in the end? <br /> <br /> Here's a thought about the career of Cassevetes: How many other actors could make a movie so confusing in something so fascinating? A darling of film critics of his previous work, often with his wife Rowlands, in real life, he features a central character who really suffers for his art here, but seems to enjoy himself and makes us like him too. It is not Prospero, but something rich and strange that contributes to a tremendous change of seas. <br /> <br /> "It's all here," he tells one of his faithful companions, Aretha's dog, Nino. "Beauty, magic, inspiration and serenity." It is. "Tempest" transfers 1611 from London to 1982 in Manhattan and finds some pleasant resonances in the displaced life of Philip. "Show me the magic," he calls a city skyscape, and Mazursky's version, augmented by the excellent cinematography of Donald McAlpine's purple sea landscapes and naturally sun-burnt Greek landscapes, does just that. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie, by any means. In fact, the grand finale, which is the only part of the film that follows Shakespeare's plot in any measure, is a mess. Rowland's character is hard to care for in this film, and after meeting Sarandon in all his glory without a bra, it is difficult to understand Philip's continued concern with his wife, let alone his desire to make an unfortunate "sacrifice" in order of restoring the natural order of things. <br /> <br /> But there is much to love in "Tempest". In addition to Cassavetes, there is the debut of Ringwald's film as his loyal but restless daughter, here as in the play an object of desire for primitive rustic "Kalibanos" (Raul Julia). Ringwald is the same teenage muse of the privileged adolescence that would inspire John Hughes, but with an emotional depth in which the last films of Hughes did not deepen. Ringwald and Julia have never received Oscar attention, but both have won the Golden Globe for their playful work here. He tries to seduce her on island isolation with her TV replays "Gunsmoke" in Greek, tempted by her 15-year-old body. "I want to balonga you with my bonny johnny" Kalibanos declares, being pushed aside, but winning our sympathy anyway, especially after playing "New York, New York" with a choir of goats. (When "Tempest" hit the screens, Julia fought with Broadway as the protagonist of "Nine.") <br /> <br /> It's the Mazursky show, even though sometimes Cassavetes is dealing with improvised things readings and emotional collapses in abundance. (Philip introduces himself to Aretha saying "I'm in the middle of a nervous breakdown.") He plays his character as an obsessive kind, seeking to crystallize his happiness by building a theater on his uninhabited island. <br /> <br /> Adding to the pleasure is Gassman's performance as the other man, who is as completely amiable as Julia when telling a young man obsessed with Philip: "Boys do not have half the money we have. I'm nervous ... and they make love in the backseat of an old sports car. "Despite being overbearing and pretentious in spots, like so many art films," Tempest "is fun in its excesses and a trip very similar to the of Shakespeare, even though his dreams did not involve smoking marijuana behind the scenes of a Go-Gos show.
