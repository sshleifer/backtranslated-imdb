I know little or nothing about astronomy, but still; I was, at first, a bit skeptical about the plot of this movie. He follows three children who were born during a solar eclipse and therefore have no emotion, and thus (of course) become relentless serial killers. The plot sounds ridiculous at first, but once you realize that a solar eclipse blocks Saturn and, as you know, Saturn is the planet of emotion, everything fits; makes perfect sense and it is then that you know that you are not simply watching another silly 80's slasher with a cerebral pea plot. Thank God for that! Seriously, however, Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise, but more than makes up for its originality. Having a bunch of kids hovering over people may not be the most ingenious mastermind ever seen in the movies, but when given the choice between this and another bland clone on Friday, 13 - I know what I'd choose. <br /> <br /> Also helping out the movie out of the hole that some people think is silly storyline dug is the fact that it is extremely fun. Many slashers become stereotyped very quickly and the audience ends up simply watching to see some blood. This film, however, continues with some great scary performances by children (which reminiscent of frightening children's classics such as Village of the Damned), a steady stream of sickly humor and a small but impressive for the kind of movie, suspense dose and tension. One thing I really enjoyed about this movie was the wide range of weapons. There is nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon several times (coughing cough Halloween), but it is not the case here as Bloody Birthday finds space for everything from skipping bows to bows and arrows. There was no room for a chainsaw, which is a great shame, but I suppose not every film can have a chainsaw on it.
