I got some free tickets from the Times to see this little Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing' ... I did not know anything about it, so I did not have any bias before entering. <br /> <The movie is about two guys who are confined in their wheelchairs and live in a house. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from muscular dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, since Rory seems to be the only person capable of understanding what Michael is saying. They end up leaving the house to live alone in an apartment in Carrigmore. They immediately employ the help of an attractive girl (Romola Garai) to care for them. The two friends end up falling in love with the same woman. That's the story in a nutshell but there are lots of laughs and tears along the way ... actually ... being unprepared as I was ... I found the tears were flowing very often! Indeed! I do not think I've cried so much watching a movie since The Elephant Man !!! This movie is a huge drain on the emotions ... both fun and sad things. The performance is absolutely perfect! James McAvoy is my tip for greatness ... he is a great Irish actor and I think he has a great future ahead of him. Steven Robertson, who plays Michael, was also excellent ... and it was only today that I discovered that he does not suffer from Cerabal Palsy and it was just an excellent performance! Brenda Fricker is also in this movie, and plays the Home Manager very well. The other great part has to be Romola Garai, she was wonderful as the love interest, and I think we'll be seeing more of her on the big screen in the near future! <br /> <br /> What makes this movie work is not only the synergies between the two leads, but the script ... which is so so witty #### that it's literally on fire! I still can not help repeating some of the lines in my head by now. <br /> <br /> The picture is good, though very somber, but then it is capturing a certain type of area of ​​Ireland. The music is great in this movie as well as the choice in Songs ... the use of Johnny Cash's cover of the Nine Inch Nails 'Hurt' track is inspired !! <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize this movie in one word ... it would be "emotional." This movie is very funny ... and then, at the turn of a coin, it's very sad! I still can not believe that even two days after watching the movie, looking back, I laughed and almost cried! This movie is incredible ... and I hope it goes far! Although I may not see this, as your advertising budget is probably very small! <br /> <br /> So go and see! I recommend it ... you will not regret it ...
