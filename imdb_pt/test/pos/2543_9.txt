This is a wonderful movie, about a soul of Ale. This is a journey into the heart of Ale. I found it fascinating. The director did a great job. He makes the scenes speak. Especially in the silent scenes. Ale's window is great. The scenes when he's in bed are one of the best directed scenes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In addition to driving. It's been a long time since I watched a movie about a soul. As a philosopher, I can say that this film proves that age does not matter about your soul. So as the soul of Ale. <br /> <br /> Since I live in Turkey, I do not care about the other side of NY. This is a universal scene that you can see all over the world. As for my more universal opinion than anything else. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie. Otherwise, you will lose a great deal on a soul. If you have one. <br /> <br /> Baris.Sentuna
