This movie would be considered controversial today, but it's still very funny. The racial stereotype is made from the point of view of humor and not hatred. This movie shows and shows how corrupt politicians were already in the early 1930s. This film proves that it began before the 1970s and later, when it accelerated in the United States. Lloyd is still in his typical genre here, though his character was raised in China. The meaning of a Cat's Paw in this case is a person who is running for political office but is being used by the established political machine to advance his agenda. In other words, they think this guy (Lloyd) is harmless when he runs into the office. Then, when he is elected, he surprises them. <br /> <br /> This same theme is used later in the James Stewarts movie, Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Stewarts is more famous and has a stronger message. This film is smarter and subtle, which are trademarks of Harold Lloyds. <br /> <br /> There is still the heart of the romantic comedy hidden with the facade of the film, but the current audience would still enjoy the political humor and the ending is absolutely invaluable. I wish someone could beat the political system today in this way. I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this movie and felt like wishing Harold had done more like it during the 1930s. At least we have this one. I think the most cited person in the film is the fictional Ling Po. I always thought Confusicus was the wiser, but this makes me believe that China's wisdom is not limited to it and it is a vast field of comedy Lloyd extracted in this film.
