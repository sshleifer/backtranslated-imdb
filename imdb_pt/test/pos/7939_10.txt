I saw this movie with a live performance of the Buffalo Philharmonic, and music was one of two things that definitely made the experience for me; particularly the music after the battle in which the woman is looking for her husband was devastating. The other thing that stood out to me is the battle against the ice itself, a bit of strategy pulled out completely by the creators of "King Arthur" in 2004. Also, the battle lasts forever (half an hour?) - painfully long. I can not think of another propaganda film that makes war seem less glamorous or rewarding. It surprises me that Stalin really liked this film; I would not want to go out and fight after watching.
