I watched this movie again yesterday with a 20-year intern from my office (OK - it was the quiet day after Thanksgiving) and we both loved it. I love the unique plot, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer and the way the dog is waiting at the door. Is not it part of each of us like that dog after someone we love dies? <br /> <br /> I also love the old men in the restaurant - they remind me of some of the older people in southern New England, where their ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion. And I love the wedding in the end. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is great in this movie - and Bonnie Hunt should have won a prize for everything. <br /> <br /> Bonnie - make more movies!
