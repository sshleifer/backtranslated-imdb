After seeing this movie, I came to the conclusion that Drew Barrymore is a great actress. This movie would not have been watched without Drew. The fact that someone as cute as Drew, could really make me disgusting, and she did when she was "Josie Grossie". His "transition" attempts, as the cool girls called them, were hilarious, especially her trying to dance at the nightclub. <br /> <br /> We also had SNL's favorite singer, Molly Shannon, playing a large part as Anita, Josie's best friend. One of the funniest scenes in the movie was Anita trying to teach class sex education. This was one of Mollys' funniest performances and the best. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski also played a big role and I really felt for her because I know people like her who were tortured like that. <br /> This film is a must see for Drew Barrymore fans because Drew does the movie.
