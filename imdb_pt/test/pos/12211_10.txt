I wish they would bring it back to the surface. I really enjoyed the show along with my family. I felt that the plot's development and plot were first-rate. As the other person said, it seems that everything comes down to the lowest common denominator. Nothing but bland and politically correct trash survives. Just look at the internet to see how many people were watching the show. It's also not cool to leave us out on what happened to all the characters in the show. This is the same thing that happened to the time travel show that I think was called 8 days, but it should have been called a backstep. Did the Olympics kill the surface? I know the writers killed another of my favorite shows years ago called the greatest American hero.
