Forget some of the tearful (and useless) comments left here by some. This series is well executed, well filmed, and makes a refreshing change for most of the pap on the TV. <br /> <br /> Any idiot may need anything. However, in this series the characters are believable, intriguing and compelling story lines (but require some intelligence from the viewer), overall it's nice, and it's British! (We occasionally invented some gems, and that's one of them). <br /> <br /> The shows have an hour each and I think there are four of them together (at least I only saw four of them). The show clearly impressed some US TV stations that did a longer series that was not nearly as attractive despite the larger budget. <br /> <br /> If you like soap and reality shows, you will not like it or understand it. Hour.
