This is a fun surreal road movie. It was written by Joseph Minion, who also wrote After Hours, the excellent surreal film by Martin Scorsese. The film follows the adventures of a ten-year-old boy named Gus, who drives a red Ford Mustang in some fictional states with names like Tristana (perhaps a tribute to Luis Bu√±uel's film?), Essex & South Lyndon, in search of eight elusive Motorama game cards from various gas stations at Chimera Company. The film has a surreal feel because many things are unusual, like money, for example, which is like a blank paper with numbers. Most of the characters are unpleasant to Gus at work. trip. They tattoo him, punch him, but that does not stop the boy from his relentless quest. Some eccentric actors like David Lynch in power Jack Nance, Meat Loaf & Flea also make appearances. Jack Nance plays a motel owner, who when he meets Gus tells him, "If you see some squirrel, give it to me." This is a movie in which a man and his wife abandon their small children because the man owes Gus $ 100; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder when he speaks grossly. If you're a fan of Twin Peaks and Surreal movies, you'll enjoy this. A strange little gem from a movie.
