To be totally honest, I did not expect to much partake of the 9 Souls, even after reading compliments on it, but to say that I was surprised would be a big euphemism, in short, I was totally delighted. <br /> <br /> The basic plot is as simple as they come, nine inmates ranging from a drug dealer to the escape of several prison killers and go in search of a secret stock that is presumed to be hidden money wrought by one tenth. detainees who cracked and were dragged by guards shortly before their escape, but it is the direction that director Toshiaki Toyoda takes this simple story that is so brilliant and original perfectly mixing drama, comedy and violence creating a kind of movie that deserves to be seen only fans of Asian cinema, but cinema in general. <br /> <br /> Superbly represented, emotional, funny, violent and sometimes very surreal, it's a movie that has it all.
