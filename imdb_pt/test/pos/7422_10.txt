Terry and June in my mind, it's an all-time classic along the ranks, blessing this house with the late sid james and the late diana coupland, but terry scott will miss it a lot even if he died in 1994. I have all dvds upto press and i'm looking forward to getting all 9, it would also be nice to see "happy after forever" released on dvd June whitfield is still going strong and terry scott will always live in my memory <br /> <br /> terry scott rip There are not many comedies nowadays that I might think will be on the list of legends and yes, the middle class party gets a few wicks, but I do not care, I think it would be shiny see some celebration life of terry scott
