I first saw this short when I bought a random DVD of short films a while ago. This is the only short on the DVD that I liked, but I do not just like it, I love it ... if you spend some time with me, you'll see. is beautiful, simple and passionate, no bells, no whistles - could have been made with a sharpie (but do not get me wrong, the animation is elegant and insightful - this person clearly spent a lot of time with cats - but it's just black and white) and then there's the writing and the music ... it's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> I eat chocolate, drink wine and watch again and again ... <br /> <br /> nothing else matters, I hope Pedro Serrazina will make up something else.
