Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It is the most unusual film of Werner Herzog. It does not have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we get a collection of pictures, words and songs that work wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this movie are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and amazing images. Herzog shoots into real mirages and we see cars and people floating in the middle of the desert that are not there, but hundreds of miles away reflected as in a mirror. The use of music in this movie is so brilliant - from Leonard Cohen, Mozart and Third Ear Band. Imagine Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in the Wilderness; This is how this movie is. This movie is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel as if your spirit had left your body. A must see. This will change the way you watch the movies. Rating: 10 out of 10.
