OK, so the following review is more of a synopsis than it actually contains spoilers, but prevention is better than cure, to avoid being blacklisted, right? Right! Consider yourself officially warned, and keep reading ... <br /> <br /> In this parody / tribute to the greatest moment in the history of horror films - the '80s - a group of stupid teenagers is gathering to perform a sitting at the home of the notorious Murder McGee, who killed his entire family a few years ago and buried them in the yard. As I'm sure you can guess, things go from bad to worse faster than you can say "Where's the meat?" and in the typical cinematic fashion of the 1980s, the killings are bloody, the dialogue is extravagant, and beautiful women take their clothes off as often as they can. Good times ... No clic or clich√© characterizations of horror films of the 80's are left without representation here. In fact, no stone was left on stone at all? we have the cool hero, his innocent girlfriend, the gothic girl, the tough brigand (think of John Bender), the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt, the shy idiot in love with the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt, a couple of beautiful semi-nude lesbians and two big geeks. <br /> <br /> As you can clearly see, the cast is quite large. Usually, the larger casts are where things can crumble quickly, with one or two sour apples popping the whole barrel. Not in this case though. Not a single member of the cast left me disappointed. The performance was very well done. Everyone from the cool hero in his Thriller jacket, played by Jovan Meredith, to goth Goth girl played by Renee Dorian for Geeks One & Two, played by Cory Assink and Jonathan Brett? they all played right, brought their A-game and knocked him out of the park. If you are a fan of Gary & Wyatt in Weird Science, you will immediately fall in love with the nerds. <br /> <br /> Director / co-writer Jeff C. Smith is a guy for the future, trust me on it. If this is what it can do with a low budget, there is nothing but good things ahead of it when it gets more money for future projects. The characters were dead; the atmosphere was perfect; the laughter was enormous; Did the blood flow, and squirted, and sprayed beautifully? It was like watching an 80's horror movie. Call this one "BREAKFAST meets DEMONS NIGHT" !!! The slogan says it all, and says honestly - "EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE, FREE NUDDESS, ZERO BUDGET" - no fake publicity here, folks! As fans of this genre, we have to look at the indies and support these workers who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales so we do not get stuck in a world full of great PG-13 studios. 'horror' or mindless remakes like The Hitcher. No, thanks - none of this for me. <br /> <br /> To conclude, I must say that STUPID ADOLESCENTS MUST DIE! is by far one of the best indie movies I've had the pleasure of watching this year. It's a bloody good time and it keeps on repeated views. From the dialogue to the characters, to the wardrobe ... even the love theme at the end of the final credits (which, if it did not bring laughter, reminiscent of REO Speedwagon-R's 80s ballads of power in each word starting with the letter 'R' - so I'll eat my DVD right now) ... the end line is, if you're a fan of 80's horror or horror in general, do not hesitate anymore - this movie deserves to be in your collection !!
