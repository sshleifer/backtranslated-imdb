Haines is excellent as the impetuous cadet who thinks West Point will really be something now that he has arrived. Haines displays his comic, easy and idiotic personality while facing West Point and Joan Crawford, the local beauty. Great fun for the first semester. And surprisingly playing after the character of Haines go too far and is almost avoided by fellow cadets. The new Haines, full of humility, receives the relief of a minute more to play in the game of soccer against the Navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. Big and exciting MGM entertainment in this Haines formula movie, shows Billy at his best. William Bakewell is also the smallest follower. The cute-but-goony character would be played by Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and others in the following decades, another view on the beautiful but daffy ladies played by Carole Lombard and Marion Davies. West Point is a winner!
