This film set the standard for African-American film excellence when it was made. I heard in several stories about the film through time, that there was a push for an Oscar nomination when it was released. This movie plays with multiple emotions, and you definitely feel for all the characters. Of course, some of the acting is a bit of wood, but fortunately, these parts are not essential. The music is sensational, and if you do not think the ending is a tear, you have no heart in the chest. If you watch "Cooley High", you'll see that many movies have copied various elements of it to strengthen their own films. The biggest example of this is "Boyz N The Hood".
