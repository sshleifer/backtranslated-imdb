Being an avid carpenter fan, I really loved this movie (although the wigs leave a lot to be desired!) And I agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of your life were missing or untouched. Anyway, that leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so I went to find out more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the movie, it is "real" and down to earth. Hope you like. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy. She is a singer (as well as a dancer) and I think that was the necessary advantage to create the character. Some other actresses may have struggled with it. It is as if the film did not go deep in its history. After all, this is the title of the film, but I felt we learned more about Richard, but I suppose, like any artist, it's worth it, you should always leave them wanting more!
