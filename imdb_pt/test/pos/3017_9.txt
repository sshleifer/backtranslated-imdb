THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> The Cell, like Antz, must be seen twice to be enjoyed. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was mediocre, but the movie had such a lasting impression on me after seeing it, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and found the film much more enjoyable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it shares its stories with quality and is a visually clever film that dreams of images and traces ideas that could not be combined. The film's script can be clumsy at times, as well as acting, but the visuals are resourceful and take the story surrounding an exotic and intriguing life. The Oscar-nominated make-up is also daring and careful, while the beautiful costumes and the totally bright decor have gone unnoticed. Tarsem Singh, who also directed video clips, completely goes crazy with his direction and turns out well. He has great talent and this movie has a lot of potential if you give it a chance. Overall, the cell phone is a powerful, disturbing and prevents being very tacky which makes a great watch nice.
