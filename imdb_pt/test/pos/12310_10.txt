I've been waiting for years for DEAD to come out on video, having pretty much used up my copy of VHS in pieces. This is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays. It happens on the Epiphany (Night of Kings) and is a simple and moving vignette of characters who attend a dinner prepared by three Dublin women. Central to the story is a loveless couple, a woman who loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife but feels incapable. All the performances are impressive, and the script interweaves the various dinner characters beautifully. Of course, his source material is James Joyce's tale on the same title, and much of his narrative structure is kept intact. John Huston's long career as one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting ending to this film, which was scripted by his son Tony Huston; star his daughter, Anjelica Huston; and is dedicated to his wife, Maricella. Thanks to Lions Gate for taking the rights to this movie and releasing it on DVD. For lovers of all things Irish or for people looking for a literate, subtle yet incredibly moving holiday film, this is a real gem.
