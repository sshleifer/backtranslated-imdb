Just Before Dawn is an excellent horror movie. It is atmospheric, full of tension made of wonderful scenes of wild nature, in which few young people find their misfortune in the form of two crazed and fat bastards who kill them. Jeff Lieberman is a very talented and intelligent director, who is unfortunately underestimated. He managed to build tension, not with blood, but with the display of a threatening environment of nature. Lieberman manages to construct a tension in a very linear and simplistic way, which is also the best way of not showing the viewer the blood, but letting him imagine the worst thing that happens to the characters. <br /> <br /> Before the Dawn is ever compared to the Saw Massacre, Deliverance and Hills have eyes. It's as beautiful as Liberation, better than Colinas, I mean creepier and better worked, and it's scary like The Chainsaw Massacre. <br /> <br /> JBD is one of the best horrors of the last few decades that finally lives on DVD!
