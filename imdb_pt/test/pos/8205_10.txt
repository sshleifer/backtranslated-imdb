This movie is a warning to all the people who were surfing the internet on a typical day at the office. My warning is, do not reveal much about yourself, 2 Beware of who you cross !! There are spies on this internet thing. I thought it was so scary what that combination of man and woman did to poor Angela Bennett, I did not realize anyone could take someone's life in a click of that mouse Angela, I thought she did a great job of fooling Jack Delvin and that horrible girl my question is, why does this computer make that noise when it works? as a click sound of mine does not do this or this. This movie also tells you that there is fraud on this internet. Also why did not Angela do the virus-wreaking program on a CyberCafe? I also thought that, like all computers, the transfer rate to the disk was slow, which is correctly portrayed in this movie, when you save the program on your floppy, the bar moves slowly !!! I really enjoyed Angela's house at the beginning of the movie too. Why did not anyone believe in Angela ???
