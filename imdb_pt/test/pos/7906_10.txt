It's really bad that no one knows about this movie. I think if it was just spruced up a bit and if it was not so cheap, I think one of the biggest movie companies could have wanted it. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 11, and I found it was so powerful with the many, but illegal, lengths that Mitchell just goes to keep his family together. That inspired me and surprises me now. If you're lucky enough to find a copy of this movie, do not miss it!
