Renoir's story about Paris, the Cancan, a washerwoman and the Moulin Rouge. A more discreet but very entertaining version of the opening of the Moulin Rouge. Jean Gabin gives his usual excellent performance. The Technicolor photograph on the print I saw was exquisite. An easy night vision. chris w galla
