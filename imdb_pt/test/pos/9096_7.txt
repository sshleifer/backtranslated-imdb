Originally I was a Tenacious D fan of their first album and of course I heard some tracks from The P.O.D. and was quite disappointed. After watching the movie, my vision changed. The film is pretty funny from start to finish and I found myself engaged in it even if it was a stupid plot because of the attitudes that KG and Jaybles portray in the film. <br /> <br /> Much more fun and enjoyable than the movies I've seen in theaters lately. ex. I saw III (boring and dragging), Casino Royale (path to homo-erotic) that in previous installments I really liked <br /> <br /> If you liked Borat, you will enjoy the tale of The Greatest Band on Earth
