The editors of the IMDb forum write a certain amount of lines, but all I really mean is, "This is an incredible movie, and you can not consider yourself a movie fan without having seen it." You must trust me and stop reading this review and get the movie and hit play. But I have to type something. So, let me stress the following: (1) River's Edge contains what can still be considered the best performance of Crispin Glover of all time in a movie, and if you're following Crispin Glover at all, you know that alone justifies giving it to 10. Funny lines in abundance. <br /> <br /> (2) River's Edge contains the second most memorable performance of Dennis Hopper's (besides Blue Velvet's) career, and it's really great. Dennis Hopper is really funny. <br /> <br /> (3) River's Edge holds the best performance of Keanu Reeves' career, and is excellent. It was the role he was born to play. It has many good lines, but one in particular is actually very funny. Listen well when your character and stepfather are talking. <br /> <br /> Still, the best stoner movie is so much more than that. It tends to appear in the drama sections of the movie rental companies, but if this is a drama, it is the funniest drama of all time.
