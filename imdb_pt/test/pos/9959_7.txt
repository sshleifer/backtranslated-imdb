William Shakespeare's plays are classified as comedy, tragedy or history. Some of his most memorable - and often read - creations give us melancholy humor, gentle poetry and hilarious antics. Some of them survive as unforgettable dramas of compelling depth and gravity. Regardless, he was able to write with unmatched ability and inventiveness, greatly contributing to our young language. So in what category is the Merchant of Venice? I was very surprised to discover that it is one of Shakespeare's comedies. I had never read or seen it before, but after watching the latest film version I decided that it is not even it's both. This is one of the many questions the viewer must try to answer by coming to terms with what is clearly a baffling and deeply disturbing moral tragedy. <br /> <br /> Players are presented quickly and simply. One of them, in the first place, is Venice itself; Director Michael Radford filmed the Venetian scenes in the royal city, creating an impressively vibrant and vibrant backdrop for the plays of the play. For this scenario enters the young Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes), returning to Venice to see a beloved old friend, Antonio (Jeremy Irons). It seems that poor Bassanio has heard of a princess whose father died and left any potential candidate a sort of draw. Waiting in the lady's island estate for the fair there are three small trunks, of which only one contains "pictures of the princess." He who can guess the right way, using only the blind intuition and the cryptic stumps written on them, will be graced with his father's enormous fortune for life. Oh, and your daughter and your eternal love in marriage, I forgot to mention. Here the light comedy of Shakespeare takes over the film. This tricky plot element boosts the story and also fills much of the screen time of the movie, while a number of painfully avid opportunists arrive on the island, humorously contending and failing to win that very rich hand in marriage. But before all this happens Bassanio, very lacking in finances, asks Antonio to loan him three thousand ducats to pay for the long journey that he must do to have his chance to win the prize. Antonio, almost without money, must reluctantly embrace humility, seeking the financial help of Shilock (Al Pacino), one of the countless Jewish usurers who keep the bankrupt economy afloat, but are despised and persecuted without end by the zealously Christian majority of the city. So they dwell beneath society, and this is where the two debtors must go. Shylock does not hesitate to remind the two men of a certain incident in which Antonio insulted and spit at him in the market of the city, and he proudly rebukes this man who frankly has much courage now to ask for help. But help him to Shylock. He even erases any kind of interest on the loan, probably feeling he has no reason to worry if Antonio can repay him within three months. Still, Shylock's only contractual demand is a pound of Antonio's meat, if he denies his agreement. This is a disturbing request, certainly for Antonio and Bassanio, as well as for us. But it seems that, in spite of his justifiable pride, Shylock does not really anticipate the occurrence of such a horrible act. <br /> <br /> So, here the dramatic foundation was laid. And while the film explores its gentler side with its love lottery and wrong identities, there is still the gloomy prospect of the loan itself. In the end, what will become of this sinister agreement? Meanwhile, we're taking turns exploring the true central character of Shylock. Al Pacino has enough dramatic weight to carry here, and he does so with compelling courage and passion. There are times when it gains space for the theatricality we expect of such a colorful actor. But his most striking scenes are those in which he internalizes this energy, showing a conflicted personality: honest, sincere and proud, but taciturn, vengeful and totally ruthless. This is one of Pacino's most sincere performances to date. And while the rest of the cast plays their roles with credibility and conviction, it's Pacino who really owns the movie - especially at the end, when Shakespeare overthrows that seemingly romantic comedy with a wallop of a third act. <br /> /> I will not reveal much here; all I can say is that it involves the initial loan - a powerful shoe that was expected to fall sooner or later. And that always. In the end, Shakespeare raised a series of dilemmas for his audience: seemingly irresolvable questions of faith, morality, law and mercy are cast before us in the final scenes, and while the curtain closes the playwright's position may seem clear to some, they are left completely at odds. There are winners and losers in this, but did the winners win their spoils with good reason, or did they, in a broader sense, lose out as well? Was virtue rewarded or simply disrespected? Is it justice in fact this time was it just? At the end of the play, some destinations are painfully clear and unequivocally sealed. But the public must be the one who really decides the verdict for everyone involved. And for some, the verdict is still out of the game. Comedy or tragedy? The author shrewdly concealed the intense finale of the audience room with an end of light and rejoiced with romantic resolutions. Is he saying that all is well when it ends well, or is this his final and ironic condemnation? The mood of the game serves to prepare us well for such a heavy accident. And although it is also what unfortunately keeps the Merchant of Venice from achieving the grandeur of many other works of Shakespeare, it is still engaging, entertaining and thought-provoking beyond measure.
