Me and my mates usually meet in a house to watch it on a Friday night before heading to the pub. It was the only program that made us miss opening hours. It's one of the best comedies I've ever seen, if not the best. David Jason was brilliant and was often compared to Buster Keaton with his clever acrobatics that were taken so convincingly. I wish I could get the series on DVD to watch again. He had an incredible ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in many different directions. He is a talented "Trip and Fall Guy" and I remember watching a trailer once, where he showed people how to do it professionally. Certainly he is the one to teach people this art. He only showed glimpses of it in other shows he did. Pshaw, this program shows how multi talented he is. I'm lost as to why David Jason vetoed another series being made, as for me, it was one of the best things he's ever done and I've been a fan of him since he did this series. They say he did not like it because it showed the crudity of his early career. Well, in my opinion, this could have been the right decision when he took it, but now his career has progressed so far, I believe this would be a good time for him to do another series showing him looking back on his "secret life" . "full of mistakes he does not see.
