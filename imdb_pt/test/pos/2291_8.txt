I liked this movie, not because Tom Selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball and also had a semi-dramatized view of some of the issues that a BASEBOL player came to the end of his time in Major. League sports must face. I also really enjoyed the cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and the little facts about how games are played differently. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie to watch on cable TV or rent in a cold winter. night and watch on the "Dog Day" of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away. A good movie for a baseball fan, as well as a good "DATA" movie? Trust me on this! *Wink*
