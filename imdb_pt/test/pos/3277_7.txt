A good old-fashioned Western retreat and revenge, given a twist and a touch of seriousness by injecting some black social history into his plot. Led by Mario Van Peebles, that's fine, the gang of misfits fleeing Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army big-eyed all get along, their adventures are plausible but fun and exciting. There are some scenes of moody flashbacks that set the character and story of the hero, a good end to shooting as our heroes defend the city from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin is not bad in this pleasant and powerful western.
