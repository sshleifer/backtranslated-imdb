This film definitely shows something and sheds light on what happens in most institutions today, and shows how someone gurl only with the help of his newspaper manages to do things, his publisher has complete faith in it and does not publish something important because it would hurt her friend ... and when the time was right she took the necessary steps. <br /> <br /> The movie in general received a 9th note from me because it has everything, I mean it keeps you entertained, and in addition, they acted very well, for a TV movie, its high performance quality that deserves a lot of credit.
