I've lost count of how many times I watched this movie. I never got tired of this since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on many levels. they just do not make movies like that anymore. <br /> <br /> After recently watching the fascinating documentary about the production of this film (Hearts of Darkness: A Journey of the Filmmakers to Madness), I am even more surprised that the film was finished, but that alone has been so great. <br /> <br /> The fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the Philippines is the film's greatest asset. you really feel like your in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> All the actors are fantastic, with my favorites still being Robert Duvall ("I love the smell of napalm in the morning !!") and the great Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> Many people complain that the film gets very dark, strange and cerebral near the end. well, remember what Coppolla said about this movie: "This movie is not about Vietnam, it's Vietnam!" what he means is that this movie is about madness and not about war. <br /> <br /> This film is based on Joseph Conrad's short story "Heart of Darkness," and is directed against the Vietnam War instead of the Civil War. war as in the book. I think it was a brilliant combination in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect and challenging movie that is dark, violent, humorous at times and well done in every way possible. <br /> <br /> a true classic <br /> <br /> rating: 10
