Of course, it has its pretentious moments, plays like an artistic fantasy, Fantasia live, but also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Bus films are always a problem, but I've always had a great interest in them. I will now evaluate the segments individually. Nicolas Roeg - "Un ballo in maschera" - This segment may well ruin the film for some people because it is absolutely the worst of the whole group. It is difficult to follow, mainly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a banal, so). The photo is not complete. The best thing about this is the bit of homoerotic lesbian that never does enough. This segment made me very nervous to continue. 2/10. Charles Sturridge - "A virgine degli angeli" - an unclear segment, but it does not matter. The film has the best cinematography of the group, mainly because it is in an impressive black and white. The segment is dreamy and beautiful. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - "Armide" - I chose to face this much maligned film for the segments of Godard and Altman. With Godard, I was far more impressed than I thought it would be. I can not claim to have seen so many of his films since he made so many that almost no one saw, but judging by what I've seen, this may be his best work since the '60s. It's the funniest segment of this film and the most artistically accomplished. Bravo, Jean-Luc! 9/10. <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - "Rigoletto" - a very funny segment, is also quite predictable. Still, this story about a husband and wife betraying themselves at the same resort is wonderfully filmed with long, complex tracking jacks that rely on a precisely timed choreography of the actors. He also has a great self-reference joke about the omnibus movies themselves. The final scene is very weak. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - "Die tote Stadt" - this small segment also involves lovers in (I think) Venice. It's beautiful, with some photos of doves flying around the city. It's light, but cool. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - "Les Bor√©ades" - is not one of the best segments, unfortunately, it's more of a music video than a short film. It involves the occupants of a lunatic asylum who attend a theatrical performance. The music and the images work well together, so at least I can give credit for being a good music video. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Franc Roddam - "Liebestod" - somewhat unfortunate for the Beresford segment, this segment is very similar to it. As you may suppose from my phrasing, this one seemed to me much more. It's about a young man and his girl going to Las Vegas on a fatalistic journey. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - "Nessun dorma" - perhaps the most visually stunning segment, he plays in a fantasy world more than in reality. It is a beautiful tale of a fallen angel. 8/10. Derek Jarman - "Depuis le jour" - I heard a lot about Jarman, and this is the first movie I saw of him. I hope to see more in the future. This is also music-videoish, but it's better than the Altman segment. It mainly concerns an elderly woman who remembers her younger days. Editing and using different movies to represent time and emotion are very beautiful. Bill Bryden - "I pagliacci" - the sad clown, possibly one of the most famous arias (particularly memorable of an episode of Seinfeld), this serves as the material that separates each segment and the end. It is simple and effective. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give a solid 7/10. It's not nearly as bad as you've heard.
