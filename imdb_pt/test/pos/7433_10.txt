OMG!!! Did you ever think they would make a movie about it? Well, I knew they would, but I did not know when !! and now it's finally here !!! when I received yesterday through the post I put it in my (evil) stereo playing dvds and instantly had this smile huuuuuuuuuge in my face as cloud appeared (looking good .... gorgeous !!) and they followed by all the others fascinating characters from the ultimate fantasy of the game! including typhus and aeris, my favorites .... (they are very cute in that) the graphics knocked me out !!!! they were truly amazing. so real until the last hair !!! the plot is OK bit confusing, especially as my version of the film was in Japanese, but of course - being a late fantasy fanatic long time - I did not mind a bit - I just read the subtitles !!! all the characters speak the way they would in the game, and rude and rude are still ridiculous. the dragon scene is also perverse. It looks so good !!! anyway .... the graphics were, amazing .... the plot, fantastic .... and the basic idea of ​​having a movie ff7 ....... genius !!!
