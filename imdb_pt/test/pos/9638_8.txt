In my personal opinion - "The Patriot" is one of Steven Seagal's best films. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say it's the worst of all time, it's not like SS etc. I disagree. As a highly spiritual person, a great master Seagal has established a good tradition in action movies. He always has a good background, great action, high professionalism and a clever message. This movie has it all. You have good shooting scenes, great aikido. Although there is not much, it shows us its peaceful side. This change in his film only proves his spiritual growth (he does not kill Chisolm's friend in the end). <br /> <br /> "The Patriot" is definitely one of the best films from the "filmmaker's point of view". vision that I have seen lately. You have great panoramic photos of Montana, we see true American nature and beautiful wildlife (among others - horses and flowers). The soundtrack also deserves a few words. During the film I had a great opportunity to listen to American-cowboy-American classical music (though not in Country). Similar music was heard in «Back to the Future Prt.3». SS acting has improved a lot since his last films. His role is unfamiliar to him (unlike the cops and commandos), but he does a good job of playing the retired government doctor. His acting is convincing and his lines are good. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased with the cast. LQ Jones proves that life and death go together on Earth, Whitney Yellow Robe plays a beautiful and intelligent scientist, Camilla Belle makes a great appearance as McClaren's daughter. Mr. Seagal discusses the much debated "Real American" Tradition and militia squads, providing his own point of view (he really likes the Constitution, but chubby men have nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The best of Seagal, and opening new horizons in his film career <br /> <br />
