For once, a story of hope highlighted the tragic reality our young people face. Favela Rising attracts the person to a scary, insecure and unfair world and shows through beautiful colors and moving music as a man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept this world and change it through action and art. A fun, interesting, emotional and aesthetically beautiful movie. I showed this film to several high school students, as well as everyone living in neighborhoods with poverty and armed violence and they were in love with Anderson, the protagonist. I recommend this movie for all ages over 13 years (due to subtitles and some death images) from all backgrounds.
