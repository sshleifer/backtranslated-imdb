Of the 24 best lesbian films in my library, I should rate this as the # 1 film of all time. This movie will go down in history as the best of the genre. It's a story about a girl (Rachael Stirling) who goes from riches to rags and rags to riches, with her first love (Keeley Hawes) coming in and out of her life. It is against a Victorian background in the 1890s, which makes it an ideal setting for some of the industry's best entertainments. This film spared no expense with music and costumes, and the makeup that Rachael and Keeley wore on the Halls stage only increased the diversity of the film. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the type of movie you like, I can guarantee that this film will not only surprise you but will keep your attention during all three episodes. This film will be touched and appreciated for decades. The unrated DVD collector version is indispensable for anyone's library. Rachael Stirling and Keeley Hawes was the best choice for the cast in these two roles, and they played them very well.
