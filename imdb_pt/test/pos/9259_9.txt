My all-time favorite police series turns to a TV movie. It works? Yeah. Gee runs to the mayor and gets shot. The Homicide "hall of fame" appears. Pembleton and almost all the cops who have played in this series. Many flashbacks help you who have not seen the TV series, but also amuse the fans. The last five minutes solve another murder, and in the end, two of the dead cops appear. And a small appearance from my favorite coroner Juliana Cox. This is a good movie.
