Nothing annoying with this movie, which is kept together by characters totally accomplished with some depth to them. Even hooded torturers have body language. Jannings' performance is brilliant, everything will want and need. A Henry VIII as he must have been. Henny Porten is perhaps nobler and purer than Anne Boleyn, but she plays the role as it is written: A victim trapped in the clutches of a large (huge) baby. <br /> <br /> Sparkuhl's cinematography is wonderful in restoring the sensual hues. Lubitsch allows these characters to breathe and reveal their corruption to the tiniest of stinginess. It takes your time, which can tempt the patience of a public accustomed to being taken by the action, but it's worth spending the time. Slow down your heartbeat and watch this little miracle of the German silent film.
