Firstly, I vaguely remember being told this story in elementary school, about 6 or 7 years ago, so I'm a bit unfamiliar with the story. <br /> <br /> A lot of that has changed, though, and there are many (sometimes unnecessary) differences and mistakes in the movie that hardcore fans will not appreciate. <br /> <br /> However, as a whole, I really love this movie. I first saw it close to Christmas about 2 years ago (well, the first part), so I picked it up again last Christmas, probably on the same channel. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed, sometimes it can be a little overdrawn and long, but with an engaging storyline, decent acting (especially the icy Fonda and Hobbs) and beautiful scenery, fantasy and little touches of magic make this a really special movie - which to me really reminds me of Christmas. <br /> <br /> Despite the book's differences, I think the film does well to incorporate new themes and ideas (the seasons with Autumn, Winter etc. with I think a new character thief to represent the fall) throughout the image once you realize amazingly and brilliantly run. <br /> <br /> I live in the UK so I waited a long time for the DVD, and luckily I saw an ad showing a series of free DVDs being offered in the Daily Mail that I do not usually understand, so I got the edit from yesterday and finally got my DVD. If you have lost and want this rare DVD for Region 2 I suggest you collect the Daily Mail tokens and send them as your DVD will be delivered on Christmas. <br /> <br /> So for a little escape for this year's Christmas season, put on your fire, be comfortable and watch this as you and the kids will probably really enjoy this great movie. If you have not, it will probably be repeated on Channel 4 this Christmas, so serious!
