This particular movie was one of those I wanted to see in theaters, but I never got to that. When I finally rented out in the summer of 2001, I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD right away. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake have done a wonderful job with the script and are wonderful to hear in the audio commentary that are included in the DVD. They did a great job at creating characters that you really like. I really felt a whirl of emotions watching this movie, including sadness, anxiety and joy. The film also does a great job of showing the importance of family (a rarity in the movie today), which is a reflection of the director, Bonnie Hunt, based on the comments she made on the DVD. David Duchovny showed me here that there is life beyond Fox Mulder giving a wonderful performance with some pretty pungent scenes. I strongly recommend you give this movie a preview. I am very grateful to the creators of this film. They gave me a wonderful cinematic vision that I will recommend to all my friends. I have seen many movies over the years and it is very rare that I get a sense of satisfaction after watching a movie. I'll watch it over and over again for years to come. Return to Me reminds me that there are still filmmakers out there who know how to sincerely please the audiences of their films. Thank you!!
