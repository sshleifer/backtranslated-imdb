This is one of the best Stooges shorts. It was the only one of his shorts to be nominated for an Oscar. In this short moment the Stooges play with doctors, who cause some problems as usual. This short has non-stop vis-gags, puns and jokes. The part at the end where the Stooges are breaking the machine. This is definitely a classic. I would highly recommend this short Three Stooges.
