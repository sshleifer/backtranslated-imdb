Before watching this movie, I really did not expect much of it, although my friend advised otherwise. Due to this request from my friend, I decided that I would really watch this movie. The minute I sat down to watch the movie, I was absolutely blown away. Of the credits I was falling from my place; I just could not contain myself. The film is about Hitler in all the glory of comedy. Hynkel is the absolute double for the Jewish barber, who returns from fighting in the war. Due to the Barber's heroism, he manages to save one of the Germans and in so doing gets a member of the enemy on board, which helps in the fight the Jews had. But things went awry and Stolz was arrested, but only then escaped to the confines of the Jewish quarter, "The Ghetto." Due to this flight, the German army began to search for what meant that Barber and Stolz were arrested, but again they escaped, only to be confused with hynkel and, consequently, took their position. ***** THE SPEECH WHICH CHAPLIN DOES AT THE END IS FANTASTIC, COMPENSATES MORAL THAT THE SOCIETY COULD ONLY BE SEEN. In the speech, he contradicts the whole meaning of the film because of the seriousness and sincerity he encountered, and it definitely works, because I felt guilty for knowing how we live our lives, looking at the lowest thing, how to be ignorant. SOMEONE TO THE GREATEST THINGS MORE PROMISES LIKE WAR.
