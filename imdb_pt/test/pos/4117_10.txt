It was a fantastic movie! I like watching again and again. The actors were incredible. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I would like Lifetime to put this movie on DVD. I would definitely buy a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get involved with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is that I'm going to watch this movie every time Lifetime is aired. It's the kind of movie that keeps you glued to the video. I wish Lifetime could redo the movie, but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen.
