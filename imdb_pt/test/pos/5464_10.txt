Captivating tale of backstabbing behind the curtains. The film follows the situation of David Letterman and Jay Leno while fighting for the elusive spot Tonight Show. Letterman led by his longed for coveted time and Leno led by his agent and little-devil on the shoulder, Helen Kushnick. Kathy Bates (Kushnick) is excellent in this film, alienating herself from top-notch dogs like Bob Wright, Warren Littlefield, and Howard Stringer. At the end of the movie, you're so enchanted by the way it handles all situations, from guest bookings to late recordings, you find yourself wanting more. <br /> <br /> John Michael Higgins (Letterman) plays his part on the tee. Sometimes I wondered if he had anything to do with the real Letterman. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of corporate negotiations.
