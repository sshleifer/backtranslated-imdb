Based on a short story by William Faulkner, Two Soldiers is a high-level short film, a film that has plenty of story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two poor Mississippi brothers, one just a boy, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, does not want to let his older brother go, and he goes on a quest to enlist in the army himself. Ron Perlman gives a rude but moving appearance as the Army Colonel who decides to help the child. <br /> <br /> Because it is only 39 minutes long, this gem will be hard to find (it will probably be confined to the festival circuit for now), but remember the name Aaron Schneider - that image marks you as a director to watch.
