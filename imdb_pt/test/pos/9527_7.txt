In Victorian times a father is separated from his family when he is falsely accused of treason and they are sent to live in the country. The children adapt to their new situation, make friends and ask the help of an old man to wave on the train to help reunite the family. <br /> <br /> The actors who drive movies are often not very good. this. Jeffries, however, the great veteran actor of dozens of British comedy classics, is one of the few exceptions. His brilliant conception (he also wrote the screenplay, from E. Nesbit's novel) of a classic English children's story is what elevates this film to art. While the story can be highly idealized, the wonderful performances and the fabulously evocative Yorkshire Dales scenarios combine to make a truly memorable movie. Arthur Ibbetson's photography is the definition of good film production - no photo is wasted on telling the story, but at the same time the images combine to create a fabulously romantic atmosphere. Agutter is simply perfect as the kindly Bobbie (okay, I fell in love with her at a young age, but I challenge anyone to disagree) and Cribbins, whose pedigree of comedic acting is on the same level as Jeffries, is unforgettable as Perks the humble railroad transporter Still proud. This is a film out of time; romantic, charming, extremely pleasant and with a sense of kindness kind and naive to all.
