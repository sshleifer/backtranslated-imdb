The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a bunch of hooded invaders who killed three Indians for what at first seems not to be an apparent reason ... until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian chief Tomache that each man had a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts that we will later learn when combined will provide the brain behind the hooded invaders with a map for a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the two remaining individuals in possession of the medallions, before the hooded invaders come into contact with them? Is there really a lost city of gold somewhere in the homeland? Watching this, I kept knowing what was going to happen beforehand and everything seemed very familiar until finally I realized that I had seen this same movie when I was just a child ... suddenly the memories came back and I remembered having a really fun time as a kid enjoying this with a lot of friends. As an adult though, the plot is a bit predictable, but you know it, although it's not at the same level as the 1956 movie, it's still a lot of fun to watch. Clayton Moore is perfect as the Lone Ranger and Jay Silverwheels, since Tonto steals a lot from this movie, since he is probably in more action scenes than the Lone Ranger. There are some very familiar faces here, including Douglas Kennedy as Ross Brady, Hooded Raiders gang leader, Charles Watts as fanatic sheriff, and Ralph Moody as a kindly Father.
