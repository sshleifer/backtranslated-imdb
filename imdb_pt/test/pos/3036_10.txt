I'll make it short and sweet. Not surprisingly, you have not used this movie. This is a story about the power, beauty, and possibilities inherent in meaningful education. Based on his pathetically composed comments, I can see that his own education was woefully neglected ... or worse ... completely wasted. Your comments are those of a truly ignorant person. I advise you to do something about this condition ... but in your case I think it's probably too late. My hope is that you yourself do not intend to join the teaching profession (especially in Film Studies) because you can only cause harm. Oh ... one last piece of advice. In the future, if you plan to write more opinion articles, you should really review your work. It will make people take you more seriously.
