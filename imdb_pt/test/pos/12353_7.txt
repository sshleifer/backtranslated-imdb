If anything, William Girdler was an opportunist who wanted a share of the action against what was popular during the time. I mean, a blaxploitation movie in Louisville, Kentucky .. who would thunk it?!?! I can only imagine the enthusiasm he must have had with Pam Grier, a hot item, to star in his picture. If you are well acquainted with the gender, Girdler's Sheba, the baby does not necessarily stray too far from the formula. Despite a relocation, the film still deals with a relentless entrepreneur, nicknamed Shark, who works with lending companies, using minions to threaten them to get their signatures. <br /> <br /> Grier is Sheba Shayne, a former Louisville cop who works in Chicago, who returns home at the request of her father's partner, Brick (Austin Stoker, Assault on Precinct 13). Sheba's father, in spite of Shark's intimidating tactics (... his man in town is Pilot, an aspiring gangster, equipped with lackeys who are not so threatening, somewhat boorish by nature, so fine that they hire killers from outside Shayne Loan Building) will not give up on his company, and this eventually costs him his life when a warning through the use of brute force leads him to be killed. Sheba will take revenge on all those responsible for her father's death. In other words, the shark's tail is grass ... can you dig it? Seeing Grier with a magnum is enough to sell that particular movie, the novelty of the scene in Louisville is part of the package. You even get a speedboat chase, Grier in shootings with gangsters (..not necessarily the most polite type that anyone could be accustomed to seeing in Chicago or New York during that time in blaxploitation), lots of blood gushing from bullet-sieving bodies shattered by firearms, and colorful characters (like a loan shark in a pimp named Walker and Pilot, who is one of the less scary mobsters you'll probably see) appearing during the film, most having the misfortune to get in touch with a very angry Sheba. The plot itself is nothing special, but Grier is always worth watching, and Girdler orchestrates many action sequences to keep his target audience entertained. A modest success for Girdler and one of his most accomplished films.
