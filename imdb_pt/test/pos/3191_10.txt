I can not believe this ... after all these years, finally, it tracked this ... it was destined to be called "The Great Pretender" in the production phase. I was living in Oz at the time and through a friend I was taking care of one of the places in the house through filming .... It was me who showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realize now that it was Russell Crowe !!! It took me all those years to track this, I was not sure if I ever went to the screen when I left Oz the next month after the party. At that time Russell Crowe was not the actor he is now and I had no idea he was it until I saw the previous comment, then I thought the days while filming ..... incredible ... Really happy with myself now! !!
