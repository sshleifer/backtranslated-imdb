The first time I heard of the last days was when I was renting DVDs and I was interested because I am a member of the LDS Church. I found this film very sincere and in several areas made me cry. The reason for this is that many years ago I met a young man who went through what Aaron (played by Steve Sandvoss) does in the Last Days, but unlike Aaron, this young darling did not survive the ordeal. He ended up taking his life after his church, his friends, and his family disowned him because he was gay. There have been many people who do not think the things that are shown in the movie actually happen today, but what is sad and sad is that they happen. For those of you who are gay and young, you need to see this movie and if you are a gay Mormon, you really need to see this movie. Also, if you get the DVD, there is help for you listed on the DVD. Teenage suicide in the gay world is very disturbing and this movie plays, but that part is hidden to some extent. The acting and the music are excellent. This movie sold out all the movie houses it showed, but was only shown in major cities and had a very limited release, so for those who would like to see this movie, I would recommend the DVD release. The only people I know who did not like the movie are members of my own church and have not seen the movie because of gays and the LDS Church. Watch the movie, experience the story and feel the emotions that are displayed in this movie that you feel will not disappoint.
