It is a risky business to film such a luxurious production of "The Merchant of Venice." It may be an indigestible piece of wood, or it may be laughable by its excesses. This version is neither. Although I'm not completely sold by Al Pancino's very restrained Shylock, he does a competent and honorable performance. Antonio, by Jeremy Iron, is, as always, with his own torture papers, fascinating. Some of the smaller roles seemed to be a little too much in the spirit of turbulent amusement, "a boy's own Venetian adventure story," but the central plot is efficiently and sympathetically enhanced by the film. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the filming locations, the costumes and the interiors were breathtaking, almost to the point of distraction. <br /> <br /> One thing I do not want to comment on is the anti-semetic. content of the game. The film is as sympathetic to the plight of the Jews as possible, while still portraying Shylock as the instrument of his own self-destruction. It is a sad comment that, four centuries later, the director of this film found it necessary to comment on his nuanced view before the premiere at the Toronto Festival. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie, and I look forward to several previews.
