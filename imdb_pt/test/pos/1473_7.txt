It has to be said that this movie is definitely one of the best "bargain" movies out there - I would feel a little cheated if I had paid £ 15 for it but around £ 1.50 I felt I definitely got more that my money is worth it. <br /> <br /> The film can not decide whether to be "Mad Max" or one of Clint Eastwood's "unnamed man" spaghetti westerns, and as such is cluttered with both. Even the crazy maniac who goes out with the bad guys in "Mad Max" is there. <br /> <br /> That "Blade Runner" face also captures a good billing, although it only appears at the beginning and end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Favorite slice - for me, the punch-up at the top of the oil refinery - if you look closely you can see the post-apocalyptic rush-hour traffic thundering in the distance while the two protagonists take seven bells from each other. <br /> <br /> Take several beers, some pizzas, sit back and enjoy what is light and fun.
