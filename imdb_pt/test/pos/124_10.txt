This was a great movie in every sense of the word. It addresses the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm. She criticizes many Indian customs that many find oppressive - such as the organization of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, women's empowerment in terms of infant production capacity, binding concepts. of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a poignant love story that goes beyond such societal limitations that the two protagonists meet. The film is well represented and genuine, completely believable from beginning to end, unlike most Bollywood films. The main flaws of the film as I have seen was in the first place that the two lovers seem attracted to each other, not necessarily because of a natural affinity with each other as much as the fact that they are trapped in endless marriages without passion and without rewards . This may play a role in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people caught in the same situation will not "become homosexual." It seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual - when Radha makes her scene at the end of the film with Aashok, she makes it clear that "without desire she was dead", and the implication was that if she wanted to , could have fulfilled it completely and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when the husband seemed not to like her. Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals - they can seek comfort in other people in the same position, but in the film it is not clear that they are lesbians from the start - quite the opposite. Some people are bisexual, it's true, but most tend to be heterosexual or homosexual. In the case of the women in the film, both had insensible jerks for their husbands. . . if that were not the case, would they naturally have found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they might not otherwise have considered? The film ignores this. The other flaw is the naming of the characters. . . the names Sita and Radha seem deliberately designed to shock and outrage (imagine a movie in the United States describing a gay relationship between a man named "Jesus" and another called "Paul"!) using names associated with various Hindu scriptures. The movie is strong enough to stand on its own and does not need such devices in my opinion. Anyway, the flaws do not draw much of the power of the movie. It's really a very touching and powerful story - the pictures and characters will stay with you long after you leave the theater.
