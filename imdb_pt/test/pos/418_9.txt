This is not his routine police story, in which the characters were only secondary to armed battles and car chases. The episodes so far are more realistic and intelligent. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something with a lot of Rambo-style police history, you will not find it here. <br /> <br /> I gave a 9. I wish this series lives for a long time. Morse is great!
