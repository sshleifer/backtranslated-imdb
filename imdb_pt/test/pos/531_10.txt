I just got back from seeing this amazing movie !! I can relate so much to this ... It reminded me when my sister had to go to college, we had to move from place to place, and my mother acts like Adele August! The boys may not like this movie because it brings tears to their eyes. One of the best real life movies I've ever seen !! and Natalie Portman rules !! 10/10
