There is a chain in the movie comedy that all great comics are falling short of the law or going to jail. Think of the battlefield of Conman W.C.Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY, or the Marx Brothers in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, or Chaplin in THE ADVENTURER, by Mae West in SHE DONE WRONG. The outline of the law is inevitable, and when they end up on the side of the law, the results are still hostile between the forces of law and order and comics. Think of Lloyd on his first talkie, WELCOME DANGER, trying to "help" the San Francisco Police Department in the midst of a wave of crime, and make police sergeant Edgar Kennedy want to kill him. Think of Laurel and Hardy as ill-fated cops in MIDNIGHT PATROL. I think this kind of hostility is so patent throughout the comedy of these giants (and their peers) that even a fake title to a movie deals with it. Think of Jerry Seinfeld in an episode of his series creating a short Three Stooges, SAPPY PAPPIES, where the boys end up being electrocuted for murder. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton often pulls the forces of law and order to be his opponents in his comedies. Look at STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., Where he tries to get his father out of a dungeon. But he actually had more conflicts of the police forces in his shorts. In CONVICT 13 he is dragged back to prison when confused with a convict who escaped. In COPS (perfect title - if you realize you would understand) the police force of a large city is repeatedly looking for Keaton, confused with a terrorist). And in GOAT he can not avoid the police for most of the film. <br /> <br /> Keaton is a bum looking for food. But he's totally unlucky. When he sees a stranger throw a lucky horseshoe (Keaton previously ignored) over his shoulder, and then finds a wallet full of money, Keaton tries the same thing, and hits a policeman in the head. The policeman gives the chase, and Keaton (as luck would have it) runs to another policeman, tries to act normal, but ends up throwing the other policeman in the way of the first. Soon he has three policemen behind him. Briefly swinging them, he walks past a window at the local jail where the local killer "Dead Shot Dan" (Malcolm St. Clair) is being photographed. Passing behind the barred windows, Keaton is stupid enough to stop and look straight in. The desperate looks at it and bends down when the picture is taken. When the dead shot runs from the police, it's Keaton's face on all wanted posters. <br /> <br /> (* St. Clair would eventually be a successful director of silent and early sound comedies, although in his later biography it would be a season at 20th Century Fox, where his work with Laurel & Hardy was Keaton flees to another city by train (unplugging passenger cars that contain their locomotive and car chasers.) This is the movie (by the way) that has two Keaton jokes The arrival of the locomotive takes place on a distant plane, with it coming closer and closer, and suddenly the audience sees Keaton sitting on the cow roast. <br /> <br /> The second famous sequence goes later ( and may have influenced Chaplin a little early in CITY LIGHTS.) Keaton accidentally knocked out a man who was arguing violently with a beautiful woman with a dog (Virginia Fox) .When he sees the poster calling him a killer, he thinks he killed He is being pursued in this city. or a suspicious police chief (Joe Roberts), and momentarily loses Roberts in the park. A statue of "War-man" is being built and the sculptor is unveiling a model of horse clay. Keaton is seen sitting on the clay model, trying to maintain his dignity as the horse's clay legs begin to crumble under his weight. <br /> <br /> Keaton manages to find the beautiful Mrs. Fox, who invites him to dinner at home. Only he does not realize that his father is Roberts. The last five minutes of the movie treat Keaton by fleeing and avoiding Roberts while he and Fox escape together. <br /> <br /> It's a funny comedy and a wonderful example of Keaton's work at its best.
