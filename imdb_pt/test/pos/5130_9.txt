Hoot is a good simple movie with a simple message. It looked like this movie was for little kids, but I know adults will like this movie. The plot is very simple. A boy who moved to Florida should help a soccer athlete and an exile save bourgeois owls from building a pancake house. The message in this film is great especially for activists and animal lovers. The message is about doing everything possible to save endangered animals. The acting in this film is decent. All three children seemed to have good chemistry. The music is not very poor. I liked Jimmy Buffet songs in this movie. Overall this is a good family movie. I rate this movie a 9/10.
