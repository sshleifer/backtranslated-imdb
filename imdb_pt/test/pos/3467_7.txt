I went to the pre-screening of "Rory O'Shea Was Here". I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent castings and the powerful performance. It is a film about the friendship of two young people with disabilities. Rory is a free-spirited young man who wants to be independent regardless of his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move two fingers, but he can speak eloquently and help his new friend, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and has significant difficulty speaking. I think it's enough to start with a tearful drama. Well that's. But with inspiring messages and deeply moving performances. It made me look at my life for things that I take for granted. What would I do if all I could do was move my two fingers? I should feel grateful for what I have and for what I am able to do. This is a good movie, although it could have been better.
