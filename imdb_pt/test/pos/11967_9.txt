"East Side Story" is a musical comedy documentary in Stalinist Russia and later in Eastern European satellite comedies, with many movie clips and comments from survivors. Although some of the Stalinist films look ridiculously bad (The Bright Road (?) Being a notable exception), the 1960s movies actually look pretty good. "My Wife Wants to Sing", "The White Mouse" and "Midnight Revue" seem particularly entertaining. Producers had to deal with the censors, who had the power to decide what was politically correct, which led to some confusion, humorous in retrospect, since the people the censors were trying to appease were the same people who supported production of the movies. start with! Since the musical comedies were quite rare behind the Iron Curtain - there were only something like forty made in forty years - they had a disproportionate effect on the audience, which made great successes of some of the films. <br /> <br /> I realized that the sound of the movies of the sixties was much better. Directors often had to settle for old-fashioned equipment, and rigid energy regulations - they had to shoot in shots of seven minutes or less - and officially dangerous officers. <br /> I also notice that "West Side Story" seems to have had a strong influence on "hot summer". Subsequent movies may not measure up to "Singin 'in the Rain," but they certainly look like they beat "Bye Bye Birdy."
