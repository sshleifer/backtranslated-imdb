James Joyce could undoubtedly write some of the best English phrases, and his tale, "The Dead," which concludes his collection The Dubliners, contains in his final - perhaps the most perfect paragraph of English. language. It is fitting that John Huston, who retained the attempt to film this story, ended his career with it. As with the Red Badge of Courage and The Man Who Be King, Huston revered the literary source, but made the film adaptation. And with "The Dead" (which was completed after Huston's death by his son, Tony Huston), we achieved something almost perfect in the marriage between literature and cinema. <br /> <br /> To value everything that cinema can do, as one. of the commentators points out "this is not the African Queen" (nor need be), this is the kind of film that is uncompromising to an audience. We all go through the Portrait of an Artist at school, and we must have the maturity to appreciate how words and images can touch us. As with silent films, Huston seeks something pure here, and he works with the confidence of his many years and leaves the world a masterpiece that equals Joyce's original. <br /> <br /> Many veterans of the Irish theatrical world are recruited to bring the story of a man full of self-importance (and mock insecurity) that is reinforced by the hosts of an annual feast on the eve of the Epiphany feast. What is reserved for Gabriel Conroy is an evening of celebration, music, dance, poetry, where he asked to make the annual toast to the two sisters and their niece who organize the party. He is distracted by the task he wants to rise to the occasion, and this distraction leaves him vulnerable to a devastating experience given to him by his wife. While his ego is shaken when he hears a story from his wife's past, it is also a gift where everything that seems to have mattered at night is swept away by the perception of imminent mortality for all who are alive. <br /> <br /> And instead of trying to make the last famous paragraph of "cinematic" history, Huston brings a voice over and we hear those incredible words recited as we watch "the snow falling lightly through the universe and falling weakly." It is the perfect solution for the adaptation of a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The cast is all we hope for. As this is basically a proof of the power of the written word and how it unites us through common experience, each interpreter seems to be elevated by his role. Anjelica Huston as Gretta Conroy has a wide range of jokes, and her account of a boy who once loved her not only Gabriel Conroy but also the audience. <br /> <br /> When I think of Anjelica Huston, it is the transformation she makes in this film; and when I think of her father, it's this movie that I remember first.
