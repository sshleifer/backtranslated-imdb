Like many, I first saw The Water Babies as a child / young teenager in the late seventies / early eighties. He has remained with me ever since with his captivating melodies, memorable representations, less successful animations, and a story full of heart, coolness, and, finally, a good evil. I recently sat down and saw it again after at least two decades, and I TOLD IT ONCE about its striking similarities to The Wizard of Oz. No, these are not glaring similarities, but listen to me. In this we have a boy and his dog - having personal problems in "home", fleeing something and the scene soon after they have fled, changing the substance of their appearance. In this, the boy and the dog are animated. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy and Toto are in color. In this, the boy and the dog are informed that they must find the Water Babies for answers, and finally the Kracken for guidance and he has the ability to let Tom go home if he shows the courage, etc. Oz, Dorothy must also find an authoritative figure who tests her before he allows her to come home. In Water Babies, Tom knows three characters who will help him on his journey to the Water Babies - Dorothy also has three helpers. When each helper is fulfilled, we have fun with a presentation of "Hi, hi, hi, hi, HI Cockallorum ... We're on our way". In the Wizard is "We're out to see the wizard." Dorothy has a good witch who takes care of her; Tom has a woman with many roles (Billie Whitelaw) doing the same. If you look closely at the two, there are many other similarities. Having said that, The Water Babies is not an imitation in any way, I was just commenting on the weird tastes between the two. This film has some solid performances from the bandits Bernard Cribbins and the always fascinating James Mason. The kids playing Tom and Ella are good. The supporting cast of Joan Greenwood (loves her voice!), David Tomlinson and the vocal talents of John Pertwee and Lance Percival all contribute a lot to the mix. I must confess that the animation is smaller than the sterling, even for its time, but it is adequate enough for the challenge. The three animated characters who help Tom get home are all friendly. I always find it difficult to choose my favorite between the French swordfish and John Inman / Mr. Humphries as a seahorse. The scene in which we hear the manic and guttural laughter of a wrecked ship, just to see a seahorse with a huge polka dot bow tie always makes me roll! The Water Babies is a lot of fun. Of course, it's more of a children's movie, but there's always been a place of love in my heart. Most of the credit for the film's success must go to director Lionel Jeffries. Jeffries is a wonderful comic actor and his sense of humor is clearly evident throughout.
