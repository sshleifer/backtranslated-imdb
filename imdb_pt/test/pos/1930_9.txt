This is a gem. As a production of Film Four - the anticipated quality was actually delivered. Filmed in style that reminded me of some well-organized and simply thrilling films by Errol Morris. It is long still horrifying to the point of being excruciating. We know that something bad has happened (one can guess from a person's lack of participation in the interviews), but we are forced to see it, a bit like a slow-motion car accident. The story covers more conceivable aspects and, unlike some documentaries, they did not try and abstain from showing the darker sides of the stories, as well as dealing with the guilt of the people Don left behind, wondering why they did not stop him. time. It took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that gripped me after seeing this very well-made documentary.
