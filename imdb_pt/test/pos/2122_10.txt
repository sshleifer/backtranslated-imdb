The Grand Champion is a bit old-fashioned at first sight. Andrew Morton at Fort Worth Star Telegram said better "If Walt Disney had come from Texas, he would have made Great Champion." The film does not have video and special effects, but it has heart and soul. The kids are great and the variety of stars is incredible. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see :) (G rated) This is a little "simple" movie masterfully done in Texas by Texas Barry . Tubb. Take your kids, bring your kids friends, get Grandma too ... they'll all have fun and so will you.
