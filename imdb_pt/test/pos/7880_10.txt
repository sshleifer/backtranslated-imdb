I really liked the movie "JOE". It really has become a cult classic among certain age groups. <br /> <br /> The producer of this film is a personal friend of mine. He's my father-in-law of Stepson. He lives on the west side of Manhattan and has a bungalow. in Southampton, Long Island. His son-in-law lives next to his bungalow. <br /> <br /> Currently, he does not produce any kind of production, but he plays in a business with HBO movies. As a person Mr. Gil is a true gentleman and I would like him to continue in the motion-producing business.
