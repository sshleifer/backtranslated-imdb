Soft and genial film seems to have been neglected as a triviality ... and to be fair the narrative is a little tenuous and light as drama ... but I feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes representing the first impact of a new art in an alien and skeptical society has a radiance and naturalness that capture the long-standing romance between cinema and public better than any film in years. The immensely nice performance of Jared Harriss (who seems to have inherited all the charisma of his father ... hopefully without Richards' poor leaning for arrogance and haminess) ... and the charming cuteness of the costar Yu Xia combine to make this a true heart. Radiant location photography (including incredibly beautiful scenes on the great wall) and sensitive direction of Ann Hu give additional impact to the film. In short, a must for anyone already charmed by a blinking shadow for life ... and doing magic in the dark.
