This movie is based on a true story. The author of the novel with the same title, Einar Már Guðmundsson, had a brother who became mentally ill. I found this film very moving, following the path of the main character to the disease, to see how he tries to deal with life after the diagnosis, and how he makes friends in the mental institution, everything is very convincing. There are some splendidly funny incidents also in the manuscript. The title reveals nothing about the story. You should watch him to understand ... and listen to the music, which is twisting and turning your heart and soul upside down as the movie continues. Must do for everyone.
