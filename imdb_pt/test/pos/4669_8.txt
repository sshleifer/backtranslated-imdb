Here's another nice surprise. Whenever I hear a movie being redone, I shrink. Films like Gone in Sixty Seconds and The Day of the Jackal are redone and the results are less than stellar. So when I heard that "Italian work" was being redone, I hoped it was bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I had the opportunity to calm down, read some reviews and finally see the movie, and it was proven wrong. Granted, it's not original and predictable, but it's fun. From start to finish, you are taken on a very fun ride. The scenes with the Minis are great, and the characters really have fun. <br /> <br /> So, even if there are some flaws, who cares as long as it's fun? <br /> <br /> Overall, 8 out of 10. The only points missed are, perhaps, some details and a slight lack of realism. But, you will be having so much fun that you will not even have the chance to stop and notice.
