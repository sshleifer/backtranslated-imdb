It surprises me that the production companies process because of reproductions that they will not provide. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. You can get all kinds of movies online ... old movies, new movies ... but everything targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I do not know why I can not get a copy. Maybe if enough people write, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's time for that to happen. Yes, it's the date, but also The Wizard of Oz. This does not seem to be so difficult. So for now, I'll continue to see these illegal copies on search engines like many others.
