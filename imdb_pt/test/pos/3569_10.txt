Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border to show how Bogota and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French ancestry, sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perverse and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others. <br /> <br /> How many of you know that Colombia is the country's second oldest and most uninterrupted democracy. world (after the US), or that has a vibrant movie and television industry (not to mention Ugly Betty), which is the capital city, Bogota (Pop. 9 million) is the "World Book Capital", or that this beautiful city ​​is home to the largest international theater festival in the world? I hope that Doug Liman, Simon Kinberg (Mr. and Mrs. Smith), Robert Zemeckis and Diane Thomas (Romancing the Stone) will one day visit Bogotá to see how wonderful it really is and focus on the vitality and cultural diversity of Bogota . instead of producing myopic films like Maria Full of Grace, which Joshua Marston greatly benefited from (for this great film) without ever thinking about the ontological damage that his film would help perpetuate on Colombia's "unfairly tarnished image." /> <br /> - Anyway, you're going to enjoy Bluff a lot! -Oh, and thank you IMDb for your invaluable work / great !!!
