In April 1947, New York City faced an epidemic crisis. Eugene LaBar, a carpet importer who had arrived from Mexico, had come to town bringing with him the deadly smallpox virus. He stumbled into a bus, complaining of fever and headache, and soon died in a Midtown hospital, but not before infecting a dozen passers-by. The damage has already been done; For the first time in decades, smallpox wandered the streets of New York. The city's health authorities moved swiftly to isolate patients and contain the virus, promulgating a free vaccination campaign that saw more than six million New Yorkers immunized against smallpox. Thanks to its rapid response, the virus was contained with minimal casualties. The outbreak, however, must have left an indelible mark, for several years later were followed by two movie noir thrillers with similar themes, in which doctors must trace a single contagious company in a city of millions of people: Panic in the Streets, by Elia Kazan. (1950) "and the budget of Earl McEvoy" The Killer That Stalked New York (1950). <br /> <br /> McEvoy's film unfolds in a style of documentary without glamor. Reed Hadley's narration sounds as if it had been taken directly from a newscast, reciting facts as if reading the official transcript of the police. This technique seems a bit cheap at times, but fortunately the narration is restricted largely to the movie's book supports, as well as providing some explanatory fill during the breaks in the plot. The "murderer" chasing New York, in this story, is not an importer of carpets from Mexico, but rather the beautiful diamond smuggler Sheila Bennet (Evelyn Keyes), who has just arrived from Cuba. In a few days, Sheila has two parts that pursue her independently: a treasury agent (Barry Kelley) trying to arrest her for smuggling offenses and a team of doctors (led by William Bishop) who identified her as the source of the outbreak of smallpox. As in Panic in the Streets, routine pursuit is given to a sense of urgency, particularly when beginners have no idea of ​​the suspect's identity or appearance. <br /> <br /> Killer That Stalked New York, for the most part, manages to circumvent its low-production budget. In addition to a few lines of dialogue ("we have to stop it!", Exclaims a certain Dr. Wood, as if coming to a difficult decision), filmmakers and cast members allow the story to unfold in a realistic and captivating. . Indeed, in this respect, the low budget possibly helps the film's intentions, necessitating a documentary style that adds to the immediacy of the outbreak scenario. Evelyn Keyes is excellent in the lead role, showing stubborn resistance in the face of unimaginable torment; at the end of the film, she seems so brutally incapacitated by her illness that it is almost painful to look at her face. In addition to the virus, Charles Korvin is the main villain of the play, as Sheila's greedy and adulterous husband who surely receives whatever is coming to him. And if all the nurses looked like Dorothy Malone, maybe getting smallpox did not seem so bad, after all.
