I could only find a copy of "Mission Cleopatra" which is not as easy as you might imagine for someone living in the United States. So far, I've only watched the first 10 minutes of the movie, and I can safely say that I laughed more in those 10 minutes than I saw the fullness of Asterix's first live action. <br /> <I'm watching the dubbed version, and while the dubbing work is a bit disconcerting, I found the movie very funny and true to the book. I see people here said that the dubbed version is much lower than the subtitled version, this may well be true, and after I watch the subtitled version (also on my DVD) I may have to come here and change my Review . However, I think it's a very fun movie, and more than makes up for the mess they made in the first movie.
