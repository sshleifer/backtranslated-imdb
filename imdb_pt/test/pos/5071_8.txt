Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal), a CIA analyst, sees his first interrogation in a secret location when Anwar (Metwally) is accused of having contact with a well-known terrorist bomb maker. Anwar's wife (Witherspoon) is frantic about her husband's whereabouts. <br /> <br /> Do not you hate it when the title of a movie sends you to a dictionary? I must have an old edition, since this Surrender is not a musical piece. No, it is the government's way of legally leading a resident or citizen to interrogate him and possibly use some torture to get the information he wants. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I remembered a similar story on the Crossing Jordan TV show (now off the air), and I hope we can see even more of these stories. It's inevitable. The events of 911 are the catalysts. <br /> <br /> It's hard to watch because we do not like to see people tortured and our government is not telling the truth about things. We like the idea that no matter what happens or happens, we can go somewhere to find answers, but when that door is closed to us, we are truly lost and hopeless like Anwar's wife. <br /> <br /> Performances of all were first class and it is possible that we can see more of Igai Naor (I have no idea how to pronounce it) because he looks and can act like Telly Savalas. No joking. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Gender: No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes
