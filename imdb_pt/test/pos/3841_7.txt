I saw this movie only once, several years ago. But I remember liking it very much. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ahead ** An old and famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has for her cats. Your butler hears this and plot to get rid of the cats so he can get lucky. He puts knockouts into his milk. When they wake up, they are miles away. They should travel back to your home before it is too late. With the help of an independent minded cat and other accomplices of animals, avoiding the butler and frustrating his plan. <br /> <br /> Could have been better, but could also have been much worse. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10.
