I've been trying to track The Age of Kings for many, many years. My life in the theater was full of actors in this series. At the time, in 1960, I could not keep up with all this, since I worked in the theater, did a lot of night work. Now in retirement I have plenty of time to have this and keep it to myself. Please, please can not be issued on DVD, I would not mind the cost. I see that there are others out there who feel the same. What can we do to achieve this? Something as big as this should not be sent to oblivion. I have to write two more lines. OK, I can do this by saying that I want this series more than anything in the world. Just to be able to watch some of the best actors of our era was interpreting the best words of our wonderful Shakespeare. It is not enough! A Uzmen
