This program is a favorite of our family, and we feel it should be released on DVD for seasons! The title of "Promised Land" is very appropriate because it is a positive statement about all the good left in this great country and the people who live in it! It's a kind of "God Bless America" ​​program with inspiring stories, old-fashioned values, real characters, heartfelt and encouraging messages, beautiful scenery and well-written humor and drama. It is a show that the whole family can enjoy and benefit from - without worrying about bad language, "adult" themes, rawness, violence, etc. We always feel blessed when we finish watching an episode and can not wait to see each one again when they are finally released on DVD!
