I watched this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson proved to be a great actor. In fact, when he started Law and Order, I was disappointed with him because it was not such a powerful role. Unfortunately, good papers do not pay the bills. I would like to find a copy of this rare series and review it. It's factual and fun. Everyone should see to know what really happened. I was so moved that I bought and read the book "Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds". And he saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his perception. If you get a chance, be sure to watch this movie and see what performance Mr. Waterston can really provide to the public. Enjoy the movies!
