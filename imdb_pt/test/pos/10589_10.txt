This movie kicks ass, no bar. Bam and his crue surrendered with this movie. Since I got the DVD (4 days ago) I watched it three times and it gets better every time I watch it. I can not wait for Grind to go out in theaters. If it's something like Haggard, it'll be worth the wait. <br /> <br /> Thanks, JTcellphone
