Hollywood is one of the best and most beautiful things that has happened in my life. I admire and am very fascinated by the way Hollywood generates ideas and implements them. It makes me think about the reach of the human brain. I've seen the Flatliners for a long time, but the story, the direction, the cast and all the acting are still fresh in my mind. The story begins with our lead actor, Sutherland, saying during sunrise "what a beautiful day to die for". For all of us, it is a story that shows emotions that are sometimes retained in our minds throughout our lives. I've never understood a few things in my life. This shows us motivated and improve our quality of life. Anyway, I suggest everyone to watch once.
