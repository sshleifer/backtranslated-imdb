Hello everyone! I went to this movie without any expectation, although I knew that Maniratnam would have given an excellent movie! I was shocked !! The background is the struggle between the Tamils ​​established in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how a young Amudha who lives with her foster parents in Chennai, India, leaves Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The highlights of the film are the performances of all actors and actresses and of course the cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full marks for cast and crew. I have to mention about the cinematography, because it brings the war in such a way that you feel being there. Excellent job! Although the war sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, such work was never attempted on the Indian Screen. Overall, the movie is great! And the hat for Mr. Maniratnam. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratnam has proved once again that he is a director who can take Indian cinema to great heights! I would love to watch this movie again and again. An excellent film and a must see.
