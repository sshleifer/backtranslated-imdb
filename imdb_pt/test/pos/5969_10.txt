Reading the comments, I'm struck by the obvious effect this wonderful movie has on viewers. But how can you watch this film and not reflect that the artistic dialogue was a subtle and bold reprimand for the authorities "in control" in what was then the USSR at that time in history? It was not souls only in the time and place of action being revealed. The questions, superficially asked, are clearly provocative when directed to the here and now. Who are the real "collaborators"? I admire that the writer has been out of prison. I read somewhere that great stress can be a catalyst for the production of great art. This film is a disorienting masterpiece, seemingly pointing to one side, while asking the audience to "look over my shoulder, what I'm really talking about." What courage.
