In the last days of 1999, almost everyone in Taiwan died. A strange plague snatched the island. Supposedly spread by cockroaches, the disease sends its victims to a psychosis where they act like insects. Eventually, they die. The Hole happens in a dilapidated apartment building (which is especially well created; compliments to the set designer!). His two protagonists live above and below each other. The woman is downstairs, and the pipes above her apartment are leaking fiercely, threatening to destroy her food supply, not to mention her sanity. She calls a plumber to check, and he accidentally opens a hole in the floor of the man's apartment. The two have never met before, and they come in contact through the hole. <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant. Few films are simultaneously funny, remaining fully human, deeply exploring the human condition, especially feelings of loneliness and despair. Tsai's direction is simply beautiful. Like many other Taiwanese directors, he uses many long takes. But unlike, let's say, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai does not overuse them. In fact, I do not know if I've ever seen them used better. They are always effective and never tedious. <br /> <br /> It would be wrong to review this movie without mentioning the musical numbers. Yes, The Hole is also a musical, and a great one, for that. In the best scenes of the movie - what is saying something, considering how good all the other scenes are - the man imagines that the woman is a singer, almost a singer of cabaret. These numbers are totally choreographed, usually with supporting dancers and singers. In a stroke of genius, Tsai produced these elaborate numbers in the ruined building, the signs of apocalypse and decay. This provides both a sense of pathos and an absurdity. <br /> <br /> The Hole is a movie that begs to be seen. It should be a cult classic, if nothing else. Before going to see this, I was told it was a decent movie, but probably the least good of Tsai Ming-liang. Well, if this is true, I can not wait to see another one! 10/10.
