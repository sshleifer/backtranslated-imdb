This movie has brought me to tears. I have to say that if I did not have a beautiful husband at home, I would ask this beautiful piece of art to marry me. Aaron Carter gives a masterful performance as a confused young pop star, while Timothy Barton writes a quick and witty dialogue that only enhances the genius of Carter's performance. Kyle is very gay, but his performance was nothing short of spectacular. He is also very handsome and cute. I'm thinking of inviting him to a meeting and giving him a good night's gift. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you would like to discuss this movie in the future, please contact me. <br /> <br /> Nick Burrell Vassar Class of 2012 Malibu, California Malibu West 310 924 0126
