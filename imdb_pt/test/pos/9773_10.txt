Changi has a delightfully fresh script, acted superbly by young and old actors. John Doyle did a great job bringing humor to a tragic true story, keeping a sometimes sad and captivating story, particularly for those unfamiliar with the events of Southeast Asia during World War II. <br /> John Doyle's parallel plot successfully fills the gap between the past and the present, allowing the public to realize the long-term effect of the war on prisoners and their families, as well as providing the basis for an excellent narrative which pleases the tales. individual and collective. Doyle deserves praise for this effort. In the past, we were delighted with his plentiful and insightful humor, as evidenced in his long collaboration with Greg Pickhaver as "Roy & HG." <br /> <br /> As the series approaches halfway, we are looking forward as the story unfolds in anticipation.
