Do not watch this movie expecting Jane Austen's wit, sharp dialogue or intelligent social commentary. This time the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version, Catherine's erotic fantasies are not just foolish fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she's just observing with her daytime adventures. By day she is very primitive and demure, and her Swede Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as your own sexual nature awakens, your daydreams shift ever more subtly, from soft to smoldering to lugubrious! <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, Catherine's sex visions are based entirely on the gothic romances she devours in bed. It is both reassuring, sexy and provocative to watch the way your dreamy image of beautiful Henry "dissolves" into a sinister dream to be taken and snatched by romantic villains! At the same time, it is ironic and touching to cut back to bed in the morning - Catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent that no one would imagine what really happens in that beautiful little head! <br /> <br /> Later, after being invited to Henry's castle, Catherine hears a family argument and misinterprets its meaning. Jumping into bed, she covers herself with the sheets and lies awake listening in fear, her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert. Little by little, however, those beautiful blue eyes fall and close as she plunges into another heated dream of innocent desire. This time, Catherine dreams she's in Elizabethan times, waiting in fear outside the castle for the approach of the banditi! It is quite clear that she is more excited than terrified at the idea of ​​being taken away by bandits. She almost quivers with excitement and anticipation! But then, after a shot of her frantically running to escape, we are back in the world of daylight, where the maid is berating her for making a mess in her room before falling into a deep sleep. It is important to note that Catherine's heavy-eyed yawn in the morning light is in itself a very sensual symbol of how her dreams were in love! Ultimately, of course, Catherine's stern and unimaginative lover, Henry, guesses the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture. It is interesting that Catherine's immediate collapse in tears symbolizes not a retreat, but a breakthrough in adult relationships. In the next scene, she tearfully burns her gothic romance and is ashamed and sobbed in bed. Significantly, this turning point is also marked by Catherine falling into a deep sleep - except that, this time, there are no dreams of making believe the passion. Presumably, Catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing. <br /> <br /> Although Katherine Schlesinger has beautiful blue eyes and a lively expression, and all her performance is charming, it must be said that outside the warm environment. sequences of dreams, this film adaptation is terribly boring. I'm giving 9 stars just because the truly romantic one can appreciate it purely on a level of reverie. <br /> <br /> If you'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong young heroine who overcomes the real darkness and danger in a real Gothic setting, I recommend THE PERILOUS GARD by Elizabeth Marie Pope.
