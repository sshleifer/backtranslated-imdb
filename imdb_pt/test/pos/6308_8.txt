I saw this the week it opened four years ago and I really did not know what to expect from not being familiar with Sorrentino's work at the time. He has created a very intriguing, and ultimately moving, account of a strange character, for whom the phrase "life is to live" no longer applies. It surpassed me at every turn and I was constantly amazed at the story. I really enjoyed the pace and the way I was gradually giving the pieces to figure out what was going on. Tony Servillo is superb, as is Magnani. It opens with a broad and brilliantly elegant view and concludes with a very touching image that takes the film to a sublime territory. I thought long afterwards about the main character and the position he was in and his final destination and I did not shake for weeks. I recently bought the movie and that final scene in which he thinks his friend catches me every time. I still have to talk to someone who has seen it. It's a shame that it has not reached a wider audience, as if this were the direction of Italian cinema, it can only be a good thing.
