Toy Soldiers is a good action movie, but what really stands out is the amount of effort writers and directors have put to accurately portray US anti-terrorist forces. Just check out the final credits - there are over a dozen US military officers and officers listed. The film accurately portrays the FBI as having control of the hostage situation, but delivering the US Army Delta Force (which has no name in the film because the Pentagon was still denying their existence), since the president resigned to the Posse Commitatus Act of US Code. US Army forces at the end are dressed and armed accurately for the time. And even the use of an Apache AH-64 for air support - which may seem a bit exaggerated, is not terribly unrealistic. Much more expensive and frankly better films portrayed American anti-terrorist forces with far less precision.
