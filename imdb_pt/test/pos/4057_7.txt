It's show time! Showtime is simply an obstacle in the careers of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro. It's a fun movie and a guilty pleasure, but it does not meet the standards of the actors, especially Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def. Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes the job seriously discreetly and quietly, while the other is easier and wants to have more fun than criminals in his backseat. Both are behind the same criminals behind a huge array of TVs, VCRs, etc. They then intersect and a TV station wants a new reality TV show to fight crime while on TV. Mitch hates advertising, while Trey loves his line "It's Showtime!" Their TV tricks and methods are shown on TV and they are the new show "Cops". The fun begins. <br /> <br /> Overall, Showtime is a fun action comedy. A good movie, but that does not match the expectations and standards of the actors. However, it's rolling while it steps on and parody TV reality shows. A good break from shows like the Cops. Truly in the end, just a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
