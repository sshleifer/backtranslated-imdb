This is a funny, clever and, in a sense, realistic comedy about a 14 year old girl trying to live her first love over the holidays, and also about the complex, sometimes fun, sometimes heartbreaking, relationship between a divorced father and her growing daughter ... and to what extent women (not just Nicole, the teenager) can go get the man she loves! I laughed a lot with this lively scene that never crawls.
