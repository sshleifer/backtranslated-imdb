In 1989, Aardman Animations introduced the two heroes to The Grand Day Out. In 1993, they fought an evil penguin in The Wrong Trousers. And in 1995, they had to rescue sheep from an evil robot dog in A Close Shave. In 2005 they are back and they will fight against something that used to be cute and cute in The Rabbit's Curse. In this complete film, Wallace and Gromit work in Anit-Pesto, a pest control business. There will be a giant vegetable contest, but the rabbits continue to eat the neighboring vegetables. Wallace and Gromit take care of this problem. But Wallace had an idea. He will brainwash the bunnies with his machine. After doing this, something suddenly eats all the vegies in the neighborhood and is great. It's up to Wallace and Gromit to save the day. As a fan of these two characters, I was impressed. It kept what the previous 3 chapters had and instead added many Hollywood actors to locutions, they put an unnamed name for the job and boy, they did a fantastic job. Wallace and Gromit have not changed. Wallace is still a freak who likes cheese as he always was, and Gromit is the dog that reads newspapers in silence. Also, the script was not as bad as other family movies. There's a twist of who the werewolf rabbit is. The direction of Nick Park (the director of the previous 3 chapters) does a great job with the plot. Instead of adding the Hollywood formula, it just took the style from the previous chapters and added a touch of somber fantasy in it. All right, Nick. Rabbits are also funny and adorable, but the funniest rabbit in the movie is the one who has Wallace's mix in it. The characters were not bad and were not annoying, but they would never outgrow Wallace and Gromit. The animation is really fantastic and wonderful. I've never seen a clay animation movie that's so incredible since the Chicken Run. Overall, fans of the two idiots (including teenagers) will love this fantastic movie. It's a well-made movie that should get an Oscar next year. Hooray, Wallace and Gromit. 10/10
