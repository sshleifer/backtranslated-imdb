Taut, current political suspense, central to the controversial policy of surrender of the United States, another terrible Orwellian phrase (collateral damage, anyone?) By illegal interrogation, even torture of terrorism suspects going beyond due process. The inhuman interrogation is overseen by the Egyptian police chief, himself the target of a suicide bombing fundamentalist plan, thus interweaving the two main lines of the film's plot. Both work very well, the bombing scene is graphic and chilling in its realism, with its ending revealed in an elegant flashback of the Tarantino type and the scenes of torture in an innocent man also portrayed steadfastly in all its bloody details. The film recounts points about the use of torture as a trusted medium of intelligence - joining the war against terrorists and bureaucracy without faceless controversy (here personified by Meryl Streep, as the head of the CIA who gives the order for execution ) that can ruin innocent lives. No matter Kafka's fiction, think more about the recent murder of the innocent Brazilian in London in 2005, with the head of the metropolitan police still at work and no one tried for the murder of the poor man. Performance is excellent everywhere - the two main roles of the innocent man and the terrorist are realistically played by the unfamiliar actors Omar Metwally and Moa Khouas. Likewise, Yigal Naor, as the intimidating police chief and Zineb Ouhach, as his idealistic and passionate daughter, seem true to their performances, their unfamiliarity (at least to me) increases the credibility of their characters. Of the greatest Hollywood names present, Gyllenhaal's stature grows with the following films, here playing the initially detached government man but later distressed by the distressed conscience who does the right thing at the end. Witherspoon plays his troubled wife part mostly in a key, but it's believable the same, while David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin convincingly show senators on duty and their minions who will only go so far as to help him until his career prospects are threatened. There are some weaknesses in terms of plots; there is little dramatic need to create the "suspense" surrounding El-Ibrahimi's escape, and Streep's character may be too obvious to a bogeyman / woman. Worst of all is the meaningless inclusion of Gyllenhaal's girlfriend in loco, around only the decoration and a brief love scene for free. Overall, however, an engaging thought - provoking a cinematic experience.
