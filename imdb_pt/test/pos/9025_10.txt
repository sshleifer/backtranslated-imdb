Okay, so you start off very unimaginatively with a narration of the main character (Justine played by Laura Fraser - an incredible actress in and of itself), but it becomes something miraculous. There are little silly things you really should not find funny, but it does all the time. There is an especially memorable moment that sees your jaw drop to the floor the first time you watch it when Jake's male body, containing Justine's feminine mind, is trying to get accustomed to his new anatomy. I'm not going to ruin everything for you, but the second time I watched it was with friends; seeing their faces was brilliant. This makes you shrink but laugh at the same time. I'm also a big fan of the music I used. There is a small, beautiful band that pops up randomly on the street or on a road once in a while, but also some pretty but unknown pop songs (usually the best ones). It feels like it was written for an English cast by an American writer, which irritates me only a few times. Overall, this movie is hilarious. I'm a huge fan of Laura Fraser now, having been given her movie for my birthday, and hopefully, even though some of the cast are little known by most, you'll also enjoy every bit of it.
