This is a very entertaining drama with an excellent cast. Garfield is just like a boxer hiding from the police with that heterogeneous team from Dead End Kids. Most notable of them is the beautiful Billy Halop, who has some very exciting moments. Gloria Dickson, who in real life died very young in a fire at home, is strong and very attractive as Halop's sister, and in the early scenes Ann Sheridan, on the verge of stardom, is a knockout. May Robson is very funny as an old, cranky bitch, but Claude Rains proves here that even a great actor can get in the way if he is cheated (who thought of climbing him as a tough cop in New York?). <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley proves here that he was a good director, with or without musical numbers. The film moves in a fantastic rhythm and the sequence of the water tower is very suspenseful and well photographed. The ending is planned, and the plot nothing surprising or original, but I still find this a very enjoyable experience.
