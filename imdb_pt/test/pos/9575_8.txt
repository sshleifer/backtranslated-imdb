You know, this movie reminded me so much of so many people I know, I think that's the reason I loved this movie so much. I was on the floor laughing because it looked so serious and documented, but the dialogue is so hilarious that you can not help but have fun. Basically, the movie is about those crazed dog owners who are competing in a great show to see who is the best of the best. As it seems the dogs that take this competition seriously, the owners are so insane. Megan, one of the dog owners, is almost a psychopathic killer of the hotel manager because she can not find the special toy for her dog. <br /> <br /> There's another couple that's great, Gerry and Cookie. , this complete and attractive nerd woman who is so kind. At the beginning of the movie, Gerry describes how many boyfriends Cookie had. Throughout the movie, her "lovers" saw her and beat her right in front of Gerry! It was great and fun to see Gerry's appearance. This whole movie is just a joke, and you can not stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up. It's a great fun movie to watch, I recommend it! Now, I have to find a good way to show this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves. : D <br /> <br /> 8/10
