I do not cry easily in the movies, but I have to admit, this one brought me to tears. Although I'm not a fan of Mrs. Streep, her performance was excellent. The title defines in a sentence what is the love of a mother. In the first hour I did not like any of the characters, but that changed when the movie continued. The film also explained why certain marriages last even if there are obstacles. A must see movie.
