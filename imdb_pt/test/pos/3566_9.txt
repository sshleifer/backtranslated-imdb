Leonard Maltin gave this film a list of dreaded BOMBs in his 1995 Movie and Video Guide. What movie was he looking at? Kid Vengeance or God Gun are bombs. This movie is a delight. It's fantastic. It is literate. It is well mounted. It is beautifully photographed, making a brilliant use of colors. From the opening scene, the film catches your eye and shows that this film is a well made satire of the entire genre Spaghetti Western. The film is played for laughs from beginning to end with homage to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip, and the famous confrontation at Good, Bad and Ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. It's a shame that Mr. Maltin rated this movie as badly as it is undeserved. You can only guess at his reason. I suspect he missed the point of the movie and was hoping for something more serious than this movie should be. Kudos belong to everyone involved in this project. This film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literary films and enjoy satire.
