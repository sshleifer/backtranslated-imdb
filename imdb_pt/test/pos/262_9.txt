It's just one of those movies, or you love it or hate it, my girlfriend and I love it, we told my brother to rent it and he hated it, said it was very flashy and colloquial, so he would usually just watch great action movies , then probably not enough blasts left him disappointed. There were some great new talents (I had never heard of the leads before)? Des Brady (the directors' brother) was especially good. Throwing an idiot in the beginning I thought he would never redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and in the end I was actually rooting for him. A very surprising movie with a lot of heart, if you can live without a body count and explosions, then this is very unique. Yashimo Brixton in the United Kingdom.
