He rented this from my location because it was the only new British movie available this week. I've never heard of the filmmaker before or his other films (thanks IMDB). Eventually someone made a good, young British comedy that did not talk to Hugh Grant in his early forties. The story is a tale of morality, but never prega, completely enjoyable of a young and fresh cast faced. Luke Goss's cameo was surprisingly very good, but he surprised me with his excellent performance on 'Blade'. I loved the color classification, especially in the sequels of nightclubs. Great music and a truly unique voice at work here. Nine out of ten and well worth the cost of the rent.
