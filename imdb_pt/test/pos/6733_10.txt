I saw this movie for the first time in the night program of one of my favorite TV channels .... I was hooked from the first minute. Nothing is as it seems first, very suspenseful, great performance of Mr. van Dien, and I do not care about the "heat" in a moment ;-) ... and best of all: you're in for a final surprise! !!
