Unfortunately, I have never seen the full version of this movie. I saw the 87-minute version twice in the 1950s. Even more flower-oriented than usual with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully unusual piece, full of panoramic images, over the magnificently atmospheric sets of Andrejew . Beautifully lit also by photographer Andr√© Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a list of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre and blood-filled characterizations. George Sanders gives a polished performance, while an eccentric millionaire (who turns out to be a defending rival) is admirably played by Agnes Moorehead. Also realizing the most of her role, Patricia Roc. The film was made on location in Spain in 1949.
