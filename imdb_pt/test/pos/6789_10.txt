I hope we never become cynical as a society to enjoy the simple beauty of this film: beautiful to see with its romantic and beautiful English countryside in its message of faith and loyalty. Watch this with your kids, especially your young daughters - Velvet Brown is a wonderful model for girls. This was one of my daughter's favorite movies. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a bestselling book by Enid Bagnold about a girl, Velvet, whose whole life is her horse, Pi, and about her stubborn mind. search for his "impossible" dream. I will no longer talk about the plot unless I spoil it for first-time viewers. She lives with a large loving family in a small coastal village. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that made Elizabeth Taylor a star, and watching the movie is to understand why. She is a natural actress who radiates an inner beauty that matches her outward beauty - confident, passionate, innocent - she is the emotional core of the film. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney gives a wonderful performance as Mi, the young. A man who arrives at his door one day stands and helps Velvet train Pi. This is one of your best performances. She also stands out as Anne Revere as Velvet's mother in an Academy Award-winning role. Your strong, loving, and wise character understands that life is not very valuable unless you follow your dreams: "We are the same. I also believe that everyone should have a chance to have a breathtaking madness once in their life . "<br /> <br /> I highly recommend this very inspiring classic of Hollywood's Golden Age.
