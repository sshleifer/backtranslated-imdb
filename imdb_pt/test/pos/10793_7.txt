I tend to be inclined to films about people who choose to cross the barriers of censorship and express what they really want to express. Barry's character, by Eric Bogosian, is like Howard Stern, but much smarter. The character itself is very fascinating. Like an Oliver Stone movie, I think I was expecting more. The movie falls a little during the third act. In addition, it is quite obvious that "Talk Radio" is based on a game, with its long dialogue scenes. But overall, the movie works. Bogosian is great at leading, and the fact that he also wrote the play that the movie was based on probably helped him. If you want to check out one of Stone's biggest movies, it's best to suggest you check "JFK" or "Savior". This is not your best job, but a good movie, though.
