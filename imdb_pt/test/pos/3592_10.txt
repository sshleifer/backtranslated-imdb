The BBC's Blue Planet is simply jaw-dropping. I do not think I'm exaggerating when I say it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever captured in the movie. From familiar creatures on and near the surface of the ocean to some more unrecognizable and simply bizarre in the dark depths, almost nothing is left out. With a heavy 8 hours, some people may want to check out the edited highlights brought to you in the form of the movie "Deep Blue," but I strongly encourage you to give the series a try. I do not think it will disappoint and if your kids liked the aquatic world brought to them by Pixar's Finding Nemo I'm sure they'll love it too. I just wanted all the television to be so much fun.
