At first glance, a movie like Northfork, a town to be flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters who are sent to evacuate the inhabitants of the city, could be just an ordinary movie. As soon as we find a remaining priest caring for a sick child, a greedy landowner, we could prepare ourselves for a simple story that we could all easily digest. However, when someone is first introduced to this movie, you notice the incredible open cinematography and a scene surrounding a church hall without a wall that opens onto the pastures and panoramic views of the pastured cattle pastures. It soon becomes clear that after this scene and some of the people of the city introduce, that this is not a common movie and no common history, it is something very special and unique. At first glance, things are not clear, but the cinematography and landscape that the viewer witnesses are staggering, and the characters who inhabit this small, soon extinct area are simply astounding. It's what can draw you closer to this qwerky movie, or you've got bored sitting there waiting for something to happen. <br /> <br /> Deeply spiritual films and dreamlike qualities, take a slow and methodical approach that I'm sure will bore some viewers, but if you are patient with it and see the larger picture, the film is great for testify. <br /> <br /> Rating 8 out of 10
