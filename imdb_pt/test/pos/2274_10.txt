In Everything Is Illuminated, Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, an American Jew who is looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during World War II. In a sense, the woman who saved her whole family. <br /> <br /> This is a heartfelt tale about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. A stranger in a strange land, so to speak. Jonathan is not fully prepared for this adventure, he stands out as a sore thumb in Ukraine (he would probably stand out as a sore thumb anywhere). But what he discovers is more, much more than he anticipated. This movie will make you laugh and it will make you cry. Elijah Wood is very good in this film, based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. <br /> <br /> From someone I've talked to, this movie is a bit different from the book. A book I know is very good. However, this is a good movie, there is something for everyone and I really enjoyed it. Can anyone tell Oscar?
