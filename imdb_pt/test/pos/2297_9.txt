I really liked this one. (SPOILERS ??) Had a pretty good plot, the main woman in this movie is really kewl. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that she is the only one left alive and her lover dead, she seemed to be very much like Ninja Scroll. Another incredible movie. ;) <br /> <br /> Watch in Japanese with subtitles. I do not know where the idiots who have learned to speak English are, but for some reason all the voice actors get an F in translation techniques. Captions are more correct. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 9/10
