This film is from beginning to end with great performances, a great soundtrack with original music by Douglas Brown, and a well-paced script that is full of surprises. <br /> <br /> Full of new and not-so-new faces, this one features promising talents, especially in the case of Craig Morris, who plays the main character Eddie Monroe. Morris, who also co-wrote the screenplay, shows a quiet force combined with strong emotional performance while creating a believable character on screen. Also a poignant delivery by Paul Vario, who plays Uncle Benny with genuine warmth, was so compelling that he made me feel hungry as he lovingly prepared his Italian sauce. <br /> <br /> Great new faces, great new music and great new history - what more could you ask for. This movie is highly recommended!
