I did it too. When I saw the band for the first time, I dismissed them immediately, without even listening to the song. So one day, out of sheer curiosity, I bought the cd and fell in love with it. So I bought the video. Hold on to your lunch kids, this will not be cute! the video was great - a great opportunity to listen to music, watch some of the promotional videos and get to know the band ... although I * still * do not know how they can handle wearing these masks all the time! a must for all fans of the band and fans of alternative music in general
