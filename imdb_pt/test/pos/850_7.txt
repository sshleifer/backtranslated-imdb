I remember this movie fondly to see you in the theater. I recently found a copy on VHS and it held my memory of it. Although obviously not a "big budget" movie, the acting is quite credible and the setting, venues and costumes are very well done. I just wish the mammoths had been in more of the picture, but when you see them, they are also well made (remember, SFX was made in those days without the benefit of computers, some poor devil had to put all that hair & false prey on real elephants!) ... the same effect was used on elephants in "Quest for Fire". A better than average adventure film and a chance for the star, Rod Cameron to play something besides a cowboy, which he also did very well over the years.
