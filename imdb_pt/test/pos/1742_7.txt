I was really starting to like this show. It just started slowly and was not given the chance it deserved. It is summer that many people are not at home watching television. I know there are some singing talent and contests, but I like them like so many others. believe it or not, when the American Idol is made for the year I miss. Although not an American idol, I thought it had potential. I feel bad for the singers in the series who really started to grow in me. I wish they would reconsider and put the show back. I think it was a rush to cancel. My only complaint about the show is that I do not care much about the judges.
