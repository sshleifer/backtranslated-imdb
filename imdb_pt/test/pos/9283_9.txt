Yes, the non-Singaporean can not see what the big problem is about this movie. Some of the references in this film go directly over the head of foreign spectators and mainly Singaporeans are those who actually 'catch' it. But I beg of you, stranger, look at the other crap that was produced in Singapore and compare it to this movie. It's like comparing the diarhhoea pieces of a mule to a small diamond. This film is the first to truly show Singapore's decaying womb - something that forces, pretend, does not exist. And there is a part in the movie where a gangster (ah-beng in our singular colloquial ingris) curses in 4 languages, namely Tamil English Malay and Hokkien. Well, the truth is most of us can and do it all the time. The sad thing is that spectators from foreign countries will find it easier to get their small oily claws in this gem, in their home country, it was initially banned only to be given R ratings and also with about 20 cuts. for this. It is good to know that one of the best, creative, daring and original films ever created would be easier for you to get unadulterated, uncensored; on the other side of the world than in their own nation.
