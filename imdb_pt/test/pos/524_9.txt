This film should be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece, with a bizarre and somber film about four different stories from four different locations in Sweden. The one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of a former finance minister is absolutely the best of the four stories about love or career. I would love to see all four as a movie on their own, they can be much more extended. <br /> <br /> Also the single break in the middle is something I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the series (if they're making one) or the DVD extension. Apparently, they had cut a lot to fit in just 3.5 hours.
