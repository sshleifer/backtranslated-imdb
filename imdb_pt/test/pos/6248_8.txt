Lost Oasis of Slausen. . . A place for food, fun. . . and MURDER! After a guy disappears on his way to a gas station, a group of her friends goes out on a trip to look for him. They come across a wax museum where they think their friend may be gone. Unfortunately for friends, however, the owner of the attraction on the road possesses the power to control their wax manikins and use them for evil. One by one, tourists are hunted down and killed by Slausen and his legion of wax dolls. Can friends escape or fall into the same fate as their lost friend? Following in the footsteps (and twisting them around) of the great classic wax films (House of Wax, Mystery of the Wax Museum), Tourist Trap takes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and fascinating with its bizarre history and style . With regard to character development, action, dialogue, flow, etc., it seems to be just a simple slasher. But it goes much further than that, when the director takes control of the plot and takes it to the supernatural thriller that it is. The acting varies from acceptable (from the main cast) to very good (from portrait painter Slausen (played by Western legend Chuck Connors)). Writing moves well and dialogue is well structured, but there are some flaws in logic as the film delves deeper into the story. Also, some scenes are a little silly, like the mannequin banging at Becky. It is nothing, however, that undermines the effect of the film. As you'd expect from a wax doll movie, it's full of endless shivers provided by the mannequins. It is strange that a (mostly) inanimate object can just be quiet and somehow be so disturbing. . . it may be the human likeness, or the blank stare, or the fact that you know you are about to launch an attack. . . whatever it is, the dolls are extremely scary and this effect is used very well throughout the film. With regard to slashers, it is one of the best, and stands out as one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Slasher Elements Required: <br /> <br /> Violence / Gore: The movie is full of some cool killings. The blood is not excessive, but it is well done and ceases to be realistic. <br /> <br /> Sex / Nudity: There is an extensive scene with attractive females (although very attractive 'barely begins to describe the sweeping angel of the future Tanya Roberts), but it's all a joke, since the girls remain under water. They continue to be sparsely dressed throughout the movie, though. <br /> <br /> Cool Killer (s): Spooky is just the beginning of Slausen and his mannequins. One of the best killers of the slasher subgenre. Scares / Suspense: From the opening scene, the film retains a great mix of mannequin creepiness, fright spikes from attacks, and a strong level of suspense in the stranded situation. . . it's all very well done to create a genuinely scary movie. <br /> <br /> Mystery: Well, the mystery was not really the purpose of the movie. . . only the meaning behind it all is what matters. <br /> <br /> - Scene of Awkward Dance: All these beautiful girls and not a single dance. Shame. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8/10. See this creepy slasher! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
