"Head" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The film is a complete contradiction of the Monkees' image. Presents the Monkees in a way that their fans never noticed; men with real thoughts. Fully controlled by its producers, the Monkees had the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film mocks its image, the entertainment industry and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of his best songs. It's a movie worth seeing over and over again.
