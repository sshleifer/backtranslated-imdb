While both this film and the signing of the car chase have been shown as a lack of respect by many critics, both are far above average. Roy Scheider does a great job playing his best type; a hard-working and brave cop who works hard to get the job done, despite the officers and politicians who should support him instead of hampering him. (He played a suburbanized version of the same role as the chief of police in the tourist town of Jaws.) It is not so brave, but the same "do the job done in spite of the politicians" and a brave approach. terrified of everything in the water that goes out on an old boat with a wannabee from Ahab and a nerd, to confront a huge killer shark, is not brave, so tell me what it is ...). <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain; most villains, in fact, have some depth and complexity. This is one of those movies that improve with repeated visualizations. Overall, it captures the atmosphere of parts of New York City: brave, glamorous, often dangerous but full of energy. History is free, firm and subtle; It does the work without strange elements. It may not be one of the greatest of all time, but it is an exceptionally good film. <br /> <br /> Everyone has an opinion about car chases. Mine is that this is well up there with the Mustang vs. Dodge Charger in Bullitt. The Pontiac Ventura / Chevy Nova was similar to the Mustang in being a compact car chassis with reinforced suspension and a powerful small V8 block stuck in a motor bay meant for a tasteless 6. The Ventura / Novas had little respect off the trailing strip , but with the proper suspension mods, they created affordable performance cars that could be used both on the road and on the track. The buzz of those GM V8s as they end is music to the enthusiast's ear. I heard this persecution criticized for "imitating" Bullitt's pursuit. The truth is that they are two works by the same master, Bill Hickman, who also choreographed and directed to the French Connection chase. In addition to directing most of the car chase scenes, he created a gruesome, malevolent presence and a good match with Richard Lynch as a pair of coldly evil killers. <br /> <br /> Yes, persecution has "realism errors" often noticed. , such as the use of 3 different NY roads to represent the Palisades Parkway, the end of the chase in an accident with an 18-wheeler on a road just for passenger vehicles and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape. This is irrelevant. Let's face it: car movie chases are "unreal" by nature. In Bullitt, The French Connection and The Seven Ups, however, Bill Hickman and Phillip D'Antoni have created much more realistic and therefore more exciting pursuits than the pursuit of moving, exploding flying cars so common in recent films .
