This film is a perfect example of Barkers' cinematic gifts for the horror / monster genre. I thought this movie did a great job of keeping the feel and appearance of the novel and comics (or, in fact, the comics may have come in second, I forget). This film was made for Barker fans. It's good to have read the book beforehand, but this is not important if you can follow a movie. I've seen who's on the fence about this movie, read the book and then watch the movie again. You may find a new respect for the film. I came to this film a big fan of Barker and, after reading the book, I loved the movie instantly. There are great cameos, makeup, writing, direction, etc. in this movie. This movie does something that most horror / monster movies fail miserably, shows the monsters. They are there in color, not hidden in the shadows and occupying most of the time on the screen. Unlike other movies that use quick cuts or lighting tricks to hide the creature, this movie celebrates the grotesque and puts them at the forefront like the good guy. Two thumbs up Clive. We are waiting for the usual thief :)
