I gave 9 of 10 points. I was almost crying the whole movie because I had to laugh! <br /> <br /> The story, of course, was not great, but it was not boring either. Erkan and Stefan are assigned to become the bodyguard of the beautiful Nina. In doing this work, they are among the "front lines" of the BND and the CIA. Of course the two are neither bodyguards nor gentlemen, so they run from one disaster to another; and they do it in such a funny way that when you watch some scenes, you can not stop the tears! As actors, these two "smiling and stupid" characters get on very well, better than some so-called professionals. <br /> <br /> Do you think the talk of the two heroes is curious or "pseudo-foreign"? Well, if you hear enough Turkish-German people in Munich talking exactly like them, you'll remember Erkan and Stefan. And maybe, in 10 years, it may have become the common discourse of youth. (God forbid!) <br /> <br /> So if you like to laugh, watch this movie!
