Having grown up with GWTW, I avoided both the sequel book "Scarlett" and the mini-series so far. When I recently watched the video for the first time, I was struck by how much I enjoyed watching Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Rhett Butler and Joanne Walley-Kilmer as Scarlet. I feel that "Scarlet" should be judged on its own merits, instead of trying any comparison with Selznick's venerable masterpiece, GWTW. While the "Scarlet" plot and some of the dialogues suffered from lack of inspired writing, overall I thought this was a dramatization that would be worth between what might have been between Scarlett and Rhett.
