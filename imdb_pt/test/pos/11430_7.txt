Based on the novel The Dismissal by Ermanno Rea, in essence the story is about the slow friendship that develops between an Italian maintenance technician Vincenzo Buonavolonta (Sergio Castellitto, who can be seen as the villainous king of Prince Caspian, and was the leader in Bella Martha)) and a Chinese translator Liu Hua (Ling Tai). They actually went off on the wrong foot, the first punishing the second for his inaccurate and slow translations of what he meant to a Chinese delegate who had bought equipment that was defective. Vincenzo wants to do the right thing, which is rare these days, and that is to tell potential buyers in advance the flaws as well as the ins and outs that the purchase would bring, and that he is bothered by the fact that the agreement was still sorted out. ahead he takes some time off to create a component that can set things right. <br /> <br /> But that also means traveling to China in search of the indescribable machine, which reveals itself well hidden and apparently disappeared. without a trace. With the initial reluctant help from Liu Hua, they set out on this treasure hunt from city to city, which leads us to less visible places in China, away from the Beijings and Shanghais, to cities like Wuhan, with industrial cloths like steel mills and nuclear power plants with their chimneys dotting the scene. The mighty Yangtze River also makes an appearance. Along the way, the usual traps of these travel style movies come into play, such as learning culture, ideals, food, and basically understanding that the world is without strangers if only one makes an effort to try to connect. While suggestions of some romance between the two leaders are suggested, it rarely became a moot point, until perhaps at the end of the film (hey, opposites attract, do not they?) <br /> <br /> In addition to large industrial facilities and factories, we get to see the various cottage industry, like dressmakers working in sweat shop environments like, and I believe cotton too, along with making noodles. As a film, it afforded me the opportunity to travel without leaving my seat to observe, and credit him for not judging a high moral level on the exploration and the likes. And also praise for the film engaging in dialog based on the native languages ​​of the characters, rather than (and I will not name names here) a few other film / cross-cultural collaborations where dialogue is forced-dubbed and out of the ordinary , and truly annoying. Some may find that the supporting characters are very kind too, always opening their arms and doors to a stranger, but I would like to imagine that perhaps in the more rural areas, people in general tend to be more sincere, friendly and basically no I catch the rat race to step on others, or be trampled. <br /> <br /> If there is a message to get out of the film, apart from the fact that I mentioned that the world is without strangers, it is a reminder that some of the things that I consider important may not be so for the others. Importance is something that arises about something else, and its basis really depends on how we define the limits we set. So, given our finite life, I think I should brighten up a little more, live and let live, and sometimes delight in the illusion that ignorance could be a happiness.
