See, this movie is obscure, brilliant and classic that should be sought by any means necessary. I suppose the powers that have been decided will forever be relegated to the bin; However, we could only pray for the chance to see this one on DVD. I'd say even beat the big Phatasm. If you like a dark movie with lots of scary pictures, look for this one and see what a horror movie from the 80s should look like.
