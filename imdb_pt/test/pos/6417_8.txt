The footprints are certainly not your average at the Giallo plant, and that's not bad. Unlike his previous effort, The Fifth Cord (which was his classic Giallo film), Luigi Bazzoni's film abandons almost all of Giallo's trademarks and instead of murder; the focus is very much on the psychological mystery. It is obvious from the beginning that this will be a totally bizarre movie, since the movie opens with a scene set on the moon. Things are not clearer after that, since the lunar sequence ends up being Alice's dream, a disturbed woman. Alice is plagued by dreams of an astronaut stranded on the moon, which apparently came from a screening of a movie called "Footprints on the Moon." After several things go wrong for her, Alice decides to go to an old tourist spot, mostly desert, called Garma. Upon her arrival, she is surprised when the people she meets seem to know her. Alice also meets a young redhead who also seems to know her; the girl tells Alice that she is exactly like Nicole except that she is prettier and shorter in hair ... <br /> <br /> The fact that Footprints does not have much to do with sex, other trademarks of Giallo in the back with their primary audience from the beginning, since most people who go to this film will not get what they were expecting (or probably wanted). But, on the other hand, Footprints demands respect for not following just what happened before it. By 1975, the Giallo had begun to lose its popularity and many of the films that came out in this period (with some notable exceptions) were just retreads of what came before, so Luigi Bazzoni would be having a great chance in this movie. . Florinda Bolkan gives a strong performance in the leading role; and the fact that she is not Giallo's most beautiful heroine is not really important. The mystery develops well over time and although it may become somewhat turgid at times; Footprints are, in general, intriguing for the duration. It will probably not be a surprise to many when they get there that the ending does not make much sense, and really does not clarify anything; but pleasantly adds to the bizarre cult value of the movie, and all in all; I give Footprints a thumbs up!
