Even an old cynical doctor who fancies myself can be out of breath watching an episode of my favorite show. It happened earlier during the end of Eccleston and happened by watching this episode. This is not often, but The Impossible Planet is an example of both the show and television. This is an awesome television <br /> <br /> The Doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strangers written on the wall and the audience (many of those who are moving behind the sofa) are instantly transfixed. A door opens and horrible monsters begin to chase time travelers. That may have taken an entire 25-minute episode on the original show, but all of that happens following the pre-title. You may miss the longer format of the original program, but at least this new series is well-crafted and if we are treated with a disappointing story, at least in general it is only for a week. <br /> <br /> nothing to disappoint a spectator here. It is the DOCTOR, who is the most traditional. Writer Matt Jones and director James Strong have struggled to create a story that will be considered in the years to come. They do this by building a narrative loaded with disgrace. The Doctor and Rose lose the Tardis and are stuck with the protagonists of the distant future. It is interesting how many stories never present such a point of plot in which the doctor and his companions no longer have access to the Tardis, which contributes to a more intriguing type of story. Undoubtedly the highlight is the scene in which Scooti will search for Toby only to find him standing on the surface of the planet, where he turns and calls out. Everything from acting, make-up and the music of Murray Gold makes this a scene that really shocks your audience. <br /> <br /> I can immediately imagine after this episode that the BBC's headquarters received a tsunami of grievances from grieving parents saying how traumatized their children were. It took several hours to get them out from behind the family sofa and they are now refusing to sleep with the lights off. To do this complaining would be to deny the magic of the DOCTOR WHO. Yes, this can terrify, and yes, these images will burn in a child's mind, something they will never forget, even if they live to be a hundred. But I bet my life these same "traumatized" kids would have spent the week begging that no matter what they watch in the next episode
