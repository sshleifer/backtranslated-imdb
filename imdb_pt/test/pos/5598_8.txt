In this peculiar film, the themes of the end of days and of Satan versus Jesus are treated in a new way. Jesus does not want to open the last two seals, and Satan is frustrated in his attempt to bring another soul into hell ... Armageddon, Armageddon and Jehosaphat end up being a company! And the book of life is a little difficult to open. <br /> <br /> What is memorable in this movie are tilted images, out of focus shots and light effects, which are effective but sometimes annoying. And, of course, Donovan is great as a disillusioned Jesus trying to come to terms with what the world and its people have become! So see if you have the opportunity!
