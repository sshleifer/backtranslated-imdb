Even a decade after "Frontline" aired on ABC, as much as I can tell, the "news" programs are still using the same tricks over and over again. Time after time, "Today Tonight" and "A Current Affair" seem to be hidden behind the facade of journalistic professionalism, and still feed us only with tired stories about weight loss and dishonest merchants, blatant network promotions and sense. -parts. Having been frequently subjected to this unoccupied void between 'The Simpsons' at 6:00 PM and 'The Tide' at 7:00 PM, I was also aware of the little tricks these shows would use to attract ratings. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, four comedians on the rise ?? Rob Sitch, Jane Kennedy, Santo Cilauro and Tom Gleisner ?? were also aware of all this and created their frustrations in one of the most perverse and hilarious media satires you have ever seen on television. The four artists had already had a comedic success with their memorable participation on television on Saturday's brilliant Saturday night variety show that lasted two seasons between 1992 and 1993 and featured comedians Mick Molloy, Tony Martin. , Jason Stephens and Judith Lucy. <br /> <br /> "Frontline" has a set of colorful characters, each with its own distinctive and distinctive personality. The current affairs show is led by Mike Moore (Rob Sitch), an ambitious, pretentious and stupid narcissist. Does Mike work under the illusion that the show is playing a vital role for society? is he always convinced that they "maintain their journalistic integrity"? and its executive producers stood out in making him believe that. Mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to people; Occasionally he realizes that he is being carried by the nose, but usually this thought is suppressed by appeals to his vanity or promises of promotion. <br /> <br /> Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) is the senior director. female reporter at the show. She is constantly preoccupied with her public appearance and profile, and if rumors are to be believed, she has had a romantic connection with almost every existing male celebrity. Another equally amoral reporter, Marty Di Stasio, is played by Tiriel Mora, who memorably played the unpublished lawyer Dennis Denuto in the classic Australian comedy The Castle. Emma Ward (Alison Whyte) is the Line Producer on the show, and the only brilliant morality headline on the set of "Frontline." Then there is the highly entertaining meteorologist, Geoffrey Salter (Saint Cilaurus), Mike's best friend and confidant. Geoff always lives by agreeing with Mike's opinion and laughing at his jokes before admitting that he does not receive them. <br /> <br /> For each of the three seasons shows, we are treated with a different EP, Executive Producer. Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence), who unfortunately died in 1995, directs the program during Season 1. He has a decent morale and is always civilized with his employees, and yet he is more than willing to reject them. favor high rankings. Sam Murphy (Kevin J. Wilson) arrives at the set in Season 2, a gentle-talking producer who knows exactly how to handle Mike; The last episode of Season Two, when Mike finally gets the better of him, is a classic moment. Graeme "Prowsey" Prowse (Steve Bisley), EP for season three, is gross, unpleasant and blatantly sexist. It is therefore remarkable that you eventually come to like it. <br /> <br /> With its cast of distinctive and exaggerated characters, "Frontline" has lots of fun satirizing current affairs programs and their dubious methods to gain audience. . Many of the episodes were recorded quickly and inexpensively, often implementing many plot ideas from recent real-life situations, but this never diminishes the program's ten-year tenure. The celebrity comes in abundance with some of the most memorable appearances including Pauline Hanson, Don Burke and Jon English. Stay tuned for Harry Shearer's hilarious appearance in the second season episode "Changing the Face of Current Affairs," playing Larry Hadges, an American hired by the network to reform the show. Particularly in the third season, I noticed that "Frontline" boasted an extremely somber form of black humor, uncharacteristic for such a laid-back comedy show. Genuinely funny moments are born of Brooke being suborned bribed to have an abortion, murder by a crazed gunslinger, and Mike treacherously betraying the hopes and dreams of his best friend, only to be informed that he is a good friend. Final series finale? less a scene added during credits, which was probably only added in case a fourth season was produced ?? was probably the biggest and darkest end of a comedy series I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Below is a very tempting list of my five favorite episodes of "Frontline", but make no mistake, every half hour is an absolutely hilarious and blunt satire. <br /> <br /> 1) "The Siege" <br /> <br /> 2) "Give them enough rope" (Season 2) <br /> <br /> 3) " <br /> <br /> 5) "Add Sex and Stir" (Season 1) <br /> <br /> 4) "Basic Instincts" (Season 2)
