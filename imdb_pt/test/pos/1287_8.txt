I just watched Follow and I thought it was great. I rated 8 out of 10. I plan to watch again with the director's comment and then again in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because of my fascination with Christopher Nolan's latest memento. The following are some similarities; This movie was probably the model for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar. <br /> <br /> Recording the film in black and white gives a mysterious feeling. History and dialogue are really good. The performance of the actors is believable. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan made this movie with a really low budget. I look forward to your next Insomnia release, a big budget movie with my favorite actor Al Pacino.
