I saw this movie when it was released in the UK's smaller cinemas 50 years ago; and the memory remains of a great soundtrack and the tragedy of the plot. I saw it again on video recently. The soundtrack was poor and the image grainy; but it's one of the two films I saw again the next day, being the other Gladiator. The musical theme is intensely tragic and, from the beginning, it is known that it announces failure or death. Certainly one of the best performances of George Sanders; like a man who works on the black market to get paid for what he lost in the war, but nemesis waits; Patricia Roc plays an Eastern European refugee eaten with despair. He is attracted to her, unselfishly wants to help her and then falls in love with her, but she is very proud and hurt to accept help. His love destroys him and, inevitably, the girl and the doctor (Herbert Marshall), who brought the enemy. The plot is of complex intertwined fates, where the subsidiary characters are not who they appear to be. This is like a movie, which diappointed the critics and fought at the box office; but for the adolescent who saw him, and for the retired gentleman who saw him again, is one of the greatest films (considering his age) whose story is more like an opera.
