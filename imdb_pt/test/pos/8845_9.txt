This being my first John Carpenter movie, I must say that I was very impressed with The Thing. From the beginning, the film attracts you and never lets go of tension. The special effects and models of the film are good until today. In addition to Kurt Russell, I was not familiar with any of the cast members, but they were all exceptional in conveying fear, paranoia, and the desperation to survive. The Universal DVD has a wealth of very interesting extras behind the scenes. Highly recommended, 9/10.
