Millions of gold travel by train to the US Treasury. Traveling along is Lois Lane to report on this. Along the way, the train is attacked by masked thieves. They separate the car with the armed guards and attack the rest. This leads to a violent fight between the remaining guards and thieves. The thieves dominate us, but then Lois Lane enters. She hits the train thieves (at one point using a gun), but the train starts to run out of control. Lois can not stop him and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold. Thank goodness Superman is on his way! <br /> <br /> Fast, exciting and non-stop. Probably one of the best of all cartoons. Great.
