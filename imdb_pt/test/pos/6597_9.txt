This movie was incredible. It's a documentary about how surfing influenced skateboarding in the early days. Has interviews with skaters like Tony Hawk (my idol) =) and Stacy Peralta to name a couple. Dogtown is a part of the so-called "ghetto" of California, where there used to be an amusement park that was demolished. People began to walk alongside the dangerous ruins of the park. Soon, the Zepher Surf team was formed. This led to the actual beginning of Skateboardings in Dogtown. The Z boys were a team of disorganized teenagers who loved skateboarding and started the phenomenon known as vertical skating. They started skating in drained pools. That's just a little bit of the story behind it. It even contains rare images of Stacy Peralta's Charlie Angels making an appearance. I think you should buy this movie if you are a skater. This will teach you that skateboarding has not always been popular. Even if you are not, buy!
