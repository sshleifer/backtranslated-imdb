I just looked at another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways that teens in this movie use the body of their dead friend. One, neglected in this statement, is perhaps the most disturbing of all, not surprisingly what the character of Crispin Glover (Layne) does. he is thrilled with one of his friends murdering another friend of his, the assassin's girlfriend. not because layne did not like this guy, but he's excited about her death because it gives him something to do. this poor boy is bored in life and dead inside, that a murdered friend is something to get excited about because it provides something to focus on.
