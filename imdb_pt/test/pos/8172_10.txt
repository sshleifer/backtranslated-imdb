Having grown up a Mormon and struggled with church fanaticism toward blacks (they were not allowed to maintain the priesthood of the church when I was a member) - I was not aware of the organizations' policy of excommunicating gay men and women until after I left the church in 1966 - (I was 20) I was shocked when I learned that friends who were gay were excommunicated even after serving on missions. The last days expose the persecution of gay members to the Mormons. The movie is late. He does an excellent job of showing how the two lead males relate, while being able to grow and develop more fully as individuals. The last few days have a great heart, wonderful original music and a touch of class by Jacqueline Bisset. The film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who leaves behind the boundaries of organized religion and regains his own soul.
