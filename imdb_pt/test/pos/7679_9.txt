I saw the movie in its original theatrical release in Austin Texas. The old Paramount Theater (I do not know if it still exists) was with all the speakers around the walls connected accurately to all six channels. At 15 years of age, I was impressed. The concept of surround sound was completely foreign to music and movies at that time. <br /> <br /> I vividly remember at least three amazing scenes in which the surround sound made a huge impact. (Although, please forgive me if time has distorted my memories with inaccuracies.) The first was a camera trip through Catfish Row, live with the sites and sounds of daily activity. You saw each of them first, like a blacksmith, for example, then, as the camera overtaken them, their sound continued to be heard, going left or right, along the side of the cinema, to the rear. The second was a martial band that was first seen ahead, then passed the divided chamber to the left and to the right. Not only did the sound of each instrument follow its own directional path, it also changed in timbre as it played for you, for your side and then away from you. And if that was not enough, they also explained the Doppler effect of each instrument as it passed. The third scene was near the end of the film, when Porgy leaves Catfish Row in New York to look for Bess. He and about half of the cast members pass by the camera when they leave the village with the same sound effects of the band. The other half of the cast / choir sings along with them and also waves and says goodbye to Porgy and his other friends. Friends' responses can be heard from the sides and back. <br /> <br /> Surround sound has been used with splendid effects throughout the film. I think I remember a rock or something thrown from a pier and I heard it fall into the water behind me. Little things like this were evident to the theater goers who were lucky enough to have the six full channels - things that would look mundane in theaters without her. <br /> <br /> I stayed in the theater for several presentations. You could do that then. And I came back several times before leaving the city. I've never seen the movie again. It literally BEGS for DVD release with restored image fidelity and surround sound. I hope someone has preserved it somewhere. Please, the Gershwin family, allow it to be released before it is lost to other generations.
