As in "Columbus," we see the fatality occur well at the beginning. What follows is a growing web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. Police investigator, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike "Columbus." It's William H. Macy, as the suspicious movie critic who bears the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his "perfect crime." Fans of William H. Macy will enjoy "A Slight Murder Case" as well as those who enjoy crime capers with all sorts of delicious possibilities. Add some well-timed comedy, and that's very similar to a good episode of "Columbo." Highly recommended. - MERK
