There's a lot to like about this movie, despite its humble traps of a PC tale about rape and the criminal always doing better than the victim. The film created a bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes. (I, for one, was sure she was the teacher.) Actually, this would have been more likely in terms of plot because the idea of ​​her best friend's boyfriend came out of nowhere. omnipresent, you never know who it will be. ") Beller is as luminous as ever (but see the KB discussion board for my qualification of this statement). Like all preachers films, the storyline lasts 15 minutes after the climax, so you may want to stop watching at that point. Unless you're really curious to find out what happens to Phillip. Blythe Danner, like her mother, is in the role she was born to play: the super worrisome and super protective mother. Some good scenes from the 70's for fans of the 70's. (The dark bar where the father goes to drink the pain is all dark stained beams, barrels, oak and cork). A must for Beller fans and highly recommended for fans of the 70s or 70s kitsch High School melodrama in general.
