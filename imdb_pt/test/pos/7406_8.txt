This film was my first contact with the talents of Chris Cooper. I was deeply impressed by the character he played. I knew that when I saw the movie, more good things would come from this talented actor. He plays a Union Captain who, along with a couple of enlisted men, is foraging in eastern Kentucky. They happen on the farm of a woman "Sesech" whose husband chose to go to the Confederation. The portrait of Eastern Kentucky, and his feelings seriously divided during the War, are very accurate. If you're looking for a war movie with a lot of blood and courage, that would not be it. If you are looking for a drama that explores the psychology of people at war, in fact and philosophically, then this is the best study of how divided loyalties affected the interaction of people in the border states during the American Civil War.
