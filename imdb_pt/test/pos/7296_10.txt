<br /> <br /> When I accidentally rented A Thousand Acres, I thought it was time to have a fun story about King Lear and of course Michelle Pfeiffer was there, so what could go wrong? Very quickly, however, I realized that this story was about a thousand other things besides just Acres. I started to cry and could not stop until long after the movie was over. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn, for bringing us a wonderfully subtle and compassionate film! Thank you for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and kindness! <br /> <br /> I recognized the angry sister; the fugitive sister and sister in Denial. I recognized the Abusive Husband and why he was there and then the Father, oh oh the Father ... all superbly played. I also recognized myself and this movie was an eye opener, a relief, a chance to face my own truth and finally do something about it. I really hope A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on a few others out there. <br /> <br /> Since I did not understand why the cover said the movie was about sisters fighting over the land - they were not fighting each other at all- I watched it a second time. Then I could see that if one had not lived a similar story, one would easily miss the great stream of fear and fear and the deep bond between the sisters who cross it. That's exactly why people usually ignore the truth about their neighbors, for example. <br /> <br /> But another reason why this movie is so perfect! <br /> <br /> I do not know give a rat's ass (pardon my French) about how far the story of King Lear is followed. All I know is that I can honestly say: this movie changed my life. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, you CAN MAKE the difference. <br /> <br />
