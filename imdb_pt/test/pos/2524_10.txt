The story takes place on the streets of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, where a boy named Pixote grows up alone without his parents. Left with problems and without direction, Pixote is taken to a children's home with other street teens. Behind closed doors, terrible things occur within the team and within groups of children. And there is one last trigger that makes the place explode, the last incident that makes Pixote and his friends decide to leave and escape. From there begins a journey overloaded with strong friendships, broken friends, love and hate, criminal activities and simply relax on the beach talking about things, something that someone like you and me do sometimes. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is perfect in many ways, because it touches you on many levels, it did it to me anyway. The document style used to portray Pixote and its surroundings seems more realistic, and the actors, who are really street children and have lived similar lives, help humanity in conditions that look more natural. It has a social commentary on child abuse as well, but I think what makes the film so good is that the pressure is on history and not on political opinions. The last scene, which I think is the best part of the movie, seems to me to be something beyond what I've seen before. So full of emotions and at the same time so little sentimental makes this film a tale of true, credible, unbearable and unforgettable history. A truly touching masterpiece that is so underrated! <br /> <br /> My vote: 10/10
