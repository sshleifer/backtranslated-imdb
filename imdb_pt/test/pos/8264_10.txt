I was lucky enough to record this wonderful drama, both parts, when it was originally screened at the Masterpiece Theater. I loved it but missed it. Then one day, as I passed the old tapes, I found it again. I recorded on DVD and watched and --- WOW! I still love it! The calls are excellent and my only complaint is that I wish we had seen more of Kester! What man! And Prue. She is so strong and wonderful ... living in an age and time when her affliction and how she deals with it is seen as unhappy and evil. Even her own brother tells Prue to her face that he doubts a man can have her. * sigh * Unfortunately my copy is not the best, with wear over the years, and I would also love to have this on professional DVD if it happens.
