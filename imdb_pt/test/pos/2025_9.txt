I was really excited to see Rock Star because I'm a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. I was surprised that I liked it more than I thought I would. The script left something to be desired, but the film's performances made up for it. There were moments when the visions of Spinal Tap came back, and I can not help but think that this movie would have been even better as a documentary. But I digress. <br /> <br /> Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent, playing with credibility a common subject whose greatest dream comes true. He does this with the wonder and innocence that make you not only believe in him but also make you care about his character. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston, who has not impressed me in movies so far, is surprisingly good as the girlfriend / manager. It shows more real excitement than I've seen in their last movies together. <br /> <br /> But most of all, it's the music in this movie that really appeals to you. Caught up with a few songs from the '80s (let's face it - Bon Jovi would have all 80s music fans swinging instead), the movie really rocks with the original songs of Steel Dragon and their Wahlberg performance. <br /> <br /> I plan to see this movie again, but first I'm going to run off and buy the soundtrack!
