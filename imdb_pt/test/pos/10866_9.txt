Here we have a clever mix of typical hongkongmovieshootouts, worlddestructionthemes and intelligent cinema. Not that the script does not have its big holes and some special effects are a bit noisy. But cinematography is an optical delight and the soundtrack is top notch. The mixture of fast action sequences and slow, sometimes almost poetic, colorful parts is unmatched in their type of film, so a classification is quite difficult. The closest genre is a disaster or a terrorist film with deeper human and political notes than usual. It is worth being seen all over the world in theaters. But I'm expecting this for so many other movies (mostly Asians) before and no one seems to believe me. Unfortunately.
