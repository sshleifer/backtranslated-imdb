"Lackawanna Blues" is so emotionally powerful in his portrayal of urban blacks during the 1950s and early 1960s. A culture of joy and sadness specific to working class blacks that existed outside the dominant culture. The characters in the James-Hudson play portrayed black people living imperfect lives, but held strong positive values ​​of love, loyalty, and honor. Although the characters departed from these values ​​at times, they did not deny the importance of values. Instead, they recognized and accepted their own imperfections and those of the other characters without trial, who went through the life of "nanny". The central characters were strong and believable, the scenarios were realistic and brought back personal memories from a bygone era. Pre-integration urban life was a time of sensory intoxication, sight, sound and smell that could almost be experienced while watching the drama "Lackawanna Blues," which I watch over and over again.
