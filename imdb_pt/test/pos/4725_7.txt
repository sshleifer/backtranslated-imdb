Patricia Arquette plays American doctor Laura Bowman, who takes a vacation in Burma to try to heal her spirit after the murders of her husband and son. She is left behind in Rangoon during a military crackdown and leaves the town with an elderly man working as a "tour guide". But he is not a simple tour guide; he is a teacher who brings her to life outside the tourist traps ... the two are caught up in political turmoil and Laura sees with her own eyes how the government betrays and oppresses its own people. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites because of its themes. First, it is informative (describing some of the injustices that are occurring in Burma). Secondly, it is about a woman's struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss. Thirdly, it is about compassion and sacrifice, and people coming together - without even knowing each other - to endure pain and fear. <br /> <br /> Almost all the beautiful scenes of this film are important; nothing is wasted here. It is a sincere and moving film. There is also a very emotional score composed by Hans Zimmer, which complements scenes very well. <br /> <br /> A definitive recommendation, especially for people concerned about human rights ... and people who want to know, "What is the purpose? serve?" <br /> <br />
