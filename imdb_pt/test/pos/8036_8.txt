I will not comment on the story as such. I agree with most of the people's comments that this is a good action movie with a well told story and good acting. <br /> <br /> This film deserves 100% for cinematography for its opening sequence. The opening photo is awesome and I still have not figured out how they did it. The movie is worth watching this shot alone! A pity, therefore, that the DVD that is currently out is just the movie and no information is given regarding the making of the movie. Let's hope someone comes with the special edition. <br /> <br /> And the even better thing is that the opening sequence also becomes the ending leaving you totally guessing! Good stuff. A must have for a collector of classic movie moments.
