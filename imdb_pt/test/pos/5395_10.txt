This movie was great! I love the way you mix black humor with drama. There are times when you think there is no possible way for you to laugh at the situation presented and still experience a startling giggle. He is beautifully portrayed, with great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels and Emile Hirsch. It is well written with an elegant and surprising ending. I'm not saying that everyone will like it as much as I do, but give it a chance and rent it. The DVD has great special features, including full commentary from director Dan Harris and Emile Hirsch and one from Sigourney Weaver, who give interesting information about the film. I hope my review is helpful and you enjoy the movie!
