I saw this movie on its opening night and enjoyed it. I probably would have liked it more if I had not been sitting next to my dad. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking about the whole thing. He kept saying the movie was a drug and that it was stupid. The problem is that he did not understand that the creators were making fun of the horror genre with the movie. In all horror movies, there is always a certain character represented. If they were not in the movie, well, you might not like it very much. The characters of the trademark are: "The main character": Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) "The boyfriend of the main character": Wade (Jared Padalecki) "The main character's brother / (coming soon) Reformed Jerk ": Nick (Chad Michael Murray)" The annoying Sluttish character ": Paige (Paris Hilton)" Characters who are just around to look cute ": Dalton (Jon Abrahams) and Blake (Robert Ri'chard) With these characters, it becomes a little predictable who will die and who will live. Obviously, you know who goes with what I just typed. The movie can be predictable (I actually had a pretty good idea who would die just watching the trailer), but it was still fun. It may seem stupid (why is there a sugar mill in the middle of a desert camp that did not exist at first?) Sometimes, but it's very easy to watch. Comedy and gore were the perfect amount for filmgoers with weak problems, but it does not work, so in conclusion, this movie was not so good. as hot as the fire in which the apparatus entered, but the temperature could still burn the "wax."
