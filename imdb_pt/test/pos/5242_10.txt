I really have nothing to add to all the other reviews except: For me, the movie looked like a silent movie being slowly adapted to sound. The text panels that bore the story reinforced that impression, I suppose. Along the way, the actors were allowed to abandon the blistering performance of the theater; Marguerite Churchill looks a lot like a typical silent movie hero at the beginning of the movie, but in the end more refined expressions are allowed. Gus the Swede? Reminded me of the comic characters in Shakespeare's plays, and Windy seemed to me to be one of the first Donald Ducks. <br /> <br /> It really surprised me that everything was filmed outdoors, on the spot, and even if the dust of all the wagons, horses, and oxen obscured the vision, it really should have been like that for the real settlers! It also became clear to me that many of these Indians must have been real, and I did not detect any obvious racism in relation to them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As someone who became a true fan of Wayne through the John Ford cavalry trilogy, and thought Stage Coach was Wayne's first as the protagonist, this movie was a revelation. The plot is very simple, again remembering a silent movie, but the grain is really very real! An incredible movie that was made with this technique and under these conditions in 1930.
