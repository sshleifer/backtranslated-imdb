This British film version of the play I AM A CAMERA is based on "Christopher Stories" by Christopher Isherwood. This is the source material of the famous musical CABARET. <br /> <br /> Julie Harris, a great actress of her day, reprises her role as a 1951 Tony Award winner as Sally Bowles. She's a long way from Liza Minnelli's character, but the basics "Sally" are all here, despite the various movie codes that would have blocked the story from being filmed in Hollywood. Harris is perhaps stagy, but she is also very good as the crazy and maddening Sally. Her singing number is obviously dubbed (by Marlene Dietrich no less), though Harris apparently sings to herself at other times. <br /> <br /> Laurence Harvey (with ugly hair) plays Isherwood with zero charm and can not even make the character interesting. Shelley Winters does little with the role of Natalia (Marian Winters won a supporting Tony for the play), and Anton Diffring is very much like Fritz. Ron Randell plays Clive, but it sounds a bit noisy. Lee Seidl is funny as the owner. <br /> <br /> However, despite the general appearance and cheap appearance, Harris takes center stage and she is incredible. This film was released the same year as EAST OF EDEN in which Harris gives a brilliant performance as Abra. Comparing the two performances, take a good look at the talent that Miss Harris possesses. These two characters could not be more misaligned. Sally, Harris, straightens up and laughs and lets out a lecherous chuckle. She also plays in circles around boring Harvey. <br /> <br /> Without music and with a familiar plot, many viewers may find little here to recommend this movie but it is a great chance to see the great Julie Harris repeating what was probably a very shocking role in 1951 .
