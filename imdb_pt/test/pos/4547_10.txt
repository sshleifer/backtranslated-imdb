The main advantage of this film is the combination of Chris Farley and David Spade. This was the first film in which this comedy duo exhibited his Laurel-e-Hardy-esque mood mark. Farley's obvious physical comedy ability is perfectly augmented by Spade's sarcastic approach in all situations. <br /> <br /> This movie stands out from other comedy movies. Tommy Boy appears with Blues Brothers as a comedy work whose individual scenes and scenes derive from the plot rather than serve to break the plot and give the film a disjointed feel as many other comedic movies do. Thanks to Sagal's excellent direction, each scene is tight and immediately foretells or enacts the story being told. He has as much credit for the hilarity of the film as Farley and Spade. The performance of Dennehy, Lowe, Ackroyd and many others (see gas station 35 miles from Davenport) strengthens the film. <br /> <br /> The film deserves several views as there are many fine nuances to the film. can be overshadowed by Farley / Spade. <br /> <br /> I believe this movie is very well made and is the funniest movie I have ever seen.
