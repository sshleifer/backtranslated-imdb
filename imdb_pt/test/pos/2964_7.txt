The make-or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click on each other. Matt is very unpleasant: indifferent, braggart, seemingly lazy and misogynist. He was seriously injured by his dysfunctional mother and this makes it a little easier to take. I think I liked the details of his dysfunction - he was believable. He overcompensates for bragging that he will preach Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he attacks twice. When they speak, he can not show who he really is. She sympathizes and then blocks you in the right moments. She looks so mature and strong that her features that appear later do not seem to fit. (To me) I found her incredibly sexy and beautiful. . . In the next door beautiful, I call it. So I would like this movie unless it really messed it up. Funny things happen to the coach, but Matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring. The football scenes at the end were disconcerting. Matt does not carry the ball but appears to be blocking his back. Guys, he's not the right size! He's fifty pounds too light for that position. But I thought his acting was skilful. I measure this by the way I wanted to wring my neck a few times during his scenes with Meredith Monroe. The movie was fine. Meredith M was better than okay.
