There were at least half a dozen silent film versions of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," and there were several television productions. But no one ever made a playful big-budget play of the play. . . so far. Given the nature of the game's most memorable character, Shylock the Nasty Jew, it's a good guess that the unpleasant little thing that happened in Europe in the late 1930s and 1940s may have dampened the filmmakers' enthusiasm. Of course the main motivation for Michael Radford's new film is to give Al Pacino a chance to scream, bray, cry, mutter and be tormented - and all of this is very good. Like Richard III, the role of Shylock is the dream of a chewing scenario. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an antisemitic, since he never knew a Jew. The Jews were banished from England 300 years before their time to a few decades after his death; and is unlikely to have traveled abroad. At some level, the Jews might well have been a mythological race for him. But while Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic, his play certainly is. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that probably suggests the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th century moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version begins with a scrounge on the despicable terror of the Jews and then sees Antonio (Jeremy Irons) spitting for free at Shylock (Pacino), who is really standing, tending his own business.
