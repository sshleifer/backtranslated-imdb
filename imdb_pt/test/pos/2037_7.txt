Surprisingly well-played and well-written film about a young man of hard rock - but decent - getting the long-awaited stardom ticket: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. It is no exaggeration, the film tries to keep things in perspective and is not exaggerated; This certainly makes you think twice about these lingering teen fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite a solid dialogue, follows a tried and tested stereotyped pattern, and gets mired in its own clich√©s in the final act. I liked it a lot more than the sugary fluffball "Almost Famous". It has a good, bitter side to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish may have made it more memorable. ** 1/2 of ****
