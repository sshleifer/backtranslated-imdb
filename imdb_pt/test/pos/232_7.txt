Although Cover Girl's plot is very fragile and tired, it serves well as anchor for the musical numbers of Kern and Gershwin. After her signature role in Gilda, Hayworth chose to star in this musical that seems tailor-made for her. In addition to looking as beautiful as ever, she impresses with her dancing as well. Gene Kelly, who was loaned to Columbia by MGM, joins her in the dance and the sequence in which he shit with his own shadow was well done. The supporting characters were also competently acted. Personally, I did not like Cover Girl as much as the musicals that Hayworth did with Fred Astaire. However, Cover Girl is still a lot of fun and easy to recommend. My score: 7/10.
