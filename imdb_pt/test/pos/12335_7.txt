I also saw this in the movies in the 80's and never forgot it, even though I've never seen it anywhere else. <br /> <br /> I do not know if, if I had seen it now, it would look dated, but remembering the plot and comparing it to some of the awful modern movies I saw in Zone Horror, I should think about it. I still remember his coffin slipping and opening and all the corpses becoming reanimated, and the blue ray. Having seen hundreds of horror movies and still remembering this, it should be good.
