Another popular screening for a British image at the Century Theater in Coalville. A well-crafted, solid drama with an ever-evolving plot and 'twists in the tale' ... like the stacked lies! A masterclass to act for an impeccable cast, well organized by first director Julian Fellowes. Excellent performance, as always, by Tom Wilkinson, but good moments of interest, including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience has been absorbed by this movie, which includes some shock incidents that really make you jump. A good tight production around only 80 minutes, probably produced on a very limited budget, but a success, which should make Fellowes re-direct to the big screen. Some publicity for the film seemed to suggest that it was created in the 1950s (as in Nigel Balchin's novel), but obviously this is not the case. Recommended view.
