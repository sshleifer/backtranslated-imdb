Pixote is directed with only a fragment of sentimentality. And yet, more than imagining Hector Babenco owes some of his cinematographic skills to this neo-realistic film by Vittorio De Sica, especially Shoeshine (that film, like Pixote, takes place mostly inside a children's prison). Still, although I may still prefer De Sica's film to decide between the two is so close because it is, without pun intended, choosing between two children. Both are wonderful works of raw drama, and with Babote Pixote has an extra edge and distressing quality to deal with in that this is not filmed under conditions brought on after a world war. That's the way it was in Brazil - someone would see him with a little more charm and admiration in Cidade de Deus, maybe in some of the same places - and these kids were on the streets before and after the movie was made. Some are not alive more than 20 years later, as everyone knows. <br /> <br /> "star", pre-adolescent street kid Fernando Ramos da Silva, plays the title character, a young man without a father or a mother. in fact, any family that will take care of him and will be placed among dozens of other street children and delinquents in a reformatory for boys. The conditions could not be much worse, and become even more unbearable when two children are killed one after another for some cause of custody duty. There's a mutiny and a breakout, and in the middle of the movie we meet Pixote with a few other young people, including Babs a practical travesti who is not even 18, and they become wallops, drug dealers, whatever it takes to survive. None of this, I repeat, is shown with a kind of seriousness - surely you would never see in a million years to see Ron Howard or Paul Haggis directing this kind of image - and yet there is an emotional honesty towards everything precisely because nothing at all all the scenes are significant to show how fragile Pixote's life is, and how he can be killed or die somehow at any time, and so, even without reaching puberty, he has to be at the level of those around him who are a little older (though not much at all) and become things that will haunt that person forever. Despite Babenco's use of a tender and lugubrious musical score and one or two scenes with people crying a lot, nothing seems forced. Like De Sica, perhaps more, given the consistent conditions of the street children of San Paolo and Rio, he is a natural director of children, and pulls out of Ramos da Silva and Jorge Juli√£o and others a really good job that provides the touches certain. of "cinematic" drama (which is not so real that it becomes a documentary, which is not a bad thing to say) and even subtlety in some scenes. <br /> <br /> Pixote may not be as well known as Are twenty-first century Brazilian films that recall the horrors of Rio, or even neo-realist films, but it should be. Anyone who wants to have a good and agile vision of what it is must look for it in a library or another and immerse themselves in the best foreign film of 1981.
