Rita Hayworth is well where she should be - as "Cover Girl" in this 1944 Technicolor film starring Gene Kelly, Phil Arvers, Eve Arden, Lee Bowman and Otto Kruger. Rita plays a beautiful dancer, Rusty, working in a small club owned by the man she loves, Danny (Kelly). Every Friday they go out to oysters with Genius (Silvers), the club comedian. They all hate oysters, but are looking for a pearl. When they find one, all three will have good luck, they believe. <br /> <br /> Rusty auditions and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine - she gets ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner. (Kruger) sees a resemblance between Rusty and the girl he once loved, who ends up being Rusty's grandmother. When she becomes the cover girl, the world opens up for her and her Broadway dreams come true. Danny wants her to succeed, but at the same time realizes that he has lost her. <br /> <br /> "Cover Girl" has exuberant dance numbers and songs by Jerome Kern, with Rita dubbed by Martha Mears. Rita is at her best playing Rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past. To a woman so beautiful, sexy and desirable, she was apparently very insecure and always under the dominion of domineering men. None of this ever appeared on screen, nor the fact that she did not want to be a movie star. She is one of the true goddesses and has brought everything she has done for life. Gene Kelly is in a serious role here, but there are many chances to dance and sing. Phil Silvers is very kind and funny as the best friend and comic book in the house. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie with no dull points. The only problem I had is the idea that Rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves. When supermodel Jinx Falkenberg, who plays herself in the film, talks about getting married, she is warned by her boss not to do it, that she is very much needed for the modeling business. They do not tell us if Rusty continues with his career or goes back to work at Danny's - but all signs seemed to point to the Brooklyn club. Why could not she have both? However, you can not beat "Cover Girl" for top entertainment, beautiful color, lovely music, great energy, good performances and its most fabulous, the glorious Rita Hayworth.
