Not too top is the classic "top gun" or "independence day" when it comes to jet fighter excitement. Yes, the top-down movie is based on a really fictional example of how anyone can make a ransom, but it's cool because it breaks all the traditional rules. The kid doing what he wants to do in a jet the way he wants to do. <br /> <br /> I can not really put my finger on what I love about this movie, but others I know who saw the movie feel the same way about this I do. I think it's basically a lot of fun, but maybe a little unreal for some to buy. <br /> <br /> Once again, after all, I loved it, people I know, loved it so definitely worth it. seeing make their own decisions about it. Put it this way, I thought Top Gun was one of the best fighter pilot movies ever and I like this movie as much as if not more than Top Gun. Do not miss it, you see, a truly inspiring film.
