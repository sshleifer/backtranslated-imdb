"Cherry" tells of a naive and single virgin who decides to have a baby but is not sure how to do it. This easy sleeper goes full of quirky characters and ironic situational humor. Cool, fun, breaking things, I really enjoyed this movie ... for anything worthwhile. Recommended for lovers of romantic comedy who want something different.
