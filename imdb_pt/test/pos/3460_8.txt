This is definitely a movie that will make you think about the daily struggles that a person can spend every day. Great acting for the two leading roles exemplifies this even more, and you will not regret watching this movie anyway. <br /> <br /> It's a comforting tale of two new friends exploring the ups and downs of everyday life seen from the seat of a wheelchair. Their friendship is tested as are their spirits when they get their own apartment out of the nursing home. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone who likes pictures of friends or just want to see a wonderful and moving film. which avoids all cliches and traps and does not once get soaked.
