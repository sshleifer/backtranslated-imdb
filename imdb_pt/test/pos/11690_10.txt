First I have to admit that I had some doubts about the director. He made some films (with Kharkovsky) about the recent history "czech = east" or more precisely about families (individuals) as they survived some historical moments. But it has always been like Chinese food. This movie was totally different. It was pure, shows the bones of life, shows the variations of human nature. This film is an excellent work of art (history, acting, image, music) but shows the life around you with a much brighter light that we do not want to see. By the way I saw it on a DVD (with English subtitles), but I'm afraid that in the US I can not get it.
