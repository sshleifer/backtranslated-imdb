"Kramer vs. Kramer" is a fantastic drama about an unhappy woman who goes out on her husband and son. The husband now has to take on the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. In doing so, they know each other better. But then the mother and the wife come back and she wants custody of the boy. "Kramer vs. Kramer" has a lot of drama with some wonderful pieces of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won his first Oscar for Best Actor for his brilliant performance here. Most people say that his performance in "Rainman," which earned him his second Oscar, is his best. He was great in this movie, but I disagree that he is the best of it. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this film. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. He's funny too sometimes. Also giving a great performance is Meryl Streep, who was not as well known when she made this movie as it is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (Best Supporting Actress) for her work on "Kramer vs. Kramer" as the wife and mother who tries to meet after leaving the family. Justin Henry, who was just 8 when the movie came out, is as wonderful as the son of Hoffman and Streep. He earned an Oscar nomination for his role here, and is still the youngest artist to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also good as a family friend. She also received an Oscar nomination (for the supporting actress, where she lost to co-starring with Streep). "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a great movie from beginning to end. Writer and director Robert Benton made an absolutely unforgettable movie. <br /> <br /> **** (of four)
