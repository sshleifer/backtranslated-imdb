Hal Hartley has been compared to a modern day William Shakespeare, by virtue of the fact that he receives his actors to deliver their lines in an iambic pentameter. He certainly knows how to put together a cast and, once again, Martin Donovan is sensational while Thomas Jay Ryan plays his part with an intensity that is unforgettable. Although the movie is only 1 hour, the timeline works wonderfully and keeps the audience in a swift run to the end. Without a doubt, Hal Hartley is one of the best directors out of America in the last 20 years, with a vision that is unique, fun and entertaining.
