It is not difficult, after watching this film, to see why the post-silent Soviet cinema is held in so little critical esteem. Do not misunderstand me. THE CRANES ARE FLYING is, for the first half at least, extremely amusing, sporting a completely unexpected lightness of touch from their country of origin; a new, quick and spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms; two impressive subjective seats; and a romantic verve that flirts, but never completely falls, Lelouch's territory. It is just that, in its inclusion of vast social, national and world events in a love affair, it is not essentially different from a conventional Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, in a Soviet Union that emphasized the state above all, and in an era (World War II) that suppressed individualism and freedom to defend murderous symbolism, this foreground of two attractive young lovers it's a relief. And the thematic similarities - all consuming love rented from war - with two of the most wonderful of all films (SEVENTH SKY, LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG) also increase their potential kindness. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. Boris, a young factory worker from a brilliant medical and artistic family, and Veronika, a student, lead a relaxed relationship at night, his only free time. Boris's cousin, Mark, a composer, also has eyes on Veronika. When the Nazis invade Russia, Boris volunteers secretly, to the dismay of his family and lover. He promises to write to Veronika, but never does, thinking that perhaps she has not bothered to see him, or maybe the mail is not reliable. Veronika's parents die during an air raid, and she moves in with the family of Boris, helping in the hospital where her father cares for the wounded soldiers. Annoyed by Boris's silence, Veronika is also besieged by Mark's attentions. , who gained exemption from military duty by bribing a local authority. She ends up being worn out and marries him, to the disapproval of her foster family. Boris, meanwhile, is dead in action. Veronika, revolted with herself and with an adulterous mark, refuses to believe it, and awaits her return, promoting a young orphan with her name. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the birds that the couple sees at the height of their lives. love, perhaps symbolic of its transcendental and epiphanic power. But that is illusory - the cranes fly in a V-formation, and that form permeates the entire film, through the geometric shapes of buildings, interiors, exteriors, groupings of people, composition, camera angles, heroine's name - or editing in which feet walking south-west in one story are reached by feet walking southeast in another. <br /> <br /> This serves to fatally trap lovers who have no control over their destinies, and also suggests the Stalinist power that is never specifically mentioned in the film. Although the pair seems to be free in space, whether literally in a depopulated environment or privileged in generous close-ups, they are always ironized, minimized, torn apart - by circumstances, families, by crowds (see the bright, if obvious, sequences where Veronika is swallowed by tanks, or the pair can not find themselves in a huge crowd), or simply by the structure of the film, which is constantly distancing, through parallelism, its proximity. Although at first the lightness and brightness of the style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll, it is constantly being broken by strange editions or camera angles of distracting music fragments. <br /> <br /> What is most remarkable is how these blocks to romance are achieved by abstracting instead of emphasizing historical forces. The whole movie, but especially the war itself, is strangely unreal and dreamy, we are never shown its harsh and brutal reality, only its effects on lovers. In fact, it is transformed into a majestic spectacle, devoid of unpleasant Germans. <br /> <br /> In front of home, air strikes create delightful effects of light and shadow, or ruins of almost gothic decadence. In the bunker, the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than the apparent indifference of Boris. The empty, dreamy Moscow initially puts lovers first, than Veronika and her mother, although they are less real places than emotional spaces. <br /> <br /> When Mark tries to force Veronika, air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations. This is a brilliant sequence, filmed with a silent Expressionist terror, in which the screen seems to explode with hysteria and violence, all the more appealing to the melancholy kindness of previous scenes. <br /> <br /> It's not much different up front as well, where fights for the honor of girls are more urgent than tactics, Nazis or despair. The movement of Boris and his injured companion in an end space is more a summary of the experience of the war, its scenery in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic; and Boris's latest flashback, Pre-Death, is an extraordinary blend of dream-fulfillment and intense anxiety, in which what is desired becomes threatening and grotesque. From this point, the film becomes a little less interesting, a little more obvious. Another realization of Expressionist overload - Veronika's suicide attempt and child's ransom - is manipulated awkwardly; and his shadowy guilt casts a paralyzing shadow over the whole film. The use of deep focus, at first sweeping, soon becomes exhausting, devoid of any moral force or meaning that Welles brought to his use in the CITIZEN KANE. After what appears to be a discreet critique of totalitarianism in favor of the individual is cruelly betrayed at the end, when individual suffering, as so often in Russian art, transmutes into symbolic hope (ie, dehumanized, sexless). A feather.
