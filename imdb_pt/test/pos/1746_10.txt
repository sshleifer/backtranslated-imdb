Wow. I saw this movie and "Up" the same day within an hour of each other in different theaters. I saw "Mr Bug" first, and was totally disappointed with the "Up" accompaniment. What a beautiful and moving film! Movies from the 1930s and 40s for us today may be annoying with their melodramatic acting and dialogue, but as animation the same melodrama and guttural mood can be wonderful. And the soft "organic" lines of the 30's design And music leaves you with a comfortable mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybugs, locusts, bees, snails, bedbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, crickets, and more each with their own cute (but not arrogant) idiosyncrasies. Interaction with the human world, from nemesis (cigar smokers, high-heeled wearers, innocent children playing) to the good-hearted destroyers, and to the unknown destroyers, is realistic and fascinating. You care about insects and Dick and Mary. The protagonist Hoppity is not a perfect superman who "solves things," but an optimist who leads everyone by the garden path (literally!), And every time you think you're going to end up happy in the 1930s style, another obstacle ...! I was on the edge of my seat a lot more than with "Up". I left the theater smiling and laughing: something that did not happen a long time ago!
