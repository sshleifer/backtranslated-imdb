This review contains MILD SPOILERS, but not enough to ruin the story ... <br /> <br /> I recently watched Nihon Chinbotsu (Sinks in Japan or Japan Sinks, depending on where you live), a remake of the 1970 film the same name, which was based on the bestseller Sakyo Komatsu. This movie is a jewel of Japanese cinema. It seems that Japan is sinking due to a subduction of a tectonic plate to the west. Americans predict that this would happen over the 40-year period, but according to Dr. Tadokoro (a seemingly "crazy" scientist), that will happen in less than a year. The Japanese government is not so convinced but it establishes a disaster evacuation plan as well as forming a new D1 team to deal with the crisis. During a trip to China to negotiate evacuation plans, the Japanese prime minister was killed and sent the cabinet into a state of panic. The D1 team is left to handle most issues, and led by the newly elected Minister of Crisis Management, Saoro Takamori (former wife of Dr. Tadokoro). She turns to Dr. Tadokoro for advice, and he has plans to blow huge astronomical holes under Japan to avoid the sinking process. <br /> <br /> Japan will soon have to negotiate with several countries and persuade them to adopt. Japanese refugees. Soon it seems that many countries are reluctant to accept more because of the sudden influx of Japanese in their country and the ensuing chaos (if that happens, touch wood, I hope Misaki is safe ... she can always stay in mine house ... hee hee). The evacuation scenes are really well done, showing the chaos, the suffering and the desperation that civilians face in such disastrous times. And the many faces of human beings arise, arrogance, selfishness, bribery, bravery, cowardice ... <br /> <br /> This is a really well done film. the narrative is solid, with engaging storyline and marvelous acting. Dr. Tadokoro (played by Toyokawa Etsushi) was done very well, portraying a divorced and often crazy scientist who kicks and fixes things. His frustration and concern were very visible and this is really a good thing. Reiko (played by Shibasaki Kou) was also played very well, and has the most memorable line of the entire movie (go watch her to find out) and I imagine she has a great acting voice. She interprets the love interest of Toshio Onodera (played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi of SMAP). Oh, I almost forgot ... she has very, very long hair ~ And also has a subtle love story, but well past, which is well written and if there is something that the Japanese do very well, are love stories .. . One thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanations of the events that occur, and if you're interested in geography, you're going to have a lot of fun (I know, yeah ... hehe). I can see that they made a great effort to make the theory of this film believable, and the first exhibitions and graphic explanations were done very well (although you have to excuse the famous Japanese "Engrish.") OK, now about the effects (it's all about the effects, is not it?) After watching the film with pure reverence, I must say that this movie has special effects that are at the same level (or even better) with some Hollywood movies. The volcanic eruptions ... the huge earthquakes ... the destruction ... tsunamis ... explosions ... everything done splendidly. The opening scene is so cool, the first earthquake catches you by surprise, mountains fall, destruction due to volcanic eruptions makes you shrink ... to really watch Mount Fuji warm up is a wonder ... so you see Shibuya fall on the ground ... it is so sad! However, what I felt was one of the best scenes was the scene of the giant tsunami, which s rescue operations to fail and people left with no place to run and no hope of holding onto ... the final scene also deserves a mention ... wonderful things. If you like effects, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh ya ... every good movie has great music behind it. The seriously addictive "Keep Holding U" sung by super cute and adorable SunMin is a duet with Kubota, and is simply adorable. I feel that it fits in nicely with the film and shows that no matter what the disasters have hit us, our love and strength will keep us safe. Disaster scenes are treated with orchestra music and sometimes with silence (a Japanese specialty) and really gives a sense of chaos to destruction on the screen. Oh, and did I mention that it's really a WIDE screen? Okla, it was talking about this movie. Yes, I loved it, and waiting to watch it again ... There are plot holes, but it's all excusable because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie. It is not perfect, but very well done. I would give a 9 out of 10. I am happy to say that the most expensive film in Japan's history is also one of the best. If you have not attended yet, you should even today ... it's a OBSERVATORY!
