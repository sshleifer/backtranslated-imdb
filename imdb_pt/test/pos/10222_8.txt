For a movie like this, there is always something to follow in the next few years. Clive Barker, the man who brought "Hellraiser", makes a horror movie that is part-Goth, Part-Mythology, and all the horror between them. "Nightbreed" is a bunch of mutants that only go out at night and wander around the place called Midian. Now a man named Boone (Craig Sheffer) claims to suffer hallucinations, he goes to this psychiatrist Dr. Decker (David Croneberg) who "helps" Boone with his problems. Unaware of this situation, Decker claims to be a purist that he is merely a disguise of disguised hatred. Boone, however, enters Midian and makes the claim that he is one of the mutants there. But a mutant named Peloquin (Oliver Parker) sees Boone as flesh! His bite however, spares Boone so after he is killed by a guns glove, he is one of them now. After being tricked by Decker, Boone does everything in his power to protect Lori (Anne Bobby) from him. Lori saves a mutant from the sun, and in return helps others as well. I liked the mutant girl who gives a "kiss of death" and the Porcupine Woman who dreamed of Boone to show her power that is so seductive and deadly at the same time. I liked this horror movie all the way, and the rule is, never trust a psychiatrist! Rating 3.5 out of 5 Stars!
