Meville's film is not as good as his most famous film, the deliciously stylish "Le Samourai (1968)". I do not even think this is the best example of the subgenre of much-loved assault. The main thing against the movie is its long run time. Meville has this tendency to focus on many trivial details. He could have told the same story in a relatively short time, but for reasons I do not understand, the movie seems to continue indefinitely. Still, the movie is never boring. The direction of Melville impressed me and the cast is very good, especially Alain Delon as a very "cool" thief. The film's unmissable color photograph is a great asset and Melville uses sound (or lack of sound) in a very effective way. From a technical point of view, the film is practically flawless. Sometimes we get the feeling that Meville is just showing off, but when someone is as talented as him, there's no reason to complain. I still like other assault films (Topkapi (1964) by Jules Dassin, just to name a), but there's no denying that this film is a good piece of cellulose entertainment and a good example of what people are referring to. like "cool" cinema.
