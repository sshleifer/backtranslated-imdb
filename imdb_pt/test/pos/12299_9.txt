A rare exception to the rule that great literature makes disappointing films, John Huston's fine farewell to life and movies is almost entirely faithful to the narrative and spirit of James Joyce's tale, a tender meditation on love, death, and express time at the events of a Twelfth Night party in the Dublin middle class around 1910. Merciless as the material may appear, the film succeeds in its willingness to tell the story in its own silent, seemingly inconsequential terms, rather than force a conventional cinematographic form of plot points. and dramatic incidents about it. Only once is the wrong note played, when old Miss Julia (a singer and music teacher whose voice was supposedly broken by age, not broken) sings so loudly that the audience began to laugh when I saw it in the movies. Fortunately, the mood of quiet and gentle melancholy is restored in plenty of time for the moment of revelation between the couple Gabriel and Gretta Conroy in a hotel room while the snow begins to fall outside. It's a sad story, I suppose, but the kind that makes you feel better, not blue. Especially recommended as a date film - for people in love who are not afraid to face the sweetness and sadness of life.
