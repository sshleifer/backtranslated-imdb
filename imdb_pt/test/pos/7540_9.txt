Lots of fun as much as a movie as an excuse to sit and play the game of "oh, that's whassis name". Every golden age star in English films seems to be in it and it was a joy to see them. And the greatest of all, Richard Wattis, was as wonderful as before. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is a plot that circulates very well, there are also some splendid jokes and comic moments, but the key to the triumph of this movie are the characters within it. Alastair Sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six-foot Scotsman could be the female boarding school director. George Cole, Beryl Reid and Irene Handl all have their moments, but with Alastair and Richard, the star of the show is Joyce Grenfell. She is an absolute person and brings a smile whenever she is on the screen ... her catwalk accent and plum done to perfection. <br /> <br /> And for those who are playing, that's the name of the game, you might even see Arthur Mullard, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle if you look carefully.
