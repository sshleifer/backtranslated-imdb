True stories make the best stories, do not they? There's always something nice about a story, be it romance or film or anything, simply because it's real, it makes the story even more fascinating. This film is based on a true story of two young Americans, a government official and hawk enthusiast - Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) and the other Andrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn) is a drug dealer. These two begin to sell secrets of the government, mainly of CIA, in 1975, to the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the human aspect of the two men as well as their growing personal problems (especially the character of Penn always - escalating drug addiction), rather than glorify their status as traitors to the States United States, which would undoubtedly undermine the credibility of the film in the United States. Boyce gradually becomes more cautious and eventually frustrated and paranoid as his relationships drag on and they delve deeper into treacherous territory. Daulton becomes more addicted and addicted to cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened, and more desperate to maintain control over a situation over which he has no control - in addition, he already has problems with the law. The torment of the families of Boyce and Daulton because of the way they lead their lives is also well portrayed and adds to the idea that espionage against one's own country, even if one thinks it is just, leads only to great problems and the ruin of lives "including the degradation of friendship and trust between the two main characters. Here is the analysis: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - Hutton and A Penn has done extensive research on the characters to capture their individual appearance, so they are portrayed with great depth and realism. <br /> <br /> - The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> - The atmosphere of paranoia develops very well. <br /> <br /> - The story is fascinating and of course, as based on real events, it has an additional effect. <br /> <br /> - The Soviets who work with Boyce and Daulton are portrayed very well, and are not stereotyped or receive evil consciences just to make them look bad. <br /> <br /> Did not hurt, did not help: </ <br /> <br /> The sound effects are occasionally a bit dubious - with many films from the seventies to the eighties. d: - Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) has a relationship with a woman we barely know. Because of Boyce's problem with the US and Soviet governments, his life can be put at risk - but this is not as expanded as it looks like it should have been. A small problem, though. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> The apparent simplicity required to sell government secrets is a bit annoying. Nothing like a constant state of indifference to keep the masses as insecure as possible. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: See the first report of the CIA accidentally sent to the wrong place with the reason is, "difficult night". <br /> <br /> This was another film that suffered great delays due to the controversial content of the story. Studios and producers did not see how a movie about two American traitors could be accepted by the American public. Fortunately, it is filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality. Of course, it helps that traitorous anti-heroes are not portrayed heroically - more like a couple of young people who have made big misjudgments in their lives. As such, it becomes a very human drama, and one portrayed very well and very convincing. 9/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 8/10 (few, high quality) Violence / Gore: 7/10 (no blood, just some violence) Music: 7/10 Direction: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness : 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10 <br /> <br /> Total: 8/10 <br /> <br /> If you like spy movies and spies then you can not go wrong here. If you like dramatic movies with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters, then this may also work for you. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
