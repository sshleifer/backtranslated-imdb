The Italian concept of "sprezzatura" was grace and indifference in the social modes that led to success in love, as described in the sixteenth-century handbook "The Courtier." The film "Hitch" is worth watching the incarnation of the concept "sprezzzatura" in the dynamic performance of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Smith plays the character of Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, who is a professional dating consultant for those with little luck and confidence. The best scenes are when Hitch trains the painfully shy and sulky Albert in his quest to win the heart of a New York socialite and in Hitch's own attraction to Sara and a surprise to her when visiting Ellis Island. In these scenes, Smith is backed up with good work from Kevin James and Eva Mendes. But this movie is driven by Smith's charm and charming personality. From beginning to end, Smith rises above the common comic book script to make "Hitch" a film eminently watchable and entertaining. I do not believe there is another actor working today who is able to deliver the charisma and the perfect timing with the comedic moments like Will Smith in this movie. And your secret is in the "sprezzatura"!
