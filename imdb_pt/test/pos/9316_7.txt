Supposedly back to back with 'Erotic Nights of the Living Dead' with the same cast and set, but this certainly does not have Laura Gemser. Very ridiculed by all I prefer this movie. Surely the plot and the dialogue are codswallop, but this is so beautifully filmed in such a wonderful setting and I really like the hardcore. I find it both naturalistic and exotic, and that does not mean just that there is a black girl and some soft penises! I find the numerous and varied sex scenes very believable, even if two are placed on a tree trunk at the edge of the ocean with the waves constantly splashing around. The creature does not deign to appear until half an hour before the end and is, it must be said, a disappointment. Still, in the remaining time, he manages to kill all but two of the expedition, and in case the girls have sex with them first (or later in at least one case!) And this movie is not as slow as some claim. In addition, there are some beautiful moments of sexploitation, not least, the lady scientist and her desire for two "natives", and the glorious end when the two survivors depart on their boat, look at the island from which they escaped and find it is still time for a last act of copulation.
