Miles O'Keeffe once again takes on the role of the powerful Actor in this first sequence of the original film. <br /> <br /> What can I say? - This practically represents the B-Movie Nirvana! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the script sucks, the acting is kind of hard, the special effects ... well, let's not even go there! - All in all this movie is a real delight! <br /> <br /> Highlights of the film include Actor and Thong (his mute companion, not his underwear) being attacked by invisible robbers in a cave (certainly saved in the fx budget there!), Actor fighting against what it has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid and, of course, the infamous hang glider scene! <br /> <br /> There is a question I have ... at the end of the movie, we see a huge atomic explosion when the Actor supposedly destroys the Geometric Nucleus (as the narrator tells us) .... as hell Actor destroyed and got out alive?! Did he create some form of primitive timer / detonator or something? <br /> <br /> Ah, well, such an illogical ending only adds to the overall charm of the films - they just do not do it any more!
