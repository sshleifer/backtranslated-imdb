This strange movie from Troma is actually a very good movie. It is known as his epic production and best and most highly valued. His version of Shakespeare's play is extremely funny with the usual dose of nudity and gore from Troma. Troma made some very good movies, one of my favorites is "Street Trash" and of course the Toxic Avenger movies. I have a Troma movie, "Terror Firmer," which has the reputation of being the meanest and nastiest movie of them. I liked both "Tromeo and Juliet" so I finally have to watch "Terror Firmer". This is a 2-disc collector version with four comments and many features. "Tromeo e Julieta" is an absolute joke and highly recommended.
