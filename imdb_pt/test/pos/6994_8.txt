Pitch Black is a surprisingly good movie. I was not a Vin Diesel fan before seeing Pitch Black, but after seeing Pitch Black, my respect for Vin Diesel went up. He did a great job playing Riddick, a man wanted for many murders. His character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me, as near the end Riddick was going to get on the ship and save his own ass leaving everyone behind to die. I like this movie and how it deals with human instinct. This movie is low budget but this movie shows that you do not need amazing special effects and lots of money to make a good movie, I think all the characters have made this movie. I give this movie 8 out of 10;)
