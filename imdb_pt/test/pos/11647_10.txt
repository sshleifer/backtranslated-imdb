Dead Man Walking, absolutely brilliant, in tears in the end! You can not watch this movie and not think about the problems it raises; how can you justify killing (whether murder or the death penalty) and how much forgiveness is possible (not just in a spiritual way)? Do not watch this movie when you're depressed! But watch !!!
