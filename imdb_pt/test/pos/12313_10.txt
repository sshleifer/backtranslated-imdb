I believe that "The Dead" by John Houston is a true classic. Not only was Houston's final film, he is quoted as saying "all I know about making movies is in this movie." The story, closely adapted from "Dubliners" by James Joyce, is a great ensemble piece with excellent performances by Angelica Houston, John's daughter and a cast of English and Irish actors who give life to the story. This is a movie that should be part of any serious collection, not only because it is visually stylish, but because the story is timeless and very attractive. The movie is not rushed, nor is it loaded with action. Instead, the story unfolds from the characters, who bring light and meaning to the dialogue. The ending of the film is impressive, poetic and astounding. I recommend "The Dead" without reservations as one of the best movies ever made.
