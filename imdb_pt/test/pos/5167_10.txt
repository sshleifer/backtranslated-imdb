My wife and I saw this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much we wanted to see it again. It was so touching that I was calling it a tear. The mystery that Billings was sent to report is not really a mystery. Angles !! It seems like whenever He turned around, something happened to him, okay, and I believe it scared George a little, considering that he had not realized where He had come in. It just shows that even the cold heart can change with the right attitude around. If only we could all treat each other in the same way, the world would be a better place. To this day, we have searched the net for a copy of it, now I finally have a connection with it, so I can find a copy to buy I'll get.
