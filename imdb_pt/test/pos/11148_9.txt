The movie opens in a stuffy English men's club full of gentlemen in leather chairs smoking cigars. This is the world of Denistoun. A messenger delivers a small box to him which he opens to find a pair of gold earrings. The site of the earrings sparks a reminiscence about the time he spent in the company of gypsies. The rest of the movie is flashback. <br /> <br /> Golden Earrings has been one of my favorites and is probably the most romantic movie I know. Dietrich plays against his usual type. Here she is dark-haired, earthy and not at all mysterious. Instead of a femme fatale, she is a tower of strength and energetically sets out to use all her resources to help Denistoun survive and achieve his goal. To make sure he is a really convincing gypsy, she pierces his ears and causes him to wear the gold earrings of his dead lover. With her clothes and a little grease, she turns him from a weakened British gentleman into a wild, sexy man. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up, I used to listen to the song "Golden Earrings" which is sung in the movie. I think the music is a bit buzzed by Dietrich. / There is a story that the gypsies know is true / That when their love wears gold earrings / It belongs to you.
