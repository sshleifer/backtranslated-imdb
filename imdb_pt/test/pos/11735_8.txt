One of the few Twilight Zones comedies is actually very good. We have Floyd The Barber from Andy Griffith Show, the stock in trade Old Geezer face of Many old westerns and adorable old Frisby. Also has that cool spacecraft interior that I believe was used in the classic Forbidden Planet of Sci Fi. Or The Day The Earth Stood Still. The new faces of the city are driving an exotic Renault (I think) sports car these days. when European automobiles were known as "Foreign Jobs" in the USA. The whole idea of ​​harmonica as a weapon is a joke. And the fact that Frisby's friends love him despite the fact that he's a total BS artist is a comforting moment.
