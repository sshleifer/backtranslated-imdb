Not surprisingly, the majority of the most voted votes were made by women over the age of 45. This is the period of time in women's lives when they become carers for elderly and sick parents. I lost my mother from cancer complications in June, and went through most of the same emotions portrayed by Zellweger in this film. Yes, that made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real and the development of the plot extremely accurate. Lots of praise for the whole cast and crew for a wonderful picture of life and death, and the promises of tomorrow.
