I expected FAME to be an uplifting movie, but it turned out to be the opposite. The overall storyline that accompanies the lives of several determined students attending a performing arts school has a strong potential. However, FAME builds your characters beautifully and then leaves us with so many questions when it's over. I was very surprised when the graduation scene appeared - we thought the DVD had jumped or something. All characters have internal and external conflicts of some sort and virtually none of them is resolved when the movie ends! You may think there are many characters, but they are probably too many scenes. Clearly the film has been cut and shortened because sometimes it has no transition. I think Laura Dean as Lisa Monroe is my favorite character. I really connected with your character's ambition and following your heart. Boyd Gaines as Michael, the stereotypical poor student who can not read, but is a divine dancer, is also very good. I did not especially like Irene Cara's Coco character, but this is not Cara's fault, since her script is weak and her character is not developed. Your voice is beautiful and listening to your music ensures you watch the entire movie. In summary, the film could use many improvements, but the actors of quality and good music gain their place in the history of cinema.
