This is a great show with total freshness and innovation. That usual chair (couch for a woman) hosts, that obligatory band playing monotonous melodies, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the days of Nebuchadnezzar ... probably the pattern of Johnny Carson, copied by each and every one, Latterman, Leno, Conan ... Daly, this program does not seem to have any of those. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this show in the first 10 minutes and I will continue with it. Although it is too early to say this, this program seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension that most talk shows try so hard to project, and I hope that is what would make this program unlike anything else. I hope this show will last a long time! Returning after months, I still love this show, and I love his self-deprecating mood (eg his claim that only the lonely ones watch his show on Saturday at midnight and, so jokes are funny just for stone guys), which does not however involve the usual monkeying of Conan O'Brien, for example (I know it's a fundamental sin to be repelled by O'Brien's antics, but I really do not like his style and repeatability). <br /> <br /> I again watched the other night with Tom Arnold. The spoof of Ferensen's Trading Spouses (and Nanny 911 in an earlier episode) is hilarious. Paparazzi idiots are fun, especially when a security guard warns them against taking pictures of people, and (if I'm not mistaken) they start taking their photos by shouting "Gary Coleman." <br /> <br /> Added April 16, 2007: Coming back one more time, I was confused by the neighbor and his dog. I can not decide if it's a joke or a real thing. Either way, it was funny as hell. <br /> <br /> I do not expect Spike Feresten to read these pages, but maybe he does. He's crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so it's best to jot down my suggestion here: I'd like him to do a 30-minute show with Crazy Gideon, the star of the late night TV commercial. I'd like Crazy Gideon to have an interview on Spike's talk show, sing a song (and play guitar), do a skit on the SNL line, and also answer questions from the public about his potential Los Angeles City Hall (I know, Crazy Gideon may not be aware of this, but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of mayor of Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> God willing! <br /> <br /> Returning in July 14, 2007: Someone wrote here that people who praised Spike's speech should be bribed by Spike.I confess that Spike actually bribed me but I must also confess that Rockefeller named me in his will and last night had sex with Cindy Crowford.
