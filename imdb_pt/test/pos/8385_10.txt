... "Inglorious" as our local theater decided to display its title in its marquee, minus the second word. It's great cinema. <br /> <br /> I do not hesitate to recommend this movie to everyone, but the excess of scruples. Let them never know what they're missing. <br /> <br /> I hesitated to give ten stars because of my experience with Tarantino's previous films. In all cases, except for "Reservoir Dogs," they improved with additional observation. <br /> <br /> So, although I have given ten stars, I did it reluctantly. Do not let me "go". <br /> <br /> Yes, Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we all imagine to be the worst. He is cultured, sophisticated, gentle and very sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk as a threat and who puts his cigarette abruptly into a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if grinding the heel on a Victim . <br /> <br /> To understand Tarantino's films, you just need to have a sense of dialogue, color and rhythm. The colors are as bright as necessary and, when necessary, brighter yet. In the French country house of the opening scene, they are soft and dark, but excessively. Out of a bright sun is shining, but in a room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black. <br /> <br /> It is a brilliant scenario for an interrogation by Waltz, as the SS "Jewish hunter", who swings his French farmer on the cliff to reveal what he can not reveal countless times, then the pulls back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding. <br /> <br /> A second sadistic German, well played by August Diehl, later, works as a major actor in the final turnaround. Diehl's major Nazi, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz ... almost. <br /> <br /> Film lessons will study a lot with this movie. They should look lovingly at the excellent pace. Tarantino knows how long ago to draw a scene, building suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, and then only at the breaking point, coming to a sudden resolution. <br /> <br /> For color, look for a final photo of a scene. French Theater, where its secretly Jewish owner is staging a surprise for the upper echelons of the Nazi leadership. <br /> <br /> We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, waiting for the hated German dignitaries who will arrive for a preview of the film of the latest masterpiece of the film Deutsch, a piece of propaganda about a German hero and his dubious achievements. <br /> <br /> Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the beautiful theater, his red lips and dress down. reflecting everywhere the intensity of his drawings on his guests. It's a single shot that would be worth a whole movie. <br /> <br /> Thankfully there are many other images, many exquisite scenes of dialogue and suspense. <br /> <br /> In short, see. I'm sure you'll see it again and again.
