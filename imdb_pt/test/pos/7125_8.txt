There are few movies that made me wait and wait for more releases than this one. This is the latest movie from the group The Dead Gentlemen, responsible for the original film Gamers and for the films Demon Hunters. This group has not been very active in recent years, but this film is a definite reason to try to keep pace with progress. <br /> <br /> This movie accompanies a group of players who are trying to finish. a campaign run by a GM frustrated by the disregard of his group for its history. With the help of new blood, they try the campaign again with the hope of ending this time. <br /> <br /> This film is a breath of fresh air in the film community and a big improvement over the original. The film shows respect for the game very much like the original film, but in addition, this film shows a dramatic improvement in special effects, casting it above the simplicity of college films. The acting is pretty decent and the jokes are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately many of the jokes are jokes, so if you're not a gamer, you may not find the movie as funny as the others. So that's why I give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 I initially thought. Any case, if you are a gamer or know about the selection game, you will have fun.
