My sister, a friend and I went to see this movie for my birthday on September 24th. We've all seen the first "Jackass" movie for some time, and we all like it. We were really looking forward to Number Two. <br /> <br /> We were not disappointed. <br /> <br /> From start to finish I was laughing hysterically. It's equally shocking and fun parts, however, and definitely not for those with weak stomachs. It's obscene, but it's also an innovative American movie ... well, maybe that's too much praise for a movie where men intentionally keep their scrotum stuck to ice sculptures, but it's groundbreaking because it shows us obscenities, whether we like it or not, things that no other "decent" American film, released around the country, would dare to show us. There was only one scene in particular that I found unnecessarily obscene, and involved a horse - I will not elaborate. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I almost mumbled, and I came close to crying (because of a physical reaction to seeing a scene involving a leech and an eyeball, not sorrow). In my humble opinion, "Jackass: Number Two" is the '06 movie. <br /> <br /> Does that make me an idiot? Possibly. But if that happens, I really could care less.
