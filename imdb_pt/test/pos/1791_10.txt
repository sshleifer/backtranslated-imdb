As Margot in "Fear Fear," her ambitious husband's victim, as Fox in "Fox and his friends" is taken to suicide by his boyfriend who took all his money, as Xaverl Bolwieser in "The Stationsmaster's Wife", which will to prison to give his betrayal wife a chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann, who seeks refuge in insanity to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt company, so Hans Epp is a victim of the German society "Wirtschaftswunder." after World War II in "The Merchant of Four Seasons" by RW Fassbinder. Simply by the fact that Fassbinder has played through social abuse between men and women, as well as between heterosexual and homosexual couples, it should be clear that he does not favor any sex. <br /> <br /> In the case of Hans Epp, there are women who lead him to despair, disease and finally death. When he returns from the Foreign Legion, where he flew because he could not stand his mother's pressure anymore, she complains that he is still alive while his neighbor's good boy was killed. So Hans gets a job as a cop, but is surprised by his foreman while seduced by a prostitute. After losing his job, he works as a low-income fruit trader, going from the yard to the backyard "screaming" at his products. Her mother, one of her sisters and her husband are ashamed to have a "street worker" in their family. "The love of her life" (she has no name in the film) refuses to marry him because his work does not fit with his social status and origin. So he marries Irmgard, whom he does not love and who does not love him. From his constant pressure on him, he flees to drink. One night, after his wife was chasing him, he explodes and hits her. She flees to her family for which this event was exactly what they were expecting. When Irmgard is calling a divorce lawyer, Hans suffers a heart attack. Imrgard decides to keep it, but from now on, he can no longer do heavy work and drink alcohol. Then he begins to feel more and more superfluous, becomes more and more quiet and more depressive. When he discovers that Irmgard deceives him, he decides to end his life, but not as Hermann Hermann, taking a trip in the light of madness, but he drinks himself to death in front of Imrgard, his little girl and his drinking friends. Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing. The question, however, is: Has Hans just killed himself because he could not stand his miserable environment anymore, or did he do it himself?
