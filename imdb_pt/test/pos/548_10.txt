Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us about how much she hates her mother, Adele (Susane Sarandon). This is how the movie begins. Adele decided she and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone and leaving the husband for no reason. The story is about the relationship between mother and daughter. It's really deep and exciting, thanks to the excellent work of the actresses. Natalie was nominated for a Golden Globe for this role. She's one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen, and so is Sarandon. They really look like Mother Daughter. The soundtrack is great, too. The movie is incredible. * 10 out of 10 *
