Low budget, but memorable, a shock that emerges as a theater of the bizarre. Charlotte Beale, a vulnerable and naive nurse, arrives at an isolated psychiatric hospital and is unaware that the only sensible people have been murdered despite the red flags that are constantly being erected around her. <br /> <br /> The lack of a decent budget really gives filmmakers little more than a sense of style as well as a cast of crazy characters. The pleasures of this film do not come from the shocks of the film, which are relatively tame, but from the strange atmosphere. First, we have the delirious woman who thinks her doll is real. There is also a murderous judge of axes, a war veteran in shock, and old Mrs. Callahan it is as if the whole grumpy grandmother of everyone goes mad. A young patient named Allyson gives the new meaning of "nymphomaniac". A big guy named Sam is only a little slow after a failed lobotomy, and Jennifer jumps suddenly between catatonia and violent outbursts. The only other sentient person in the place seems to be Dr. Masters, but does she have a secret? <br /> <br /> "Do not look in the basement" is a great example of low budget exploration films. There is not much storyline going on, but the low price works for the movie. Several cast members feature memorable performances, particularly Betty Chandler and Annabelle Weenick, and the way the director adds odd little details to the movie may actually be with you. <br /> <br /> The scene between Allyson and "the man on the phone". "is a classic of all time, and especially delicious are the facial expressions of Dr. Masters when she begins to surpass the limit of the end of the film.Brownrigg also makes great use of the cheap soundtrack with several musical tracks really evoking the characters "My favorite tip is the" crazy "hint, a sitar that vibrates whenever one of the patients does something pathological. <br /> <br /> It's also wonderful how Charlotte herself plunges into hysteria at the climax, with patients revealing that Dr. Masters is simply another inmate, and then suggesting that CHARLOTTE is also a patient who is being allowed to present her illusions (she certainly has a tenuous grip on reality, why else would she not question the grim lack phone service, or outside contact?) The scene in which Charlotte manages to wipe out Dr. Stephens, who is a little alive with a toy boat, has to be one of the best moments of low budget horror. Yes, "Do not look in the basement" could very well be the "American beauty" of Class Z trash.
