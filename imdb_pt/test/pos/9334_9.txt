For those who remember the initial impact of this video, it will never be forgotten, and a Thriller show is all it takes to feel twelve years old again. But although it is an excellent video, it is not perfect, although it seems at the time. When this video first appeared, no one had ever seen anything like it before. Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a new Thriller show will reveal its flaws. Why was it necessary to deconstruct the music? When Michael Jackson is walking alongside the girl after they leave the movies, he sings all the verses of the song, ignoring the choruses. After he becomes a zombie, when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if to make up for his previous absence. This may have been the first time a song was deconstructed to fit the look of a music video, but it certainly was not the last time. It remained a problem in the MTV era. The best videos, such as Billie Jean de Jackson and Beat It, used visual aids to serve music, not the other way around. Still, Thriller is a lot of fun and an absolute must on Halloween.
