I rented this movie, but I was not sure what to expect from it. I was very happy to discover that it is about the best Brazilian film I have ever seen. The story is rather strange and simple and, above all, extremely original. We have Antonio, who is a young man living in Nordestina, a city in the middle of nowhere in northeastern Brazil, and who is deeply in love with Karina. The main conflict between the two is that while Antonio loves his little town and does not want to get out of it, Karina wants to see the world and resent the place. As proof of his love for her, he decides to leave and bring the world to her. He's going to put Northeastern on the map, as he says. And the way he does it is unbelievable. This is a good movie; can be a bit tricky for some people due to their different editing work, but I think this also improves the story. It's fun and it makes you feel good.
