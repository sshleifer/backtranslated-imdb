Goldrush: The Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great TV movie for all ages. The film centers around "Fizzy" (Alyssa Milano), who wants to travel in search of gold in Alaska. The only person to hire her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. This TV movie was great. The performance is # 1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned some information about Goldrush. I highly recommend this TV movie to everyone without hesitation. It's also based on a true story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
