Martial arts films got huge in the 1960s in parts of Asia, but with the growing popularity of the infamous Shaw Brothers films, America was forced to pick up. This film was the first to be presented in the US under the seal of Warner Bros. and in fact initiated a mania that flooded the 70s with martial arts films. Many of the following movies would pale in comparison, but some were great and many like Enter The Dragon (which came out shortly after this) became great success stories and made superstars of these fighters. <br /> Fast forward almost 40 years later and this movie still holds. Most of the Shaw brothers' films are so good today that at that time it was true that no movie was made in that genre to compete with those made by Shaw Bros back. <br /> <br /> I like to think that martial arts are like pornography and nobody watches porn for the plot just the action, well same happens with MA movies and most of them are just a lot of big fights with little history, this is an exception. It does not have an incredible story, but there is one there. <br /> <br /> The main character played by Lo Lieh actually stands out among the heroes of karate cinema. He never brags and he never fights just because he can, he is often seen as weak and less of a fighter than most, but when he must fight, he is very well the greatest alive. I really loved this character. Many of the bad guys were memorable and the fighting scenes were presented so amazingly. Even a small role with Bong Yeung can be seen as the huge Mongolian, and Bolo is in my top 5 as the biggest star of martial arts films of all time, he was also in the already mentioned Enter The Dragon. <br /> <br /> As I've said several times, the production is wonderful, you can not beat the Shaws, the direction was something that, contrary to what I've seen in 1970s films, the use of color was well placed and made this movie stand alone and on the rise. above the others. When the light shines in the hands of Chi Hao, as he does with the Iron Fist, its pure beauty. <br /> <br /> The music was superb as well. Martial arts films were for Asia what Westerners were to Italy, two separate art forms with so much in common. The countries making these films had all genres, but the Japanese films were the ones that were stirring, since the spaghetti westerns were in Italy. With their many differences, the styles of these two genera were neck and neck. As seen in films like 5 Fingers Of Death, the fights were easily compared to the stand offs of Sergia Leoni, and the music tied the genres as well. The music here borrowed a bit of Ironside, but it was still very original. <br /> <br /> Many movies were inspired by this and when I watch I can see everything from Master Killer until Bloodsport has been influenced. The most obvious film to be influenced was Kill Bill, which for me is the greatest of all time. Many of the sets used by Quentin are full replicas of those seen here and he used the music of this film, even though the music he used was the music borrowed from Ironside. And the fight scene at the end of Kill Bill vol. 1 with The Bride and O-Ren is sometimes accurate compared to the fight with Chi Hao and the Japanese villain at the end of this film. <br /> <br /> I've seen many martial arts movies, some even better, but this is a must-see for fans of the genre. You can not go wrong here. The movie starts slowly, but 15 to 20 minutes starts and does not slow down.
