I attended a screening of "Fierce People" at the 2006 Woodstock Film Festival. I hesitate to label it "premiere" of any kind since it was filmed in spring 2004 and had its world premiere at Tribeca in 2005. It rang at various festivals that year. Release seemed imminent, then disappeared. Poof. Disappeared. Or it appeared to the audience that goes to the movies. Rumors of a theatrical release or on DVD appeared from time to time, but all proved unfounded. So this screening was announced. Maybe we can call it "re-premiere"? It certainly seemed that I was witness to a buried treasure. And what a treasure it was. <br /> <br /> I suppose one could characterize "Fierce People" as a maturing drama. But it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, plus mystery. And a little farce thrown. In short, real life. This makes it difficult to rank, which puts her more in the category of indie than in a Hollywood movie. But its high production figures, large budget, and high-level cast seem to be at odds with the indie label. So let's call it a hybrid. And maybe that's why it's "lost." It challenges categorization. <br /> <br /> Meet the Finnish Earl (Anton Yelchin), 15, whose father is absent. In fact, Finn never knew him. But he sees it and hears it through the collection of home movies sent from South America. Dad is a renowned anthropologist, and made a name for himself, setting up a shop with the Yanomani, the tribe of the "Ferocious People" who lives for kill and, well, procreate. All his activities are built around these two "tasks," and Finn is captivated by it. Mom Liz (Diane Lane) is also a little absent. Although present physically, she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol. So Finn becomes an adult in his lonely little world with his film reels. <br /> <br /> One summer, Mom decides to drag Finn along with her into the jungles of New Jersey. Masseuse, Mom attended a wealthy client, Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland, in a presentation of strength) and he invited her for an extended visit in his mansion. The "tribe" of Osborne includes a variety of eccentric rich children, servants and idiots of the village, among whom Finn will find in his own anthropological study. Will your experience with Dad's movies help you survive life as a visitor to this tribe? Will he be accepted? Or is he seen as a stranger, struggling at the same time with his own identity as a teenager? Such is the stuff of fairy tales, and I suppose that would be if it were not for the dark side that director Griffin Dunne and writer Dirk Wittenborn inserted into this magnificent story. With the narration of Anton Yelchin, interspersing pieces of his father's home movies, Finn must learn to return to being the teenager he never had a chance to be, to stop being his mother's father, allow the newly sober mother to be his mother and learn the responsibility on the subject. way to adulthood the way it should have happened all the time. However, he needs to make that transformation into a dangerous and dark world, where playing with fire is crazy for this fractured family. <br /> <br /> This is, first and foremost, a story-based film, and Griffin Dunne emphasized this in the film's introduction. He bought the rights to Wittenborn's novel while it was being written, and Wittenborn's script comes to life in the hands of Master Dunne in a way that is a work of wonder. <br /> <br /> This is also largely character-driven film, and Sutherland has never been better. His star turns when Osborne surprises those around me and will probably leave him in awe as well. The character of Diane Lane finally exhibits so many personalities that it's hard to imagine another actor doing so well. She is breathtaking. But most of all, "Fierce People" is the film by Anton Yelchin. He has a long resume as a child actor, but precious little as a teenager. In addition to the little-known "House of D" (also a gem), he is best known as Byrd on TV "Huff". In January, he will be seen in "Alpha Dog" (also sitting on the shelf since 2004, a movie I saw in this year's Sundance and in which he is the "heart and soul"). Your performance here goes far beyond what you might expect from someone so young, and it's nothing short of spectacular. <br /> <br /> This complex and quirky film was out of sight long enough. "Fierce People" is a treasure full of light and shadow, comedy and tragedy, joy and excitement, but mostly wonder.
