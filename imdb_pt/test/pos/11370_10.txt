I saw this mini-series when I was in high school. I remember being absolutely brilliant and convincing. At the time, I did not know any of the British actors in the series, but I have since learned that some of today's stars have performed, including Sean Connery (the original James Bond among many other roles), Judi Dench (Queen Elizabeth in "Shakespeare") . in Love "among many other roles) and Eilene Atkins (probably best known for creating" Upstairs / Downstairs ", but also excellent in many actor roles.) Like the other commentator, I would like to see him again. production remains timeless and I hope it has either been released on VHS or DVD. If you get a chance to see it, do not miss out.
