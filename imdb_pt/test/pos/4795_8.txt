The career of Spanish director Luis Buñuel lasted almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. Arguably, his best films were those he did during his exile in Mexico - from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. There he had to deal with very cheap budgets and working in an industry interested primarily in producing commercial films for non-sophisticated audiences, but somehow he managed to make interesting and thought-provoking films that stood the test of time. This film is based on a novel by the Spanish author Benito Perez Galdos - and the adaptation is quite faithful, even if the scenario is now Mexico of the early twentieth century, rather than the early twentieth century in Spain. The protagonist, Nazarin, is a priest who tries to live a life as faithful as possible to that prescribed by Christ. The question that many ask is whether such an undertaking would be possible without incurring the hostility, incomprehension and derision of their fellow men. It turns out that he suffers many indignities, but remains stubborn (even the polemic final) to that goal. I think Buñuel wanted to show Nazarin as a somewhat ridiculous figure, but perhaps inadvertently, his stubbornness (at least to this viewer) comes out as admirable. In any case, a great movie.
