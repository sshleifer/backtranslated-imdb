This movie is a great example of the greatness that is the entertainment of the 80s. Oh, do not get me wrong, most of the music was sucked. I just liked the 80's metal bands. Bands that had some balls. Forget this keyboard crap and all that 'life is horrible and I wanna die' rubbish. But the '80s movies are the best. They were all about nonsense and just having fun. This movie exemplifies this! Party! Get naked! Be placed! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!
