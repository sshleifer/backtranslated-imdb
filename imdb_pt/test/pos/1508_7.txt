The one who says that Lucius Fulci is not one of the most important names in the history of splatters is probably crazy. The Italian director is a legend among fans of hardcore-horror, and his work exceeds the barriers of the genre (which may forget its western, crime or fantasy films). This is probably your most naughty movie, and unfortunately one of the last. A director of terror (Fulci as he) begins to hallucinate about cruel murders. He goes to a psychiatrist, who makes him believe that he is the criminal. At this point, the doctor starts a long chain of crimes in series. With such a plot, the film should have been filled with something. And there are rotating corpses, broken or melted heads, stabbings, beheadings, chainsaw splitting and many others. of annoying sometimes, the film is saved by excessive violence that will definitely please blood addicts.
