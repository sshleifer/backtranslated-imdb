D.I. (4 outta 5 stars) Wow, I certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as I did. I had never heard of it until I saw it in the discounted video session one day. I imagined Jack Webb playing a military training instructor might be good for a laugh, but he thought the drama would pale in comparison to recent films like Full Metal Jacket or An Officer and a Gentleman. Boy, was I wrong. This is probably the best work Webb has ever done ... by far better than their performances of a "Dragnet" note. The delivery of your tough face dialogue is simply brilliant ... done in its patented sharp monotone and yet you know that the guy wants to say every word of it. The story may seem a bit corny compared to the sterner military films that followed but still find the film fascinating and appealing. Even a completely unnecessary musical interlude in an army nightclub left me hooked. Does anyone know where I can get a copy of that fantastic Ray Coniff song "If You Do not, Another Else Will"? Webb plays the most difficult instructor of all time ... and is under pressure to expel the deadbeat, Owen, but by God he sees a man buried somewhere in that kid and will drag him out kicking and screaming! Good stuff!
