Eh oui, impossible n'est pas gaulois. <br /> <br /> Well rhythmic, very funny movie. Very good command of the French language and knowledge of modern France (and history) are recommended. I do not think this movie really works in any other language. The movie is unbelievably better than the previous one (looking for ...). In addition to great actors and intelligent camera management, it is the wit and firework of allusions, word games, etc. that make a really great movie. The cartoon is recognizable, but the film is very emancipated. The cost of the film is well spent. In fact, all of the special effects fit "naturally" into the film, you never feel smothered by them. <br /> <br /> Bref, oui, les 2CVs, ça traine un peu mais à part cela, Imhotep! <Br /> <br /> -A neighbor on the other side of the Rhine
