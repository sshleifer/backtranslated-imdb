Excellence seems to be rare at Hollwood today. Many consider only two of the best candidates of the year to make sense of the film industry. And in 'Everything is Illuminated', the brand is hit directly. <br /> <br /> The film begins its brilliance with the beautiful entrance on the scene. From the outset, you get a sense of warmth and true family connections and relationships between one and the other. And also, the cast is presented perfectly. For the character of Elijah Wood, Jonathon, his sensitivity is expressed by holding the hand of his dying grandmother. And for the character titled Alex, it's easy to see his life from his perspective - the real Ukrainian rock star. With the cast illuminated at the beginning, the story slowly enters our minds while Jonathon decides to venture to Ukraine to find the woman who is believed to have saved his grandfather, so the whole family. And from there, the films of the story were being slow, but they kept up at a rapid pace, from the contrast between the drama and the laughing humor included in the scene scene, in every scene. <br /> <br /> Although the film itself is quite prized, there are several complaints from other sources commenting on Liev Schrieber's inaccurate adaptation of Jonathon Safron Foer's novel. Personally, I've never read the novel. But any film, especially this particular film, should not be evaluated if the storyboard of the film matches the plot of the book, but rather how the main concepts of the novel were cast and explored through the film. Just because it may be unlikely from the novel does not mean that this movie is no longer a must-see - it still is. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, new information floods the mind of the audience very slowly. Some of these thoughts are never answered; and in fact, the second half of the film refutes all its theme and reason to travel through Ukraine to something different, but quite similar to the original intentions of this film. The film, however, leaves you with a satisfied note - even so, for weak-hearted souls, a tear can be discarded. And throughout the film. for people with common sense of humor can just laugh at the fun and continuous conversations of Alex and John. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to several different types of people: for those who enjoy films that share the genre drama-comedy, for those who have an interest in family connections, and for those who have an interest in subjects of the Holocaust. And for those insane people who find slapstick a hilarious comedy, this movie is not for you. And for you who think this is a funny and absolutely ingeniously funny movie, you're wrong; This movie shares comedic moments and dramatic sequences. And for those who judge a movie based on its likelihood with the corresponding novel, you may or may not like this movie, but this movie should be taken for much more than if it were or not near the book. <br /> <br /> All in all, 'Everything is Illuminated' is an ingenious work that will enlighten the hearts of anyone.
