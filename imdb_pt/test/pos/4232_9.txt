I'm from Germany, so please excuse my writing style. When I saw Chucky 4 for the first time, I was a little surprised, I knew Chucky as a scary movie from the 80's, but the Bride of Chucky was very different from the old ones. First, there is the artwork of the very good director Ronny Yu, who we still have in mind in a Chinese ghost story. His visual style is somewhat comparable to Francis Ford Coppola. Also the voices of Chucky and Tiff are very impressive. I also really enjoyed the script, especially from the scene where Tiff plays Champaignbot on the ceiling mirror. <br /> <br /> I give a 9.0 vote for funny, bloody and progressive entertainment. If you have any comments about my opinion, send me an email. MFG Schawez
