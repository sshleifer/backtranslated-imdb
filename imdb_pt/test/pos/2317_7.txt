This movie is about a lot of misfits that should be assigned to a task that should fail miserably. The misfits get together to successfully complete their mission. <br /> <br /> Hilarity follows. Like the "Police Academy" movies, humor comes from the eccentric characters of the boat. I thought it was an engaging movie and I'll stop and watch it while on TV. No, this will not cause you to reflect on your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things at the service of humanity, but it is fun enough for 90 minutes. In addition, Lauren Holly looks hot in a naval uniform.
