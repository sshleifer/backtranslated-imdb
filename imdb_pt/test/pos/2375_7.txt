Two actors play competing gangsters in three films, the finale of which is a science fiction film, which strangely beckons to William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick and anime all at once. Robots are called "replicants," a reference to Dicks Blade Runner (various visual references to the film can also be found) and the crook is a psychotic prefect obsessed with limiting procreation through the use of a compulsory drug for "heterosexual" . love is fleeting and homosexual love is eternal "... Martial arts fights follow each other, a debut in the living or dead movies. The climax hilarity involves the two ends turning into a winged robot with a gigantic head phallus, which personifies the "destruction," which has been the path of both characters so far, their individual minds and then literals functioning as something like testicles.The movie ends with the prefect and his free jazz footman playing as the robot apparently knocks down a wall around them, the mayor's last words "Oh f * &%", followed by a quick fade to black. , the best scenes favor the film while the rest is too slow.Kiashi Miike has always explored sexual motives under male violence in action films, and this film, with the exception of "Gozu", reinforces this theme more than any other. Sex and violence are two very basic themes, but like Cronerberg (which jazz interludes can be a tribute to the Naked Lunch Wing) Miike is able to show where the two connect, for a hilarious and strangely cohesive effect.
