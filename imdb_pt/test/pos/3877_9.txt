Bring it back Team A was a one-hour special on Channel 4 in the UK last year and hosted by host and comedian Justin Lee Collins, the show tried to track down and reunite A-Team castmates together for the first time on TV. This has been something that has never been tried by anyone. Well, it's not for anyone I know, that's it. <br /> <br /> Justin makes a great presenter, and his eccentric personality and humorous jokes have brightened throughout this show. The attempts he makes to get hold of the cast members is always so funny, but also he was very persistent and eager to fulfill that task too, which is a credit to him, I would say. You see, he's great on TV - whether it's a show like this, or the Friday Night Project with his co-host, Alan Carr. <br /> <br /> There were appearances and interviews with Dirk Benedict. - Faceman himself, Dwight Schultz aka Howling Mad Murdock, Marla Heasley who played Tawnia Baker, Jack Ging also known as General 'Bull' Full Bright, the creator of team A, Stephen J Cannell and the great man, Mr T aka BA Baracus. They were simply fascinating to watch and listen to what they had to say about the show that became a global hit during the 1980s as they reminisce and relive the good and bad moments of the show: both during and behind the scenes. Unfortunately, there is no George Peppard, but of course he is already in paradise, understandably and strangely not, Melinda, who played Amy. <br /> <br /> I just did not understand why she did not show up in the show. Okay, she was eliminated after 3 seasons or whatever, but she was the first and original female member of A-Team - only to be replaced by Marla's Tawnia and then it would have been great to see and hear her side to the A- story of the team, in addition to the other cast members. <br /> <br /> Overall, Bring Back, the A-Team, was a great documentary style. Perhaps, this could have been spread more by means of which this could have been a six-part documentary. But, nevertheless, this was a great effort on the part of the JLC. Recommended
