This film has its detractors, and Courtney's fairy-tale outfit may offend some people (who, frankly, need a good slap in the head) - but the film is top-notch in every way: engaging, poignant, relevant. Finney, of course, is bigger than life. Courtney plays an ideal role. I thought the performances were terribly strong on both tracks, and Courtney's character provides enough black humor. The period is well captured, the support cast well chosen. This is to be seen and savored as a cordial good. I just wanted it to be on DVD already ... (* sigh *) ...
