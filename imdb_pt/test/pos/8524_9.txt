This is an excellent James Bond movie. Although not part of the original and most famous series, and is an independent film, it is very well done. Seducing Sean Connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius as well as the title of the film in a way that refers to his previous vow not to play Bond again. Connery was as good as him in his first appearances in 007. The screenplay is excellent, as well as photography and performances. It is the oldest film I remember with Kim Basinger, who became much more famous after that film; Barbara Carrera was excellent; and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. Frequent references to Bond's aging and changing times and attitudes of the British Secret Service were more humorous. The 007 sets matched those of the other Bond films. The only thing missing was the famous music theme 007, which, of course, could not be used by this competing production. It was amazing for me to be able to see two great James Bond movies released the same year, this one and Octopussy with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the film is the emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The early 1980s marked the first peak of such things, and their use in this film made it a very contemporary film. The movie is actually a different version of Thunderball, updated with newer technology. Regardless of the theme repeated, there are enough differences to make it more fun. I'll watch this often.
