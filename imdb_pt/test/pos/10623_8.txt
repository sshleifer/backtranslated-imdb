Reading the comments, there seems to be a lot of nonsense about La Pianiste's emotional banality. I find this difficult to understand given the excellent performance of Isabelle Huppert. Huppert is holding - she can perfectly convey the woman on the edge, full of self-hatred and delusion. <br /> <br /> The film is wonderfully stimulated and judged. It would be as easy to portray leadership as a ridiculous figure - consider the scene in the porn store, for example. Somehow, Huppert is able to accomplish it, partly because of his brilliant performance, but also because the director makes his life surreal real and identifiable. <br /> <br /> Do not ignore this movie. It's one of the most amazing and engaging movies (and performances) I've seen. <br /> <br /> Trust Boris!
