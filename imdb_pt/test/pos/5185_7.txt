Excellent special effects make this disaster very plausible. One can see that the producers have taken the trouble to get the displays on the computer screens - all of which makes it very convincing. The sets are also very authentic. A good choice of songs completes the movie well. <br /> <br /> The performance is good and the presence of David Suchet adds some weight to the cast. Compared to other movies of that genre, the Flood is up there with the best of them. Fortunately, the "human drama" aspect has not been exaggerated, as is often the case with this type of film. Human suffering is portrayed in perfect balance with the actual flood scenes. <br /> <br /> And of course, the movie confirms what many of us suspect anyway: meteorologists often do not get it right! :)
