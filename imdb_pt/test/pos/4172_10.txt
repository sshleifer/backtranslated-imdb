Symbolism in abundance, great melodies, this film crushed the expectations of the target audience "soon there will be no more." These monkees and the naturally selected members of the group were witnessing a subtle still on their face, kissing goodbye to each other. The message sounds true today, the cage from which you escaped and the bridge you want to jump off of are the disappointments of the next generation, there will always be new boys on the block replacing those who are freeing themselves from the chains. The film can be frustrating at times because the themes the film strikes are so grossly separated from the American way of life, a person who reasons and reasons can not help but look at his own reflection in the scenes of Head, and question not only his folks. reasons to continue the madness of everyday American life, but the motives of those who want it to continue in favor of madness. The final scene, similar to Don Quixote's chivalrous daring of the caged tiger to come out to battle, represents just how dreamy and impossible dreams are.
