Okay, maybe it was because I was in Yangchun in China when I saw this movie. Maybe because I finally had something on TV that I could understand or at least read the subtitles, or maybe it was funny. Whatever this movie was worth. <br /> <br /> I had just arrived for my foot and rubbed my head when they gave me the remote so I could watch TV. Usually I changed the thing, but I ran into this crazy movie and got hooked. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can call it plot, revolves around a cooking contest and it's a love story. and the food in that movie is the real star. If you like Iron Chef and many other cooking shows currently in reality TV mode then you will love the food scenes in this movie. <br /> <br /> It goes fast and the subtitles are so fast that it is better to be on speed reading for this one. However, the action is mostly clownish so you do not always have to read the entire subtitle to get the idea. <br /> <br /> The lead actress is lovely to the eyes and the lead actor is not bad to see. . Both are worth watching. Finally, if you have some time to kill and want a good laugh, this is not a bad choice for both. <br /> <br /> I do not speak a word of Chinese, but I was totally able to understand cultural humor. of this film. For those who speak Chinese, maybe it's even better. Overall I give this a 8 out of 10 and currently I am even looking to find a copy to have while I stay in China, and to keep for when I return home will be a good reminder to me of my time in Yangchun and one silly afternoon in the massage parlor watching a silly movie.
