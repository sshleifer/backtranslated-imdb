After seeing "La Pianiste" several years ago, I told myself that I would never see him again, so powerful and disturbing. Time passed, but I could not get the movie and its main character, Erika Kahut, out of my head. The story of a respected piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, a specialist in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-loathing and self-destruction strong enough to ruin it more than one view. I read the book "The Piano Teacher" by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial Nobel Prize winner for literature on which the film is based and after reading it, saw the film again. The second time, all the pieces of jigsaw puzzles have arrived in the right places. It is not often that an exceptional harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliance as "Le Pianiste". Three actors gave remarkable performances. Franz Schubert's piano music, "soaked in morbid humanity", is another brilliant star in the film. <br /> <br /> I only have one problem with Haneke's vision. There is a scene in the film in which Haneke made some changes in Erika's character in comparison to the novel. In the book, the farthest she was to reveal herself to Walter, the young conservatory student who was drawn to her, was in a letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed her how much he felt revulsion over it, she had stopped communicating with him. Erika's book would never chase after Walter to play for him. She kept everything inside - she did not like to act, she was not a hunter - she loved watching. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. She tried to make Erika understandable (and, of course, Huppert was heartbroken), but it took the mystery around her - Jelinek did not write that scene, it sounded and it seemed false in another great film.
