The extraordinarily lovely Suzy Delair plays a sculptural artist obsessed with succeeding in the theater. Her husband and companion, played by Bernard Blier, is a composite but jealous man. When he discovers, less than preferable, that his flamboyant wife has planned a meeting with a lecherous old merchant intent on advancing his career, he loses all control and threatens the businessman with murder. Now, at this point, I must stop describing the film to you because it skates on ice so thin with its twists, revelations, ambiguities and suspense that imply that any of them would put you at risk. I'm not sure if this is good or bad for French police coming from the music and dance community, although it's certainly interesting that what we know from time to time is who did not. We just do not know who did it. <br /> <br /> History depends on the procedure of following clues, where ideal alibis fail and where they cautiously create disintegrating fabrications and deceptions. Curiously, this is a suspense movie in which suspense is generated despite the knowledge that one would traditionally think too much too early. <br /> <br /> Quay of the Goldsmiths is Henri-Georges Clouzot's least obscure film. It is not nearly as sinister as the shocking Les Diaboliques, as tragic as the fascinating Wages of Fear or as mysterious as Le Corbeau. Perhaps it is due to the vibrancy of the dance halls and theatrical settings of France of the 1940s, which function as the environment of this crime police. Clouzot understands and approves his characters, even the most rotten. those where he has more than a vengeful streak with his other films. Where he may have understood that women traffickers in Les Diabolique or truck drivers who sink to the risk of horrible death risk to get rid of the miserable life of The wages of fear, there is necessarily support or agreement on the part of the filmmaker, because they are characters who clearly make the direct decisions that determine their destiny. All the characters in this quieter movie have scenes and moments that enchant us, even the hard and cold detective played by Louis Jouvet, who cares about his young adoptive son amid all the problems and despair that happen in his life to any time. with the fall of a hat. <br /> <br /> There is humor and shameless sensuality, the latter mostly from Delair, who neutralizes the pressure to some extent. Clouzot was quietly practicing his craft, patient until he made his tireless later films in which he would not allow his audience to lose the tension.
