Said to be inspired by Disney's Little Mermaid, Ponyo on the cliff by the sea is master of Japanese animation, Hayao Miyazaki's next big work after the well-received Spirited Away in 2001 and Howl's Moving Castle in 2004. In Ponyo, his signature style animating fantasy realms and children's characters are on display once again. Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), the lead actor in the film discovers a "goldfish" trapped in a glass jar as he plays by the sea below the cliff. He stays with his mother, Lisa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) above and on top of her. Sosuke shakes the pot hard to try to get the 'goldfish', but the goldfish is stuck. He then tries to pull it out, but he just can not let go. Sosuke then puts the jar on the floor before breaking a small stone into it, breaking it into pieces instantly while suffering a small cut on the finger. He then checks inquisitively to see if the "goldfish" is still alive. Watching him, the "goldfish" reacts by licking the blood of his finger suddenly. Excited, Sosuke quickly runs back to the house and puts the "goldfish" in a small bucket of water in the hope that he will survive. He did and he called it 'Ponyo' (Yuria Nara). <br /> <br /> The above scene would mean what lies ahead for the rest of the film. It is from the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. And it is one that Hayao Miyazaki meticulously well in portraying. He should have a great sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before describing this communication chemistry between the two main characters. The children's behavior would also extend to the rest of the film in their new encounters. The affection between Sosuke and Ponyo grew as the film progressed from the moment Sosuke brought Ponyo to school in Lisa's car. The best moment came when the two met again after a brief breakup when Ponyo's father, Fujimoto (George Tokoro), a magician in the sea recaptures the wandering Ponyo before encapsulating it into a magical bubble with gentle intent. <br /> <br /> Fujimoto, who was once a human, grew up and referred to humans with disgust for polluting the sea and stealing his life. But all Ponyo wants is to be human and to be with Sosuke, so for the second time she escapes, accidentally emptying her father's precious stock of magic elixir into the sea, creating a storm of tsunamis and swallowing the small town in the process. /> <br /> What follows are the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in the flooded city. <br /> <br /> Is there a happy forever in this? Would true love prevail? You find out. Looking at Ponyo's art at Cliff by the Sea, there seems to be a departure from Miyazaki's earlier work in rendering. It seems unfamiliar because the mood apart from the characters at stake in each scene is not colored in the usual way like Spirited Away (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004). The aesthetic appeal is disregarded from what appears to be colored pencil drawings. The objects and characters are not as detailed as before. <br /> <br /> This is peculiar if taken at face value, but from the way the story is written and told, the possible explanation is that Miyazaki is allowing the audience to see the film in the tone of a still allowing adults to reminisce about Japan when they were younger. This move might have prevented viewers, new to Miyazaki's work, from seeing him. The trailer did nothing to promote Ponyo either. Taking the case to Japan, however, would be a different story, since Miyazaki's credential surpassed any marketing technique. In short, the whole was not like its parts. In addition to Miyazaki's ability to launch animated and animated characters, the film lacks elements of excitement and admiration when measured against previous work, resulting in a deficit of presence on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The sparks of Ponyo and Sosuke failed. brighten up the film in style, but moments of warmth, kindness and love can still be found in recognizing the film as something that is not meant for children but for children that everyone is or has already been.
