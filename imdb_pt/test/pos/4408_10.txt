I must have seen it on television when it was first broadcast a few decades ago. I thought it was brilliant back then, and as I remember it so much now, I can be right. Although I have lived in and around London, I can not call myself a Londoner and I do not know him well - who is not a taxi driver? Once the viewer understands the premise; that here is a group of men trying to learn the seemingly unlearned and rising to the status of demigods, then the rest is pure joy. The characters are well contrasted, their family relationships are equally diverse and affected so differently by the events of the film. Do not think this is a documentary - it's pure drama, and The Knowledge is one of the characters. I've never seen anything like this movie before or after. Watch it!
