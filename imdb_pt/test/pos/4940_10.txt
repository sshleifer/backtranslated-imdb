This happened to be just starting on the TV when I opened, and since I was too lazy to change channels, I ended up watching. Dude, it was lucky. <br /> <br /> This movie is more a fairy tale than a demanding, and sometimes overtly sentimental drama. It's definitely what you might call a well-being movie, and I usually find it annoying or annoying. However, this movie is so well done that I could not help but love it. The script will not twist your brain; is conventional, but without failures. The actors are brilliant, each one is a perfect fit for the role. There is not much, but the snippets of music enhance the movie beautifully. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate other things besides expensive pyrotechnics, vicious killings or save the world in a movie, check this out if you already had the chance. 5/5
