Why is Jessie Matthews, one of Britain's greatest music stars, in this movie between her brilliant "The Good Companions" and the classic "Evergreen" a good question? When I first saw it, I was very disappointed. I wanted to see her singing and dancing - she was heralded as "Millie - the girl of the non-stop variety", but there was more parade than variety. <br /> <br /> Now I see it as a good little drama. It's about a bus accident and the stories, even the people on the bus. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jessie Matthews, who is great as Millie - Sir Ralph Richardson plays her fiancee (yes, that's right). Edmund Gwenn - who went to Hollywood to co-star in Lassie's movies and also with Natalie Wood on "Miracle on 34th Street," plays a grumpy businessman. Gordon Harker is your very annoying partner. Emlyn Williams - who wrote "Night Must Fall" was the Black-Mailing villain and Frank Lawton, who went to Hollywood and appeared in "David Copperfield" and "The Devil's Doll" is the young man in trouble. Sonnie Hale, who was married to Jessie Matthews at the time, played the bus driver.
