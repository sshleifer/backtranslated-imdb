I must say: of all modern Korean martial arts films, it's worth checking out. He was not as epic as Musa-The Warriors and did not develop the characters as well, but he had many good ideas. Simple story: an elite soldier thought dead, returns after years to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in the medieval days. His counterpart was previously the best friend he had and now he's out to stop him. The fight scenes are all with different sword or weapons and very fun to watch. The motifs of the figures are discovered first near the end. You may need to watch it again to get all the connections right. And I personally ... loved the ending. I could watch it over and over again. Maybe a bit pathetic, but a true history of freedom struggle ... People can be killed, but not the ideas they defend ...
