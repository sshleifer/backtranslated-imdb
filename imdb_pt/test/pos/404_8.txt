I saw this in TCM recently, and through IMDb, I discovered that there were seven "Crime Doctor" movies with Warner Baxter as the psychiatrist-detective. Baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to his impassive performance at 42nd Street a decade earlier. No noir, and a bit exaggerated today, the film also has a touch of the supernatural possible. The plot, the black and white photography and the characters are much more complex than the Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan series. There are subplots, unexpected twists and appearances of several B movies that we should all recognize immediately (none of them reached status A). It's a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> I would love to see a number of DVDs from these films.
