A boat builder in a drowsy town in Maine is getting out of business, and the lives of all (soon-old) workers and families are cut short. The biggest disappointment is that the two stars - Bates and Bridges - have only small parts. <br /> <br /> Interesting, but not something you would see twice. <br /> <br />
