Coming to the end of the Universal Monsters horror film cycle, and before the Golden Age of science fiction films, House of Dracula is more science fiction than horror and incorporates some of the more extravagant elements that come to typify fiction films of the coming age. Lon Chaney Jr. plays the Man of the Wolves, and John Carradine, Dracula and Glenn Strange, the monster Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> A mad scientist wants to "cure" the two monsters of his "diseases" through modernity. {read: crazy} science. When the beautiful scientist's assistant nurse turns out to be a hunchback at the beginning of the film, the viewer is alerted to the fact that this film will not be typical of Universal; this movie foreshadows the kind of despicable exploration that we would have as guaranteed in the 1950s science fiction. If you do not mind the slower pace of older movies and the black and white does not shoot it off, this movie is recommended viewing. Afaik, this is not currently available on DVD, but AMC displays it from time to time, so keep an eye out, or you may always want to see it on your TiVo!
