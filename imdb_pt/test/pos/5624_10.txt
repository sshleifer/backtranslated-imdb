Chris Smith's American film is an insightful examination of the American dream. The film centers around Mark Borchardt, an independent filmmaker from Wisconsin. Mark dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since he was a teenager and had a hi8 camera out of focus. The film follows Mark through his attempt to make his dream film, Northwestern. There are a number of hilarious scenes in the film as Mark goes through Northwestern's pre-production and then his short film Coven (pronounced co-ven, the correct pronunciation, Mark says "Sounds like an oven"), which he plans to use to raise money to complete Northwestern. The vision and mood of this film is on the same level as Roger and Me, Michael Moore's big movie. I first saw him in a chaotic display of the Sundance Film Festival that brought out the spirit of the movie - a giant air duct fell from the ceiling early in the movie, hit seven people and caused a twenty-five minute delay ; in the middle of the movie, the sound began to flicker and the projector had to be stopped to repair it, and in the last twenty minutes the projector stopped and the film burned. Despite the delays, the audience remained in the film and applauded standing up. American Movie also won the Documentary Jury Grand Prix at the end of the festival. I highly recommend this good movie, it's worth watching any infernal scans.
