in his descriptions of CAA, platinum lunches in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, vacations in Provincetown he never made, and free trips to Nicaragua, funded by Columbia photos. Sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) dominates the audience, laughs at himself (maybe because he has not taken the Hollywood thing so seriously) and makes us take care. <br /> <br /> This monologue is not just about "The Killing Fields," or "Swimming to Cambodia"; it is another pastiche of events, as he sees them. Some of the lines are classic, such as when Gray meets CAA's esteemed talent agents. The conference table is ... "full of them, tanned, healthy, fresh from drinking blue-green algae from an Oregon lake ... there are no drugs now in Hollywood." <br /> <br /> That was before the tragedy occurred. Many of us will miss your unbalanced mood. 9/10
