Absolutely one of the best aviation films of all time on many levels. Hardware addicts will drool the largest mass of Spitfires flying out of a reenactment of the Battle of Britain. No less than eight flying Spits are at hand for very precise ground and air sequences. <br /> <br /> Those who marvel at flying folklore and windy eyes reciting High Flight will identify the reverence of the central characters. the freedom to be fast, free and high in your Dark Blue World. Be warned: romantic and even dog lovers are treated with a very emotional ride in this movie. The central message is that shared by many war veterans, when their best hours, their lifetimes when they felt most alive, were in fact during the war, when all the rest is gray and sad. <br /> <br /> The plot is about the Czech pilots who escape from their country when the Nazis invade and join the RAF Free Czech Squad. There are some subplots, which deserve careful attention. This is just an excellent movie that even the most ardent romantic anti-hardware will love (keep the handkerchief on hand). Beautiful photography, first-class performance, accurate details of RAF life during the Battle of Britain. Easily a candidate for the personal collection of DVD of any aviation enthusiast.
