The first time I became aware of this film was when I watched a preview of another film. I was intrigued, but I could not see it before the theaters were over. <br /> <br /> It's not an easy movie to watch several times. There is a lot of violence inflicted on unarmed civilians. There are lessons to be learned here. One of the lines of Patricia Arquette sums it up. "For Americans, if that did not happen on TV, it just did not happen." There's a lot of truth to it. <br /> <br /> Another is that at one point she thinks only because she announces that there is an American citizen that the soldiers will separate and let her pass. It does not work like that. <br /> <br /> The scenery is beautiful. The acting is all decent. The TEACHER is especially good. Especially though I care about these characters. Francis McDormand and Spaulding Gray are fine, but their appearance is short, so they do not matter much. Patricia has the courage. In the hands of a minor actor, this could have gone very wrong. As it is to love or hate the movie, you must still come out with the idea that there are still military dictatorships in the world in this century, and until one of us gets hurt we ignore their oppression. <br /> <br /> Aung San Suu Kyi, is the female political leader in the film. In real life, she won the Nobel Peace Prize. She was only recently released from house arrest. The Bush administration, as I write this, is trying to pressure the military government to engage in negotiations with it and reform the government. The Burmese government was under such scrutiny that it changed the name of the country to the Maynamar Republic. The US government has not yet recognized the new name. <br /> <br /> If you do not want a message in your movie, do not watch this one. If you do not mind a little education with your entertainment then it is great.
