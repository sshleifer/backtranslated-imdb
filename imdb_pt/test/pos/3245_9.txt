A bold Australian film with all the elements for success. Two Hands represents the ability of Australian filmmakers and actors to produce high quality popular material. The film takes a new angle and uniquely incorporates drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very enjoyable on so many different levels - but I can also appreciate that it may not be the "cup of tea" of all. '. The film bears a distinctive Australian humor, as it portrays Sydney's underworld, and explores the lives of a young (Ledger) and young man (Byrne), swept away at the local crime scene. Two Hands deals with the theme of good and evil, both on an interpersonal and personal level and looks at the question of the consequences for 'our' actions. <br /> <br /> The camera work is elegant and humorous dialogue. With Bryan Brown, who plays Pando and Heath Ledger as Jimmy, battling on screen in the most bizarre situations - this Australian movie certainly has no talent for acting. <br /> <br /> This action / subtle comedy has become a bit of a cult favorite, and one of mine too.
