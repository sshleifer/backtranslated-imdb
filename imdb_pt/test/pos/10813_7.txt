The film takes place during the year 1940 and the French are about to lose the war. <br /> <br /> The film includes all genres: comedy, romantic, murder and history. It is likely that the historical part is not as likely as the others. <br /> <br /> It is not, however, a great laugh movie, but a great occasional smile!
