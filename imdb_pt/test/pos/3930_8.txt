I did not expect much from this movie when I entered the theater, but I waited for it for many years. In short, it was very good! Chad Michael Murray was very good, I thought he was going to be another Chris Flynn from Wrong Turn, but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good, but the best performance has to go to Brian Van Holt. He played the bad guy very well, I mean he was sick, sadistic and very cruel. The story between the brothers was good, and I liked how no murder happened until about 40 minutes after the movie. This gave you time to choose the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die. Jon Abrahams was very good as CMM's best friend. I liked how Chad half wept when he found him dead, it was better than just being like, "Anyway, my friend is dead, who cares." He showed how he really cared. So overall, this was a damn god slasher with some great effects. Angry!
