"One True Thing" is a very quiet film, which debuted in the fall of 1998, with rave reviews, but light box office. He tells the crippled story of Ellen (Renee Zellweger), a workaholic who is forced to return home to take care of her terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep), so that her distant father (William Hurt) can run her academic department. These terms are only general. The strength of "One True Thing" lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above Hollywood territory. Streep is Kate, the perfect housewife whose ability to illuminate an environment with its charm is evident from its opening scenes at a costume party celebrating Hurt's birthday. But Ellen has never been close to her mother, and since graduating from Harvard University, she has a certain dismay about her - Ellen almost thinks her mother is simplistic. While, on the other hand, she admires her father, who shares a special passion: Writing. Ellen writes for an aggressive New York company, and is almost heartbroken when her last play is demolished by Hurt, who appears to be a very lonely figure. <br /> <br /> To get to the point, as Kate gets sicker, Ellen's prospects change and she approaches her mother and further from her father. Hurt continues to make excuses for not being there when the family needs him most, and Ellen assumes he is having an affair. Meanwhile, she gave up her desk at work to spend time doing craft activities with her mother's "cult" group, the Minnies, and also learning that her mother is not as weak as she initially assumed. <br /> <br /> Without going too far, "One True Thing" is a masterpiece in the study of the character. Streep once again turns into a beautiful performance, this time working on a subtle level that starts slow but ends with a brilliant speech about wedding vows. Streep received his eleventh Oscar nomination for this performance. Hurt is also convincing as the father carrying a secret that is not revealed until the final moments. But it is Renee Zellweger who steals this movie. Forget "Chicago," "Cold Mountain," "Bridget Jones Diary," or whatever else you've seen and rented for this movie. She is remarkable in that. Working with her character's bitter resentment in understanding her parents, Zellweger can realistically portray a young woman struggling to keep her lip as she screams inside.
