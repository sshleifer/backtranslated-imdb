I waited 9 years to watch this movie simply because I've never seen it advertised on TV. Eventually I picked it up and it was well worth the wait. It's so much better than your exaggerated shout or garbage from last summer because it's all at a pretty quick pace, without crawling, crawling around the house for playful music scenes. Only bad dubbing slows down a bit, but do not let that put you off somehow. What's underneath - more hyped and crap. Witness changes - low budget, no hyped at all and very good.
