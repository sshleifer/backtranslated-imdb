I am very impressed with the performance at Comanche Moon. Before I started watching, I did not expect it to be as good as the Lonesome Dove. I could not believe how the actors were chosen to represent all the characters. This surprised me how they played every role! In my opinion, this was almost as good as the Lonesome Dove. It's hard to compare any movie with Lonesome Dove. If you do not make that comparison, I would give a positive signal. It was very funny! I did not post many comments on this site, but I felt I had to put my opinion out there. Amazing! I do not want to name all the brilliant actors because I would probably have to list each one of them. My favorite was Steve Zahn. He hit the nail on the head playing Captain Gus. His mannerisms were perfect.
