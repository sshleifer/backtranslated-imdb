Although I'm a bit older than the recommended age range, I really enjoyed this movie. It is a short break from reality and should be the dream for all girls to become friends with a pop star. I know it was mine, for sure! The first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the mean girls said some things that were also slightly full. Once you get over this, you can really start having fun. I loved the relationship between JD and Jane - it was really cool and you could see how much they started liking each other. The soundtrack is perfect and fits nicely into the movie. I also liked Jane's family, her sisters seemed kind. Movie very well done.
