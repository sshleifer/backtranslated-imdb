I just saw this movie in the resfest and I was shocked. I've never been a big scratching fan, but this movie got me addicted to getgo. It's listed as a documentary, but it never felt like one. (I can not remember the last time I had a lot of fun watching a documentary). has a style and energy that is refreshing, insightful and never too preaching. the production values ​​were also up there. (filmed on film with cool cuts and an incredible soundtrack). in general, an intelligent, fun and enlightening piece.
