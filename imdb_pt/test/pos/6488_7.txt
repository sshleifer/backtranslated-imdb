Sometimes it is difficult to define what separates a successful comedy from one that falls flat. In this case, the artificial plot over a spoiled rich girl who plans to take her nieces away from the 'bohemian' Greenwich Village, who is creating them, just to fall in love with him, is not promising. And nothing in director Leigh Jason's filmography suggests that he was a great neglected talent. And yet, he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed and happy atmosphere on the set that was faithfully recorded on film. <br /> <br /> He also had the good sense to pitch that movie properly. The small flaw is Miriam Hopkins in a part that Ginger Rogers would have been perfect. Hopkins is efficient but fragile without the warmth and sensuality that Rogers would have. She is further impaired by a pair of bizarrely long, fuzzy false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction. But a very young and very handsome Ray Milland could not be better in an exuberant and uninhibited comic performance of great charm. <br /> <br /> And better than that, particularly for New Yorkers, is the Hollywood representation of Greenwich Village in 1937. Although completely synthetic and idealized, it remains recognizable to a contemporary viewer. Art director Van Nest Polglase has created a friendly heap of apartments and shared backyards in ruins that is the perfect setting for the collection of artists, strippers, smarties and aspirants to this photo. Best in the supporting cast is Guinn Williams, bringing sweetness and light to his role as a boxer-sculptor-seamstress, suggesting the self-invention and fluidity (sexual and other) of life in the Village. Even more refreshing are Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby playing the girls. Pure, intelligent and full of humor, these girls look like real humans and look nothing like the professional children's actors of the day. <br /> <br /> Of special interest are a few memorable comic book sets: Ray Milland demonstration of vacuum cleaner for a woman with a howling baby is played more spontaneously than expected (the baby and her contortions are wonderful moments "found") and a fake domestic game in a department store showcase that degenerates into a free-for-it's also fun. The movie slowly slides down with a straight face custody trial, and then never gets back on track when the action moves to Long Island, but this movie is still worth taking a look at.
