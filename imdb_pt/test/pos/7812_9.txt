In a minute to pray, a second to die, Clay McCord (Alex Cord) is an unfortunate outlaw with a ten grand bounty on his head and degenerative epilepsy. Perceiving his days as an outlaw, he desperately wants (albeit with some reluctance) to take advantage of an amnesty granted by the rugged territorial governor Robert Ryan (excellent performance), who very much wants McCord renounce his ways and accept amnesty as an example to others, while Escondito's crook, the bandit Mario Brega plans to kill McCord to prevent that from happening. Also starring Arthur Kennedy, Aldo Sambrell and a number of other well-known European faces, this is co-written and produced by (American) pioneer western spaghetti Albert Band, also responsible for the pre-Leone film Gunfight At Red Sands. Although the main character's "epilepsy" solution is taken directly from the Howard Hawks Eldorado, the script is solid, fresh and unpretentious. This has a great balance of action and story and Alex Cord is great at it. He really should have been a bigger star. <br /> <br /> In defense of the shorter (well dubbed) English version: personally, I have passed that age, where the longest version is always the best and the final where McCord is ironically shot down by bounty hunters dirty after his forgiveness, is unnecessarily nihilistic and completely destroys the movie's message about hope and redemption. Call me old-fashioned, but I cheered for McCord and felt he won that happy ending!
