Thirty pieces of silver and a kiss for luck. This was another totally unexpected gem. Normally, I'm not even a suspense / suspense fan. That satisfies 100 minutes has more twists and turns than a boardwalk pretzel. It has an exciting erotic romance, reminiscent of "Body Heat" in more ways than one; has police and crime; political intrigue and just a dash of daytime soap. It has the right touch of violence that any professional must commit. Emma Thompson, (FBI AIC), delivers her role with grace and humor, and receives my vote of the best Southern accent for a Limey. Alan Rickman, (local cop), who always seems to steal the show, is excellent but not arrogant. They work well as a pair. A lot of plot that never goes out of control and is coherently reconnected at the end of the movie. And who is this incredible woman, Carla Gugino? I want her to carry my children. Carla, if you're out there, let's have lunch.
