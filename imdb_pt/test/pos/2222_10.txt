One of the funniest movies I've seen in movies in the early 70's and, sadly, has only been on TV a few times since. This movie must be released on video. It's Sellers at its finest, slimmer, as a corrupt hospital administrator. Great cast, great movie. If anyone has a good copy on VHS, I'd love to buy it.
