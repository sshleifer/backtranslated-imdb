I was impressed when I saw "The best years of our lives". The performance, script and direction of Master William Wyler (winner of Best Director in 1946) is Brilliant. <br /> <br /> The movie talks about World War II veterans coming home together on a plane and everyone happens to be living in the same town. They are all reunited with their families. The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar-winning role) has to adapt to his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and Children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) being different than before he went to war. <br /> <br /> The second man Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews in an excellent role) has to find a good job and adapt for a wife, he had married just 20 days before leaving for war. He begins to discover that she is not the same. <br /> <br /> The third man has a much more difficult adaptation to make. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his role of excellent Oscar) He lost his hands in the war and must deal with the reactions of his family and fianc√© 'Wilma (played by Cathy O'Donnell) to the hooks he has instead of his hands. All these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scenes. The stories of these men are all beautifully intertwined. <br /> <br /> This movie truly defines the meaning of a "classic". This unforgettable drama (winner of best film in 1946) is a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I were asked to choose a favorite movie, I would choose this movie. <br /> <br /> From 10 I would give "The Best Years of Our Lives" An 11. <br /> <br /> So the next time you rent a movie rent this one, you will not regret it.
