I remember when this NBC miniseries aired when I was in high school. After reading the novel, I thought I'd check some adaptations. I did not expect much from a mini-TV series, but now I might have to check out a little more. This is really excellent and the best possible movie version that could be made. Writer Simon Moore, who wrote the teleplay for the original miniseries Traffic, on which Soderberg's film was based, came up with a brilliant narrative concept that helps the story to flow very smoothly: he projects Gulliver's adventures as flashbacks, with the real story beginning as Gulliver returns home (everything happened on a journey). Gulliver, played by Cheers' Ted Danson, is kind of crazy when his wife, Mary Steenburgen, greets him back at his house. Unfortunately, the house is now owned by the local doctor, James Fox, who has projects in Steenburgen. Gulliver seems only disturbed at first, but when he starts telling stories of little people, that's all the evidence Fox needs to put him in a madhouse. All four of Gulliver's travels are related in this version, in the same order as the novel (the only time this was made in the film). I love the way your current situation reflects your flashbacks. Gulliver's little son, whom he has never met before, reminds him of the Lilliputians. Doctors who watch him in his cell from a mezzanine above him and remind him of the Brogdingnagians, and the scientific investigations of the doctors remind him of the insane scientific experiments and theories of the laputies and teachers of the Academy. Finally, when he is brought to trial, he is reminded of the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos. The cast of this thing is incredible, and includes Peter O'Toole, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Omar Sharif and Warwick Davis. The biggest flaw of the miniseries is that the acting is really uneven. You have all these great actors, but the smaller characters are often played by actors who were probably well into LA Law episodes, but do not do well in a fantasy drama. Ted Danson is not particularly good, despite having some sequences where he stands out. It's probably best that he has not tried one, but all the other characters in the movie speak English. Steenburgen is actually very good, and is very good overall. Another flaw that the series has is that the adventures happen a little too fast. It is not credible that Gulliver has spent eight years away from home, as is claimed. But in general, it captures Swift's tone and purpose very well, while, with its structure, it adds a new emotional level.
