Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more horrifying; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed with Ken Stott and there were no weaknesses in the cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was booked on the BBC in three parts, I watched the video Messiah in one go. A point of criticism; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.
