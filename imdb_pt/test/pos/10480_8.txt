If you think the first 30 minutes of this movie are so slow you wonder why you're watching, do not give up. In addition, listening to the Danish language is a bit new to most Americans, who do not see or hear many Danish films. Anyway, as the movie progressed it got better and better and the viewer is rewarded for his patience. Being a fan of the movie "Out Of Africa," this film has piqued my interest because it is based on a short novel by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the main character in the film. <br /> <br /> The meal - Babette's party - was incredible. I'm not a chef, but I was impressed! As someone interprets the story too, varies, I suppose, depending on how much you read this, and where you stand on religion. If the latter, as you look at the definition of "legalism" can affect how you interpret this story. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a great movie, but do not watch it if you're dieting.
