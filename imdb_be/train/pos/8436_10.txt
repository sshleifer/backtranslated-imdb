Not only that, this film is the best of last season H: LOTS. But it was better than any film made for television I've ever seen <br /> <br /> Looking at the Â«Top 250" I see only one small movie screen made it: How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I think that the time has come to increase this group 2. <br /> <br /> I will admit that the original series was a few concerts that were better than this, but I did not mind. I just loved to be able to enter into the world of Baltimore Homicide squad again!
