Only two comments .... seven years apart? It is unlikely that evidence of the relentless pulling force of the film! As already mentioned, the low-budget status on 13 telemovie portal ROW is a mitigating factor in his ugly. Having said that, however, is not without merit. - either as entertainment or as a fear walking alone <br /> <br /> However, the plot is basically the processing of The Amityville Horror - but without a lot of horror. Another case of intrigue! Gibney could make a decent impression, if she played Halifax -investigating couple of seemingly unrelated murders with the "home" as the main suspect. The script is better than average, and production in the overall standings at the highest level. He just will not be able to attract viewers, especially at key moments. <br /> <br /> Picking up on DVD for only $ 3.95 in the last week in my regular video store, I can not be jealous of spending. $ 10.95 is an acceptable price for the movie. Just do not expect the fireworks!
