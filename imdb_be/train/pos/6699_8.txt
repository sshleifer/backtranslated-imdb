If Sabrina first came to our screens, I was about 12, and so spent his teenage years watching the teenage witch delve into all sorts of strange problems. <br /> <br /> He was always one of my favorite programs, Witchy feeling from the sixties sitcom "Bewitched," but this time the character was steeper. I've always loved Sabrina, because she was smart. She was also friendly and calm, which made it a pleasure to watch. Characters at the beginning were great; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, the Quizmaster, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal favorite, a shame he left so early on), Hilda and Zelda her aunts went fine, but then it became annoying. <br /> <br /> I liked Mr. Kraft as well as it has always been that little bit closer to the discovery of the secret of Sabrina. What I loved about the first three series were original ideas Discovering the secrets of the family and learn new spells, but as it went on it became more predictable. Such as Valerie too many characters come and go, Dream and Brad, and then they decided to make Sabrina in college, which destroyed it for me. <br /> <br /> Sabrina became self-centered in college, there was less magic, Sun spell book, not an aunt living with her and Roxy, Miles and Morgan were annoying. <br /> <br /> The latest series was sad, and I just looked to see what happened in the end. Lacking Hilda and Zelda, apparently, is not so and Miles left the same as it is. The last episode made me feel a lot better, though (spoiler), which has Sabrina end up with Harvey on her wedding day to Dullard Aaron was great! Overall, a great program if you have forgotten the poor the last two or three series, which reminded me of many teen show. Magical.
