Municipalities is more mixed bag. Part vignette NYC political life, and part cautionary tale. Al Pacino-esque boss Dukakis presidential dreams, gives the OFT times surly or muted performance. There's a couple of times when he chews the scenery, and in the case of the mayor's office, this is where it shines. John Cusack gives a muted and generally an excellent job, not going into the caricature of New Orleans dialect, or slipping into melodrama during menopause films. Aiello like Burrough political leader, is also very good. I love showtunes too. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the mayor's office, and it's a good film in many ways, is the general feeling of a lack of momentum. He comes off more like a documentary than a movie. We see that the action or follow the story from the perspective of an individual, and, of course, the audience does not participate. If the viewer does not get involved, to some extent, they become indifferent with respect to the characters, and in the end the story. <br /> <br /> This leads to alienation, and that must have been riveting, detailed disclosure of the final, came off as "Um ... uh ... well." They say that you "can not fight city hall," as the tread is worn clich√© goes. However, he still can not stop you from thinking that it could be, if they only tightened the script and walks this film.
