One of the biggest movie I've seen this year.Last perhaps before sunrise, which is also seen late at night alone in the lab. I like the idea of ​​the film, which provides for the freedom of man's will and our weakness against time last fate.With James and Catherine are doomed to failure, and the indescribable sorrow comes. I love the end. but the big question is also coming. The virus can not be released, it should be? <br /> <br /> In the last scene at the airport. Jose is sent back again to meet with James future scientists. When he told him that the scientists have received your message and know that someone will be to spread the virus. And together they two meet Kathryn, when Kathryn James said true man DR. Goines assistant. So it is clear Jose also get accurate information about the virus, (James watching him at the time, remember?), And it has teeth. So why still happen ?? Why scientists do nothing after the truth is revealed in the future ?? My biggest question after the movie ...
