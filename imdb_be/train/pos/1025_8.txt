My assessment refers to the first four seasons Stargate SG-1, which are surprisingly fresh and creative application. If the roll is passed through the gate, you never know what lies on the other side! Starting around the 5th season, the show took a different focus - all good, but different <br /> <br /> The series is about the adventures of a team of people (and a foreigner) who regularly venture into planetary transport device called. "Stargate". Background of the series based on the characters and events of the film "Stargate", in which the device was found during archaeological excavations in Egypt. <br /> <br /> Episodes light (innocent and easy to watch), and very creative. Many of inventive stories could be easily done in large science-fiction films of his own. What happens next has always been unpredictable. <br /> <br /> characters which show residues are also well defined and brilliantly executed. Their tone is serious, but the flowers dialogue with incredible wit and humor. They're just fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Since somewhere around the 5th season, the series began to develop into a permanent basis storyline to fight one opponent (Goauldov, the Ori). Areas are becoming more complex (much more political / strategic-oriented) and interdependent. The characters were all just as great as ever, but the show was different in nature. <br /> <br /> One thing that should be mentioned to watch episodes that kept the 100 th and 200 th series. They simply can not miss the show. They demonstrate a creative and wildly comic genius who carried a series of 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you are a science fiction fan, watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons, and you'll probably be hooked. If you want to develop story lines between the two warring parties, you have 10 seasons of the show to look forward.
