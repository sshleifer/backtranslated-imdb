This cool superhero game Marvel pays due tribute, remaining faithful to the comics. Of all the superheroes Game Marvel, which were so crippled with a weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improves in both departments. It also has a voice of Stan Lee, creator of Spider-Man comics. <br /> <br /> As expected, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can. He does more than spin network. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. If he does not use the Internet in the battle, he punches and kicks as well. Spider has its hands full as he fights Venom, Rhino, mystery, Scorpion, and Dr. Octopus, to name a few. Look for Captain America in a cameo role. <br /> <br /> Most of the levels are complex, but some of them require patience to beat. The only complaint about this game is that it is so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you are a Marvel superhero fan, then this game is for you, but do not expect a long gameplay. Lucky in the "Spider-Man 2" My score: 9 out of 10.
