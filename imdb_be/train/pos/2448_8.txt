Yes, it is above, so it is a bit formulaic and let Constance Marie and the baby all worth it to see again and again! Jokes and tricks can get old and repetitive after a while, but the show is still fun to watch. Since this is a family show humor softened and the authors included family values ​​and ideals between the gags. <br /> <br /> George Lopez funny. Do not take it seriously and show a winner. I am sure that he did not intend his character to be a serious or a paragon of virtue. His outbursts and shouts of joy fun ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that a large, dark, bitter spot Benny. I hate the character ... so much so that at any time it is for more than 30 seconds, turn off the TV sound only reason I did not hear her. There's nothing funny about it a dialogue or a joke. As a mother, she has to be the worst out there and I was just shocked and surprised that George, as a character, will stand such a boring person for so long. <br /> <br /> Even anytime I get ticks from seeing Benny I think to myself, seeing it a lot better than watching Bill Engvall Show. Now there's a bad comedy ...
