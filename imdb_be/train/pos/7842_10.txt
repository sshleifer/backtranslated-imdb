so in the middle of the season, I got so turned out to be in school and my work, I did not understand that the show was canceled in the middle, it's crap. <br /> <br /> I think that the followers of this show have to write a fox and ask them to at least finish the shooting, so that the season can be released on DVD later. maybe then they will see how many people have been disappointed that the show did not survive their first season. <br /> <br /> I loved the show and looks forward to it every Thursday after OK. You can imagine my disappointment when I went back to try and watch the show only to find that she was gone? Needless to say, I was not very pleased with the fox right now. especially after he discovered that no end is not removed. I mean, if you're going to work on the project, at least, finish it, and see what happens. half lifted the show as half of the car, it's pretty much useless. fox, shoot the damn ending and give some of the supporters of some of the world show.
