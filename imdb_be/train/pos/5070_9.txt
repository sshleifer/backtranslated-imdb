Recently I was looking recently launched Wide Screen DVD in the Fly home and came across an interesting name, which I had never heard: Great Gray Owl. The fact that it was Richard Attenborough's film caught my attention (it is responsible for such wonderful films like Gandhi, Chaplin, and Shadow). I have noticed that the script was by William Nicholson (author of Shadows). This «Special Edition» was full of interesting-sounding material, and the price was just under $ 10.00 - so I bought it and accidentally. WOW! What a beautiful film. Pierce Brosnan stars as Archie Great Gray Owl, real life catcher in 1930, who came to love and respect the wild lands of Canada, and has worked to help protect them. Brosnan (who starred in the James Bond film) gives a shady, warm, high performance, as does Annie Galipeau as a young woman who loves and influences his feelings for the land creatures - especially the beaver. Penalty Assessment George Fenton (COC) and the beautiful photograhy Roger Pratt significantly add to the effectiveness of the film. And the extras on this DVD is something else! It includes two shorts made in 1930 with the actual Great Gray Owl, and audio commentary tracks Attenborough and produced by Jake Ebert; 2 shorts; and many other wonderful additions PLUS option for those who have access to a PC with a DVD-ROM features. Gray OWL was released directly to DVD in the US - a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes the lack of interest in distributing Hollywood that is not loaded with a lot of violence and sex. This is a film that not only informs and entertains, but leaves you with something to think about. I had a very warm feeling at the conclusion of film - and at a new love and understanding beavers! Gray OWL very thin film - worth checking out! This is one I look forward to share with others.
