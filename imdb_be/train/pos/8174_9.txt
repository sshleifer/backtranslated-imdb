I love this movie. As a child, it was one of the first films I saw that made me flinch. Of course, it is soft now, but back in the day, it was awesome. Dentists one thing so many people are afraid, so why not make a movie about a killer dentist? It's cheesy, it's fun, it's scary sometimes, but it's awesome. And I've always had a love for the medical horror. And Bernsno plays Dr. Feinstone well, no one could do it better. And low budget horror film, effects, and these are very good. And I also love the theme song, it goes well with the film. Ken Fori (Dawn of the Dead) also plays a curious police, and doing an excellent job. There is a sufficient amount of blood, and some really cool scenes of torture / death. Check this one out!
