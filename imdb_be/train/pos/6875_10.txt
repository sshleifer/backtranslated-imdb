When I was chairman of the coffee of our college, one of our jobs were the review groups and films for student activities. One of the best things to come along in 1972 Groove Tube. The initial premise is that it is shown outside the Broadway theater where television monitors have been deployed throughout the audience, so that everyone had a great location. The room was that the scenes will change on a regular basis-ala Saturday Night Live, keeping the most recent. They decided to make it into a film for general distribution. <br /> <br /> I believe that the developers have said that this is the first time Chevy Chase was on the tape. Watching him run around naked, but the forest was howling. Like many of the reviews before mine, it was on Saturday Night Live in the appearance of such a thing. I highly recommend this VID. I told my 13-year-old son about Coco clown- He can not wait to get a copy!
