It's just such a joy watching this intriguing project. So refreshing and education. Not only filmmaker who can find out what can be achieved within 5 minutes of screen time, but as viewers who may not be so willing to love in such a short period of time. <br /> <br /> 20 short films about love in Paris are all unique, but some of them, as you would expect, are allocated. I thought that Tykwer segment (Natalie Portman) was the best, though memes made me smile in the same way. <br /> <br /> I clicked on the "spoilers" option to review this bus alas ... that you read this spoiler enough. Just watch. I do not read what I write, but to watch a movie instead. <br /> <br /> And smile.
