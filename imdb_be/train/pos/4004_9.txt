"Mother" is that part of an extraordinary film - it will help you to think that does not pull punches - and in the end it leaves you thinking. Very open warehouse to the fate of the lead character. Ann Reed (who I briefly knew from her performances in some of Victoria Wood under the direction of projects and thought a great comedian) is really beautiful here. Nha stereotyped widowed housewife, which was held in marriage and motherhood in general. And not all of that free spirit and adventure in the first. She plays her character with just the right note, that the truth (well, it was for me). Powerful shot. Great script. The revival of European cinema really;)
