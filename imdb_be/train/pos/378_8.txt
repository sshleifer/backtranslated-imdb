These days Spielberg «The Color Purple» mostly remembered was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and won zilch. What is even more disturbing is the fact that Spielberg himself was not even nominated for Best Director. Needless to say, the filmmakers deserve more than the recognition given to them. <br /> <br /> The story concerns the trials and tribulations Celia Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), African-American women dominated in the first of her incestuous father, and then her rigid husband. The film covers several years, and focuses mainly on the relationship Celie women around her. He said with a clearly female point of view, but you should not be afraid that this saccharine "chick flick." <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, it intensified with humor times, although the fight against the central character is paramount. Some of them can not estimate the change in tone towards the end of the movie, but I did not mind, although it seems content to a lesser film, most likely, in my eyes rolling. <br /> <br /> The film received three Oscar nominations for action: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Supporting Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Actress). I think that Goldberg and Winfrey were certainly deserves and Danny Glover was inexplicably abandoned. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, Spielberg did not receive a nomination for Best Director for his efforts. Such an omission is hard to believe, since the direction of Spielberg's first-class here. I do not particularly mind Quincy Jones' account, but it is not lower than the average of any means. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story of a satisfying, well narrated by master filmmakers working with Pulitzer Prize material. Give it a try, and you are likely to be confused as I am about how this could be so badly treated at Oscar night.
