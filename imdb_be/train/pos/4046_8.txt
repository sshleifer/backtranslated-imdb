Romer is returning to its historical dramas in the true story of Grace Elliott, an Englishwoman who remained in France the top of the French Revolution. Always suspected that Romer was a conservative, but who knew that he was such a full-blooded reaction. If you can put aside the shameless protection Romer in the monarchy (and it's not an easy thing to do, given that, for example, the French lower classes appear here disgusting louts), it really is elegant, intelligent and polished film, not having money on a large cinematic recreation of 18th century France, Romer has instead cast to play against the explicit depicted cordons. This is clearly an artificial conceit, but it somehow works. And newcomer Lucy Russell has managed to make a sympathetic character, which should not be.
