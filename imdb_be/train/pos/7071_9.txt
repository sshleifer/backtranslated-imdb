Time paradoxes devil trap drain completely. They are fun to consider "what if?" Kind of way Film producers and writers had to deal with this again and again in many films and television, including. «Star Trek: First Contact", "Back to the Future" trilogy, "Bill and Incredible adventures of Ted "," Groundhog Day ", and Stargate SG1 tribute," a window of opportunity. "Heinlein" all you zombies "was written several decades ago, and yet it will still pull people read that short story for the first time. <br /> <br /> in the case of a great film by Terry Gilliam, '12 Monkeys', it is difficult to establish what can s to be continuity in the plot against the elements intended to force us to rethink our understanding of the film. Repeated views will lead us to different conclusions if we keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Some, seeing the film for the first time, will be regarded Cole, played by Bruce Willis, schizophrenia. Most will see Cole as a person, perturbed by the fact that Adams describes as "persistent painful experience" visited on his journey in time. <br /> <br /> Unlike the other time travel stories, '12 Monkeys' is unclear whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time can not be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport intercepted by scientists after it was sent back in 1996, in his personal timeline. <, Br /> <br /> Even that could be interpreted as an event that should have happened in the same timeline of the universe, in order to ensure that the timeline does not change ... Cole had to die before the eyes of his younger self for the fate It must be implemented. If this is the case, while the liquid, it always finds its own level or path, regardless of the external forces acting on it. It boggles the mind to dwell on this kind of thing too much. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events, which are then sent to the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the aircraft at the end of the movie, it means that in the future can be changed by manipulating the events of the past ... or does it? The film is likely to lead to a large number of drunken fights in bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians. <br /> <br /> bonus material on the DVD makes for very interesting viewing. Gill was a more than normal pressure to bring the movie in on budget, which is not particularly surprising, after the disaster at the "Munchausen" and in light of his subsequent attempt to film "Don Quixote." I would rate the "product" documentary as one of the more interesting I've ever seen. This, of course, not white and true notes the difficulties and sometimes conflicts between creative people who participate. Description Gilliam film, as his «7½th» release the film on account of others write, than he did the writers - and, therefore, is not really "his" movie ". - does the film itself justice <br /> <br /> the image of Brad Pitt with Goines interesting attractive, although his character is not particularly friendly. Watch out for his slightly cross-eyed look in one of the scenes from the shelter. This disturbing and distracting. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a coincidence, Louis Armstrong song "What a strange world" was used at the end of both the '12 Monkeys', and the last episode of the television series "Hitchhiking Guide to the Galaxy." And the movie and TV series also showed a British actor Simon Jones. <br /> <br /> '12 Monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that mental excitement of the game of chess can please. This is not a pointless holiday, that's for sure.
