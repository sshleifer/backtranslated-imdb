Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this film. The last 15 minutes (or so) are large and Peck absolute joy to watch. The same can not, however, be said for the rest of the film. It's not terrible, and I'm sure that it was done with good intentions, but the only real reason (if I were to be honest), to see that it is Peck. The rest of you better just read the Old Testament.
