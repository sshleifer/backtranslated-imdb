Burlinson Thornton and give excellent performance in this film, along with Dennehy. Although at first glance to be just about love, it's really going down deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures the film, placing among one of the best I have ever seen. Horse scene absolutely fantastic !! All horse lovers will love this film out there! <br /> <br />
