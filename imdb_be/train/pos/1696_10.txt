This cult material. My friends and I were together once a year to enjoy this film. It's very funny and very dry. I saw this step ten times and still not use it.The actors are funny and it gets better with each viewing! If you like "morons from outer space" you'll love this. Big game War of the Worlds. I love the riot of Red-neck to get a foreigner, on the hood of a mistake, the DOD, warm suit populous Annihilator, mine field, Red Camo, breaking the speed limit on 1800Mph! "I'll get a bucket!" Very funny. I would like it to come out on DVD! Forget the negative reviews and see for yourself!
