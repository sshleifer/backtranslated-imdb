In the process of trying to establish empathy with audiences Jake Rodel (Tobey Maguire), the filmmakers cast aspersions on the north and Jayhawkers. Missouri never seceded from the Union and the Union army was invading forces. Southerners fought for the right of the State: the right to own slaves, to elect crooked legislators and judges, as well as the use of the political spoils system. There's nothing noble in it. Missourians could easily have traveled to the east and joined the Confederate Army. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this story has nothing to do with the ambiguity. When Jake leaves Bushwhackers, it is not because he found a mistake in the way it is, of course, not be given for reasons of resignation.
