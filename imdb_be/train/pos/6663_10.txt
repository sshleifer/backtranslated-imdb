This film is about a family Dysfunctinal, but not just any dysfunctional family. We are talking about the family of the Father of our nation (India), though, the film focuses mainly on the estranged relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Charilaus Gandhi. It shows how the Mahatma had to kill MK Gandhi, he had to sacrifice their family life in order to achieve our freedom. Every time Gandhi and his son try to get Mahatma come between them. This beautifully made film. Akshay Khanna shown itself to be the best actor. He expressed his emotions very natural. Darsi Zhariuola, which mainly stars in lawyer-Gurukant Plays in Desa Guru Gandhi reflected perfectly. (As a real person, as opposed to Ben Kingsley, which made him look like a God) Shefali Shah girl with Monsoon Wedding also did a very good job to show how the Kasturba Gandhi was torn between father and son. This film is touching and therefore his music from «Raghupati Raghava» movie is sung in a very unique manner. I saw this film only 3 hours ago (he was released in Dubai the day before, on the 2nd), and if the film was there was a «Pin fall Silence» and leaving the theater not one person pushed the other (Can you imagine we Indians Sun pushing) is not one! It was sacred silence ...
