This police drama is no worse than many others of his time, and better than many. Obviously, it follows in the footsteps of "the net" and "Naked City", but it serves as a nice programmer. The best thing about it is the unvarnished opinion it provides in the world has long gone ... lower class New York from the late 40s / early 50s. Here in all its glory run-down, from the old school, tattoo studio on the cheap hotels in greasy spoons. These old police movies like travelogues to a bygone era and a very bitter for everyone who does not like the sanitized, soulless cityscape today. <br /> <br /> In addition, intriguing is the emphasis on the nuts-and-bolts of the scientific aspect of the decision of crime ... In this case, the killing of tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our main characters, detectives Tobin and Corrigan, doing footwork, but without the tedious and painstaking efforts "lab boys," they would not get anywhere else. Despite the fact that the technology is not in the same league, the police here are using the persistence in C.S.I. investigator to find his man. <br /> <br /> By the way, some observers have written about this film, do you think he would have been sent to Ed Wood and acted on the extras of his films. What nonsense! I enjoyed the John Miles, lanky ex-Marine turned cop Tobin ... he was carefree, careless approach to the role that a happy change in normal stone faces theatricality most movies cops period, Patricia Barry cute and beautiful as his playful friend that helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella stuffy and as beautiful as a senior detective Corrigan. I rather liked the chemistry of these two, and he did something a little different than some robotic «Dragnet» approach. <br /> <br /> The very secrecy is not too deep and the final chase and shootout, of course, will not rank among the classics of cinema crime, but in this short time working, "Tattooed Stranger" more than held his interest.
