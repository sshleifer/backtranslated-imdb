I have not seen this film since the late 80s and decided to pick up a VHS version of it. The plot is very slow, and the actors seem almost robotic in this film breakdance. Music, hip-hop / freestyle artists and breakdancing scene that makes this film special. Breakdancing in this film is actually better than that of «Breakin '», but I have to say that «Breakin' 1 & 2" carry the energy & excitement on the screen is much better. This is a film, I will keep in my library, but this is not a movie that I can watch over and over again, only once in a blue moon.
