I'm not saying that just as a fan Chris Rock, I say this as someone who had low expectations that go into this film and has been proven wrong. The first drawback was it all work out is over, that everyone saw the arrival. The defect was number two, I discovered that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock, seemed fake. Finally, acting in this film was sub-par, with best actor as Regina King and the worst being Mark Addy. but I could see past it and saw the lack of a solid comedy. In Hedi-up scenario, watch the sky can be expected instead, it is better. So for all of you, Chris Rock fans out there, watching this film, you will enjoy the outside. He has some good standing in this movie <br /> <br /> In general :. 7 out of 10
