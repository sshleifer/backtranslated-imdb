If placed on my TIVO for a rainy day because of the cast, some very hard-working people in the industry, and when I finally looked, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> In this film, there are some Altman-like aroma (it is mentioned in the credits as "thank you" to people), using seemingly unrelated independent storylines are intertwined as the film approaches its climax. Macy clean, pure and honest as a person who can not seem to escape his "destiny", Sutherland plays and draws as few can, in Neve adds a splash in deliberately softened the environment, add Tracey Ullman, Barbara Bain (remember Mission impossible on TV?), not to mention the steady John Ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good movie. Scenario laconic dialogue free from cliches and brooding (especially between Mace and David Dorfman). Suspension of belief and enjoy, it really had a good time.
