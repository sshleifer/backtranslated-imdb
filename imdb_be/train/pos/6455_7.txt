I was drawn to this film at that time, when I saw a preview of it on the night of the Oscar. When I read of whom Pollack, I was hooked. We Americans are suckers for the return of the child. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film was a huge hoax in Sweden. As a very provincial American, I can only guess at the reason. Perhaps this is due to a provocative joke that makes the character of Lena in the beginning of the film and other social commentary, but perhaps this is due to the central message, which I believe is the same treatment everywhere in affluent societies. <br /> <br /> message of this film for me is the same as in the movie Titanic. Life is short people, and how much people know exactly what it is all that we have. It can be taken away at any moment. So I do not regret that we spend so much time hiding behind the walls that separate us from other people, because we are so afraid of being hurt? He broke down the wall is painful, but the feeling of living to lie on the other side of these poor walls. lively sense of worth the risk. Give and you will receive. So start to live now. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this movie for this lack of performance and other defects. I say that you are a pseudo-sophisticated. Grab people, it is a parable, fable, because we are prosperous Western that financially wealthy, but whose souls are in extreme poverty. <br /> <br /> So to join the choir or group or to help build a house or to distribute food to those less fortunate than you. Spread some joy and make the world a better place while you go out and communicate with loved ones. Writing a check is not enough. We are social species, by the way. Even modest your colleagues can affect you in ways you never thought possible. <br /> <br /> individualism has its place, but it's overrated.
