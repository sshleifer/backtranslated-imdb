I remember quite a low note for the enterprise, as when it was first released. James "Do not, Jim" Belushi, unnatural child actress, and cheesy title in Formula John Hughes. You could not pay me to see it 15 years ago. But I was looking until goes out on Sunday afternoon and it strikes me on a couple of levels. Tale (part Pretty woman, a part of the reverse Pretty woman), is very vulnerable, performance Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street -like Kelly Lynch, in escapism. overall, it gently pulls some very good lines. it is very difficult not to fall in history, to develop a crush on Kelly Lynch, identified with James m Belushi, do not like the hard bad guy guy and laughter on the line Curl Sue. My ups and downs, with a happy ending, as well as the type of message you want to hear. Go ahead, waste your time on this film, it's worth it.
