This is "The Prodigal Son" and "Oriental Condor" my favorite movies Hung summit. Fat Dragon fatter in this outing than he was in the "Condor", but it is not less sure-footed as a director or actor. He, in fact, on top of their form and provides destructive, violent thriller that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to say compassionate, sweet love story too. Love and romance is not a priority directorial here, but they are interesting adjunct to the action, and make sure that viewers do not press the fast-forward between physical collisions. <br /> <br /> The first scene that shows a funny light saber duel, it sets hard, but the wrong tone. The sequence in which the summit is Pedicab fleeing vehicle beautifully set and sweetened with sharp comic tone. Fast and furious Regiment battle between itself and Lau Kar Leung model dazzling choreography and sharp, fine management, and easily one of the best ever of its type. movie violence escalates slowly, until finally, when it's climactic showdown, we do not suffer from some of the most brutal fights ever seen in the production of the summit. assault director / actor Billy and His house filled with angry, threatening opponents bone cracking, physically punishing pleasure. <br /> <br /> Perfect on every level, and one of the best martial arts movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Most of evaluation, too.
