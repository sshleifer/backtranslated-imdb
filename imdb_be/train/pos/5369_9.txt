Mild Spoilers <br /> <br /> In the near future, the star Arnold, Ben Richards, wrongly convicted man make in the game "The Running Man", the death TV game show where people have to keep moving, to try to avoid hard deaths 'stalker' hands. Of course, people are expected to eventually die, and Arnold to prove the system wrong. <br /> <br /> I have not read Stephen King's book, but it's a great movie, no matter, one of the best by Arnold, he does what he does best as a man of action, bringing the death memorable one-liner. Classical, probably, "He was a real pain in the neck" after pressing the guy with the barbed wire, and he had to share! "Due to the location it is just a chain sawed someone vertically. Dawson quite annoying, as presenter, and all the "Stalkers" are suitable camp. Action tough, but his fighter. This is the point. The film is fast paced, and after 90 minutes it does not overstay its welcome. <br /> <br /> With the Starsky and Hutch Paul Michael Glaser at the helm, and took on the wave of success of The Terminator, before this film probably seen as just another mindless action vehicle for Arnold, and very far-fetched, but today the TV viewer can see a lot of how the film is getting closer to reality. I would not be surprised if you turn on the TV in the "near future" and see a show not far from it. <br /> <br /> On this depressing note, I must, however, recommend the "Running Man" for those who love the 80s, Arnold, funny or acts of violence or just a good action movie. 9. 5/10
