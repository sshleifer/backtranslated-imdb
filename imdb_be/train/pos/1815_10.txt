"May contain spoilers * <br /> <br />« All dogs go to heaven "is a great film. I saw him in 1989, when I was two years old. I do not know what is good, but as I saw him more and more time, I began to love it. I love the songs in this film. My favorite songs «Let Me Be Surprised" and "Soon you'll Come Home». This beautiful songs. The only thing that bothers me about the film Charlie dies. when I was little, my sister could not even watch this part. in addition, this film is excellent. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie, when Annabelle and Charlie flying the sky. the sky is beautiful in the film and the "clock" is very smart. I also love itch, in fact I have 3 of my own taxes. They are so cute. <br /> <br /> Overall, I love this movie and offer all need to see this. I give this film 10/10 stars.
