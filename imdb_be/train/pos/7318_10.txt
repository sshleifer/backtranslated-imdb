Halloween <br /> <br /> John Carpenter This is the greatest horror movie of all time? no .. maybe not everything, but it is and always will be. The film is an obvious genius and will always hold a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> It's a pity I did not get to see this film to twenty years after its release, and even twenty years later, after many slasher copy cat came and went a film still gave the same effect, as it should be It has done then. My father suggested that before I go to look for Halloween H20, I jump out and Halloween rental 1 and 2 in order to get the full story, and after watching the Halloween it was quite clear that he is determined and set slasher genre. <br /> <br /> plot of the film is simple, in 1963 Michael Audrey Myers murdered his sister, Judith restrained with a large butcher knife. Shchukin for fifteen years, where he was treated Dr. Sam Loomis, he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, where he begins to achieve three young girls: Laurie Strode innocent BookWorm, Annie Brackett hard conversation with sarcasm and Lynda Van Der Klok beautiful and sexually energetic young girl. Dr. Loomis, Michael tracks here, where he enlists the town sheriff Leigh Brackett which remains skeptical of his story about the psychotic killer. Michael looks girls mercilessly and begins killing them one by one, until only the sweet innocent monastery remains, who is the main target in the list. <br /> <br /> Michael Casting the film was brilliant and all the actors and actresses gave top performances expression, Jamie Lee Curtis was stunning in her first film role as the Laurie Strode Pleasence and gave a fascinating insight with his small role Loomis. Nick Castle, which draws Michael has done an excellent job as a callous and malicious killer, and his walking movements and body were perfect. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest moments of this film is a deterrent by itself did John Carpenter who created one of the most famous horror themes known today. Blue lighting was terrible and efficient and one of the greatest moments in the film when the young Laurie cowering against the wall to see her dead friend, and in the shadow of her face Michael materializes before it strikes. Michael mask was one of the things that sent shivers down your spine most, white unconscious face worked perfectly. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so great that this is not a bloody film, unlike cheese Friday 13th movies actually have a little bit of blood in this movie at all and works, and not on their toes and tensions. <br /> <br /> It was so obvious that Halloween has spawned films such as Friday the 13th, and characters like Jason Voorhees, of which it is a rip off of Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> In summary, I suggest you watch this movie at least once in their life, as it is an important milestone in making the film, and, no doubt, if not the best, then one of the greatest horror films of all time.
