I enjoyed watching this film at the International Film Festival in Rhode Island and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati obviously a great writer, and I would like to see more of his films. If she could do what she did with the budget of this film, I wanted to see what it can do with the main image. Kudos to the actors for their amazing performances (this little girl was the gold), and the one who wrote the music. Deformed "Row your boat" blew me away. It is a creative film all around .... I really hope that he will be released on video or DVD, because I would buy it in a second. If you get the chance, you should definitely see this movie.
