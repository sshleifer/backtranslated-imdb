I think this show is definitely the biggest show. Jessica Alba does such a great job in it. Weatherley also does an amazing job, and the rest of the cast. The show is very intriguing, and they have some great story lines and amazing stunts. It's like looking at the 1-hour film. It is definitely worth a look.
