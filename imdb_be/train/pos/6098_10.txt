This is one horror movie based on a TV show that gets it right. Friday the 13th series had nothing to do with the movie. Poltergeist heritage: I am not sure. It may have been poorly linked to movies. I have the feeling that they just throw a well-known title of the show, so fans will be watching. <br /> <br /> It shows Freddy is burned on Elm Street parents (in the 1st episode, I believe) and the number of parents were disappointed. With all the children he targeted in the first 3 films you would expect to have more parents. But oh well. <br /> <br /> Freddy mainly the narrator for the show. He's watching the actions of people in the real world, sometimes joined somehow. Just like other anthology shows like Tales from the Crypt, there are supernatural or unexpected twist ending participate <br /> <br /> To act is not enough, but believe it or not .: Violence is sometimes superior to film. The show lasted two seasons and was made during the 4th movie. I heard it was canceled because of the protests of parents. I watched a lot of R evaluate things as a child, so it's a shame that the parents had to ruin it for everyone. 4 more films came after the series, so it was not a total loss.
