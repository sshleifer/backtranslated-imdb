Peter Bogdonavich made some really great films, and they all laughed, this is one of his best. The cast could not be better equipped to play this light, but a little bittersweet screwball comedy. Interestingly, witty, light touch Bogdonavich so easy to use gives the film a rather disarming emotional core. Fresh and direct, the film begins with absolutely no explanation. There's no soundtrack music rewind us. We meet the characters in action, as well as Bogdonavich slides down the streets of New York, the film unfolds effortlessly. Robby Muller camera captures it all with understated simplicity that seems random, but of course it is not. The cast is terrific. In all respects, the classic.
