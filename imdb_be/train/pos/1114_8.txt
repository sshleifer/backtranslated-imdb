At that time, I remember, I was then struck and killed by this film. I called it the most important film I've seen in ten years, and has appeared bumping into people who say things like that. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has an unusually insightful behavioral laptop. And she formed the bitter teenager faces that we all had, in corrosion, for adults outlook. Two surprising together provide a mixture which can be too sharp for some viewers. (Hi Skip. I want you not my brother, so I can **** you!) <br /> <br /> Search Bernhards for themselves after returning to Los Angeles from New York, results in an attempt to dive-on with a different person (all of which fit badly) for our entertainment, but they are enough to attract the acting out of turn to the system of "mandatory black" meaning that the real barometer resituation it is accepting its black culture. (This was at the time. Nina Simone comes to mind. And she has a large, solidly built black lover in the film) Pretty black girl attends a show, and it seems that allows the LV-Black Sandra, but ultimately rejected it. <br /> <br /> just as Catholics consider themselves happy to suffer for Christ, here Sandra portrays the suffering of the black culture of hands, in which she seeks revenge; as if she indulges her dignity and her refusal. This system is only the value involved in the world of movies, it is Bernhards artistic confusion. <br /> <br /> For the nation, the main issues of racism and money, it's refreshing to see one of the two topics covered in an atypical way.
