Being that I am a true product of hip-hop and electronic dance music generation, it is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street, though not as "authentic" in some respects, like Wild Style, a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of those who take pride in the culture of the urban sample / DJ for the music and electro-club culture. <, Br /> <br /> While I recognize that sometimes some cheesy dialogue, you can not help but feel for the characters, and ultimately, "If you were there" to begin with hip-hop culture in New York city in the early eighties. B-boy battle scene in the nightclub Roxy (in real life, in real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and NYC Breakers) is just as important for the archives of the hip-hop fan, like any classic album. See some of the actions of circuit breakers in slow motion, when you can truly appreciate the sport and style experience seasoned B-boy / B-girl. All praises due to the Zulu nation !!!
