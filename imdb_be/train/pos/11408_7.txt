Etienne Girardot is just a character actor - the man most people would never know by name. However, he once again plays a coroner - one of the few actors in films Philo Vance, who played a part more than once. I've seen him two other times and loved it every time, because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air. This film is also great to look at, because in addition to Girardot, there are many other great actors of character for the trip - including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is a fairly large cast, and they sure make the job easier for the leading men and women Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. <br /> <br /> These great actors sign one of the main reasons why I love these old B-movies, while very rare secret that spectacular, because frivolous letters and action movies really satisfied. As for this film, beautifully played by Vance Lowe, but, as I said, the very mystery of just an afterthought - with a silly plot involving hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can not hypnotize someone to do something like this - I have training in clinical hypnosis, and if I could do something like the evil man can do in the film, I would have done it! Used car salesmen and some of my old bosses would be obvious targets !! <br /> <br /> In general, while not the best film of Philo Vance, it was very good, and it's a damn shame Lowe only the role played once. In fact, apart from William Powell (who had played five times Vance), it has been hampered by a series of long, long line of actors like Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others), which play Vance. This is a similar problem, which also suffers from a number of Bulldog Drummond -. Too many different actors playing the leading man <br /> <br /> Well worth seeing and exciting - though not impossible.
