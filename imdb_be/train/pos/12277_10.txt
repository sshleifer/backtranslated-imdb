Perhaps the best book by Isabel Allende, spirits House describes alternative Chilean history, this one is full of magic, mystical veil, and some ever-present sadness. The film assembles a large cast, plus great art direction, with the script, which may not contain all the features of this book. It is unusual for the almost unknown country like Chile, to get so well represented, as of this film, which may only sin aspire too high, and because of the fact that the illiterate public left a bit disappointed, mostly because they are very poorly understood.
