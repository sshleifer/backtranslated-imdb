Barbara Stanwyck gives it an early-directed Sirko, manufactured by Universal soap just blow that he needed. Not as memorable as the later melodramas Sirk, it is easy to see, watching Â«All I Desire", which will be headed by artistic Sirk in the next few years. Stanwyck is a dancer who returns to his family in a small town, USA, after the defection of a decade ago. Her family and the community have mixed emotions in a relationship with her shocking return. Some of the strange cinema, and Stanwyck tough as nails and really gives the film a shot of energy. Overall, a pretty good show.
