I read a lot of commits, when it was in theaters and they were all bad .... I think you have to be sure the type of person to enjoy these films. If you are not a person who enjoyed the home or small Waltons ... U do not understand and do not enjoy these movies ... <br /> <br /> Now Loves abiding joy ... I knew it was bad news the beginning movie .... I wish it would show through, rather than to allow you to just think about it. This film has a lot to do with it .... Jeff in 6 years, so you know that he would be interested in a girl. <br /> <br /> I want to say that I enjoyed all 4 of the film so far. ... was not crazy about the books ... Cant wait till next film. The way Clark says will help you every time. I would like to see January Jones to pretend ... Maybe a family reunion or something.
