Here's another movie that does not really need a lot of recommendations. This is a classic comedy, very funny and fun, and, of course, ultimately inspired the successful TV series, which many would say is even better (I like the way, personally). <br /> <br /> For some, it is difficult to warm up the Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison, when they have been brought up on a television show starring Tony Randall and Klagmen (or maybe vice versa). But the fact that we got there in both cases, four good actors who in real life seemed so much like their movie counterparts, that they were able to make these specifications themselves. It is humorous material by Neil Simon, which is key, and where laughter is really going on with. <br /> <br /> For those who have never once heard of an odd pair, is the story of a neurotic and vain neat-freak (Lemmon) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage of his long-suffering wife and moves in with his messy Manhattan altogether irresponsible buddy (Matthau). Spot these two very dissimilar roommates together in one and the same four walls makes for some very funny difficulties.
