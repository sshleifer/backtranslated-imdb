14-year-old in me very happy that they are now able to make a really good watch fantasy movies, and they're all the rage, that Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia makes loads of cash on hand. This year will be (and have seen) a bit more, especially Golden Compass, which has the most spectacular trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on the novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared in cinemas this week, with little more than a squeak. I have not seen the previous views for him, only a couple of spots. Critical reaction is a genus l. I would not even see it, if not for the fact that I have to wait on the other, to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing interesting was opened this weekend. Well, if you'll excuse the terrible pun, the stars were aligned correctly, because I went to the Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot is very simple line of your fantasy quests (the hero puts in search of a fallen star) is filled with obstacles. But this basic outline, the story of a lively and creative. It just tends to be a lot of fun, and charming little novel. And it works great. There has been a lot of great movies this summer, but none of them was not nearly as much fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told well, and almost completely coherent. This is not a masterpiece, but it can certainly hold the same land, something like The Princess Bride (although I do not like it quite as well as before the movie). it was really fun to be here if you're a fan of the genre.
