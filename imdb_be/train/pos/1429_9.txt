I loved how to make the land. His picture is incredible, editing it should be an interesting challenge and the voice of Patrick Stewart more perfect. Besides his music and sound editing you can watch EARTH deep experience that you will not want to miss. You really are on your way to where you probably will never, never end up on their own. <br /> <br /> And though, at first, I was very surprised the audience laughter, as we can see animals in their daily struggle for survival, I could not help but laugh myself sometimes. Nature just seems too big to understand <br /> <br /> But, instead of having to laugh, I walked out of the cinema with a deep question :. Â«Howcome 200 years of the industrial revolution can destroy the natural systems that have been here for thousands of years? "<br /> <br /> With this question in mind, you will understand how I felt somewhat bitter and helpless after watching the ground. I felt the urgent need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle to undo changes we went through the last century, and to stop global warming right away (all that without being an activist NGOs at all!) ... <br /> <br /> so, I immediately visited the site listed at the end of the movie to see, I could do to save our planet -still- fantastic (and polar bear), with its depressing fate ... (www.loveea rth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed not to find any direct answers to my questions there. However, it was very interesting to learn more about the film and his crew fight took place. <br /> < br /> I hope that the reduction of my energy use will do. I do not know how else to shorten the distance of polar bears have to swim to reach the ground, before they sink or animal attack, which they can not be beat in his devastated state. .. <br /> <br /> it is inspiring the movie, but I did not leave the movie feeling very happy.
