I just remember this show, not much, but I thought that it was great! My older brother, reminded me of the show recently, and I saw an advertisement for the D.V.D set out. Network again screwed in to pull it out of the air so that they could, even in this place? He was supposed to go at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? I sometimes think that network executives think they are "gods" of the entertainment world. But they are wrong guess, and flat out miss the good location the show from time to time. Let them say that they are much more than the failure of the "hits". It was one of the poor decisions, carved out of the lineup. Anyway, I get it for my collection.
