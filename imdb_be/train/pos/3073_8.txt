This is the kind of movie Hollywood should do more. A lot of extravagant props, no pursuit, no clever one-liners. Just people, the experiences of people. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy plays the unlikely killer who works for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is a dutiful son, Sutherland is a domineering father. Son wants to go out of business, his father would not let. Macy loves his son, played beautifully by David Dorfman ( «The Ring»). He also begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he met in the reception office of his psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting comparison of the characters and the film is behind the reluctant assassin as he balances the needs of his own with his family interests. There are many touching scenes, especially between Mace and his little boy. And, as one would expect in a film with William H. Macy in it, there is a bit of humor too. <br /> <br /> Great job all around, the actors and the director. It's nice to know that they can make a good movie in Hollywood on a small budget.
