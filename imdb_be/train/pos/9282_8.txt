In Iran, women are not allowed to football matches. Officially, it's because they need to be freed from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But, of course, we are talking about sex discrimination. Women are a lower form of human beings. <br /> <br /> Some brave girl against it and try to get to the stadium, using different tricks. They are caught by soldiers and keep its kind cage until the police come and take them away. <br /> <br /> Despite the insane situation, this is a film with a lot of humor. It is also nice to see how people always find different ways to deal with depression. You'll get touched at the same time as you have a lot of laughs. Good job of director Jafar Panahi. This is largely heroic comedy.
