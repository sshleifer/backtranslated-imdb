Live <br /> <br /> live is very interesting SCI-FI movie from Japan. I noticed that a lot of disappointed movies geeks who love Versus debut film of the director or his third film Azumi. I have heard that they are the blood-drenched swords and movies with zombies and all sorts of goodies. To be honest, I went to the video store to get Versus, but I am very good with the living. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the beginning to the end of the wall to the action of the walls, the living is not your choice. There is a lot of action, but it comes as a smack for an hour character building initiative. Personally, I think it is well done and worth. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the plot silly, as with many fighters SCI-Fi, and I think the subtitles using the term foreign objects could replace the parasite to great effect. This film is hard, when it should be so weak heart does not apply. <br /> <br /> They held the budget down for the most part of the retaining all the action in one underground construction (taking the signal from the cube), but the film does not suffer because of it. Another bonus for this film is intense gothic, which are made with great artistic flair and consistency largely Memories sleep. <br /> <br /> Rent it!
