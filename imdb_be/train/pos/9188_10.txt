It's too bad, many people do not realize this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But do not worry! bad attribute this to you too :) <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into 2 parts. <br /> <br /> The first part of Tony's "Dream" in his coma. The second part is what happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Now, what people do not realize that dream, Tony is more than just a dream. in this episode of the ITS of his preparation for his death. It loses its own identity, and in the end even forgets himself, so he breaks all of its bindings to this world. You will notice that I say, a doctor at the scene where Tony says that he lost his briefcase containing the "life." They manufacturers really have done an excellent job of interpretation they own thoughts, what happens when you die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode of the unique things with great spiritual meaning. <br /> <br /> Like every episode of The Sopranos actor and filming are excellent. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not understand, was that part where the monks. I will look again until I get it. <br /> <br /> In any case, this episode really touched me, and I do not think anyone else can do a better idea of ​​what is happening in almost death experience. <br /> <br /> 10/10 without a doubt.
