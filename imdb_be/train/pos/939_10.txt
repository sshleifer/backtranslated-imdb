Well, there are tons of reviews here that I can possibly add? <br /> <br /> I'm going to try anyway. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is my favorite Scrooge because of all. Sets of open space, the costumes are so beautiful and precise. Sweet music. The supporting cast is very well done. One of my favorite is the narrator and a nephew, played by Roger Rees. His understated sincerity touching his voice sound of Christmas to me. David Warner is also quite plausible Bob Cratchit. Its a hard life, but he remains positive and worthy. <br /> <br /> The best part of course- George C. Scott as Scrooge. Some say that the image is too rough. I could not disagree more. His exchanges at the beginning while the cold or hard, was not out of character. He was terribly disappointed people, the heart hardened vicissitudes of life and his own thirst for wealth. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, it is obvious that it is not all rude. Here we see that there is hope for him. If he would have completely disappeared, his partner, Marley never came for him in the first place. And in the end, we are none of us in the past in the hope. I think it's a huge part of what Dickens was trying to say. If Scrooge looks at his dancing to his employer with Belle, do you see him smile sadly, as he says Bell in his memoirs that he will go through life "with a smile on his face." Clive Donner was smart enough as a filmmaker to these points Ed. Sometimes they get left on the cutting room floor. <br /> <br /> And finally, its conversion so completely full of joy, it makes me cry tears of joy every time I see it. His forgiveness of his nephew Fred, so sincere, so touching, this spirit is not only Christmas, but humanity itself. The joy it brings to Fred, his wife is so obvious. A line that gets me every time, "God forgive me for all the time I wasted.Â» <br /> <br /> Bravi tutti!
