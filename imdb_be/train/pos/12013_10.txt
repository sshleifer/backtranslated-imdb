After reading the comments on this film and see the mixed reviews, I decided that I wanted to add my ten cents worth to say that I thought the film was excellent, not only in the visual beauty, writing, score, acting, and directing but put through the story of Joseph Smith and the roads he traveled on a life of hardship and persecution for their faith in God, how he felt and knew his way. I am very happy, in fact, had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man. I recommend everyone to see it, if the opportunity does not present itself, no matter what religious path, he or she can walk, it instills the only one with more determined to live the life that we have with these values ​​of love and forgiveness as The Savior taught us to do.
