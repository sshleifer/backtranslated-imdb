If the thought Arthur Askey twists the guts, do not worry, you can watch and enjoy Ghost Train, as well as the beautiful Back Room Boy, this is a film that is just too damn good to be sunk by a single performance, even in the lead actor. Personally, I like Asuka, maybe it's because I'm going into his world, and not unreasonably expecting him to come to the mine, which is a mistake too many people make. Ghost Train is so much atmospheric that you can not quite see it without being struck by the deep, dark world it transports you, it's a dive, so that a few cheap and cheerful flag indecisive could be in desperate early 40's and it's a movie, I would like to introduce a few people have ever seen only once. The cast are, without exception, extremely well, perhaps Linden Travers lays it on a bit thick, but against the background of a lonely train station during the war, she could barely play a crazy and do not stand out. Sad passing lovely Carole Lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible film, and now it's really in the past, but patiently waiting for us to hit the play button.
