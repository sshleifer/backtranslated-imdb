I really enjoyed the movie, but I did not realize that Little Richard had so many things going on in his life. First of all, I do not know, Lucille. There is very little (almost no) mention of the women who come in close contact with Little Richard. Even in their lives today there is no mention of women's involvement in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. In general, the film was great. I also did not want Leon plays the role of Little Richard, he's a good actor, but I feel that a part should be gone to another actor. Visually, it did not remind me of Little Richard. I was also not aware of the immorality that was a part of Little Richard. Of the movie, he was portrayed as a sex addict. Over time, he will be given today for consultation for its sexual compilation. He was a voyeur. I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone that has not seen the film, but there were a few things about the film that I feel should not have been part of a final push.
