It is hard to imagine this film is based on a true story, and how Christy managed to achieve a miracle so stirring the heart. Daniel Day-Lewis chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort it took to create the invalid character. Watching him on screen, shocking and exciting experience. <br /> <br /> The film is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story kind of colorful and intriguing. Christy does not neglect the normal, his life as a colorful and pleasant, although we can be aware of the loneliness and painful shackles of his eyes. <br /> <br /> One of the most important success factors Christi is the support of his mother, who seems to be more touching, and an unknown actress Brand Fricker also deserves her Oscar for this role, the fat man middle-aged woman uses her all that dream has come true Christi. So lucky Christy! And Hugh OKonor as well as young Christy, that performance for the baby! Christy love story is very well done, trustful. Christy wants to love and nothing can bring him right to love, his crush on the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (strange plays Fiona Shaw, I am deeply impressed by her role in the Harry Potter films, disgusting Aunt Petunia, so its appearance in this role actually outside of my mind, but in any case, every woman has her own youth ...) is a paranoid and insulting, I sympathize with him, love a double-edged sword, happiness and suffering are just next to each other. <br /> <br /> By the way, the works of Jim Sheridan's all good (in America BOXER, etc.), except GET RICH OR DIE Trying Â», God knows why he decided to send this shit! Indeed career damage for him, what a pity!
