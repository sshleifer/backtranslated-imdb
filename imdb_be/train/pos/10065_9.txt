It's a beautiful film, suitable for all but the smallest, although the availability for young people have been spoiled (at least in the press, that I've seen) using any unfortunate choice of English sub-titles! For most of the film is almost impossible to guess which time it is installed - no modern technology showed not even the ubiquitous Chinese bicycle, just a uniform, almost monochrome, everyday life, which are contrasted against the blinding reflection of Szechwan opera and fireworks. Even if a group of soldiers refers to their imminent departure to the theater of war, it can still be at any time during the last 150 years <br /> <br /> But then we briefly see the car -. The end of the 30's, early 40's style - and we understand that we are seeing in China is on the verge of tremendous upheaval, and that a large part of the world we see is going to be swept away by the cataclysm of World War 2 and the communist revolution. <br /> <br /> What makes the desire to adhere to the central character of the old customs and traditions, all the more acute. <br /> <br /> But the film also raises issues which are of vital importance today, both in China and in other parts of the world: inequality between boys and girls, men and women; trade, for a variety of purposes in young children; corruption in society; injustice; . The importance of friendship <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm reading too much into the film; but I do not think so! I also think it is a scandal that the films of this caliber often do not get in the United Kingdom, while the slag is passed as the quality of the material. <br /> <br /> But do not get me started that ..
