_Les Acteurs_ is absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a hot cup of water, history of a conspiracy against the actors, the story of the aging actor whose career slowly less active than before, but a stunning tribute to French actors and their movies. <br /> <br /> with the support of a solid reflection on cinema and acting (the fourth wall, hidden cameras, to play or not to play), the story of this film, in which most of them are well-known actors play their own role (not to be confused with the living their lives in front of the camera - the film is not a voyeur) is rather vague, and stands as an actor in the series of episodes that make the film very funny. As Dussollier is a film and leaves Balasko play a role (a great actress, she is fun to serious, especially as Dussolier, she bitches about themselves), as well as the actors working in each other on the street, ask for autographs, and fights and gossip happening we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which one (or more) game. <br /> <br /> In fact, for those who do not know the actors (most of them, at least in their 50s), or does not know French cinema, this film has little interest, so most of the links will be missed, but it will still offer good trail display on aging, acts on the social life ...
