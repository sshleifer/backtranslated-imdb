I was hoping it would be good as a fan of James Bond, and Dalton, although this was not his well-deserved 'third way communication ", it was a laugh. Belushi brought good humor in his pieces and Dalton hammed it up nicely, but probably not enough. part of it was very much camped up version of Jack Nicholson in a few good men. another Brit in it was a bit shocking, but Overal it was a laugh.
