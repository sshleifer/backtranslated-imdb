I saw «The Grudge» yesterday and wow ... I was really scared, a good thing. I love horror movies, and I really liked this one. There were so many «surprise'-scenes (which the English word?) That will make you jump in your place. Though, too much shouting from the hall made it difficult not to laugh. I think that the most terrible scene was ... on the bus, if the person read on the screen, or when walking Yoko no chin. Make-up is also very good. Sometimes you can actually see it was there, but it was another to add a quaint view of the stage. The boy was very good indeed, so cute without makeup and so terribly frightening to him next. The next time, when I hear the crackle I probably feel pretty scary ...
