I really do not know what people are against this film, but it's definitely one of my favorites. This is not a preachy, it is not a moral anchor, it should not be controversial. It's just God. Any possible nya God, regardless of religion. And it is really funny. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter usually lingered on the bright side of the news, desperate to prove to yourself (more or less myself) that it can be serious and do a good job in the work to anchor . This CD is that slow controlled his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) away. If the final straws are made, he will soon do not laugh, but to shout in the face of a God who, in turn, gives Bruce his powers. Bruce then makes his life better for himself until he guilted in helping others, where it then goes on to miss the point of his powers. Meanwhile, his constant anxiety about his own life makes it more selfish, leaving their relationship in hazardous locations. <br /> <br /> Well, that was kind of long. But, as the plot, it works well. Fashion, step by step, in which we meet the challenges the existence of God is much better than clustering their problems together and be able to hide well enough. <br /> <br /> As you probably know hear about this movie in the first place, pitch-perfect acting Cary is in the nature (which, fortunately, is his), and also controls and gives the atmosphere in the film scene by scene. whether they admit it or not, the role has been written or rewritten exclusively for Curry. Without it, the humor will transform the apartment, and the humor half performance. And humor is very good in the first place. But without Curry, it will be a kind of feel as a great imitator of life. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston is a great, and, no matter what some may say, Nia does not act as a single cause for the third act. At least you do not think that when you see it. It gives the heart work and makes you forget that you are watching a movie, she and Carrey feel very much like a real couple. <br /> <br /> The film feels ggooooodd (see the movie to understand), has a very good feeling, solves this idea properly and better than expected, and in general should never have called slapped together just to save the car 'career Curry (which was not Goin' anywhere.).
