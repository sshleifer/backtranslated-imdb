«Read My Lips» tells about the amazing symbiosis that develops between the plain, socially defective female office worker (DEVOS) and its workplace student crude EXCON (Casel). As the film elaborates on this unlikely duo until their identities are involved in effigy merger of minds, each of which use the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome. Good stuff for those who managed to sign films with strong undercurrents psychodramatic. In French with easy to read subtitles, and a good translation. (B +)
