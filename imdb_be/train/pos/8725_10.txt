I loved Antz, but loved "Life errors." Animation, which was put into it paid off. I'm definitely going to get it on DVD. By the way, Disney should make a widescreen version of the movie on the tape. (I've heard talk about a heavy all characters on the screen in a standard video format). Most of them will agree that the end credits were funny! I have seen only one of the two sets, but I can not Vata to see another!
