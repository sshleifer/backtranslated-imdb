I saw it as a kid in the late eighties, and I must say that the Galaxy Express is one of those films that stick in your mind for a long time. If you've never understood the appeal of anime, showing this movie could be your golden ticket Otaku-city. <br /> <br /> The history of how subtle and poetic, like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. Cell animation, while a few traditional, has a striking style that reflects a lot of talent bursting Leiji Matsumoto for character design and visual storytelling. <br /> <br /> This is one of those unique children's films such as Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and The Wizard of Oz, which is completely beyond the scope of "family entertainment" status and serves as the movie classics on their own terms. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film.
