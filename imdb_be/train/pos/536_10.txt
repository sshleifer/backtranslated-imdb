Few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later, still remain exciting as this one. Technological progress is not of this classic love story. Special effects are used other than for the 1946 movie. Action is excellent. David Niven, Kim Hunter, and especially Roger Livesey do an excellent job. The use of black-and-white / color adds to the creative nature of the film. He has not been seen on TV for 20 years, so few people are not even aware of its existence. This is my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hoping for a DVD release of the film for many years, in itself, "The question of life and death."
