Torrent The film was the first and last to Greta Garbo. It was her first American film made at the MGM, the only studio in the United States that she had ever run. That was the last time someone was declared over her in the credits, that being its leading man her Ricardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> Torrent is based on the popular Spanish writer Blasco Ibáñez in Entre Naranjos. This applies to a pair of mismatched lovers, Garbo and Cortez, which is not entirely can come together, mainly because of the machinations of his mother in March Cortese Mattox. <br /> <br /> Mattox wicked woman who has a lot of ideas about who should marry her son. Remember, this is Spain and such marriages were arranged yet even in those days, quite legitimate. Mattox has Gertrude Olmstead as how nevestki-, it is a product of Mack Swain people rich in pig production. Swain has several comic moments with his tender care of the pigs before they grow into large old pigs to be killed. <br /> <br /> Blasco Ibanez had previous Science Four rider Revelation and blood and sand previously removed from Rudolf Valentine in the lead. It might be interesting if Valentine did so with Garbo, but he could have for the film industry, when it was made. In any case, one of Valentina Wannabes Ricardo Cortez fills with male role. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons, Valentino, perhaps, I did not want to see this movie, because it is clear that the main character is the Garbo, unlike the other two works mentioned above, when it becomes dirt Cortez who does what Mattox and her "adviser" banker Tully Marshall to tell her that she leaves Spain and sent to France, where she becomes a big opera star. And is quite scandalous life there. <br /> <br /> When it returns to Spain and is trying to rekindle things, Mattox even more outraged. It has a political career in the mind of her son. Cortez is now working for the Spanish Parliament, which oddly enough is called Cortes. <br /> <br /> The name refers to the flooding and platinum violation resulting in all kinds of devastation in the countryside. Cortes actually torrent safely in the boat, trying to save the Garbo of harm's way. When they get together, they have a tough frank conversation, brutality based on Garbo. <br /> <br /> special effects here are primitive, although they seem to now are very specific to their time. They are very similar to the shots used in the Twentieth Century Fox rains that came out in 1939 and won an Oscar for special effects. Unfortunately, Torrent, he went one year before Oscar made his debut. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give any terminations to the side, so you'll have to see the movie to find out when Cortez and Garbo come together in the end. Garbo rightly won rave reviews for his role in an age when the exaggerated gestures were the norm in the silent screen action, it was surprisingly thin in her roles. Thus, it would be the rest of his career, it was the perfect person for the close-ups. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo will continue to do much better work than Torrent, this film is a fitting her debut on the US big screen and holds up very well to today's audience.
