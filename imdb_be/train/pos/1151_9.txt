"The big foam" is one of the best but least well-remembered sitcoms of the 1990s. The film revolves around different camera drama is taking place behind the scenes of the production of cheap daytime soap opera. The first of the various merits of the film is impressive is fantastic A-list actors. "The big foam" features some of the greatest actors and actresses, this is the era. <br /> <br /> The film is superbly led by Sally Field as neurotic aging actress Celeste Talbert (She famously throws a tantrum if you put in a suit that makes her look like a "Gloria F * CKING Swanson!"). Her supporting cast reads like a work of WHO in the 90-Movie Greats! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Naji all elevate the film greatly. Goldberg predictably excellent, while Downey Jr. Hatcher and performances hinted at a preference comedy they later achieve. <br /> <br /> In terms of writing the film is excellent. There is a very modern edge to the script that goes astray in a beautifully quirky several times. There are also a few gag, which is far ahead of its time. In a sense, the film is reminiscent of Mel Brooks at his best and often reminded this reviewer «High Anxiety» (1977). Much of the humor of the film depends on the fact that it is often destroyed, but quite accurately, presenting daytime TV and neurotic and ambitious actors. For example, additional casting session with the participation of exploiting the executive plays Carrie Fisher, at the same time cheerful and honest. <br /> <br /> «Large foam" is, for my money, one of the best comedies of Hollywood, made during the 1990s. It's a great script and cast A-Class make it a must-see. It's hard not to love this the film after he made you laugh for 90 minutes.
