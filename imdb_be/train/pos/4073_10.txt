Have you ever wished that you could avoid your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own, one of your closest friends at your side, facing all kinds of dangers and villains, and clues secrets of the lost civilization, which is just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets? Even if you are not quite so much fantasy lover, have you ever wished you could just experience what it's like to be a kid again, and there is no care in the world, just a couple of hours? <br /> <br /> This is what Miyazaki's "Laputa Castle in heaven" is all about. Paz, a young, but very brave and ambitious engineer who lives in suburban life in a mining town, until one day, a girl named Sita falls from the sky like an angel and takes him on his way to a place far beyond the clouds, while all the time they have the pirates and the troops in hot pursuit of them. Simply put, it's just an incredible adventure that every child dreams of one point or another, and I can not help but feel that my worries melt away every time I see him. <br /> <br /> As it is one of the oldest works of Miyazaki and take up much space in the ordinary world, the film is not as visually spectacular or deep into his storyline is Gone, Howl's Moving Castle Howl, or even Princess Mononoke. Nevertheless, I believe that it is difficult to say that any of these films is superior compared to the other, because all three of these films, at some point or another, mysterious to the point of being enigmatic, if not confusing, especially for the little ones . viewers <br /> <br /> «Castle in the Sky", on the other hand, does not try so much to be an allegory of any kind, and it is not a coming-of-age story; instead it is quite possible one of the best images in the mind of the child I have ever seen. Moreover, this work is beautiful, but the use of perspective from the eyes of children is simply amazing; Is this the pan up with "camera" to see the huge trees and a cloud over his head, and an incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, I just can not help but feel like I there is a slot and the screen, just a kid, in another world, far away from reality. <br /> <br /> Even the children do not have a complicated relationship, which implies the need for hope as the Ashitaka / San - or Chihiro ~ d / Hak; Sita is the angel of the groove, having literally fell into his life from the sky one day, absolutely perfect person for it from the outset. In the course of the film, more and more of the true spirit of childhood adventure to go through them kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. They are not only a great reminder of who I used to be, but they were punished friendship never waned throughout the film only gets stronger all the way to the last frame. For this reason, I fell in love with the two of them more than any other pair of Miyazaki. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "Castle in the Sky" this film is easily accessible because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer can be, you'll be sure to find his grave here. The mystery, thriller, drama, comedy, suspense, science fiction, romance, even some Western ... it's all here, just about everything, people go to the movies for (except, perhaps, the horror). This is why I can certainly recommend it as a first Miyazaki film; it is ideal for those who do not have any expectations from the already incredible otherworldly viewed some of his later works. <br /> <br /> Even the ending song of the film, when translated into English, conveys a sense of longing for the discovery of a lost civilization, and some of the partner of the soul, which could not be found in our worldly life. "The reason I long for many lights is that you are one of them ... the Earth rotates, carrying you, bringing us both, that are sure to meet." Miyazaki has always provided a poetic lyrics to the song end of lush scores Joe Hiasashi, but it's the only one I saw it as a touching song about love and inspires a dream. I found myself near tears just listening to it. <br /> <br /> «Castle in the Sky", may not be the most advanced, effective, or the meaning of the work of Miyazaki, but it's absolutely perfect for what it really should be: real vision of children's fantasy, and great escape from reality for all adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of fantasy they had when they were just careless young children. Sit back, relax, and enjoy it for what it is.
