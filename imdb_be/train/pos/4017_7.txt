This is a very memorable spaghetti westerns. It has a great story, interesting characters, and some very good performances, especially by Rosalba Neri. Her role as an evil thief in the film is really a classic. She steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even if she does not speak. Her performance is very plausible. She manages to be quite fascinating without being overly (not that there's nothing wrong with being over the top). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this film too. <br /> <br /> Music excellent, and the song is the kind that will play in your head constantly for days after watching the movie, or you want it or not. There are some parts which are very funny. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of a parrot. There's also a lot of spot-gun game, which is very well done. <br /> <br /> I would probably give this movie 8 or 9 stars if it were not for two things. The first being a stupid bar room brawl, which occurs in about 25 minutes in the film. This is one of the most ridiculous-looking fights I've ever seen in a movie. This is very bad choreographer, and more like a dance number with bad musical than any real combat. One would be able to ignore it, if it was a comedy of Terence Hill / Bud Spencer, but it is more serious West, and the fight really need to be more realistic. Another thing that annoys me about this film was the cowardly Mexican sidekick in Yuma. I believe that he had to be comic or something, but the character was just stupid and unnecessary in a film like this, and it was not fun. All I can say is, where Tuco, when he misses? <br /> <br /> All that having been said, let me assure everyone who reads it that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western, despite the faults of which I spoke, and all fans of the genre need see this movie.
