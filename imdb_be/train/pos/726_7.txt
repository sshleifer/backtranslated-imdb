Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal - an evil mistress Togar (Mary Ravens). It intends to ban rock and roll all together. She butts head with Riff Randall (P.J. sole), who loves the Ramones. The head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can not connect to any girl - do not understand, my dear Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) in love with him <br /> <br /> For a moment, midnight. cinema. It was raised in total output and almost immediately bombed - but at midnight this movie was a huge success and went on to play throughout the 1980s. I remember visiting more than a few of those when I was in college - it was like a holiday! People sang along with songs, laughing deafeningly every joke and generally just have fun. <br /> <br /> Seeing it now, as an adult, I can not imagine why I loved it so much. Scenario juvenile and full groaners, I could not believe what I heard. Symbols change randomly, and the film is going to jump all over. It saves some really funny lines and excellent performance soles and Ravens (who really enjoyed). In addition, each full of energy and play their roles WAY over the top (as they should). As for the Ramones ... I've never been a fan. I do like the name of the melody, but the rest of the song never caught me. If you are fan of the Ramones, you could give it a higher rating. <br /> <br /> Spoiler !!!! This is mainly for children (she has a PG rating), who probably find it silly, but fun. In particular, I think that they wanted to end when high school was blown up! Spoiler END !!!! <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood for a movie with a silly northern 1980s you could have it. Otherwise, stay away. I give it a 7.
