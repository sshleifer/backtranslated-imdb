There are a few movies that appear to provide enterntainment, as well as realism. If you've ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern warfare, look at this. <br /> <br /> I just loved the scene where hundreds of soldiers are shooting in the jungle, no one is quite sure where came that shot? <br /> <br /> And they cut one scene to Saving Private Ryan, so it must have some merit in the scene. <br /> <br />
