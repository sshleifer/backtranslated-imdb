Scott Henderson, an engineer who uses Carol Richman, his assistant, makes a point to call it "Kansas" when he speaks to her. This shows us that Carol, effectively plays Ella Raines, is supposed to be a baby in the woods as far as Manhattan 40s was concerned. Only a woman, this city, will follow the shadow bartender to separate elevated subway. Even then, only the naive girl could hold such an adventure. <br /> <br /> Siodmak directed this film noir very well. It shows precisely determine infusing history with a lot of raw sex, which was surprising for those days. How else can you justify that as a drummer in the orchestra music, which Scott takes a mysterious woman with an unusual hat, makes a pass to an open house on a date? Drummer playing with high voltage Elisha Cook Jr. does not hide his desire for all of the ladies, who were sitting in the front row of the musical, in which he plays. It was obvious by this invitation, the first in the "ghost woman" story, Fay Helm; Then, Cliff drummer, insinuates himself very openly Ella Raines, who goes to the theater disguised as a mystery lady took her boss initially. <br /> <br /> This is a film that will hook any viewer from the beginning. There are things that can not be explained in it, but it keeps your interest throughout. The killers did not show to an end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines and his expressive eyes were underestimated actress. She is holding her own against the much more experienced actors. Franchot tons, a stage actor in New York, working in Hollywood, is not found in this environment, the fame he deserves. It is effective as the best friend of the accused person. On the other hand, Alan Curtis, comes across as a man who, when framed, accepts his fate and preserved only the survivability of a woman who secretly loves him. Thomas Gomez as Inspector Burgess, is an asset to the film, as a detective, who has questioned the police caught the man who committed the crime. <br /> <br /> This film will not disappoint.
