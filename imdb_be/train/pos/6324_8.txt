These guys are nothing but suspicious! They have a whole bunch of pretty freaks who want to see you get away with it, but they are so unfortunate that there is very little chance that.No one better than William Mays on drawing a man with a big heart, but down on his luck.This probably , its best level since Fargo.Sam Rockwell played Meathead boxer to perfection, and the rest of the gang were equally well also.Luis Guzman brought great comic like Cosimo, and George Clooney stole every scene of his cameo role.The robbery scene at the end was absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> direction is also spot on for Russo brothers.There was, of course, the Coen brothers have for the entire film, and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers.They have a long way to match Coen but it's a great start, and I was looking forward to his next celluloid outing. .......
