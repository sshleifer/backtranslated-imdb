This film shows the peoples in the middle of the hottest 2 days in Austria. It shows people humiliate other nations and hard for other peoples. This shows the inability of people to communicate or interact with others. <br /> <br /> At the screening I attended people left in the middle, because they could no longer watch a movie. And rightly so. Because the film is not so and just one look. It has a very depressing message and there is not any moment of mercy in the film. This is a very hard film, but not for everyone. You can not talk in terms of the pleasure of this film. He grabs you in the throat and never let go, and in the end you just feel breathless due to its intensity. <br /> <br /> I can not "recommend" or "not recommended" this film. You have to make up your own mind based on what I said earlier. Just be aware that this is no ordinary film, and it's not for everyone.
