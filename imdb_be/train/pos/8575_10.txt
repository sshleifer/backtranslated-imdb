This is a movie that I can watch over and over again and never ever get tired of it, it has a lot to laugh, weapons, action, crime ,, good ships, and a decent plot, with the top, Donald Sutherland in a rather comic role as Assasain . Tion Carerra looks as hot as it has ever done, and can do the same, Thomas Ian Griffin large in this case, as the protagonist of "Max" and the DEA agent Diana is an FBI agent, played by John Lithgow and Carerra with Fraser on TV, games ,, bad guy "Livingston". The plot centers around Max and Diana Livingston tries to capture as they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money to the relevant agencies, to throw into the mix in Assassain Sutherland, who largely has all the good ships, this crime caper , is an ordinary love story ,, but played quite differently than you might think at Carerra and Griffith. You also have the Russian mafia, Italian mafia and Chineese Mafia is involved in the film was shot ,, ,, in Boston where you have great pictures, and local residents ,, big picture and music in this film, this film is just the epitome of comedy crime ,, it has everything that you could only dream of. Check the toilet Sutherland in a particular scene ,, very unusual. this film is a riot and make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me.
