Bill Paxton stars in and directs this highly original film. Watching the first time when I was at how good it was. Reviews that I heard were in order. As a result, I was expecting an average thriller in most .However due Paxtons excellent directing and acting film worth watching, especially if you are a horror movie fanatic.The film also helped plot twists do not continue to come until the closing credits. Movies horse storyline, I should say that this is a very original and, as I have ever seen. Well done young as 2 wires that perfectly convey the emotions when these intricate boys. I give this film 9/10, and I highly recommend everyone catches it.
