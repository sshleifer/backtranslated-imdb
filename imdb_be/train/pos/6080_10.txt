Othello, the classic Shakespearen story of love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember studying this history in high school, I actually found to be Othello, is probably my favorite Shakespeare story because, as it was exciting, the fact that Shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship, love and racism excellent. I mean, if you really examine the story, you could go in so many philosophies on why Othello mad with jealousy, in the blink of an eye. But later for my report, I also watched this version of Othello, and I must say it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth just grab this story so well, and realized that it was dark. <br /> <br /> Othello a great time soldiers in his city, he was loved by all, including the king. But when the king discovers that Othello slipped away with his daughter, Desdemona, King hated, but it excepts. Othello welcome in the city and makes it the best friend, the box office, his human side instead of him standing Othello. Because of his mad jealousy, he is out for revenge. Still pretending to be the best friend of Othello, he just mearly alludes to Othello that Desdemona is cheating on him with the cashier, he never says that they just make Othello believe that this is happening. Othello's mind and not pleasant or plans Desdemona and his box office more than happy to help him. <br /> <br /> Othello is an incredible story, I strongly recommend you read it. This is an incredible story that keeps you think after you read it. Othello film is also great and again recommend it, he took the story at all, and has a large type Tearjerker touch, or you can just be completely shocked by what is happening between Othello and Desdemona, how quickly he believes his true love betray him . This is a great movie, great acting, good sets and good direction, is that Shakespeare had in mind when he wrote this story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
