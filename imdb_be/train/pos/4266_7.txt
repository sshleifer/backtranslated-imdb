First I saw this half a lifetime ago in the black and white TV in the small village of Samoan and thought it was fun. Now, seeing him for the second time, so much later, I do not find it funny. I do not find anything funny anymore. But this witty and light-hearted comedy that moves quickly, without stumbling, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It is 1945 and the Yukon are 4F, who is dying to get into one of the armed forces. He rubs the lamp in a fight, he manages and gin seems to give him some suggestions. (Ho hum, right? But if the introduction of no more than okay, quite lively imagination.) MacMurray says the genie, he wants to be in the army. Poof and he walks along with Washington's soldiers in a particularly warm and inviting USO, where June Haver and Joan Leslie wearing a lot of lacy napkins or what they are, and lavender wigs. Washington sends MacMurray spy on the enemy - red-coated, German-gessentsevyh, not British. Hessian clamped in the Bierstube and sing a song very funny drinking raising advantages Vaterland «, where white wine winier / Rhinier Rhine and water / and bratwurst is juicier / yellow and yellowish hair and / Frauleins are jucier / and goose steps are goosier «. Something like that. The characterization of the incredible, as well as the Sig Ruman better. Preminger is suspicious and sinister at all Hessian. "You know, Heidelberg, wi are 241 to 1 against you - but do not be afraid of vi.» <br /> <br /> I can not too long, these fantasies, but they are all pretty funny, so the lyrics. If he wants to, he was in the Navy, MacMurray winds with Columbus and fantasy is presented as a grand opera. "Know ye not that the voyage to the west meant / terribly expensive investment? / And who do you think provides the tools / but Isabella, queen of the queen. " If they sight the new world, one notices that it looks cool. "I do not care what it looks like," mutters Columbus "but this place will be called Columbusland». <br /> <br /> Anyway, things finally straightened up, though the gin still pretty drunk, and MacMurray winds in the Marine Corps on the right girl. <br /> <br /> I've made it sound too cute, maybe, but it's cute. Children will enjoy the clouds of smoke and magic and stereotyped love story. Adults will enjoy the more complex elements of the story (which Hessian?) If they do not happen to be college graduates, and in this case, they might want to stick tricks and say, "Wow! Excellent! "
