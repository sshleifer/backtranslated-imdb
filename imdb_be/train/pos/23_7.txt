OK, so the music was written poorly and generally bad singing (although Walken and Marner, in particular Walken, sounded pretty good). And so they broke the fourth wall at the end, with the king and the princes are singing about the "battle" with the man-eater, and to praise the efforts of Puss in Boots, when they have the right not even know about it. <, Br /> <br /> Who cares? It Christopher Walken Freakin ', making a film based on the fairy tale, and he sings and dances. His acting style suited the role very well devious, mischievous cat, who seems to get his master in deeper and deeper trouble, but to actually have a plan, he thought about seven or eight moves ahead. And if you ever see Walken in any of his criminal role, you know * * eater bitten solid dust in the end, when Walken got it into his trap. <br /> <br /> A fun movie and a must-see for anyone who enjoys a unique style of Christopher Walken.
