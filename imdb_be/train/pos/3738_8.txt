Tigerland / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> According to Blake French: <br /> <br /> Over the years, the audience saw and understood war films with every point you can see and once the producers and writers are always coming up with new and innovative methods for drawing different soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ( "8mmy," "A Time to Kill"), easily one of the risk of directors currently working, found similarities with the "thin red line" in the way of his new drama "Tigerland" steps in the individual soldier shoe. The film, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more courage and irony than "The Thin Red Line" or even "Saving Private Ryan." Although strongly influenced by the film slightly decrease due to the perversity of the material present is, of course, enlightens us on the new point of view of young men preparing for war. <br /> <br /> I would like to know, Joel Schumacher's experience with the army. Do people really are is not confused and cruel? I'm sure some of them, but the film sees his uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man by the name of Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), who rebel against the idea of ​​war. His face instantly counteracts with several other characters, who becomes his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis), and the second, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose temper often Flamed Bozz fueling tensions with the idea to go to war. War is depicted in this production are not found on the battlefield, but also in the training base in Louisiana through the camp instructions between views and fears of soldiers in training. This film is about the preparation for war, no more no less. It ends when the soldiers finally go to war, a kind of disappointment, as witness the characters in action to serve as a supurb bribery. <br /> <br /> Shot on location in about 28 days, using 16mm stock and a tiny budget, Joel Schumacher accurately reflects the sand, perversion, cruelty and relentless atmosphere, using a hand cinematography, unique lighting and direct sound methods. granular and released images of Schumacher to make the film feel like a documentary. This unusual style of filmmaking helps only a hard core of realism of the film, rather a graphic to use coarse language, perhaps a little too anxious. Waves of four-letter words to pound the audience, some are shocked by what they hear. Even the extreme amount of vulgar not conducts a dialogue with preferred as harrowing, however, and emotional. <br /> <br /> If anything, «Tigerland» gives us a little pleasure, as our soldiers are held for our country in the initial stages of the battle. Such courage it must take in order to enlist in the army during the war, knowing the difficulties and risks are taken. Such thought-provoking ideas made possible by the performance of pious young aspiring actors representing different students. This film is not for everyone, but one that young people need to look at yourself before enlisting in the army ... and adult viewers have to watch to appreciate the courage it takes to make such. <br /> <br />
