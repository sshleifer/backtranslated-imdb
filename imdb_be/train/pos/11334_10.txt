I would say that this film provides insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when the family divided by divorce or other natural disaster. I highly recommend this movie especially the father or the person wishing to have a family. <br /> <br /> I found the characters to be attractive and very responsive from a variety of measurements. <br /> <br /> terrible monster, though probably not terrible for most adults, has a very real hint that the hyperactive imagination of a child who is faced with the unknown horrors can create. <br /> <br /> I found the movie perfectly!
