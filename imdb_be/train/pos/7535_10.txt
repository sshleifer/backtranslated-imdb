700 Club gives great prospects for world events. Some of them described it as disingenuous or cheesy. I found the program to be informative and inspiring. It is natural for many to throw dirt on the program that has been so successful. There are very few shows that can indicate a 40 year track record of success in the world of television and the media in the 700 Club is one of them. Although Mr. Robertson may have been wrong to say that someone has to be killed, I wonder that so many people literally tripped over themselves to jump on the bandwagon of criticism. Of course, I said some stupid things in my life. I would, of course, willing to forgive Mr. Robertson, as it puts a great show.
