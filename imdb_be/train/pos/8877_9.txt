This story was probably one of the most powerful I have ever been in. John Singleton, of course, went above and beyond in the preparation of this educational masterpiece. Brilliant performances of the entire cast, but Epps and Rapaport turned into the best and most convincing of all the young career of the star. <br /> <br /> However, as a college student myself, many of the issues that affect Singleton had been taken to the extreme. In the sense that, while they are the problems faced by many college campuses, they are not presented in the form of a large, or in the open like this film will make you believe. In some cases, it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this kind can happen in reality. However, besides the fact that he was a little more dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me stunned, unable to speak, just think. One of the things from this picture I will remember forever, was a quote from the character of Laurence Fishburne in "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you can not see his strength." Brilliant, just brilliant.
