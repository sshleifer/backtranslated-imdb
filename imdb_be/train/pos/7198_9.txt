This is a really good movie, and one that I enjoyed watching a few times. Michael Caine strange, as always. Michael Caine got kind of reputation did not take any part in any movie, regardless of the quality or lack of the same, but he is doing a good turn in lead Sidney. From the outset, it is so well written. Who would have thought that Ira Levin, who wrote such horrible things, as the boys from Brazil and Rosemary's Baby might write something in this witty. Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how are you going to go wrong with a cast this good director Sidney Lumet <br /> <br /> I am very discreet to go. on, because if somebody to give away anything about this film would be a crime. Just watch it and love it.
