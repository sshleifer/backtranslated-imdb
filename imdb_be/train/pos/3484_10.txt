This is simply the best movie of all time! Unfortunately, Hollywood! I saw it in the early '70s, when he appeared on Bulgarian television, and I immediately fell in love with it (I was 14 at the time). 25 years later, I bought it on a video, and a few months ago, he finally appeared on DVD here in Bulgaria. I live with this film 35 years already, and so do all my friends and my family. My son was a teenager, when he saw her for the first time, and he loved her immediately, also (and this is the generation that grew up watching Hollywood movies almost exclusively, and not to speak or understand Russian at all!). What makes this masterpiece Danelia so special? It is difficult to say how it's hard to describe what a beauty ... But the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as it did the first time. I can not remember any other kind of movie, no matter how many millions is worth or how large cast was ... Introduction, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
