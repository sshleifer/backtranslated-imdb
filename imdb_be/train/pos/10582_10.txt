He sings. It has drama. It has comedy. It has a history. This is one of the greatest films ever ... period. If you can not enjoy this film, you must be either asleep or in some spiritual despair. In «Yankee Doodle Dandy» James Cagney sings and dances its way to an Academy Award; but in this film he is the best! This is James Cagney in his quisessential BEST! He quickly with jokes! He quickly his feet! This non-stop action. And song and dance scenes are classics, especially "Shanghai Lil.» And a great supporting cast; and the entire film is upbeat, fast moving, and exudes confidence. And despite the fact that this film was made over 70 years ago, it is still watchable, even today. And, of course, this film features Miss Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Zholson). It is the ideal partner for James Cagney ... and Dick Powell, too! If you like upbeat, fast paced film, with lots of singing and dancing, it is a movie to watch.
