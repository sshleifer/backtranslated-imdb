I have not read the novel, or something else Kurt Vonnegut, but now I'm going to start. It grabs you from the very first frame, and does not let go until the end credits will not start to grow. Taking you to places you do not expect, the plot of interest to all. Spot- walk, nothing lasts too long, and it does a perfect job of balancing between the unexpected turns and allows the viewer to handle what we have seen. It is well said and well thought out. I never watched the movie, I feel that I could compare it especially. This intense and exciting and funny and sad. Works perfectly, Nolte absolutely shines, Goodman once again proves that he does not have to go to laugh, and Lee and Arkin are mesmerizing. I could actually ... no role were treated to a less than stellar performance. Editing and cinematography are unusual, and all the visual effects are great, with a couple of memorable and bizarre of them. I'm going to go to the other movies directed by Keith Gordon, as well as two others, apparently associated with it, through the author. There is one scene of sexuality, and a lot of anxiety and anxiety in this content. I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it; I do not like it. 8/10
