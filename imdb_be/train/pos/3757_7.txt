As with a bunch of guys at school, we have to give this a thumbs up. Even the Grim Reaper made us smile. These two alien thing made me laugh, Bill and Ted were sillier still fascinating in the whole film. This is much better than the first. And yet, for some reason, I feel that he misses something. Something big. Something important. Made a better home and a friend. No, I would say that it is better villain. Using clones instead robots.I gave it 7 out of 10 of those two robotic doinks. <br /> <br /> Grim Ripper, do not worry, he does not Deathy kind of funny. When he fell from the sky I shared intestine. Splat, I'm not sure about these aliens. What, where are they? Scientists? No way.
