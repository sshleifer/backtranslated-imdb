Tech: Look. Something else <br /> <br /> This film was highly appreciated by Gene Siskel, but after watching I can not understand why. The film is definitely original and different. It even has an interesting dialogue times, some interesting points, and terrible "noir" feeling. But it's just not interested. Also, it does not make a lot of sense in the story, but especially by the nature of motivation. . I do not know anyone that behaves like the characters do <br /> <br /> This is a difficult film to take - I suggest you do not take the call.
