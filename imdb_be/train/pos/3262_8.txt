I do not think I would have liked more, although some things were alarming. I do not want to say that if you have not seen ... you have to find out for yourself. In any case, a movie can not miss with the puppy dog ​​eyes of Robert Downey Jr.? All-in-all, the story was quite advanced. Nothing seemed too rushed, like movies like this, as a rule. The characters were once able to, and there were a lot of funny scenes in it. The idea of ​​all-that the story is very well connected with each other, even though some aspects may be poor ... on opinion. But, as I said, it's hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
