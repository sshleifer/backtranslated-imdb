Tour DEFORCE! OK kid who plays Oliver toooooo a little sweet! Starting with the big cinematic, color, costumes and the most impressive performances of this must see movie. I have seen several adaptations of this great novel, but this one stands out above all and his musical to boot! This high-handed Fagan, never leaving his character to make a song. You never know when you like it or not, the same feeling I got in the book. In other versions, you hate it from start to finish. Bill Sykes .... if you read the book HES middle one, and so it is in this film. Oliver Reed was overbearing. His wife directed this masterpiece. I went and saw his last film, Gladiator, based on his many fine performances, not to see the headliners. Music fits the time and mood. Who will buy this wonderful movie? You must!
