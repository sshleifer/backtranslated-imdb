Given how banal these films, you need figure out what they were supposed to have fun doing it. The film focuses on the house, strangely containing whoever lives there. Residents were: author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair)!), Which receives pursues one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who gets a little too close to the statue of wax; John Reed (Christopher Lee), whose daughter wit facade seen; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), on the border getting a bit too much in the nature <br /> <br /> «The house that dripped blood" is really worth seeing (well, not like it. stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). In addition to just be careful, there may be some subtext: it can be called into question the issue of the real horror against horror suggest. As in «The Shining», we might ask whether the house / hotel some memory itself of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (as Paul's co-star) is hot hot hot! Around the time when it happened, she also starred in "Countess Dracula" and "The Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she - like Barbara Steele - will be known only as a scream queen, but mark my words: it's hot SCREAM QUEEN! I would like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele a major role in something. <br /> <br /> I think that the only strange scene (so to speak), where Denholm Elliot wearing a pink shirt and furry jacket. You read that right. What name is «Denholm» anyway? Oh, well. Very cool movie.
