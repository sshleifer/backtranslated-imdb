Buster absolutely shines in this episode, which is the only vehicle I saw at the end of a career that allowed him to make the physical (and quiet!) Comedy that made him famous. It's still a shock to hear his voice in the radio Gravelly sequence - his voice was the only thing I do not care how it comes Buster - but his ability to accept failure so far unparalleled. He even repeated some of the gags used in his earlier two of the machines for reeling Arbuckle. <br /> <br /> My deep gratitude Rod Serling for providing us with this episode, and that the full range of the genius Buster. He did not have a lot of time (one episode), to make it, but it is a touching tribute to Hollywood's greatest genius.
