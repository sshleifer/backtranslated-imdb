Hi all, I chess enthusiast from the age of about 6. I must, I absolutely obsessed with chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film. <br /> <br /> In this film, the central character reflects the real chess player called Bardelebno, who committed suicide in 1924, he is known for the game he was playing against Steinitz, where the perfect combination of playing Steinitz. Rather than resign, he simply walked out of the hall of the tournament, never to return. <br /> <br /> In the social absurdity of the central character, unfortunately, treat some of the more serious you sometimes get grandmasters in chess tournaments. Chess I believe this is a very big sacrifice, and sometimes you can end up unbalanced in other areas of life. A good example of this is the chess legend Bobby Fischer. Although a genius, he was also very worried about in many ways. <br /> <br /> The film portrayed the championship match of the World, as well as between the Italian grandmaster and Luzhin. The format of a knockout, which is actually a world governing body Fide is sometimes used as the format itself - going from 128 players only 2 in the final. But it was a group Knockout - which also reflects a realistic format, where the winners of each group play against each other <br /> <br /> In the position before the deposition makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself .. In fact, I made a YouTube video about it, for you to explore in detail the winning combination - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Regards Tryfon
