Wow. Um ... well ... wow! I guess I'll start with the plot. Betrothed woman (Lucy) enters the family her house is her husband (Mathurin) in France, where they expect the bishop to arrival or Cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church in order to marry them (in order to satisfy the will.) While waiting, young Lucy learns about the legend of the monster, who before roamed Grounds centuries. In bed that night, she begins to fantasize about the Beast and his rape turned consensual interview with the former mistress of the house. That's where the fun begins! The plot is really very thin (and seems to drag on for a long time in the middle click), but the filmmakers award (?) Those who hold it with the shocking and hilarious ending. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone. If you are looking for a great movie, look elsewhere. If you are looking for an unconventional film about bestiality (which almost throws a sympathetic look at an object), this film is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of this. Regardless of some actions horse-on-horse in the beginning, "business" rather cartoonish, IMO)
