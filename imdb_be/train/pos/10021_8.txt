This story is based on two pieces of Edgar Allen ( "The Fall of the House of Usher," "Dance of Death" (v)) is actually quite terrible from start to finish. This is similar to some of the old black-and-white of the people films are found in the old old house (for example, "the Cat and the canary», «the old Dark house», «Night of Fear" and so on). Boris Karloff plays a crazy inventor doll in natural size, who terrorize people. He dies at the beginning of the movie (or he?), and the residents of the house are exposed to a series of terrifying events. I will not go into the forge Nost, but it is definitely a must-see for lovers of old house dark secrets. <br /> <br /> Be careful with lots of popcorn and soda in a dark room. <, br /> <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
