I went to a small pre-screening of the film on July 19, not knowing any more than the names of some of the actors, and that it was a fantasy / adventure quest of some kind. <br /> <br /> The story line is really nothing else I've seen, and unique history, of course, understandable, and everything else that is currently or soon to theaters. Despite the fact that first impressions can give, it is not cheesy, corny, tacky, or funny, and actually very interesting and funny. The stream is well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged. Soundtrack, due to the lack of a better word, magical, and adds a lot to the film, and not just to fill the silence, as often happens in the movies or television. And although I could know what will happen in the points, I still could not bear to stop looking at the screen; As far as I know, no one left the theater throughout the film. <br /> <br /> May, one complaint is that it seems there is almost no marketing for this film, as well as brilliant as it is I can not figure out why.
