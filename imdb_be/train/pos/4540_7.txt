This movie stars Jay Leno as a cop in Detroit, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as the Tokyo police sent to Detroit to get the stolen car engine prototype. Japanese man went to Detroit, hoping to sell it and the nearest car company ran by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately for him the people who were supposed to negotiate the transaction killed him and took the prototype. Angry Jarryd Derek tries to distance himself from Phillip of Madras, who led the people. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has none of it and threatens Jarryd causing it to continue its cooperation. At the same time in the same landfill, where he was killed by a Japanese man, a friend of Tony Costas was killed by the same people. Tony watched each landfill. <br /> <br /> Tony goes in search of the murderer against his boss in order. Tony robbery while apparently killing should investigate the matter. While Tony is investigating the crime, which he held in the Japanese police and mistakingly he arrests him. In the end, they end up working together on the case. They do the odd couple, and there are some really funny parts and some ridiculous scenes such as Pat Morita, jumps and kicks right through the windshield of a moving car and kicked in the head Madras. But it was a pleasant buddy cop movie, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but it is nice as well, and Pat Morita as well. Nevertheless, they make for one of the most unlikely buddy cops duets in an action movie. If you like the buddy cops movies, cheesy 80's movies, or you want to see Jay Leno, as an actor, I recommend this film.
