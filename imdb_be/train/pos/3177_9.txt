Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There's nothing I do not like this movie. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot. Adam does a great job, not only the development of the main characters, but also minor characters. <br /> <br /> The Cross Eyed gives hope to every low budget movie there. That you do not have to spend much to create something worth watching. There is something everybody likes. If you have had a terrible roommate. If you ever took a dork in high school. If you are ever in a parking lot somewhere in town. if you have any sense of humor at all, you will love this film. This type of film that will be around for a long time, and finally once again rise to the surface as soon as Adam makes a name for himself. I look forward to future projects of Adam.
