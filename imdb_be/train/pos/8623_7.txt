King of death is not one of my favorite movie JÃ¶rg Buttgereit - but it's still an interesting film deals with suicide, and it causes and consequences. Those looking for a Gore-festival or operating style NEKROMANTIK Schramm or films are likely to be disappointed. King's death, certainly, "art-house" style of the film, so that those who are in need of a linear, understandable narratives do not apply ... <br /> <br /> The basic concept of the king's death is that there is a " episode "for each day of the week, which revolves around the strange chain letter, apparently, makes people commit suicide, interspersed with scenes slowly rotting corpses ... <br /> <br /> There are some very well made and thought provoking scenes in including man, to talk about "problems" with his wife, and a concert of the massacre (which, unfortunately, has lost non-cat oryya with its "power" to me, because I was too busy laughing at the sight SCORPIONS Double band on stage ...). But seriously - this sometimes beautiful (a scene depicting different corners of this huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the significance of this scene, and that the names of the flight of people who actually graduated from jumping off a bridge ...) sometimes confusing, sometimes silly (SHE WOLF SS plagiarism quite funny), sometimes harrowing (I found the scene a guy talking to a girl in a park near his wife is especially effective), a film that is more "experience", just fun, how many of these "artistic" films should be. However, I found the King's death, to be as strong as NEKROMANTIK or Schramm, and probably put it on a relatively even paid out Nekromantik 2 in terms of my personal "satisfaction level." Definitely worth a look for any Buttgereit or "art" film fan. If you dig this type of film - check subconscious cruelty - in my opinion, the best art house film / horror movies that I've seen. 7/10 for the King's death
