I was very surprised to read some of the comments to this work, to be honest. Some people are looking for the story ??? Well, if it's a video it released more than a decade ago, I was watching him, what it was: a collection of music videos. This is not a movie. This is not the plot, nor the central storyline. It is quite an art collection of mostly long-form videos, they are almost all or creatively done. Michael Jackson can be seen as a freak in these days, but, in the end, it was the man who gave us Thriller (considered by many the greatest music video of all time) and set trends with Billie Jean and Beat It. With Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who have collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some bright fascinating material including claymation, special effects, live performance footage, and even self-parody (sequence «Badder») , and for those who wonder what Joe Pesci did there, this video came out just a little, before he became a household name, and was one of his most memorable performances in the film. And, IMHO, I think, Smooth Criminal sequence (Choreography section) has something else Michael Jackson has made up to this point!
