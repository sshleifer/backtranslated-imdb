As a powerful and fascinating simple quality film production can be. This film tells a story with daily scenes that manage to revel touching hidden inside. It is true, as others have argued, like this movie really makes this clearly is lost in this Hollywood special effects, exaggerated emotionalism and above the upper climatic endings and forgot the essence of meaningful stories, told with simple realism. So much of what these characters go through are meant scenes and is not registered in a verbal dialogue. One aspect that I really enjoyed about the film was the contrast of the two brothers, one so very openly expressive in his childhood, and the other is completely stoic, but also can cause deep emotions. The older brother had to say little, as he usually did, it was all there, in the person of its indestructible! Beautiful cinematography, great action, great destination! Do not miss out!
