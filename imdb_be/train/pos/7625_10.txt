Although Kurt Russell and probably the closest person to see Elvis in show business, so many things were false in this film. First of all, the creators claimed Elvis opened his famous concerts at 69 after 9 years hault for movies, wearing a white jump suit made in 1972. In addition, they argued that he sang "burning love" which he first sang in 1972 and "the miracle of you," which he recorded the first in 1970. they also claim that he received his first guitar for Christmas when all Elvis fans know that he got it for his birthday. I know that all the films based on the past there is something false, but these things are so obvious to those who love Elvis.
