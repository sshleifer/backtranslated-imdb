Michael Jackson is not very popular in the United States over, but in Europe (especially in Germany), he still has a lot of fans. Many will say that this is a bad movie, and it :. He has nothing of the plot, it is full of clichés, Michael praises himself constantly <br /> <br /> But you can not expect the story or no-cliché like that movie! He is entertaining visual effects and the music is full. Smooth Criminal fragment - the greatest song ever, full moonwalks, group dance, and even the famous "Lava of Michael Jackson" - makes this film one of Jackson's masterpieces with even nice (and white ...) Michael Jackson! <br /> <br /> Required for Jackson fans, compulsory for music lovers, a mandatory act for dance fans. <br /> <br /> However, since I'm a fan of Manchester United, I must warn all Michael Jackson haters out there: Do not watch this movie, you would only make its growth hatred ...
