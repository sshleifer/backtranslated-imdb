It was the first movie I ever saw, and Ashley Judd in the first film of Victor Nunez 'that I have ever said, and the boy I'm glad I did. Her quiet tone, its relaxed pace, its realistic portrayal of a young woman just starting out in life, his excellent portrayal of the struggle she has to go through to make their mark in life, a decision that she makes based on real things, people she meets - nothing wrong with this film. This is as close to the movie magic as I've ever seen outside of the "Star Wars" films, and, given the fact that these films, it means that the film is commendable indeed. Actions, Mr. Nunez'writing, and Ashley Judds great easy to make sense of the history of this wonderful coming-of-age story and an interesting film.
