I happened to take this film from one without knowing anything about it, and he was an outstanding documentary on the journey to the ancient ship through the vast expanses of the ocean. Heyerdahl developed the theory that the ancient Incas in Peru was able to travel thousands of miles across the ocean in Polynesia, on the basis of some of the relics that are in both locations, some types of ancient ships, we know that they are available, ocean and wind analysis flow, and knowing that the Incas did, in fact, a trip to some indeterminate amount into the sea. <br /> <br /> in order to test their hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his team build a boat as close as it is possible that the ancient Incas were available, using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time, and set to Lima , the capital of Peru, to try to get to the Polynesian islands, about 5,000 miles. <br /> <br /> His theory, like so much about ancient history, it is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but their travel coverage provides strong support that he is right. The film is really little more than a story of footage taken during the 100+ day expedition, but this is a very detailed description of what it was like, and the trials and tribulations that they face. I often want to Academy Award-winning documentary films were easier to find, and it's one of more than 50 years ago, is still as interesting and informative as I'm sure it was when it was first released.
