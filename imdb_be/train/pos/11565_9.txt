SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is other people." In «The Odd Couple», Jack Lemmon and Matthau show how well it can be. Ungaro as Felix and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau, respectively, to create two good friends who have decided to live together. As the two begin to slowly grow more and more frustrated with each other, the laughter comes thick and fast, before Felix leaves, leaving Oscar modified and more purely individual. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon as Ungar absolutely delightful as neurotic, obsessed with cleaning divorced coping with life as a single person. Matthau unlike Lemmon character is as good as slobbish sports writer who just want to play poker to earn money for their children's allowances. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau is unusual in its individual parts, to some degree dependent on the great Neil Simon script, and at the same time, because they work well in a team. As the two friends, which are essentially different ways of life, although similar to the relationship with ex-wives and children, the two late, great actors create a partnership that is almost impossible to recover. So great in fact, that the world is crying so much something like that for two years before the death of Matthau and Lemmon to three years, the characters reunited in a subordinate further. This idea, while the following annoying Hollywood's obsession with sequels may have worked to some extent, but at the same time, he could never come close to duplicating the genius of the original film. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's not really possible to say anything else. With an amazing script Simon, filled with humor and laughter, the creators of this film were already hit. Casting Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix and Oscar Madison Ungaro, though, is the most important part of this film. "Odd Couple," with its traditional soundtrack (which even received a tribute in «The Simpsons»), it's a great script, and it is the genius of leading men, it is a tribute to the movies and the opportunity for history to remember.
