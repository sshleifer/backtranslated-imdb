I loved this movie. It was almost the same as the first (cabin on the lake), but instead of just killing women he kills people too. And the scene is much more interesting, 2 of my favorite scenes in the first place, when Stanley and Alison at the dance club, and he describes the last moments of Kimberly, before it is released into the water, and secondly, when Stanley visits Allison in his basement, right in front of them upside down in a set, when she kisses him. These scenes, for me, were very intense and riveting. I gave the film a rating of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the film adaptation was bad, I mean, there were times when you would have noticed there was nothing like it shot like a movie, like typically, a shot, you would not see a "live" camera shot, but then, very little, you will notice a shooting error. what went wrong ??
