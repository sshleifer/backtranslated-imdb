This film is another anthology horror. It's pretty good, but it could use a little more. I compare his "House of Horrors Dr. Terror", though this title is suitable. It has four stories all the more connected home. The first tale of a writer and his wife moved. It creates a killer for my last novel, and then he begins to see the killer walked into his house. This is one kind of predictable, but it is to throw a few turns at the end. The following story is a bit more unpredictable, and you really do not know where the hell is going on. This one features Peter Cushing was probably my favorite of the bunch. This guy buys a house, but it's not the house that occupies a central place, but rather strange Wax Museum. The third story begins quite good and features Christopher Lee. This one has it as a rather quaint dad who seems horrible to protect his daughter. The problem is that once you know what's going on in this story does not end quickly enough. He pulls a little, resulting in a very predictable output. Then, the final story comes to an actor purchasing a cloak of an odd little shop. Actor does get what he paid. Then there is a small story about the officer who had seen around, trying to figure out what happened to this actor, and then an explanation of why this happened. Although I am not very satisfied with the explanation, I do not think it actually explained the history of Cushing much at all. I think they need a little more back story for that. Overall though it was an interesting set of stories.
