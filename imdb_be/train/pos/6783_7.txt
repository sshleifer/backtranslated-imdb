If you like "Othello", you will love this film, as half of the film revolves around a stage play. <br /> <br /> The film has a great cast with Jose and Shelley Winters, as a woman in a life Solman while Edmond O'Brien plays enterprising press agent. <br /> <br /> pair of supporting players I particularly liked was Millard Mitchell as a grizzled reporter who finds the corner and Joe Sawyer 1940 Reply Drew Carey, who plays a cop on the case. <br /> <br /> Large raw moments in this one of noir realism around.
