Absorbs (although repetitive and rather didactic) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or upward, which attempts to make himself feel better, disrupting and suppressing those below you, it seems the only option. But even here, in this desolate wasteland of unfulfilled hopes and no future that does not work, and continuing to something or someone to console and share with, the simple act of charity, giving some reward, even if it just makes a gift tolerant reviving memories of the past. <br /> <br /> While there is little actual violence on the screen is sharp and tough film about the oppression of the small minded (political and personal), that does not make for light entertainment, it is clear that on the basis of the game, with a small cast, more wide more expansive attitude towards the overall social and political environment, may have helped the film to reach a wider audience.
