This man is none other than as a country. You really feel as if you have lived your life with him for all these tragic events, and cry along with his family in the end. He was so fascinated by his deeds, not just for ourselves but for those who survive him will not have to go through this miserable pain. I watch this video every time I have a bad or "down" day, and it always manages to make me see the big and bright side of life, as well as Johnny did, even with his unbearable pain. My only regret is not knowing about Jonny before when I visited England in 2 times in the course of his life, and would be able to say that I met him. Nice to know, of Jonny sits on his cloud, pain free! Rest in peace, dear Jonny. You deserve it!
