I love this movie. This is one of those that I can watch over and over again. He acted well a good cast that does not try too hard to be star-studded. <br /> <br /> Inside the newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet can be converted into a Americanized turd of a movie or a thriller. Or to completely kill the film. <br /> <br /> The film plays out as an Ealing comedy with an amazing feel-good factor in everything. <br /> <br /> It should be viewed from two old women and a box of corn only for the stage ... (no, this is not a spoiler!)
