This film documents a transformative experience for a group of young people, and the experience of watching it transforms itself to the viewer. Few films even aspire to that level of transcendence, and I can not imagine another movie - a documentary or drama - which reaches it. There's no other film in which I was laughing so much and cried so much. Yes, we are talking about MDDE and available travel; on those issues alone, it is worth undertaking, but it is more. It's about friendship. It is about life itself, about the life of every day that you are alive. And it's great fun, adventurous story. That's why God created the movie! See this movie !!!
