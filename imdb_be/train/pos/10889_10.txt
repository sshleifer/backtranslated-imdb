What with all the negative comments? After the movie I saw for the first time today, I can only say it was a good holiday comedy that will undoubtedly improve the day every lonely person. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck), may end up spending a vacation alone, I wanted to cry. You have to see the film if you want to know why. In addition, despite the fact I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after a while, if you ask me, they were real snobs. However, this film made me smile and feel good inside. Before we wrap this up, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell killed a pure holiday punch. Now, in conclusion, I would highly recommend this good comedy festival, which probably brighten the day of any lone person to any fan of Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate, who has not seen it.
