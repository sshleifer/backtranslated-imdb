I saw this movie with my family and it was great! This film is not just a documentary (which offers no more than cold facts) with long mono / -duologue-x and many diagrams ... Full "power" of the film comes from the spectacular film was shot under water, in the air or Arctic.With watch this film you can learn more about our planet than to simply read the book, it shows that we are embedded in a circular course of life. This film is not only for "environmental fanatics", although people who want to watch a good movie with a message should watch it. This film has taught me that we do not only live in the land ... and we live on the earth, and all the plants and animals grow and die with us.
