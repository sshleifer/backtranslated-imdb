This is a wonderful film that is so top that my wife, daughter, and I found her irresistible. The plot is just crazy, but the "ring of truth" in the world of soap operas in all its glaring improbability and impossibility. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the performances by Kevin Kline and Sally Field. I'm not better than anyone-Kline in THICKheaded game. really desperate need character Field of attention and approval - and its almost bipolar mood swings - played beautifully on the background of the famous field (sadly?) "Do you love me!" cried Oscar. People who can take over with such a large grain of salt is all too rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think that this is the only film where I do not feel impatient with Whoopi Goldberg characteristics; I thought that she was "spot on" in every note she hit. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elisabeth Shue were also first rate as well. Just a great film if you're in the mood to go along for the ride and laugh!
