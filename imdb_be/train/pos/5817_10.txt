If you want to remember MJ, is a good place to start. This film is a feature of sweet melodies, MJ, like a robot, and a crazy, messed up story. I remember a lot of the night, giving to this wonderful feature film in college, and thinking vertical awesomenes the one who decided to green light this funny piece. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of singing. Many dances. There is a lot of singing while dancing. MJ slays him as one would expect when it comes to this stuff. But there is much more to this film. There claymation. There are smooth children (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit, Michael Jackson has to fight in a dance off (obviously clay, too). There is a Joe Pesci, and (not clay). <br /> <br /> We love RIP-you Michael! It is a sad day for all of us.
