As Peckinpah made from Straw Dogs and Kubrick with A Clockwork Orange, directed by John Boorman provides an effective film about a violent person in getting rid of the possibly definitive horror film of the 1970s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox show four Atlanta businessmen who have decided to take a canoe trip down the wild Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia, before she killed in what Reynolds calls "a big, dead lake." < br /> <br /> But local mountaineers taking painfully obvious dim view of these "city boys" roam through their forest. And the next day, continuing down the river, Beatty and Voight are approached and raped (the infamous "screech" The sequence of the film) Two vicious highlanders (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward). Thus, what started out as nothing more than a lark through the Appalachian Mountains is now turned into a nightmare, in which our four main hero comes to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization, and what we think, barbarism. <, Br /> <br /> James Dickey adapted the script from his best-selling book, and the result is often gripping and disturbing shocker. Often known for his "scream!" And "Dueling Banjo" sequence, the release is also very impulse-beat tests with four leading men outstanding in their roles, and McKinney and Coward doing two most feared villains of all time. A must see film for those who are willing to take the risk.
