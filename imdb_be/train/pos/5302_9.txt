This film made me constantly entertained. Comparing this Serial Mom, Mr. Waters returned to his grittier side. It's not as polished. <br /> <br /> There is a dark side here. Message about how success and fame changes a person - .. But more importantly, it changes the people around you <br /> <br /> There is not a false moment in the film <br /> <br /> somewhat caricatured characters ... but I want to believe that this is what Mr. Waters is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting to see how Mr. Waters has evolved ... it really is his best work.
