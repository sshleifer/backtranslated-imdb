Well, a recent history of Star Trek was not good. The next generation has disappeared in his last few seasons, DS9 safely stay where nobody was before, and Voyager became very ill and has never lived up to its promises. So when they announced the new series of Star Trek, I did not have high expectations. And the first episode, Broken Bow, does have some problems. But overall it was a solid Trek stuff and good race. <br /> <br /> I'm going to get the nits out of the way first. Topic boring, and I do not expect to sit through it regularly, but it is something that a remote control for. What was really bad was absolutely free lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room. They have to cut this crap. <br /> <br /> However, the story was strong and moved together well. Symbols, although it is still new, it seems, well rounded, and are not always what one would expect. Vulcans are clearly quite different than before, with a slightly sinister theme. I especially liked the linguist, who is the first character of Star Trek, to be able to stand proud in the face of death, and we have to deal with their fears and phobias. They seemed to stay true to Trek lore, what has been a serious problem in the last series, although they have a long time to bring us things like shooting through the panels, the present invention is a technology that can fix everything, and inevitably many time travel story. Anyone want to start a pool, how long before the Borg show? <br /> <br /> In general, the series has a huge potential. They see the world with fresh eyes. We have the opportunity to learn how things got the way they were in the later series. As the Klingons go from simply an insult to the war? We met the Romulans? How could form a federation and who put the land free of charge. Why is the Prime Directive is so important? . When they decide these things, and not spit while traveling episodes, it will be an interesting series <br /> <br /> My favorite line: Zephram Cochran says "where no man has gone before" (not "no")
