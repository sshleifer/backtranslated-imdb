Perhaps the best film of Jackie Chan in the 1980's, and the one that put him on the map. The scale of this self-police drama seen from the opening and closing scenes, during which the squatters' village and shopping center demolished. There is obviously a difference between the original Chinese and English versions voiced, with many of the jokes are not able to make their way into the final. The latter also prevent the stars, that do not sound anything like their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing that dubbing is adjusted trial ?? while test in colonial Hong Kong was conducted in English, while in the original scene in Cantonese! <br /> <br /> However, pan style of fighting and martial arts choreography inject humor where possible, so that the non-Cantonese audience does not miss much. It is not, in the end, a dialogue that makes the film Chan, but the action and painful because of duplicates. Story is easy to follow: Chan plays Hong Kong detective spends incorruptible Gangland godfather (Cho Yeun) and is designed to protect the star witness (Brigitte Lin). Action perfectly from beginning to end, and not much time to breathe in between. He will never get you thinking, but entertaining as well as strung-together film. One could argue that this is one of the best martial arts films there.
