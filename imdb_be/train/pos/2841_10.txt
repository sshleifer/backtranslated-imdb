As a supporter of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I love you very high expectations. I'd love to go to all my expectations met. It was funny, sweet, fast-paced and entertaining. The film begins with two cabins bunkers (Bradley Cooper and Justin Bartha), who are trying to get to the same area, but arguing which way to go. It was funny, and then the film goes into some of the best parodies I've ever seen anywhere. There were four of them from the amazing all good. Those four I start to talk about. One particularly Shia LaBeouf as a servant in the hotel, which is the love of an old woman. The following features of Orlando Bloom as a music producer who does business with a woman, played by Christina Ricci. Another feature of Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly two people walking on the prom, the character Thirbly currently disabled. The best of them have Eli Wallach and Leachman as the bickering old men. I bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes an impressive directorial debut, directing, and writing a parody of a janitor, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q well as flirting man and a prostitute. New York, I Love You, of course, just as good, if not better, than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. In the parody, well developed, and the film shows how indie films should really be. The film, however, is not so much known directors like Paris Je'Taime, so it was fantastic to live up to its perfection. If you want to laugh, to see some great dramatic effects, see a surprising amount of fine performances, and just have fun, be sure to go see New York, I love you.
