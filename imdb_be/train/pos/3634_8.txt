I had low expectations for this movie, but I was looking for it is easy for the evening. I left the theater very satisfied and somewhat surprised. This is a very good tribute to the baseball movie and a good lesson about achieving your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role, and I was moved by his performance. Definitely worth the full price of the ticket and a couple of hours of your time!
