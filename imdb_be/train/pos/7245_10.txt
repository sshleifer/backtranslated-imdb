This is the only full-length film about the world of bridges. I found the first 10 minutes a little slow, but after that the film is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players, and how they go about making a living. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are very funny. I do not think that without a bridge player will receive the charm of the film. <br /> <br /> Some of the dress is very beautiful, a pity that the film is in black and white - I can only imagine what they will look like in color. The way the media portray absolutely hilarious. There is no way to bridge the earth will someday be like that. <br /> <br /> Look, as soon as you can, and tell your friends about it.
