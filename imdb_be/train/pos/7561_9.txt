The version that I saw this film was rolled Blockbuster with the same name, but a dirty word in it. <br /> <br /> This movie was funny as hell. This is also true in the bone. If you've ever spent time in Hollywood or the area around it, you will understand the humor. If not, you can not "get it" at all. <br /> <br /> The story of two people in the business are struggling to do so until they finally reaches a critical point, it is a rare gem. He He argues that it is a drama, but a drama, as Deer Hunter comedy. <br /> <br /> Lauren Dean, it's great, as always, as a supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy was able to hold its own well. His performance especically impressive during poodle scene. Carmen Electra was the only downside, but we can not have everything.
