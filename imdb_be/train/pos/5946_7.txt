"In the world of Finest» is a unique project. This trailer crossover movie Superman / Batman, which does not exist, and also never exist, at least not in this form, with these characters, actors and story line in any case. <br /> <br /> So the film is one big bully, even more than the standards of everyday real movie trailers. Trailer inflate you all for free. In connection with this, I really did not like this short project. When watching this trailer it makes you hungry and more excited and at the same time, sad-, and maybe you even feel cheated later, when it appears that the full length movie trailer that will never exist. Variety makes you wonder why this project was made in the first place. Of course, to show the skills of Collor, but could not it also did it with a real short movie, as his earlier film "Batman: Dead End». <br /> <br /> But if you have to judge this short purely for what it is, because of the movie a technical standpoint, this is really great. This is a great way to look and feel more professional than you might at first be expected, although people who have seen «Batman: Dead End» will already know better than to wait for a short cardboard sets, cheap homemade costumes and third rate actors . Short is not always an impressive appearance and, obviously, the budget is not sky-high, but for the most part this is a very impressive and professional looking, with good costumes, sets, special effects, film and lighting. <br /> <br /> In short, a good fast and build a typical trailer, with perhaps a little too much posing shots is fully credible, but hey, it works well for the trailer style. It has some impressive images, but also some of their poor, mostly flying Superman sequence. It was obvious that the guy was just standing on a moving car with the camera aimed at him at an angle below. I even found it quite funny that you need to watch. But in reality, the better and more exciting moments really make up for it. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn seemed pretty good Superman / Clark Kent, though he's obviously not the biggest talented actor around. Clark Bartram reprises his Batman role well again and Kurt Carley seemed strange Lex Luthor. The rest of the cast also served its purpose well enough. <br /> <br /> This is especially interesting to watch this short after the recent new modern reinterpretation of the two main superheroes of this film, in the film "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns." It is interesting to compare the style and nature of the treatment of these films with it. It is really amazing and interesting to hear how much Kurt Carley sounds like Kevin Spacey, the actor who played Lex Luthor in "Superman Returns." <br /> <br /> it looks good and is well made and built trailer that will nonetheless make you hungry more, even if you know that there will be more. Whatever happens with Waner Bros. It plans to create a real full-size Superman / Batman movie, by the way? I thought that the events were for it a couple of years ago, but nothing has so far been heard of him. Instead, two new separate Batman and Superman films were made; "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns." <br /> <br /> 7/10
