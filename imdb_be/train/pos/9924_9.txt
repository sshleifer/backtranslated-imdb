Ah, the Domino is really a breath of fresh air, something new in the world of cinema. I enjoyed the film a lot because of the complex plot, a variety of characters and intense camera effects. I've seen some complain about the camera work and, in fact, according to the creators themselves, catchy and wild shots were the culmination of the mistakes made in time. Everything you see was the desired effect. Maybe some complain because something quite like this has never been done before, but this is what distinguishes it. The deeper aspect that you see just how Domino to see things through her eyes, thinking about it. <br /> <br /> As for the story, I do not see anything bad about it at all. Despite this "dirty" character, according to some, it is actually just a quick form of narration. The plot is not really all that hard to follow if you really focus on what is happening. Maybe it's just me, because I see movies from many different aspects, such as action, plot, etc. I'm not a "translator" or something, who selects the films to each other, it just comes to me. With that said, I believe that it is quite a wonderful movie in fact, in spite of this future as a cult classic, blockbuster, or whatever. <br /> <br /> And the characters, and there is no doubt as diverse cast. I believe that actors are excellent, as they all do different jobs that show their characters effectively, is what makes the film Ladies and Gentlemen. The characters are all very unique and the plus is that you get to watch a little bit of each of their lives, when set them apart even more. In principle, I personally loved the actors and characters. <br /> <br /> All those who beat and burn the film, perhaps just do not see how I was, or he just does not appeal to them. Regardless of whether it's a great movie in its own right, there is a great period film.
