Rich, alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall secretaries. He marries her and so happy that he will stop drinking. However, Bacall secretly beloved best friend stacks, Rock Hudson. And nymphomaniac sister stacks, Dorothy Malone, lust after Rock. Add a few complications, and the film is spinning out of control (in a good way). <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful glossy film in Technicolor with stunning fashions and furnishings (check number at the beginning of Bacall). Everything looks perfect, and dressed in beautiful, tight-fitting clothing. Basically it is a soap opera with the production values ​​of class A. The story itself is very fun, and some of the dialogue at the beginning of this funny top. Actions for Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not so good, but to see them so young and charming ... great ... especially the Stack when he smiled at my knees weak! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic - she deservedly won Best Supporting Actress for her role. She is sexy, violent, vicious and helpful ... all convincing. <br /> <br /> Fun, glossy trash. Do not miss it!
