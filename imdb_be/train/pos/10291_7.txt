After a slow start, Bruce ALMIGHTY very funny movie, which is something positive to say. He was not one of the best performances of Jim Carrey, but it's still okay. Morgan Freeman was just like God. Jennifer Aniston had a few good moments. I miss Steve Correll on «The Daily Show» <br /> <br /> I like the choice of director Tom Shadyac in movies. He also made Liar Liar, the PATCH Adams and The Nutty Professor. In all three of those, and Bruce Almighty, he takes a big star of comedy and tells the story of a man with him. The director, who knows comedy, talent can get it receives, and I can say, informative and clever story with him is hard to find. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they had to use a biblical reference. I only remember three specific biblical references, and they were three funny parts of the whole movie. I think that the first drafts of the script were more biblical references, but they were cut because the producers were afraid of offending people. That's too bad, because I thought it was a missed opportunity <br /> <br /> My rating :. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
