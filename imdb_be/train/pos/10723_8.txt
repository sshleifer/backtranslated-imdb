I was reading through some of the other users comments and decided to put one in, too. Some users are stuck in a type of "realistic" mentality. This film was supposed to be a "fancy" .... and "what if" funny film. It was never meant to be a "real" or serious. It was thoroughly enjoyable to everyone I knew, when he came out - despite the fact that the surveillance explosion tragedy of Challenger ... I was 30 at the time and thoroughly enjoyed this one - my younger son loved it! Later, I shared it with my daughter, and she loved him, too. SpaceCamp is a fun family film, which is to be served during all this - pleasure. All of the "realists" in the world highlight the need to follow or watch documentaries or avoid and documentary art of any other type of film. So sorry for those young people who have seen the movie first, and then were able to go to a real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one in Vandenberg AFB, California) - they should have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that is portrayed in the film, then felt "disappointment" ... I think that their parents do not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh, well. If you enjoy fantasy funny movies and have not seen this, I highly recommend it! Enjoy!
