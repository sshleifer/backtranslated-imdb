I loved this movie. He analyzes the great Italian philistine society, both left the 70s gave all their ideals and to come to a happy agreement that they do not want to be disturbed. For example, the aging of the analyst, who is jealous of his own son, and do not want to be reminded of his more radical youth. <br /> <br /> For a long time I wanted to buy a video after watching the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on television, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy, one in the stores did not know about the movie. Very sorry. <br /> <br /> one sex scene, which everyone seems to go on about doing a film no harm.
