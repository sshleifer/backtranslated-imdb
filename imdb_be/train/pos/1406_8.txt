Remember H.G. Wells' The Invisible Man "? Well, that's another movie, it only more extreme. "Invisible" is not a story of invisibility as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Kane, a scientific genius who goes out of invisibility and make it useful for military purposes. When you first make the serum was the easy part, what makes people come back was not. Most of the first attempts ultimately unstable. To one night when he improved formula. And who else but to Caine in lab rats. Gorilla was the first and almost died, so that when he came to himself, he was a close one. So if Cain did, he decided to use it for fun. Then, when he was tired of being not visible, the team tried to bring him back into the world of the flesh. However, the visibility of the formula is to not work as it should, and Kane will delve into madness. Thus, it ends up being a crazy invisible killer. It would be better to just get out of the city instead of the lives of people who are close to you. I could care less about those who have done you wrong. Great movie, a lot of fun. 3 of 5 stars!
