This film is a remake of the two films, which were much better. Last, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I think you can see that one. This one is not so great. The last third of the film is not so bad, and Chris Rock is beginning to show some of the comic pleasure that got him to where he is today. However, I do not know what happened to the first two parts of the film. He plays as a very bad «B» movies where people sound like they are in some bad TV sitting-room. This situation forced and they are just trying to get the story on the fact that they can start a real movie. All of this seems real and fake just bad editing. I do not know how they could release the film as it is. Anyway, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video and see him then.
