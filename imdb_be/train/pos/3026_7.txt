Charles Boyer to be Spanish, and he came to London to buy coal in the "Confidential Agent", in 1945, the film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer Louis denarius, and everything to stop him, except Bacall. His papers were stolen, he is accused of murder, but he decided to get coal for the people, so that they can fight the Nazis. <br /> <br /> This film has its good and not so good moments. It is high speed for the atmosphere and suspense, and it's very interesting. Bacall incredibly beautiful, Bowyer captured, Paxinou meanly, Lorre is slimy, accordingly Hendrix pathetic and outrageous Seymour fine <br /> <br /> Not so good moments :. Bacall has to be in English and Spanish Boyer, Er, no. Boyer is terrific in his role, even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, entirely British upper class. Two have chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall somewhat miscast. Her actions are not up to snuff either; it is better than in other films. But it is a strange beautiful woman, and much can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Paxinou almost over the top and hateful. Dan Seymour almost steals the whole movie as a hotel guest, who studies human nature. It's a big part of his performance is perfect, while some areas of other actors is not so good. This was determined in case no small parts, only small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look, even with its shortcomings.
