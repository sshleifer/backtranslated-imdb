WWE Armageddon December 17, 2006 - Live from the Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> Kane vs. MVP in the Inferno match: So that's the fourth when the inferno match in WWE, and it is against Kane. MVP (I wonder why this is the first match on the map). I just looked at ending part where Kane sets MVP ass on fire, they are on the platform, and then MVP runs around the arena, yelling ?? refs finally extinguish the fire extinguisher as MVP was stretched around the inlet ramp. Funny and visually very interesting ending. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: It was originally supposed to William Regal and Dave Taylor vs. Brian Kendrick and Paul London (c) in a regular tag team match. However, GM's Teddy Long comes to the ring and announces that he's going to be a Fatal 4-way tag team match stairs. MNM and The Hardys and thrown into all this chaos. One word to describe this discovery ?? wow. Man, I really can not remember how many patients were places in the game, and words can not really do it justice. It was a particularly characteristic of the place where the Hardys set the ladder in the position of the swing and Jeff jumped off the top rope, and Matt spent MNM for the murder, and then BOOM! Nitro blew while Mercury, apparently spoiled and bleeding like hell, with wounds on his face. He had to be taken away and Nitro continued the match single-handedly. Another place was when Jeff powerbombed London while flipping the stairs. There were other exciting spots ambitious too much to remember. London finally unbuckles belts to win this rave show stealer. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> against Boogeyman The Miz: Two men get thrown in and around the ring to Boogeyman detonates sedentary with Powerbomb for the win and then drools worms mouth Miz as usual, 5.5 / 10 for this three-minute incognito <br /> <br /> US Open :. Chris Benoit (c) faces Chavami Guerrero in yet another exemplary match Guerrero. Some good sites include superplex off the top rope on the FAQ and an unusually long string of German suplexes Benoit. Vickie Guerrero comes to the ring with the belt nail Benoit, but Benoit deterred from her and took a long time deciding whether to put it in a Sharpshooter or not. This allows Chavo to go for a cigarette but Benoit rolls him again and locked in the FAQ Sharpshooter. Game over. Nice hard-fought battle, although slow at times. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Championship WWE Cruiserweight: Gregory Helms (c) vs. Jimmy Wang Yang for it, in a rather moderate pace of the match. The match had a good ambitious spots ?? primarily Helms moves off the top rope ?? but the crowd did not seem to be in it after watching the match the stairs, and Yang should get more air. after blowing out of the Yang facebuster knee Helms won the match. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy in the last match Raiden: After a series of matches between the two, this time it's the last game drive, the second ever of its kind and, therefore, the winner must accompany your opponent out of the arena in a hearse. Very good indeed for the fact that these two could offer. Kennedy beaten many Taker, and even escaped from the chokeslam Taker throw from Armageddon set about 15 feet below; and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would have been cruel. Kennedy almost gained the victory, while Tucker did not come back inside the hearse (I liked the look of the camera inside the hearse). Taker then passed throw steel pipe Kennedy and broke catafalque window instead, and then burst open Kennedy ~ d with a chair, and the resulting serial chokeslam and tombstone roof in hearse. Kennedy was unconscious and Taker kicked him out of the arena to win. I actually was very interested in the willingness of these guys take / give a real sick shots. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa is coming to the ring, I go "what the hell?" How many children in the crowd, and then the word "competition underwear" gets in my ear. Break time <br / > <br /> John Cena and Batista vs. Finlay & King Booker :. Talk about charisma against formality. This match was actually very good main event since the rational transition from one team to another, and keeping a good suspense. Even got Finlay some legitimate good shots to their opponents this time (I kind of doubted his strength against the champions), and with it Booker and basically were unsuccessful in an attempt to fool ?? except in one place, where Booker rammed his rod in the throat Cena hits Batista bomb on Booker for the win, did not get to see the FU;. Cena performed the 5 Knuckle Mix one way or another, and I think he did too STFU. This is probably the best match of the night, and technical participants did great, really, because they could no stairs 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> As a po- u WWE fan, I have to agree that Armageddon was permeated with numerous eyes traps everywhere, and in the final match of the stairs eventually absorbed half of the show; Last match trip revealed some pretty nervous inside-spot, and the main event is also made very good for its category. All other matches also lived up to their billing, with the exception, perhaps, Boogeyman vs. Miz fight and competition ever useless clothes. In general, Armageddon was a very pleasant way of payment for and despite some major setbacks earlier in the chronology of the PPV, Armageddon wants to leave this year's respectable. Rating PPV: 8/10.
