I participated in a small mini-production, when I was 8 fight at school, and my mom bought a video for me. I loved it so far !! When I was younger, this song and dance spectacular sequence, which I enjoyed, but as I watched, as I grew older, I appreciate most fantastic action and the nature of the image. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can not imagine that someone plays Bill Sykes or Fezhin. Shani Wallis Nancy, when the best character for me. She tolerated so much for the boys, I think she is a strong character and her final scene, when ... well, you know ... always makes me cry! Best Music on my mind all the time. It lasted all this time, he will live for many more years! 11/10 !!
