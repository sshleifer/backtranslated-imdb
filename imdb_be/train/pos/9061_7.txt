I really liked the movie. I remember reading it a few times as a child and was glad to see a movie was made about the book. <br /> <br /> I was a kid, sitting at a boy and a girl between the ages of 8 and 11, and had to talk to the girl to see the film. But, fortunately, in the end, she was glad that she had seen, and even said that she wants to buy on DVD, as soon as he came out. <br /> <br /> There were some great laugh out loud moments and the film was not "gross" as I expected it to be ... tho it was a place where pretty high on the gross-o-meter ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I can not understand why they had to have a "weak-minded" line there that has been done by Woody with reference to the personal part ... I was just a shocker moment (and you can hear adults in the audience to gasp out loud at that moment in the movie) ... I have no idea why it was put in the film; it adds nothing to the actual movie for this shock / sigh factor ... in addition, quite a good film, but. Nice to see "Pepsi" girl is all grown up.
