It will be somewhat less. First, do not listen to the critics, since it is not as bad as most say it !! The Sniper uses the classic formula of the film, which many dissolve immediately as flawing film. While the sniper does not reflect 100% the truth about how the military snipers work in our country, it gives those who do not know anything about professional Sniper glimpse into the world of the sniper. And yes, the film has a lot of shortcomings, but the fact that the film does not? There are many good scenes and good acting, Tom Berenger. I have to say that the 2 worst scene early in the film with Billy Zane in the helicopter, followed by Zane in the bar scene commando. The best scene in the sniper with Berenger in the middle of the field with the opposing force to sweep it !! There is also a lot of good shots of the jungle and some classic images from the camera, as if you look through the scope. And yes, Creed Sniper 'one shot, one kill. Sniper judge for yourself !! <br /> <br />
