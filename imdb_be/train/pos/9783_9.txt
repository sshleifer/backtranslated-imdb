How could you say that the peaches, with its complex narrative dealing with a multitude of issues, is "a small TV idea" for me. In addition, I can think of many films that have a "small television idea" in their areas. Your obvious dislike of the television industry ( "Sue Smith could not rise above his television background") is confusing. In particular, how do you feel is a "great time" working on television. If we could all be so talented as Mrs. Smith (no, I'm not a friend or relative) - AFI awards Bride of Christ, Way to Coorain and others. Everything is done for television. Come to think about it, what about these other "small television ideas" as "Against the Wind", "the Bodyline", "Dismissal", "scales of justice", "the Blue Murder's", "Water under the bridge", etc. I think, peaches good entertaining film, which was interesting to me, and most of my friends as well, from start to finish. It is far from perfect yet I think it is one of the best Australian films that I've seen over the past few years. Who knows, even with multiple views (there is so much to think about), it might just be up there with classics like "The Year My Voice Broke», «The devil's playground." I really like this film a lot more than the "bag" and "Three dollars." These films, I think, had their moments, surreal, atmospheric, realistic and address important issues of our time, but for pure entertainment for mr.and average walker, no movies, and me, it was very common, if not boring. When I go to the movies, I was always conscious audience reaction to the film (via In- cinemas reaction and snatches of conversation in the lobby and toilet). Some came out of the peach shake their heads, some negative criticism, but many seemed to enjoy the experience.
