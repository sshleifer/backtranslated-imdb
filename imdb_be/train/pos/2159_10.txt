Firstly, there is no way, modification can be as good as the Japanese society is quite different from ours, and plays such an important role in this film, as described in the first stories. It adds to the humor and warmth of this film. There are many different minor characters / persons. Everyone does it participate in the creation of this film perfectly. This film is full of comedy, Sun vulgar in any way, like most modern "gross-out comedies." However, it may still you laugh. The reality is that in real life, you do not have a choice with whom you work or go to school with ..., etc .. This movie really highlights that and shows that the natural good in people can overcome petty differences. Not to mention, that makes for a great sub-plot and a lot of humor. This is a story about the dance, which actually has a story, and good at it. There are some back stories are not stupid, but actually support the storyline. Really well written movie. Dancing is also great. I happen to be a supporter of any movie with dancing of any kind, for this aspect. However, this film goes beyond any other with the dance, that is the story of the first place it happens to be written about dancing in Japanse society. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 from 10.
