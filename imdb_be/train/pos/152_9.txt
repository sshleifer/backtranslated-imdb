I saw «El Mar» yesterday and thought it was a great movie. It begins with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur, and Francesco. After that, we jump about 10 years in the hospital, where 3 friends meet again. <br /> <br /> Religion, illness, love, violence and sexuality rage around the creation of the film and an intensive and tension filled film. <, Br /> <br /> I see the people who complain the film is too bloody, and I think they missed a moment in history. This is a strong, intense and sad story. People will suffer. To cry. In order to get injured. To bleed. And I think the film shows not done for pure shock value, or presented in an unpleasant way. I know that some people like their films "cleaning", even with violence in it. But sometimes, the film should make you feel unconfortable to work. This is one of those films. And it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> The only drawback I found that there were 3 or 4 minutes there were some details of the plot was not 100% clear, and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie, it all made sense. But it was nothing of great importance for the general history, so I still give this film 9.
