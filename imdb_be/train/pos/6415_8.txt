Tillman Jr. drama about the first African-American Navy Master Diver (Gooding Jr.), who defies all odds and achieves its objectives, despite the strict embittered trainer. The script is not bad, a little extreme times, but the direction and operation of the first course, and this film inspires and achieves what it should do. I loved De Niro in the lead, even though it is not on par with his masterwork (taxi driver, brother and everyone else) is just as good as his other good performances, such as The King of Comedy and Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and plausible here, very good performance, Gooding Jr. is not bad, is certainly one of his best performances. --- IMDb rating: 6.6 My rating: 9/10
