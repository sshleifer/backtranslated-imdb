Writer / director Henry Brommel did a great job with his film, "Panic" of 2000, and includes his choice of actors: William H. Mays, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain, David Dorfman. Brommel threw Ullman and Ritter in a clearly non-funny role, and an unusual cast is a welcome change from what we usually see. <br /> <br /> «panic" is the story of a killer, Alex (Mace) who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He conceals his true profession, doing the work in the mail; apparently, he and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are typical suburban families. Dissatisfied with his life, Alex seeks the help of psychiatrist (Ritter), to mention only his mother (Bain). In the waiting room, he meets a young woman (Campbell), to which he immediately attracted, which further complicates the position. His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. When Alex gets his next assignment, he finds that he must kill his psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> This is a deep history of gentle, kind man made monster father's murderer, his mother knowing who kills in order to please his father, but also can not stand on it and quit. His fury is so deep that he had lost an emotional attachment just about everything and everyone, except her son - and, finally, his son, who awakens him with an almost lifelong repression. When it came time for the "panic" before the moves he makes. - Quickly <br /> <br /> «panic" seems not panicked at all. In fact, it is moving very slowly. But it is moving slowly, not because it is badly done - the deliberate slowness, reflecting own psyche Alex slowly emerging from the mist. When deciding on the Sarah Campbell character, and seeing his writing, his psychiatrist, as a living, breathing man, Alex begins to make the connection between what he does and who he is and they do not jive. And the difference between them can lead to the loss of other mental ,. <br /> <br /> Sammy William Mace gives another brilliant performance, as a loving father, a distant husband and a cold killer, a child of two monsters who never cared cursed his feelings or desires, a person who understands finally that he should come to the plate, or to have the cycle repeats. <br /> <br /> This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater. It is too old, too small, too thin, too mechanical nature, and too well.
