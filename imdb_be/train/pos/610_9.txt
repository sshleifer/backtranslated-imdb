Although Stardust seems a fantastic film with a predictable ending and medium productions, this is certainly not the case. When I saw the film, I knew that this would be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br Stardust /> more fabulous than the adventure. He has this magical aura "," from the very beginning to the very end of the film. The storyline is well written, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like any fairy tale, it has some short morality. So we know in our hearts that the evil brothers will not take the throne, but the innocent boy who manages to overcome all obstacles and difficulties he faced during his journey. We also know that true love never Yvaine Victoria, material girl, shallow and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I have to give extra credits Claire Danes. It literally shines in this film. Her eyes have that spark, completely appropriate to her character. Moreover, it does have a Coke and chemistry that makes the novel in the film is even more prominent. Other actors are well-known actors and actresses, who, of course, make Stardust interesting and "high classed '' cinemaÂ» <br /> <br /> In general, the film is fantastic, accommodation and magical story interesting.I was very disappointed that the film did not get nominated for awards. I have to give at least 9/10 of stars for this.
