Forget the depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door and have a great time with this manic funny, quite absurd, ultra-cutesy live action "cartoon". MYSTERY MEN is a promise to each superhero clicks you've ever seen, but it is hardly a super-Wannabes is so interesting, varied and well-cast, they are memorable characters in their own right. Dark humor, downright silly, good-faith action, and even touching moment or two to combine these comic fantasy about attractive lost the true winner. Comedic talent actors playing Mystery Men - including a mysterious woman - is the perfect foil for Wes Studi as what can only be described as dumping Yoda, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most off-in-the wall (and bizarre charming) villains ever to leave for Dark Horse comics pages, and on the big screen. Get ready to laugh, cheer and say "huh?" More than once .... enjoy!
