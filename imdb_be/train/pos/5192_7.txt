I kung fu fan, but not a fan of Woo. I have no interest in the gangster film, filled with over-the-top gun game. Now, martial arts; * * This beautiful! And John Woo surprised me here, producing a very exciting kung fu movie that almost has too much * * fight, if that is possible! This is good stuff. <br /> <br /> Many of the action scenes very well (and some less than good), and the main characters funny and cute. The bad guys are a little too incredibly evil, but entertaining nonetheless. You should see the master Sleeping !! He can fight only when he sleeps - it's hysterical <br /> <br /> With repeated viewings, however, the Last Hurray for the knight may have a tendency to get a little sad and verbose, and especially because many of the action scenes with It is actually not so good. Thus, I appreciate it "only" 7 out of 10. But in fact, it is almost "8". <br /> <br /> In general, one of the best kung-fu movies, made smack dab in the heart of the prime Kung Fu cinema. All really good kung fu movies from the mid to late 1970s, with some exceptions, characteristic of the late 60s and early 70s (and early 80s, to be fair).
