This film captures the essence of the absurd powerful American patriot actor - the one who believes that his work (and politics) is crucial for the American people, as the opinion of the president himself. Alan Bates captures this thinking just like Michael Baytes, and I will remember the immortal Bates as this character. This is a film for Canadians and Americans, yes. It is a valuable piece of cinema that is able to take its audience through the magic to make a film and show how easy it is for the producer and director of losing complete control over the will of the actors and countless outside forces. Cool "Hollywood North" does not suffer from the subject, which he portrays: Peter O'Brien directs with precision and complete control, and the team as a serious "behind the scenes" of the film, and film intra- -movie, "Flight Bogota "with clarity and insight. If you are at all interested in wit and strength of the Canadian film, "Hollywood North" is a great place to start.
