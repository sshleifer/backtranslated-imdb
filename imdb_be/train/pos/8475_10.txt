It is a fantasy film for children based on the marsh Creek Legend, although I do not know why they called it a return to the swamp cries, as if it were a movie sequel.This has nothing to do with documentary and fantasy kiddie fare. Dawn Wells star as mother of 3 children who got lost in the swamp surrounding marsh creek with 2 other men and a monster comes to the rescue. Yes, this is very stupid and banal story, but it's a film, ideal for 8-12 g / n band that target. It's G-rated harmless kiddie fare, and at least you will not have to worry about leaving the children alone while they watch it. Strictly 8-12 g / on the set, older children will get bored and think lame.
