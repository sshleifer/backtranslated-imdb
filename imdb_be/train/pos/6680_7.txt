It was different, that's for sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about eccentrics. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, although almost a bunch of actors share the attention, in this farce superhero-wannabees. The most glaring played with Paul Reubens' Pee-wee Herman "fame. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of humor, flashy colors and lulls. It's pretty interesting, light comedy with nothing but meaningless characters, each of whom want to be heroes a la Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, the name. They have talents in areas of the country, however, that real heroes do not (and do not want to!). It's silly, but you know what happens. <br /> <br /> Also, you can watch a movie in installments and in fact did not miss any breaks. It is a long film for so hectic, so taking a break here and there all right. Language has been tame so children can enjoy it too. In fact, I do not remember any bad words here, except the guy in the theater next to me who was speaking, "What a dumb, f --- ING movie." I thought it was a fun two hours, but I would like to watch it on DVD and make a few breaks.
