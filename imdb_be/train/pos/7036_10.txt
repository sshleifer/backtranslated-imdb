You have to be one of the best political satire that I've seen to date, with excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei, and all supporting actors. <br /> <br /> Excellent plot very well located and a very good surprise twist at the end. Scenes are well shot and choreographed. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give this movie a thumbs-up. It is extremely critical of US military intervention in the middle-east, and as such, it can get bad reviews from people who do not share the same political viewpoint, or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark humor and Drk. Indeed, in such places, the comedy was so close to the truth, it is the line between funny and tragic.
