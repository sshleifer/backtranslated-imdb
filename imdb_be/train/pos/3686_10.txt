Diana and I saw this fabulous film in Fremantle today, and we both agreed that a pastiche of films he was head and shoulders above the rest. I say that because we were fascinated by the brief, five to ten minutes segments consisting the film and the fact that this movie had a theme around which each piece was written and, of course, this theme was love in its many forms. <, Br /> <br /> Ostensibly the movie took place in various Parisian arrondisments, thus giving a particular flavor to each segment. Having only been to Paris several times, I was not experienced enough to easily recognize the place, but I am confident that the Europeans, especially the French people can easily find out the place of the city. In any case, the viewer is immediately drawn into the story of each of their manufacturing excellence, so that these places in the city are disappearing in-investigation. <br /> <br /> The film moves quickly, and the audience is absorbing a script while a new one on the screen. The stories themselves are not graphic, as some cellulose Hollywood nonsense, they are thin and food for thought and tender, like most of life without media dies, which hides so much the beauty of life under the nearest dung-heap just sell, sell. sell ... <br /> <br /> Go with someone to take care and allow this magical little movie you love to swim spa treatment, and if you leave my guess is you will feel restored.
