I saw it on VCD Cantonese with English subtitles. I thought that this story was good, but there were times when some of subcharacters roughly over the action. It took away from the film, how did pretty lame score that really annoyed me throughout the film. If music has been improved, I was able to overlook some replay scenes. Then the film will be much better.
