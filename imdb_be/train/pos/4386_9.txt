This is one powerful film. The first time I saw him, a Scottish accent made it hard for me to understand a lot and killed the viewing experience. I gave it up, but then purchased the DVD, use the English subtitles when I needed them, and really got into the movie to discover how good it is. It's great. <br /> <br /> widescreen image makes it spectacular in part, with some lovely scenery and a strong story reminded me of a brave heart, with tales of good versus evil. Now, it's Liam Neeson (good) vs. Tim Roth (evil). And do a good job. <br /> <br /> A few actors come across as mean, as the mouth. Man, you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant, irritating pus. (He was so disgusting and shameful patients critics love his character more than anyone else here). Nissan human being male and a solid hero figure as Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is a strong female lead. The film draws you in and help you fully involved, so be prepared to have an emotional experience of viewing this.
