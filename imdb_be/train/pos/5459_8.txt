Baby Face is a fast paced, wise cracking, knowing smirk film that <br /> <br /> lasts only an hour and 15 minutes, but what a reasonable 75 minutes they <br /> <br /> there! This is a story that covers so much ground can be covered in this <br /> <br /> short time puts most modern filmmakers to shame. Writers <br /> <br /> today's economy must learn the child's personality and to reduce the bloat that <br /> <br /> breaks many of his films. <br /> <br /> The story is not nonsense. Immoral woman rises to wealth under the ground first, <br /> <br /> and then over the bodies of the people who served madly in love with her. <br /> <br /> production of the Sure Code loused it from redeeming happy end, <br /> <br /> but it's not difficult to understand, the authors wanted to <br /> <br /> go in any direction, so that enjoy the fact that there is and use your imagination for the rest, it is a terrific Stanwyck George Brent and Douglas Dumbvrille like <br /> <br /> hapless suitor. Not a great film, but certainly pleasant. If <br /> <br /> You have never seen Baby Face catch him the next time it is shown on cable <br /> <br /> or rent a tape. It is worth the effort ..
