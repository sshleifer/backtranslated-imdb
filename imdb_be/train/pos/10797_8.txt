Their usual procedure gets disturbed when lonely, repressed, but still tempting widow mother Carol Jennifer (great moves performance remarkable Jennifer Wells) falls for a visit. Pretty soon, Jennifer relaxes and becomes a willing participant in a pleasant and relaxed carefree carnal swingers way of life, with all but Carroll eager to seduce her. Writer / director Joe Sarno comes up with a sharp, exciting and insightful study of suburban angst and restrictions throughout the 70-wild'n'easy sexual revolution; Sarni transforms the traditional mores of the middle class on the head and further spice things up with a bold and provocative mother / daughter incest story. Besides, Sarny is uniformly top-notch acting from the explosion up roles: Wells and Brooke both are exceptional, with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Hausman, Arlana blue, like a puff New Age sexologist Shandara and Erica Eaton as a brash neighbor Mrs. Field. Moreover, all the women are very hot and tempting; Wells, in particular, seriously soars up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence. The sex scenes are really sizzling and quite clearly, but never obscene or tedious. bright, polished cinematography by Stephen Colwell and Jack Zhastis bouncy, melodic acoustic folknul costs money, both on hard and effective. Recommended viewing for fans of Sarno.
