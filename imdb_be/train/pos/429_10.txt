It has been nearly 50 years since the film was made about the romance and mystique. The only two movies I can think of, "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films used the great actors are not stars. In both films, the actors all gave their best romantic notions. <br /> <br /> Â«Enchanted April" is about four English women after World War I, who are dissatisfied with their lives and find happiness in Italy during the holidays. It's amazing, "Enchanted April" was made in 1992, stands out as a pleasant classic.
