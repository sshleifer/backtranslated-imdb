The film is very nice with a great cast and a great by James Eves. The film entertains with a very charismatic performance by Stephanie Beach, and all perfectly cast. James Ev has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor, knowing exactly when to turn the effect of the fall, then climb up to the climax. He does so with an element of humor, a lot of twisting, thrills and blood. It is the return of an old vampire movie, with loads of gore, blood and screams. The film operates at high speed and the characters you on an exciting adventure, but what makes it work is that the film does not take itself too seriously with a lot of tongue in cheek action.Great!
