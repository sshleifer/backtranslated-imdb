Walking with Cavemen, hosted by Alec Baldwin, look at all the hominids (that's us!) Species over the past 5 million years: who they are, what they looked like, and how they became extinct. At the same time, a very interesting scientific view on the information that we have in these kinds, Walking with Cavemen also explores what it is that makes us human. I waited a few weeks to look at it, and I was not disappointed.
