With the rapid intercutting scenes of crazy people in an insane asylum, and installation / superposition of images and vague, interwoven stories, it is very difficult film to follow. Apparently, the man (Masue Inoue) takes a job as a porter or cleaner in the shelter, so he could be near his wife in prison, and perhaps to save her. But it is clearly mad, she huddled on the floor, with a vacant expression of a large part of the time and the fear, anguish and confusion written on her face in the rest of the time. Filmmaker goes to her point of view, sometimes, and we see vague images on the side of the pool drowning of a child, or clinging to the sunken child. It hurts something. If the point of view shifts to her or other crazy people, the director uses a distorting lens and things like that, showing us that the crazy people see and how they react. And the place is infested with crazy people laughing, hiding, and in one case the night and dancing furiously the day. At some point, a person is trying to take his wife out, but the door at night terrifies her, and she runs to his cell. Gradually the person falls into a nightmare in which he is interrupted in another attempt to steal it, and it kills the doctor and many attendants, and all the while the mad people's laughter and applause. When he wakes up, he is released, and wipes the floor. Some spectacular footage Japanes life, streets, buildings in the 1920s.
