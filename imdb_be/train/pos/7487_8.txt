I really enjoyed this film, because I have a huge interest in American history ... the pre-war years and the Civil War in particular. I bought it recently from a rack above to watch video on sale in the supermarket, and I was very pleased to add this to my collection of video stories. Although not the caliber of the Civil War films such as "Glory" and "Gettysburg" provides a lot of history on the brotherhood to a civil war among the cadets at West Point. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's gray uniforms, young people, or military discipline, but I'm fascinated by the history of the Corps of Cadets from around 1830 to the brink of war. I believe that it must be like to sit in a class with other young people, to learn how to make war, and then to put the lessons to use against their own classmates! <br /> <br /> In fact, there are two classes graduated in 1861: one class in May and another in June. the film has no real mention of this, except to mention Henry A. Dupont, the first graduate class of May; George Custer, the last city of the June class. the reason for the two classes is not so much about the war, but it was the result of a shift back to a four-year course of study in, after several years of experimentation with the five-year course (I think the first class had attended for five years and the other four). It reflects the film, the cadets were like brothers, and often had nicknames for each other ... George "Fanny" or «Autie» Custer; Alonzo «Lon» Cushing; James "Beauty" Stewart (for Jeb Stuart, class of 1854), etc. <br /> <br /> I say this film «Santa Fe Trail», as it should be, because the 1940 film, while pleasant, actually fudges history. Cadets from several different classes, all end together. Jeb Stuart and George Custer depicted as the best of friends, and side by side in stopping the 1859 rebellion of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. In fact, Stewart and Custer were never friends, but enemies during the war. They collide with each other (for the first time, I think) at Gettysburg in 1863 (Stuart was on the ferry Reid Harper, but Custer was still a cadet at the time when it took place). <br /> <br /> "Fanny" Custer plays a role in "class '61," even though his classmate friends, Dev Shelby O'Neal and Peyton are fictitious. I believe that they are, respectively, based on the Patrick Henry O'Rorke and John Hoover, two people, you can see. <br /> <br /> In any case, I really enjoy this film or any film that provides a window into the mid-19th century America.
