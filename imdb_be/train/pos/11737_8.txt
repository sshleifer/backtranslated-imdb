Well, this movie is stupid. I mean that in a good way though.It was stupid for the purpose, and was one of the best "stupid" movies that I've seen. Jokes and tricks intentionally bad, but organized in such a way that it hit all the right notes with me. Supporting characters were rather small and mediocre. There is quite a weak plot, but it works great. <br /> <br /> character Elvira is the focus here.She is nice and adorable.Cassandra Petersen is the world of acting talent that just glows in this movie.On pinnacle of acting talent she had the physical attributes which have been opened, stunning. Few could disagree with that. Parts that show off her figure were also some of the funniest scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had a smile from ear to ear from the first scene to the last. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended to fans of comedy and fans of beautiful women. I want them to do more than a dozen films ELVIA.
