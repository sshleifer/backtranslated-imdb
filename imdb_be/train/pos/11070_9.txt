I just finished watching this movie, and I can honestly say that this is a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating as a 5.2. <br /> <br /> This is not only Guy will bring a list of ab (ish) film actors and turn them into such glorious heroes, he gave us a film with a fantastic variety of subjects with a lot of imagination left. <br /> <br /> too many people want movies with the plot, which can be understood and handed them on a plate ... until those movies that get poor reviews because they are too predictable. <br /> <br /> This film is special. Get it now!
