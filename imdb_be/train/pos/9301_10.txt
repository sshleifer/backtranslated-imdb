Initially, I saw this very dark comedy about 2000 or so on cable television. What a surprise and delight! Each secretly armed in this movie! Dreyfus plays a "mental" Don (remember New York Don, which was to be schizophrenic? Art imitates life or vice-versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are at their most beautiful and not to be played! Thus, proving that beauty and strength DO go together! Then there is a big "garbage" scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey), where they verbally to play off the world "bullshit." This film is as thin and bald. For all surveys, it can be very quiet film. And you have the opportunity to see some of the actors in their final or near final roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. This is not a film for everyone. But if you like a movie that has a lot of word games and continues to move entirely undermined in mind that this is the movie for you. Roger Ebert shelves on this film. It is flat wrong. This is a great, great movie! Maybe just not one for Ebert. I think it's like 10 because of how well it is done and how ridiculous scenario may be, whereas in fact is not a straight comedy type of film. I like it so well that I bought it on DVD, because it simply does not get a lot of shows on cable television. Now, it's all mine!
