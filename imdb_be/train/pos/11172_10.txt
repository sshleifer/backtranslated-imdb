Personally, I love this movie and the novel (I read the book first and decided to watch a movie). First of all, the plot really original and unique. There is also great and I love the cast. Judd Crandall (Fred plays Guinea) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you. There are also a few corny lines abandoned there (Ica, when they should have been banal), but they will really lighten the mood and provide a good laugh. Maine atmosphere is really the perfect place to make this film, and it kind of draws you in for the film. Not only do you love it, but want to see it again and again, I recommend these 100% of any horror fan !!
