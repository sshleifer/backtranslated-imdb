I grew up watching this series. I was seven / eight years old when it was on. I still remember the 1st episode, which was named «The New House». It scared the h * LL with me! I can almost still hear that the statue, laughing insanely. And the ending, my God! Hooror spirit comes in the room for the baby: Yikes! It was a classic television, and it was one of a kind series. I found a DVD collection for sale on the Internet: 2 actually. My question to all readers: Has anyone bought this set? His bootlegs. Both vendors claim that has a very good copy. I have a fragmentary and poor DVD of «The New House» episode, and a few other episodes that are a bit better, however, if anyone knows if it's much clearer, it would cost me to buy it, and to share with my children. A large series, smart, scary and supernatural boldly. Thanks in advance for any fans who have low down on any of this- In fact, I would like to discuss. chris Walker
