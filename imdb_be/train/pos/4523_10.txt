When I heard that Pasdar was dragged into this film, I expected that I would have to watch the whole movie were low. The only reason I gave it a chance was wonderful Julie Walters and recommend to a friend. <br /> <br /> What I thought would be extensive, "Mrs. DoubtfireÂ» type of farce turned gentle and insightful comedy. Pasdar absolutely clear and gentle, as an ambitious business person who needs to release the female part of his creatures by dressing in some cases. It transmits these needs in the audience thoroughly believable fashion. Julie Walters gorgeous as her habit, as the hostess, who teaches him unconditional love.
