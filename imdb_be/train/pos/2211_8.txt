I do not watch much TV, Office, Weeds, Entourage, and E! 'S Soup apart. I think that I think this show is in good company. <br /> <br /> I love scathing review of pop culture, this show provides. The soup also helps me stay on top of what people in the office have in mind when it comes to Sanjay and Heidi Montag (sp?). <br /> <br /> The best part is that soup clips shows the highlights of the show, which is usually the funniest or the most contentious issues (c'mon, most people sit down to watch the American Idol due freak show, auditions are), so most people say that watch. And that means I do not have to suffer from the other 98% of these crazy stunning talk show or a "reality" shows one nugget "funny" or "shock". The only reason why soup does not get in my 10, when something is not funny sketches, and even less time in the commentary is not always up to par. But they can not be at home or work, if so, the soup is not on E!. <br /> <br /> Joel resourcefulness and team writers Soup (which includes McHale) make for a great show. I happen to enjoy a laugh and crew commentaries, outside the chamber. Even if they are being quite clear, giving from time to time gently she laughs, it's fun, because it is forced to. They obviously ironic. And it's part of what makes the show funny.
