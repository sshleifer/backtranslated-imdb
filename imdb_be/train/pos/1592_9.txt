"What I love about you", of course, to show that I could not wait to see every day. Amanda Bynes is such a great actress, and I grew up watching her show, "The Amanda Show." She is a very funny man and seems to be on the ground. "Holly," such as, a capable man and has the "out-there" personality. I liked the way she always seemed to turn things around and upside down, so that she messed up in straightened times. But that's what made the show so great. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the show, when the character "Vince" came along. Nick Zano very hot and funny, as well as "Harry", Wesley Jonathan. The entire cast was great, every character has its own personality and charm. All Jennie Garth, Allison Munn, and Leslie Grossman were very interesting. I particularly loved the "Lauren"; it is the best she has helped to make the show an extra funny, and you never know what she's going to do or say on the whole, the show is very good, but for some reason I did not give it 10 was because there is no more! no new episodes, so that the episodes could have been longer and deeper.
