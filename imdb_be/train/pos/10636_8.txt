This story is a complicated and amazing story about the last harem of the Ottoman Empire, well said and provoking we see the inner workings of the world now is not, and learn about the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the plot, characters, and action scenes. Several scenes were affected by the rapid editing and sub titles sometimes disappear too fast, otherwise excellent piece. <br /> <br /> The main character is played perfectly Safia Gillet who I am pleased to say, I have done a fantastic job without over doing it. The scenes with her and Alex Deck (Nadir) charming and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who is looking to see something less Hollywood and more authentic world, they imitate.
