Wonderland is an exciting film chronicles the pornographic film actor John C. Holmes participated in the brutal murders Wonderland. <br /> <br /> promoting the movie mislead into thinking that this romanticized image of the porn industry in the vein of Boogie Nights, and that it is not here.In fact, several references made by speakers, John Holmes is pornstar and short installation real life shots of John Holmes, except that this film is strictly a drama about a fallen celebrity involvement with the murder and how it happened. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact misleading film actually engaging.The acts on all the actors wonderful, and I would like to say that Val Kilmer is strange in its ability to penetrate down all manner of John Holmes. I was fully convinced that I watched John C. Holmes, probably looked and behaved just like in real life. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of John C. Holmes or stories about Hollywood, I think you will enjoy watching the Wonderland.
