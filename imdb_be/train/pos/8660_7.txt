It is a racist film, but worthy of study and enjoyment. The first time through a natural inclination to focus on Erbe and dad. They have a relaxing, peaceful thing happens, that it still houses finished high school, and he's retired and recline waiting inspiration to do something. The second time through understanding how badly my sister's husband is dissed by her friends at the bar blues heartland. He takes it, that's the thing to do these days, and at the critical moment passes as if they were talking about the weather. In the same scene blues song sisters real tear-Jerker, if you are even slightly sensitive, and as this kind of music. Her performance feels like the culmination of history; blues story with good guys to be "people of color" in his element in the backwoods of South Carolina. At the same time, all the white people in the film result in what appears to be small meaningless life suitable for making babies only. It's cool as long as you recognize it as fiction.
