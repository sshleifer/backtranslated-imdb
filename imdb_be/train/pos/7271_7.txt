Writer / director John Hughes covered all the bases (as usual) with this bitter-sweet "Sunday Afternoon» family film. «Curly Sue» is a sweet, precocious sirotoem, care from infancy, "Bill." Couple lives in wit, as they travel the great US of A. The fate of the match of their "very beautiful" yuppie lawyer, and the rest is predictable. <br /> <br /> The kids will love this film, as they may relate to the heroine, played by 9-year-old Alisan losses (which went on to be a "you go girl!" Pepsi commercials). The character must be about 6 or 7, as it is designed to think about going to school. Some of her lexicon says that it is every day from 9 and older. <br /> <br /> As well as "Home Alone," has a lot of slap-stick and little fists punching big fat chins. Again, this "formula" create a film aimed at a young audience. Fascinating and friendly. Do not look for any surprises, but be prepared to shed a tear or two.
