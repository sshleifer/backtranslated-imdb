This is one of the most soothing, relaxing and beautifully made animated films I have ever seen. With excellent music throughout the film, sounds and music can make you feel like you're in a movie! This film is not only great for kids, but adults too. It teaches you lessons, such as to never forget who you are, you can do anything you put your mind and a brave and bold. This film can make you cry sometimes, it is always pleasant to deal with in the movie. This film is funny, sad, cute, and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Some movies do give you a fuzzy feeling when you see them, and the film "The Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my vote for 9/10 star animation, music, and great ideas for the film, he gave me a lot of spirit!
