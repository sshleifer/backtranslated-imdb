I must admit that at first I did not expect anything good, really. I was just waiting for the cheesy movies promote Gackt and Hyde image, but I'm glad to say that it has much more to offer. <br /> <br /> So, acting is not so great, but it does not suck either, all the actors are well disciplined and they bring enough power to their characters. Effects inconsistent, but sufficiently satisfactory scene. <br /> <br /> What really hooked me was the essence of the storyline, though it merges fantasy elements, but also reflects the crude reality. Developing characters, their doubts and their feelings really is to me, and I think that is the key of this film. This puts you think, and it is well conveys all the angst. <br /> <br /> It performs any expectations of good drama. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
