I recently had the opportunity to inspect «The Waterdance», and really enjoyed it. I do not understand why it is called that, as there is not really any dancing was going on, except maybe for dancing at a strip club near the end. We are introduced to the main characters throughout the film, in a hospital Disabled. History shows a love story between a man and sisabled physically healthy woman who is very sweet story.Unfortunately, you can not watch movies, as it is today. Im not "stuck in a time warp," they do not say that everything in the '80s and early' 90s was better than today, but I do think that the film industry is deteriorating, and there is much we can get out of old films , old movies, I mean anything from 1920-1998.
