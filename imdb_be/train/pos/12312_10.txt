I can not believe that the movie that you can do that well in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the West. In order not to repeat the other reviews here. Price is very good and touching. Literally it means "Dawn, please, never comes" - if it is, a beautiful ghost lover will be apart forever. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look great. I enjoyed Joel God gamblers and many films including Leslie Better Tomorrow.
