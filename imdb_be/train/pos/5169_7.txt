I saw the last five or ten minutes of the film back in 1998 or 1999, one night when I was channel surfing before going to bed, and really liked what I saw. Since then, I have been finding that clears the television, flipping through a DVD / VHS racks in stores but could not find a copy until recently, when I found out that some online stores sell. Then, being a world-class procrastinator, I still have not ordered. Finally, I found a DVD-copy Circuit City during a visit to Portland, Oregon, a few weeks ago. Then it only took me about a month after returning home, before you sit down and watch. <br /> <br /> So, what I think of the movie? That's good. Not as good as I remembered, and hoped, but still worth the $ 9.99 it cost me. After seeing the whole movie for the first time, I appreciate it as 7/10, with the potential to become a 8/10. I need to be less sleepy at that time and have the best sound system in order to avoid rewinding to catch any dialogue.
