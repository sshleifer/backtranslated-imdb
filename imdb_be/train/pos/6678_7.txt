I really was not expecting much from this movie, but it was not bad; in fact, it was pretty good. This film contains a few funny bits of writing that I've seen from the movie. Now I'm not saying that this is one of the funniest movies of all time, but I'm pretty much laughed at some parts. "The police controlled the death of my father's suicide. They said that he fell down the elevator shaft. Onto some bullets. " Now this film is not for everyone, it is mainly a silly sense of humor, like Zoolander and Dodgeball; so if you hated these movies, I would probably recommend you stay away. Overall, it was an enjoyable film, about a group of superheroes of imitators that eventually become a true hero in the end. This is significantly overvalued comedy that many people probably have not seen, because, as I have before viewing it is expected that it will be complete garbage. After watching this movie, I finally understand why this film has been able to assemble such a superstar throwing, which includes Ben Stiller, William H. Mays, Hank Azaria, and even the child from Good Burger. This is because the Mystery Man full of excellent comedy writing period of 7 out of 10. It is a big surprise.
