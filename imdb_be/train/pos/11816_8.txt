It was very fun! I never read the Chester Gould comic-but this does not need to know them. Maybe there were some I did not understand an inside joke, but the fact that the eye does not see the heart can not grieve. It's such an irony, colorful film and actors natured together. Installation is similar to that in the movie ?? Batman`, but not so dark and gray. Well, the story is not so original, but there is a story (which is not self-evident), and more or less strange ending. <br /> <br /> In this movie, you could play an interesting game if you watch it with your friends. Do not look at the beginning of loans, and then see who is the fastest to find out who the actors are known for their makeup!
