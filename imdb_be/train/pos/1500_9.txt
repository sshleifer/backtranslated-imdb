Now a days, most people do not watch classic movies such as this. Most of the friends only watch movies from the 90s to the present. Something like a miser. <br /> <br /> The majority of old films as masterpieces, unique in its kind. Just because back when these films were thought and did, when ideas were fresh. Now people straining just to think about new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the movie. For true fans of classic horror. This is for you. The film is based with a researcher from Scotland Yard is investigating the disappearance of the actor, and bumps into three other strange occurrences with the previous residents of the same home. <br /> <br /> I will not say more because it will spoil the movie more than I already have. But this is a great movie for as old as it is. It does not matter what to watch again!
