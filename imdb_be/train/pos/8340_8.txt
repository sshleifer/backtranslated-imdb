It's really fun, fresh, light hearted romantic comedy. You can not go wrong with a sweet confidence Meg Ryan in conjunction with the genius Albert Einstein. Normally, I do not advocate completely fabricated fictional stories about real people now dead and unable to defend themselves, but I think that Einstein would later he got a chuckle out of it. <br /> <br /> It is in 1950 ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a beautiful, young, dispels brained mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk, a behavioral researcher named James, simply because he has the brains, she's looking for the father of her future children. However, it is love at first sight when her car breaks, and she meets a mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). Because she does not think Ed is smart enough, her uncle, was none other than Albert Einstein plays match maker, helped in its efforts by the three mischievous friends, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert is to make Ed seem appropriate intelligent, so come up with charades depicting it as a physics course ... with funny results. <br /> <br /> Matthau his usual cheerful self, and draws out the character of Einstein's quite effective. Of his three professorial friends, by Kurt, Nathan, and Boris, a lot of laughter followed. Einstein had a real genuine human side, and this film just takes a (challenging) step forward. If you suspend all logic, you can almost imagine the stupid story going! <br /> <br /> It may not be rocket science (despite its protagonist), but this is a great sweet, refreshing movie. One of the best comedies of love of the genre.
