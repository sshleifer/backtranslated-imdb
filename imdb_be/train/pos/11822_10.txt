Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies. I have to admit, that those who have not yet seen. You'll either really love or really hate it. He came out a year after the success of Batman. So expectations were so high, that many of them have been let down simply because the story is so simple. But based on a comic book ... what do you expect? Creatively, this movie is awesome! Set, makeup, music, costumes and spectacular action makes this movie fantastic. The film has a bloodless violence and foul language - it's not something that is rare these days. Director, producer and stars Warren Beatty as a crime fighter ace going against Al Pacino evil Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs. Madonna steals the show as the seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna ever played. It has the best liners I've heard! Madonna supporters will love it! One of the coolest things about the film is that they are only seven colors, to make it look like a comic book. This film is really a work of art, which, unfortunately, overlooked by the public. Summing things, this film reveals the child in all of us. This is a film that will leave you smiling in the end.
