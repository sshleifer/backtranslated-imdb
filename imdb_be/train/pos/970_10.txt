Now, I've seen a lot of movies in my day, but each one was a very select few who were very good to me. And I'm a 19-year-old, who impressed by this film is aimed at a younger audience. This is a very under-rated gem for anyone who looks foreign films. Almost all of the action as possible, schedule a decent (for which you will not even care about how you watch a movie. Believe me, whining about the schedule would be stupid to do), the story is well written and is a film that everyone can enjoy not only the children. <br /> <br /> That's basically what this film made me. He alone made me laugh ... a lot of two, made me feel for the character, as you imagine, and three, it is very uplifting story. By the end of this movie, you will feel good. Of course, the fact that the anime has shown there is not a young man turns into a great warrior, and whether to defeat a great evil. This is the formula that is used a lot. But, in this case, it is forgivable, because despite the fact that they use puppets for some characters and some secondary graphs you can see 5 years ago, its appearance will not be judged. It is very touching, the ending of the original, and it keeps you in the movie, as it is suppose to. However, if you try to compare it with other films like "The Neverending Story" or whether it would be more diverse your opinion. Look like this, and you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It was a good long time, since I was amazed how it is. The only film where I got that feeling when I saw TMNT way back when it came out. There is something about this film I felt about TMNT, that really made me love him. So do not over-analyze and take this film too seriously, just enjoy it.
