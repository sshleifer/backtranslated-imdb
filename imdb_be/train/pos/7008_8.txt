WOW! What - is - the film !!!!!!!!!!! I am not a supporter I contemporary Italian directors. Usually I do not like drama. I'm not a super fan of Will Smith even think that he is a very good actor ...... but this film! This is such a great film with an original script and good direction so and so works well ... wow ... it's incredible. This film captured my attention every minute, and I do not even like "Pursuit of Happyness" (maybe because I do not like acting son Will, who is a very bad actor, and children, as a rule, it seems everyone congenital actors, I have seen it also last night in "The day the earth stood Still" and I confirmed his feeling that Jade can not act). I do not want to write spoilers and so I'm not talking about the history, but what I can say is that this film speaks about love, death and other feelings that I do not like to look in the movie .... but this film is a super great film. If you have at least the heart, you will not regret watching it
