"I also love the line about Oscar refrigerator," it was OK for two weeks, I saw milk standing there, that was not even in a bottle! "There's no question that Matthau Oscar Madison joy to watch on the screen. He's almost as good as the version Klagmen in the series. <br /> <br /> problem of the film, Jack Lemmon Felix Unger. Jack makes a very, very honest efforts on the role. the problem is that he does Felix SO depressing and down trodden that it becomes more irritable than comic. Tony Randall's performance in the series, brought a kind of humor, warmth and sensitivity to the character of Felix, in which there is no image in Lemmon. Tony Felix Unger, obviously, can be irritating to the time. Nevertheless, in the series, it is linked to specific situations when the irritation was necessary in the storyline.
