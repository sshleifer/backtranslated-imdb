Im usually not a fan of musicals, but if I had to choose something that would be my favorite it would certainly be Oliver.This movie is so well-made, well-drawn characters, costumes spot on the action is good and great songs, my favorite being "The Review Situation'sung Ron Moody, which gives a brilliant image Fagin.I was not old enough to see Oliver, when he was released in the late 60s, but my sisters were, in a row I had to put up a few weeks with them singing songs of blood, as a rule, it was "Who will buy my beautiful th roses'so I already knew all the songs before I saw film.Its timeless musicals you definitely can not alter it, he stands on own.Its not up to the books, and I do not think it would work so well, if it were been.I not think that Charles Dickens would have been disappointed, as he wrote Oliver show poverty in London, in orphanages, working at home, and that the poor were forced to turn to in order to survive, and the film It reflects very well.Also another great reason to watch this movie Bullseye Old English Bull Terrier type, with yarnitse attention to his long, thin legs, it was withdrawn from the rocks many years ago, they have hunted high and low to find a sample of his, and he is exactly the English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice in his {have scars that are likely to make} on his face, Bill Sykes, probably used it to fight the dog or rat pit.A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record number of murders in the rat pit.H beautiful dogs any way and note he does not hear Bill Sykes after he killed Nancy, it obviously has a binding th standards it is not a piece of the head of Bill Sykes I thought he was.This is great music playing, if you like musicals, and if you do not like musicals give it a try in any way, there is something for everyone in this film.
