It's awesome! In story mode, your going from punk to the pros. You must meet the goals, which include skiing, manage and track. You can create your own skater and give it a name, and you can make it look silly or unrealistic. You and your friend Eric throughout the game, as he does not betray you and gets you kicked out with a skateboard team (you can choose the command to be), and you then start your own team! There are many levels, like New Jersey, Manhattan, and even school II (not part of the story, although the regime) from the Pro Skater Tony Hawk 2. You can unlock the secret skaters as Iron Man, Gene Simmons, and another skater. You can create your own goals as Skate letters, letters COMBO, Tricktris, Gap, and more. You can create a goal pedestrian and write what they say. If you get tired of doing it, you can do Premade goals in pre-made parks. The only thing I do not like this game, it was sometimes difficult to drive cars. 9/10.
