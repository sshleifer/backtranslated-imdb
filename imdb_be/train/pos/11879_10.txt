This is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> If the movie has a flaw, it is that it comes at you like a mad bull. It is not so much to attract viewers as an attack it. «» Scarface «» as a voracious and uncompromising production himself Tony Montana. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> sluggish synthpop Moroder contains steps on the tee. As choruses in Greek tragedy, he screams and grinds, broods and tugs, a constant reminder of the inexorable fate of Tony. <br /> <br /> Not so much a story about a disaster warning during «» Scarface »" rips through the screen with the irresistible force of a runaway train.
