I agree with most other posts. Was it a comedy? drama? I leaned a little more towards the comedy. I could be a great movie without the comedy, and it was horrible unnatural. Jamie continues to operate in Julio and his name. In New York, how many times have you come across someone you know, in the center of Cleveland.And only as Robert Pastorelli could dig Yankee Stadium, to hide gold. Again, a comedy or a drama? But it was still entertaining especially on a Sunday morning. I enjoyed the performance Kimberly Elise, she, of course, the beautiful actress and seems to take their craft seriously. She is the youngest actress to be viable.
