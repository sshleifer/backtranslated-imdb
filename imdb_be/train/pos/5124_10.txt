This is a great movie that I do not think it gets enough credit as Saturday Night Fever and Grease in Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with her, but is too pig headed to admit his feelings for her. Instead, he wants to participate in the mechanical bull, because he thinks that he will show his masculinity. Despite the fact that it was done in 1980, it is still timely today. Big country music soundtrack is terrific. 10/10
