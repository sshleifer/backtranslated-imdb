Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out around the same time as the Challenger explosion. Which really put crimped about when to take it, or even if they should bring it. I'm glad they did. I first saw SpaceCamp in passing the film in. Which really enhanced the view a lot. <br /> <br /> While I have heard about Leo Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I had never heard of the other in the film. Thus, it was a big shock to me to find all these young people to act, and act really well! Of course, Capshaw was excellent too. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the scene where the children were shown how to operate as a team. Scenes of children preparing for the trip, they could only hope for. The actual launch of the spacecraft, it is, of course, is old news to us. Nevertheless, this one was different. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of my most cherished films. Fugitive may be, but it was fantastic for the space nut like me. After probably rent it for 30 - 40 times. I finally found it available in a particular store and bought it. Now, when it comes out only on DVD. I probably forever. This movie gets 9 out of 10 from me.
