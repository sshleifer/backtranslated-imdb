I've always loved this movie Frankenheimer. A good script Elmore Leonard and the main reason for this was not just another action film because Frankenheimer. His taut direction and attention to small details make all the difference, he even hired a porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make the case that his last good movie Roy Scheider did. I have always said that Robert Trebor gave only a terrific performance. Clarence Williams III received all the publicity with its terrible performance, and it is great too, but I really thought Trebor stood. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film, like the others, but it is an effective thriller, full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and real porn actors appear in a sleazy part. What can you say about the film, which has Ann Margaret shooting drugs and raped? Guilty pleasure, to say the least. Tumba has a real sleazy role and very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance. Classic exploiting thriller that should not be overlooked.
