The method-moving murder mystery mansion to get some peace and quiet while Charles handle his latest masterpiece, Horror novelist Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott) and his wife Alice (Joanna Dunham) delighted with the story, which centers around a serial strangler on Dominique them. After a series of strange occurrences and events in the house, Charles begins to believe that my creation come to life and chases him and his wife. Probably one of the best records in the film, this is easily the creepiest. The atmosphere here is what sets it apart. Scenes from a fictional character truly terrible mystery surrounding it is really effective, and there is always the classic creep since. Classic moment is murder in the office of a psychiatrist, which is high for the horror all the time. Build-up to it, with a creaking sound, rapid flashes of mysterious creatures, and thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for this favor. <br /> <br /> Sweets for Sweet-entering a new house, a widower, John Reid (Christopher Lee) hires a former school teacher Anne Norton (naira Don Porter) for his young daughter Jane (Chloe Franks), while he on a business trip. Anne gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from the past Jane that John vehemently denies. If she finds out the true nature of what happened, it is much more shocking that she would have thought possible. With Creepiest straight sections and the biggest turning points of history, it's quite nice post. The mystery of the family played great, with a small amount of tips collected here and there, and the final opening directly hassle. One only this part is the main reason why it works, and Lee did not harmful to his or <br /> <br /> A bad story (a) :. fake-Tormented lost love, Philip Grayson (Cushing) and his friend Neville Rogers (Ekland), both are captured by a statue of a woman in a wax museum, like a statue takes over their lives, they discover a shocking secret about the museum, which frequents both of them. There's a clever premise here, and it gives a reason to spend time in a museum of wax figures, which are always terrible. This is no exception, and it looks terrible, which helps in the fluorescent light on the display on the sculptures. dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense, but that eventually kills the pace is slow. It takes a lot of time, events unfold outside, and most of the time is spent on exposition. It also builds a shock ending that you can see coming a mile away. They really bring it down one bit. If the rotation has been changed, he would have killed more else is acceptable. <br /> <br /> Invisible-Veteran horror actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee) frustration due to the lack of realism on the set of his new film, goes and buys a new vampire cape from a specialized store. Cloak quickly turns him into a vampire, going crazy on the set with one of the main roles of Carla, (Ingrid Pitt) and other vampiric acts at home. I am convinced that the cloak is the reason he is doing everything possible to prove that it is only in his imagination. This is a fairly decent room, and there are plenty of opportunities for some decent scares, but that it sinks several factors. Firstly, it's just too stupid for its own good. plot twist at the end is an excellent example of what so overdone that it's actually not a shock at all, and just comes across as just stupid. There are so few scenes deters or discourages attempts, it's just a longing to sit. This is the weakest in the film <br /> <br /> The verdict :. A quite decent omnibus film, there are a few minor problems, which were scattered on each of the stories, which makes it less than perfect, but still very watchable film. Especially recommended for those who like films at the time, or who use British horror <br /> <br /> Today's rating-PG-13 :. violence
