I understand that a lot of people hate this movie, but I must admit that this is one of my favorites. I happen to like it better than him and I'm glad predeccesor like it better than a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think that people will never give this story any credit, as well as Back to the Future, travel time is difficult to write, and in this film they included the time way and the spiritual path. <br /> <br /> I also think that Keanu and Alex was there best performances in this film, they looked steeper acted abruptly, and said cool things. <br /> <br /> scenography Awsome this film, as well as, in some detail, and sets a massive and sometimes it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for a film about two teenage kidneys, which are unlikely to spell ... but would that the genius of the whole franchise, which makes these two idiots larger than life characters, who are responsible for all the utopian future of the earth. <br /> <br /> costume design was Awsome, as well. Bill and Ted actually look cool in Bogus Journey, where, as in Excellent Adventure, they look more like, well, as they put it, FAGS !!! <br /> <br /> Even the music in this film Awsome, especially evaluation. There's so much I could say about this movie, because I love it. But this is one of those movies I grew up watching, and every time I did I loved him, so I can understand why people hate or simply think it Bogus compared with Excellent adventure (which I also love, by the way). <br /> <br /> get down with a bad YOURSELF !!!!
