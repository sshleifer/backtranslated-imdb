let me say that I love Adam Sandler, watching rule over me, I paid close attention to his acting <br /> <br /> When he raises his voice, I can not help but think of Happy Gilmore yelling at a golf ball, the I snap back like Adam Sandler sucks me <br /> <br /> Reign Over me is a great movie, a movie that comes off slowly at first you wait for emotion in every scene, <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some really great lines and Oscar worthy in any Fil IU it <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler was strange in many ways, it was not only his most dramatic / best film of his career acted. but I can remember laughing out loud in many parts of the film <br /> <br /> supporting cast was great and Saffron Burrows, and Jada Pinkett Smith <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film it Got a great acting beautiful shots of new York high comedy and high drama of a new found respect for Adam Sandler, if you ever doubted him, or confidence as a great Don Cheadle
