My friend had an idea about how to view an animation after watching LOTR Return of the King Peter Jackson. So I finally bought his e-bay, thinking from the very beginning he was going to suck. In fact, it really was not as bad as I thought it would be. Animation was good for its time, they used a unique method of mixing live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who did the voice sounded somewhat like Frodo Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> I do not the greatest adaptation of the book, but believe me, I've seen a lot worse. He misses a lot of things as scholarships and two towers are compressed into one two hour movie. Definatley worth a look, the children could, but still not entirely absoutley Comparision of the trilogy by Peter Jackson.
