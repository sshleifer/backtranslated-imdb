*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This film, "divers", this is really interesting. All I knew about it was that it would include Nazi history, underwater scenes, and everyone will say in Danish. But I decided to check it out for one reason, the fact that the story develops around a sunken WWII German submarine. I have a fetish for German submarines, especially spoil that can be dived to. So I was a little skeptical of the Danish part, but reasoned that the south can weigh this part. Knowing that Scandinavian films is not always good, and not the size of the budget, I was sure, to put it mildly, very skeptical. <br /> <br /> After seeing ... I was surprised. <br /> <br /> I had some thoughts about the actors inadequate, seeing as some of them are very young, the two main actors, in particular. It was not a question, they both perform very well. How do the other actors, which consist mainly of people in their 50s and beyond. This makes some interesting interactions between young and old, are not often seen on the screen. It is not unique in any way, but more rarely. And it's all good. <br /> <br /> As for the Danish language, it is almost impossible to understand. But this is not a problem, it was the subtitle. <br /> <br /> Another problem was the submarine itself, I suspect that would be the internal staff and external underwater shots of the submarine. Deciding their budget was thin, I thought it might be adequate at best and down right awful at it worst. Again I was surprised, the external scene of shipwreck and beautiful interior scenes are very realistic. Having a fetish for German U-boats, I knew that the south should look, especially inside, and not later. The team has done serious research. It's all good. <br /> <br /> I suspect that more people than I will watch this movie to see some sub-sunken stage, so I feel I have to issue a "warning". The submarine in the film is not a real model, which existed during the war. This special assignment to the south. But to give you a hint of what to expect, it is the transition between the type VII, IX and type of Japanese vehicles to the south of a similar I-52. This god good design makes good wreck. <br /> <br /> Set on the Danish island or peninsula, I can not remember. It's summer time and the two brothers who travel the grandfather to celebrate the arrival of summer, as they do every year. Their grandfather brands kind. The cinematography is very nice, a lot of beautiful summer scene on the docks of the island, some mined teenage love, good diving weather and a general feeling of "perfect". Again, it's all good. <br /> <br /> The story-cross the island receives some suspicious-looking visitors, a gathering of people to hire one of the boats, the old minesweeper and this crew. One of the visitors, a man in his 50s, has a German eagle and a swastika tattooed on his back. pensioners on the island all remember when a German submarine was sunk at the end of the Second World War and since then there have been rumors about Nazi gold in the bowels. My grandfather was one of the young people who were looking for the wreck shortly after the German authorities began to swim to shore in 1945 many submarines were not found. <br /> <br /> What to Expect <br /> <br /> The basic elements of Nazi Experiments Nazi history, treasures, privacy, competition, teenage love, conspiracy, and ... surprise <br /> <br /> *** ATTENTION -. Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> I did not expect that some elements of the supernatural, to appear in this film, and he took me by surprise. Not being a big fan of supernatural events, however, it fits into the story and did not pose any problems. It's not like "From Dusk Till Dawn", where everything turns into a vampire closer to the end. It's a little more subtle <br /> <br /> Overall :. Very good movie, I gave him 8. Some of the that this is not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. Later, I learned that it was a fair budget, and that some of the actors have been tempered Danish veterans. But even if it was a production of Hollywood, I would give it a 7 or 8. Definately worth . Thus, the story of a child in the way, but then again, mature story. It has a lot of suspense and grandiose aura of adventure, which I found very attractive. And, again, the cinematography is very nice. <br /> <br /> / Medusa in 2001 <br /> <br />
