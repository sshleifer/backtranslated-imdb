This film was one of my childhood favorites, and I must say that, unlike some other films that I liked in this period Thief of Bagdad spent on this quality while I grew up. This is not just a movie that enjoys children, you can watch and enjoy the adults as well. The only drawback is, that no one can see past ?? bad "effects (compared with the current effects), as one would if one was a child. I do not remember these effects are, of course, it's been about ten years since I saw this film when I was about eleven years old. Who watches the effects? One seeks only the good stories and entertainment, and that's exactly what this movie gives. In my opinion, this film is one of the first big adventure films of the 20th century. Coming to think of it, I feel like Indiana Jones quite like this film. There is comedy, romance and adventure all in one, which creates a perfect blend that will grab you from the beginning to the end, and although the film is old and the music and style of the film is clearly not modern, it was not able to be dusty and old. All that is mainly due to a long history, good directing and acting are good performances by actors. In this department Sab (Abu), and Conrad Veidt (as Jafar) are allocated, providing the comedy movie and pinned down elements for the most part. Great film, and although the "old man" is defined ?? Goldie. I hope someone has a brain and viscera, to release this on DVD ever. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
