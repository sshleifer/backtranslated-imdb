It was one of the best shows ever made for television. Full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. Compulsive viewing. I'm lucky that I've seen this in the UK. They may have received the wrong order of the episode, I do not remember, but at least it was on the next together every week. My friend and I sat in the trailer, and none of us is a big fan of the American series is normal. <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we knew that it was something special. We missed a few episodes, and it made you feel sad and mind within a week of missing those BZHA. <br /> <br /> Great cast, great acting. Gary Cole has been absolutely brilliant, even better than his role as the Custer. Lucas Black turned in a strange design for a baby and Paige Turco was her best, too, as the party five. And Nick Sears, of course, by the time the Sheriff suffering sidekick. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some confusing and surprising bits that I think it would be explained later, and, of course, would be in later series, this will make the end of the weak, and you could say that they killed him. Made us go WHAT? Why do they do this with one of the best shows ever? Shoot EXEC.
