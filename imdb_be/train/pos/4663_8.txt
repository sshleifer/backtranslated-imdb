I saw the movie on that and just let it run, because I like Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was well surprised to find that I really liked the film and found it to be quite exceptional. Of course, this is seriously out of date, but as part of the period, it is well worth a look just for the subtle humor in the understanding of life and a way of life for nearly forty years ago. Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD, so I can watch it more often. I was also very accepted with performances of Smith and Ustinov as the lead, and Karl Malden, Newhart, and the occasional appearance of Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
