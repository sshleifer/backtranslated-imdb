I do not know ... maybe it's just because it's a great tribute to a Muslim religious activities (pilgrimage), but I just felt that the movie is so undervalued. I just can not believe that the movie just voted only 223 people so far, given that the film was released in 2004 and has won many awards since then.About movie ... this is one of those who acted in good sweet movies.Reda, French teenager due to sit on the Bachelor, asks his pious elderly parents to take him Mecca.Strange, as it may seem (if no one knows about Islam) parent wants his son to drive them from their home in France, Saudi Arabia's religious generation gap pilgrimage.The once in a life-n amizh father and son based on a fairly simple terms ( "you know how to read and write, but you do not know anything about life," the unnamed father of her son), but some bromidic generation gap literatures avoided.Bot of them caressing their frustrations .The father never spoke in French, although Ed understands Arabic, but can seem to answer only in French though they face a lot of people on the road:. "There's a terrible old woman they pick up at the Bosnian border on the way to Belgrade, and talkative Mustafa (Jackie Nersisyan), which helps them on the boundary T Urs, reserved and shy women who wear the veil on the road to Damascus, "the focus is always on the mismatched father and son.There not much talk in the movie, which makes it pleasant to the eye. You will see magnificent views in every city they go.The filmmaker shows even the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, even if the movie is not long enough. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not like movies that do not have a sufficient number of dialogues and which take energy from the intricacies of the camera, but this one was really outstanding great.Despite details (like an invisible friend Reda in French) calls for a movie senses. Great artwork and remember this movie is the debut ismaÃ«l ferroukhi in.
