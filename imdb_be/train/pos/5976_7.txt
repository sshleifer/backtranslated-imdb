Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This idiotic romp film revolves around 80-Culture Heavy Metal and horror films - two things that I love dearly. So, as you can imagine that this film came to me quite easily. Moreover, without any reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. <br /> <br /> The film is about an unpopular high school youth, who, as we all are losers, eventually flooded the world "evil» Heavy Metal. His favorite Metaldude dies, and, of course, miraculously resurrected - playing his last unreleased album back. This allows corpsified singer go around killing people with demons and help shit. <br /> <br /> Well, it's pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? He has an amazing amount of merit. Worthy of action (including Gene Simmons, as a radio DJ), the special effects are very good, very short, poverty, decent atmosphere ... In general, it is actually worthy of a horror movie. But what really sucks is music. Ironic, is not it? Well, this "super-evil" metal guy is one of the most hideous, piercing, wailing, Motley Crue rejects on the planet - and "Metal" little more than a putrid 80-Pop / Metal hair. He hits all the clichés here, bouncing around like a gay fairy promising medium to shout "Rock and Roll !!!" in the field is sufficiently high to make the King Diamond push. In addition, the brutal musical performance, it's actually very good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
