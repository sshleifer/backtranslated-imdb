And quite suddenly the story line too much for the era: there is a plague in the city of New Orleans, and only Widmark can stop him! items and trademarks Elian Kazan: embankments, working men, the crowd, unorganized, blue collar folk, violence on the illegal-are all represented here <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is quite effective as a gangster out for ice. great price, Mostel like Dom DeLuise few, but certainly watchable miscast as his go-fer. I enjoyed the Bel Geddes as a tall, cool wife, I think she and Widmark was believable couple. <br /> <br /> He always reminds me of some of Sinatra in the face and in the intense quiet manner, and what is meant, as if something compliment. I've never even heard about this film, and so, you have to admire WIDMARK performance. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas-he seemed to be playing a lot of times, they are unlikely to do this role, but effective team. <br /> <br /> plague itself is a McGuffin-and you should know that it's not exactly done as it would be in real life, and small-scale, at least not? -but I found that it carried a section along nicely. <br /> <br /> Check it out. That's good. *** outta ****
