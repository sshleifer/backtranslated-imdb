version of Peter Jacksons (a) better films in general from an objective point of view. That being said, they are not my favorite adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, and let me explain why. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the actions of the characters on the screen is too mundane and boring from LOTR Jackson. The entire cast is too ordinary. "You are alleging that these silly cartoon characters Ralph Bakshi's version is a better actor than the real people?" One might ask. Well, they are really stupid (except hobbits, then about them), and they certainly pack more personality than the party Jackson - even with a much more limited time dialogue. And it is because of the excellent _voice_ action in LOTR Bakshi in. Take, for example, Aragorn. In this version, his voice deep and charismatic at full power (Aragorn lord) and tempered rasp (Aragorn Ranger). It is connected with John Hurt in a brilliant voice acting. Compare this with a fairly high pitched sound Vigo Mortensen without a soul, and quickly becomes uneven duel: Hurt Mortensen beats hands down. <br /> <br /> Finally Gandalf. Probably the most useful (and most popular) character in the whole saga. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf (William Squire) a true master. And the fact that I did not mean it shoots bolts fingertips (he does not), but its presence is simply captivating. It is a mystical, powerful and can be switched from the gentle old man with a terrible ease. Add to that his appearance: tall, old as the ancient oak, long beard, his body, sharp eyes, a hooked nose Wizardy and, of course, the classic master hat. Ideal Gandalf, just like in the books. Ian McKellen's Gandalf, on the other hand, it's just too boring. It looks too human, sounds too people act too human and not wearing a hat or not has NO ball. Yes sword. In this version of Gandalf Bakshi kills a couple of bloody orchestra kills him with a sword (as he did in the books). And a stylish slow-motion kills. Gandalf is not to be confused with power. And it should be noted that while it is difficult to talk about it, the great Christopher Lee did not bring Saruman alive. Fraser Kerr in the movie made, even with very limited screen time and lines. <br /> <br /> Before I go completely visual aspects of the film, it should be noted that the voice and common presenation with orcs also superior pretendeous Jackson bad guys. Orcs Bakshi to tease his enemy (or each other) constantly snarling, shouting and disgusting language. They are more believable as monsters and more faithful book, in my eyes. Finally, the Black Riders - or Nazgul. These final bad guys are scary ghosts in this one - not only some riders to wear black. And they say with a haunting voice that enchants his victim. My favorite scene in the film when the Nazgul chase Frodo river. While Peter Jackson could not do anything, but just to show the driver in pursuit of the game, baksheesh throws in a nightmare with some cool slow scenes and thunderous sky. <br /> <br /> But, I like this movie more than Jackson, the latter, if only technically better. And it's because of some key visuals. As you know, Bakshi LOTR features a mixture of animated characters (all hobbits, and co-star) and the real actors, covered with paint. I do not really have a problem with using real people in the animation in this way, but they just do not fit very well with the traditional figures of the cartoon. This is especially true with people (Riders of Rohan, zucchini people, etc.) Orcs is another matter, since they are designed to look very distinctive from the other characters. Orcs, while playing a man with a mixture of animation, is far superior version of the Jacksons. They have a brownish-green skin, shiny red eyes, a flat face, and sharp teeth. <br /> <br /> The biggest screw into the film visuals, Howerver, are hobbits. While I prefer to almost every character in the Bakshi version compared to Jackson, the latter is clearly superior to the Hobbits, in fact, they are perfect. With baksheesh you get some annoying and rather mistreated humanoid bambies Disney. And you have to spend a lot of time a movie with them, so keep in mind. Again, the voice is good with them, too, but the actors mouths can not save "damage immersion" made these little caresses. Well, I never liked the hobbit anyway. <br /> <br /> Common failures in Bakshi scenarios are well known. Limited playing time (on a budget) and a lot of missing scenes. Thus, while this film covers almost half of the story, it does not do it in broad detail in comparison to Jackson's version. <br /> <br /> In general, Bakshi version with LOTR has magnificent: <br /> <br /> -overall atmosphere (it feels more Middle-earth) -overall -Musical voice (I actually dig the cost fantasy Conte and Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (one of the best roles of John Hurt) in -King Théoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Elrond (He is not some fairy hippy in this!) <br /> <br /> while Jackson's version is better: <br /> <br /> c it covers the whole story -overall visuals and special effects -Gollum / Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits <br /> <br /> Lord of the rings by Ralph Bakshi, even it is good of course, the shortcomings, it is one of the best animated film Tue, ever made, and it captures the atmosphere of Tolkien's fantasy world is very good, if not excellent. I'll give it a rating of 10 8½.
