Best film Stephen King with her, although this one is more fun than scary. <br /> <br /> This one got all: <br /> <br /> -a large cast of Alice Krige and Brian Krause and amusing cameo from the king himself; <br /> <br /> - well dosed horror in a funny storyline; <br /> <br /> -Great use of music, Santo & Johnny "sleepwalking", in particular, <br /> <br /> -likeable characters in a typical environment of the king: the middle of nowhere village; <br /> <br /> -Many humor. You can not really get a good horror stories here, because it's too much fun and over the top; <br /> <br />-old, but really good make-up effects, they do not do more <br /> <br />! 4.5-: I do not get it really. When was the last time a horror movie was as exciting as this one?
