Yes, it is ultra-low budget film. Thus acting entirely material rewards, and sometimes the action is slow, because the creators of the film shoot long sequences, and not a million moments, which then get edited into a movie. This film fills it with an outstanding script that takes seriously vampirism, explains and develops the full story from him. In addition to the story about vampires, we get the details of genetics, legal and law enforcement agencies, the action martial arts, philosophical speculation, and some good metal. Kudos to Dylan O'Leary, director / writer / actor head. This is me, this man could fulfill all of these roles and make them so good. I think, to appreciate this movie, you should be well versed in all kinds of topics, to see that the writer did a lot of research, and is aware of all these things. There are some great camera work and interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack- something I have not seen before, but it pays to underwater zombies attack in Zombi Fulci. The casting is good, as far as sexy woman sexy for sure. The main vampire also looks perfect for this role. The female victim looks vulnerable. My only complaint is that on a low budget horror flick, there had to be more nudity. If you want to see the original vampire movie with a great story, this film is for you. I look forward to seeing future projects, Mr. O'Leary.
