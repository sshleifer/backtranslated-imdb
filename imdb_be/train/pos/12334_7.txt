Does anyone happen to know where the movie was filmed? Aviation scene on a cliff beautifully. It seems, England. However, apartment house Ivy certainly looks like the Brill Building, with its magical elevators. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendl listed as playing "Sir Charles GageÂ». Maybe I blinked, but I've never seen him. Perhaps he was a lawyer of her husband, but, again, I do not remember that character must be in the film, in addition, as mentioned above, making a phone call. Perhaps he was in the aviation scene? Or ballroom scene? Does anyone tarnish it? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when he was shooting the film.
