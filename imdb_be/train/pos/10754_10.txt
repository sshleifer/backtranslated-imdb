I was a little skepticle, when I have to look at it when it was first broadcast on CBS. I was one of many people who were in New York on the same day, I went to school at Hunter College. I did not want to see all the carnage and devistation again, but, like many I was curious to see what it was all about. He almost cried watching this film. All my memories came back, and only the image intensity was incredible. I bought a DVD of one year anniversary and watched it several times. How do these guys have been able to capture this footage was incredible. If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and check it out. This is obviously a depressing and bring tears to the eyes, but it is an incredible document of the country's darkest hour.
