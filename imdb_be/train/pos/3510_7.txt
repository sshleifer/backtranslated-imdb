True fans will love this movie a real movie. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the trolls, who evaluate the film one star and calling it unrealistic. Although I do not have the background or come from the environment the characters, I spent many years working in the lower-income and working class neighborhood and feel the action was very real and representative, as teenagers behave. I do not know what the basis for other people's comments that the film is "unreal." The dialogue is great. <br /> <br /> low value production budget does not bother me a bit. I felt that the natural light enhances the character of the film. Emphasis was made entirely on the story line and character development and not brilliant Hollywood Mounted or melodrama. <br /> <br /> I completely bought into the motivation and the reaction of the character. The action was believable and impressive for a new and non-professional actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​a good movie or Transformers Fast & Furious, then skip it. If you love a good character-driven drama, you see it <br /> <br />. (This is a negative comment, which are the "trolls" :. Click on their names, and you will see most of the others do not have any reviews or only negative reviews)
