This film was absolutely wonderful. Time and separation pre-culture were recovered beautifully. Urmila gave another brilliant performance. What I really admire about this film is that it does not address the Pakistan-bashing that runs rampant in films such as Gadar and LOC. With the split in the background, the film does not distract policy issues or focus on violence, or what is right and wrong. The film always centers around the tragic history of Urmila life. Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bazhpai was portrayed perfectly. The film really shows how people like the Hindus and Muslims have suffered from this division. Subject that there is really only one religion prevails in this film.
