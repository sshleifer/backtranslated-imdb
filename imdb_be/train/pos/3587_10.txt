I really like this movie ... when I started watching it I thought it was boring pretty quickly, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie and I saw him a few times now. Characters believable, and I must say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green again (the first time the future Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this movie if you are a fan of his, but I agree with another comment made earlier that the end is kind of disappointing. I would like it to happen a little bit different! Nothing, however, a good story exciting.
