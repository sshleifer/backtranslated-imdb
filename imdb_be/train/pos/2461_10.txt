Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet" hits all the marks. Acts as an excellent 70mm gorgeous cinematography, Oscar nominated costumes and decorations are stunning and expense Patrick Doyle (also Oscar nominated) is a sensitive and touching. Oh yeah - the script, some guy named Will S., is not so bad. Film critic ribbed Branagh for the fourth Oscar nod for the film "adaptation" of the script, but his decision to use the full text was fearless one. I can not think of many better ways to do four hours fly <br /> <br /> Almost every decision swearing does the job brilliantly :. Use of Blenheim Palace in England for the exterior, Edwardian dress and statement "to be or not to be" in a hall of mirrors, to name a few. The casting of Hollywood stars such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in minor details can be distracting, but . The main niggle is cast excels: Derek Jacobi captures the conflicted character of Claudia, Kate Winslet acutely reflects Ophelia's descent into madness; Julie Christie brings a passion for her image of Gertrude; Richard thistles hell perfect as treacherous Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell raises potentially thankless role of Horatio in the apotheosis of true friendship Every speech, every line, every word, delivered with passion and conviction,. have not wasted time in the whole film final scenes to increase the scale of Shakespeare in a way not possible with theater. devices. <br /> <br /> Branagh's "Hamlet" bold, ambitious, and ultimately successful attempt to match the greatness of Shakespeare's language and poetry with an equally eloquent image. This is perhaps the greatest Shakespeare adaptations ever filmed ?? strong praise, but deservedly so.
