Dirty Harry has to find a rape victim, extracting revenge by shooting her in the goolies ringleaders, before killing them. Perhaps a more appropriate punishment would be to allow them to live after the first shot, and let them suffer forever as she and her sister ... Anyway ..... futuristic story again set in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The main perpetrator, played by Andy Drake suitably vile and receives his sentence at the end (of course!). Nha classic film, but it is better than the other for the original Dirty Harry, except.
