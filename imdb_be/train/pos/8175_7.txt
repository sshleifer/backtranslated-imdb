Before we begin, I have a fear of dentists. This film gives me the creeps, and even makes me wince. This is something that I love this movie. The film seems boring. To do this, I'm taking away 3 stars! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler alert * <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone, who had just learned that his wife was cheating on him. Soon, he begins to feel hallucinations and begins to torment her patient by killing a colleague, and he even tried his wife to death and killed the man he was dealing with. <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> in the movie is very bloody and mountains. I would recommend it if you are in the gore. <br /> <br /> I give this film stars 7 out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not an ordinary every day the dentist!
