On the top shelf great classic books, comes the imperious story written by Pearl Buck. The book, as the film is called "The Good Earth". He tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) simple Chinese farmer who starts his day with a trip to the "Big House", where he was a slave called O-Lan (Luise Rainer), and made her his wife. Almost from the beginning, it starts to adapt to his kindness, keeping a small peach seeds and planting it in front of his new home. In subsequent years, O-Lan proves its worth, steadily dividing the work of her husband, trouble and changes in the state. Through which the years, they raised a family and follow their simple everyday weather as the feast and famine. In fact, it is at the lowest point in his life, that one discovers the value of companionship, loyalty and love. With the change of time, what their family as complicity and threatened with friends and family, their uncle (Walter Connolly), who is a scoundrel and a charlatan, but a sympathetic tolerated. Wang has his "Old Father" (Charlie Greypvin) to advise and remind him of the delicate and unstable nature of life. Two well-known actors who make impressive performances in this film Keye Luke, who plays the eldest son of Wang and Philip Ahn, who plays the nationalist soldiers. The film is in black and white and perfectly adapted from the novel. Highly recommended for all audiences. ****
