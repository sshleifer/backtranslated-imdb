Traditionally, G-Men, House on 92nd Street, the street with No Name, the FBI now comes the story of one of these carefully controlled films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best light. While the '48 director J. Edgar Hoover was alive, he would be shown in any other form of light. <br /> <br /> In the book, Don Whitehead, that this film is based on a straight forward story Bureau of it is not its foundation in 1907 until about the time the FBI movie story came out. It is important to remember sometimes the FBI was before Edgar Hoover headed it. Part of this time a coated film as well. <br /> <br /> But Warner Brothers is not doing a documentary so as to give flesh and blood of the FBI fictional character John «Chip» Hardesty was created. Hardesty as played by James Stewart FBI career and graduated from law school and instead go to the practice took a job in the office in the early twenties. <br /> <br /> In real life, the Bureau led by William J.. Burns Burns Private detective agency. It was a really rough political operation, as shown in the film. Burns was on the periphery of the Harding administration scandals. If Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional techniques of law enforcement and stringent competency standards, he did just that. <br /> <br /> A Hardesty family that Stewart and his wife Vera Miles, we see the FBI story unfold. In addition, we see a lot of their personal family history, which is fully integrated into the very history of the FBI. Stewart and Milli most known all American couples. We go through some of the FBI's cases involved with Stewart, arresting members of the Ku Klux Klan, a plot to kill the oil-rich Indians, hit the famous criminals of the thirties, their participation in the capture of Nazi sympathizers during World War II and against the communist espionage on the cold war. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of prologue to the part where Stewart tells the class at the FBI Academy before in the history of the Bureau, as it is intertwined with his own. This includes bomb planted on an airline flight to his son, who has gained a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight. Nick Adams will give you goose bumps, like a criminal, and history, unfortunately, is still relevant today. <br /> <br /> Of course, when the FBI story was written and produced today reflects something else, and not all American. However, the FBI has a story to tell, and it is by no means a negative. <br /> <br /> FBI story is not one of the best films of Jimmy Stewart, but this is the first one I've ever seen, with my favorite actor in it, so it has a particular fondness for me. If all the FBI was drafted Jimmy Stewart, I feel much better about it. There's also a good performance Murray Hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who was killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson. <br /> <br /> Vera Miles is not just marrying Stuart, she actually married to the FBI, as the film shows. It is dated in the main, but still has a good and interesting story to tell.
