I have to say, when the "Daisy" Push out I immediately won a fairy tale, as the installation of such gloom. Narrator made the cake with all tests, making death seem like a routine like, well, Ned (Lee Pace) baking pies. And bringing them back to life was just as routine. <br /> <br /> Trio Ned, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), as well as the sometimes-friend Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth, who made the musical Wicked so excited) I made for kakogo- or fantastic dialogue and stupidity. It certainly deserves the title of (romantic) comedy / drama. <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck have done for the shy and not quite ready for love couple, who are still studying their feelings, even if they can not touch - an obstacle that seems to have been not really any obstacles with aids such as gloves, cellophane and quirky graphics around the apartment. But, despite the awkwardness presented as they work their feelings about the amazing secrets that only a few know that they still manage to show them on-screen chemistry in the touching scenes, like when Ned gives Chuck hives. The presence of Olive, however, makes for some moments to pull-in songs in a circular store and unforeseen complications for the couple. <br /> <br /> The second season has fallen sharply, putting a damper on the show, which was a real potential. In some of the episodes, the storyline was rushed and uncomfortable, forcing you to ask, "What happened?" As a whole the plot dead man-of-the-week and the most important storyline. Adding parents Chuck plus two half-brothers to Ned sun helped, and at least one of the storylines felt almost processed (not the episode «Comfort Food» feel like an episode of «Bitter Sweets» that dead people-of-the-week died in eating?). A few touching moments (hives) was to help promote the relationship between Chuck and Ned, but every time they approached, the authors decided to throw another wrench, rather than let the relationship develop (Oliver returned from the monastery, Chuck dead father back to life and do not go back, you get the picture). <br /> <br /> Shame it did not work, but the concept was good and seemed surreal, in a good sense, simply Pleasantvillesque color / happy smiley happens implausible scenarios, to remind you that this is not «Dead Like Me ". Again, this is in the "Pushing Daisies time," according to Fuller creator, so it makes it plausible again. <br /> <br /> It must have lasted longer, but it's just sad thinking at this point. Kudos to that, the new show attempts to replace the short-lived rock.
