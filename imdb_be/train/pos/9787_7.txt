This story is beautifully acted. This is sad and touching about the journey of a young girl to find where it came from and where it goes. Stephanie was adopted by the best friend of her mother, after her mother and father died in a car accident, and since then it has been labeled the "miracle child", she dyslexia and find life a little tight. Its findings on the way affect those closest around her. Her relationship with her guardian and her ex-boyfriend guardian handled very delicately and sensitively, and the entire supporting cast are genuine, 3-dimensional and realistic. Located around the peach cannery in the small town of Australia, is a warm gentle, erotic film, and leaves you with a pleasant sense of when to close loans. After reading some other very small notes about Hugo Weaving, I would like to add that I think it was a brilliant cast, and was extremely sexy. No, he is not Brad Pitt, but that does not mean that it is not attractive.
