Gender Bender Limerick: <br /> <br /> A man or a woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It turns out that "it" and others. <br /> <br /> Sleeping in clay <br /> <br /> Then they all went away <br /> <br /> In one of his UFO. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another excellent season 1 episode. I like this, because the story is kind of where you're never quite sure what is going to happen next. It is completely original. Teaser lot of fun with a close-up eyes and light reflected by the disc. I really need to find my thumb that deceive genderbender heshe does. I really like the atmosphere in the small village of relatives and Mulder and Scully sneak around in the middle of the night. It's very interesting. This is one of my favorite episodes of season 1 actually. I think what I like so much about it as they are strangers in the end and left-wing circles in the fields. Many people see it as a no mythology associated alien episode such as "unnatural" or "Space", but I think it would be easy to see how the mythology related. Maybe, Genderbender was just as alien hunter may seem to look like one. And? Anyway, I give the episode 9 of 10.
