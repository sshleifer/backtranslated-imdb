I was particularly pleased that in this film he was dark-skinned Othello and Desdemona had blond hair, almost always. Throw I played very well, too, and I liked the script following the original text of Shakespeare so accurately. But I must say, some of the scenes acted too sexy for such a nature as Desdemona. I always thought that it is a very modest, which is why it is not right at all, to show her in bed in October - even though it was only in the imagination of Othello. At first, I was a little surprised, even, that the love scene between Othello and Desdemona have been shown so openly. But in general, I liked the movie and especially the dying Desdemona crying scenes.
