I liked this movie a lot, because it is the real story is set in the Amazon, part of the world that has always intrigued me. I believe that the condensed form of the book was published in the "Reader's Digest" soon after the actual event occurred. <br /> <br /> Because I "baby boomers," the character and the actress of my contemporaries, and this is the reason why I connected with the film. I also believe that the film is a valuable learning survival skills when the viewer watches the character following streams leading to the river and coastal settlements, where she could get help, as well as other methods of survival. The most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope that the audience learn something from it, besides seeing it for fun. <br /> <br /> I really adayu to the film will be released in VHS and DVD fast as I would like to add it to your collection of video, also, it should be specified more frequently on satellite movie channels.
