I just saw "For the bedroom door," and it was the first erotic film with a solid history behind it that I have seen in a while <br /> <br /> We will start with the two neighboring pairs. - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington), and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian seems to be a housewife, James lawyer working for the district attorney, Lilian works in real estate, and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeons. Is there anything? Now let's get to it. <br /> <br /> Enter Abby, played a beautiful porn star Chelsea Blue. She rents a house across the street from Fenways and lives alone. Early in the film, James looks out the window and sees Abby has been a change with his girlfriend, Gigi (played by prolific pornstress Monique Alexander) and secretly begins to wonder what it would be like to be with her. The next day, Abby acquainted with all four of them, and it seems a good woman who just happens to live an alternative lifestyle. She makes a pass at Vivian, which seems to be frightened, and said to her: "Oh ... I ... do not like that." It seems that everything is fine ... as long as the plan does not get set in motion <br /> <br / > first, Abby appears in Gabe's office, naked, asking Gabe, she should get a boob job. This is where we get our quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> «Tell me about Gabe." "What do you want to know?" "Is Gabe happily married?" "I'm married." "There's trouble ..... let me guess. Your wife stays at home and does everything you ask. But she's a good girl. "" Yes. " "It's not a bad girl?" "No." "Is there a door that the lock on it?» <br /> <br /> Do you know what will happen next .... Abby gets him of Gabe, right in the room exam. Then she puts on a little show in the window for James, who comes over and does not waste no time in having sex with her. What James does not know what a teddy bear on the piano with flashing red eyes really camera recording on film all the holidays (it is so obvious, in any case). Abby has sex with Gabe later, and this time Gigi joined to make it a three-way. Now that Abby has something on both men, she is asking for $ 100,000 each to buy her silence. . Not only could she destroy James running for office, but it can destroy the practice of Gabe <br /> <br /> While Gabe and James fight their fault, Abby finds time to entice Lilian - who "experimented" with women in college, it was a long time ago, but you do not know what to see it in action with Abby. - she looked like an old about <br /> <br /> While Gigi goes along with the plan, it seems to be jealous of all the sex her friend has. "It's just business," says Abby. Recognition and apology necessarily follow, as some countries information about the true identity Abby - I think she did the same thing to different people in different places. Gabe and James use the information to fight against blackmail Abby. <br /> <br /> Now, onto the floor. The sex scenes were pretty good, and taking all the women in this film, except for Julia Kruis account has a long background of porn, I would not expect anything less. Nicole Sheridan four scenes from the movie was the best, with a three-way to the future for a moment. Monique Alexander received only the naked once, but it was a relatively minor character. Julia Kruis was the main character and got naked the same amount of time. I believe, because it was surrounded by experienced professionals hardcore, it should not have so many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> In order to wrap, "For the bedroom door" I was a great story, which enhanced the overall grade of the film. I think this is tapeworthy <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good in this film - it is better than its more recent proposals comedy Fred deer Ray, at least, it can do some drama Chelsea Blue has been .. . a scene stealer -.... it was not as bad as the antagonist, I would give her all by herself and Julia Kruis was her usual self, I want to Monique Alexander had more time for a person in this film, though) <br /> <br /> Gender :. B (hard, very hard sex scenes performances Nicole Sheridan were almost as hardcore Chelsea Blue looked good in his scenes, and two girls-girl offers not shrill, but they do not warm up the screen ..) <br /> <br /> History: . B + (I liked the dialogue and storyline Chelsea Blah performance was good for the genre, and I was impressed with the turn Nicole Sheridan in the drama) <br /> .. <br /> as a whole: .. B (It was a good movie erotic, I am glad that I was able to observe this, I was pleasantly surprised when Chelsea Blue has always wanted to do more of them, it would welcome e anytim this applies Nicole Sheridan, too -. despite the fact that she, probably best to do a comedy. I'm not against hardcore girls who can act to make Softcore movies.)
