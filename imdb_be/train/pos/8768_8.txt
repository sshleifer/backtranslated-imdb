I saw this movie at the store in the cheap section. I actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailers to them years ago. I thought, "what the hey" and bought it mainly because the plot sounds interesting and Claire Danes has always been one of the talent in my eyes (this was well before I became a big fan of Kate Beckinsale). <br /> <br /> So what about two girls who run away on vacation in Bangkok, desolate for drugs (they are innocent), and then sent to jail in Thailand. a film that will be with them, and sometimes questioned their innocence. <br /> <br /> and Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give great performances, and the plot of this movie is twisted to a non-traditional, and raises some good moral issues for discussion. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good solid film, but perhaps some improvements. it might be more ... it would have helped to strengthen these characters and a deeper understanding of the justice system, politics in Thailand would help. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, besides, it's a good movie with some large protrusions. <br /> <br /> PS For all you freaks pop culture on the lookout for a two-minute role of Paul Walker. I did not even notice it the first time I saw the movie.
