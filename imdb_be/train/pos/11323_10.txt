Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by h-games. Somehow manufacturers shook makes this successful series without any h-material. It could not be otherwise, because the development of the characters is great just the way it is depicted in this series, and any change that may destroy the perfection only. (You'll understand once you see all the episodes). <, Br /> <br /> Despite the relatively slow start (manufacturer took his time to a character representation) things quickly gaining momentum and soon after in the middle of a series of action becomes so strong that it molds you into place. <br /> <br /> series focuses on the theme of the Holy Grail War, which takes place in Fukuky city over the past 50 years. The pilot actually begins with the completion of the previous war and develops from there. Shiro is the only survivor of the fire, which started during the last fight and swept most of city.He reluctant to witness the battle between two servants of what causes it Reiju (St. Mark), to cause one of the most powerful servants in the field of Saber combat. His first contact with Saber left him dumbfounded "This immeasurable beauty ... I was lost for words." <br /> <br /> You do not have to compare this series with any other, to fully understand its plot. FSN offers a lot more than some cool sword fights, good animation, spectacular lights, great soundtrack, it offers a great character and the development of relations. It presents the changes that occur within the characters personalities as precipitate events. Action shows plausible dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of persons (not like the linear type of series of other uses), constantly shapes its identity, to show from under the mask of perfection, invalid characters. <br /> <br /> Saber character tied to medieval legend, which has been modified to conform to the series and should be taken as such. You should not look FSN think that he is not a spectator with historical fact, just remember that it is an adventure / fantasy series, not a documentary, and enjoy it as long as you can. The ending is sudden and unexpected, and had twice as many episodes I have watched them in the same breath.
