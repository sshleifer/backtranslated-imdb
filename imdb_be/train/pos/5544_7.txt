China, which was the lowest since the minimum actually struck gold with this whimsical little thriller. They did the same thing a year ago with the "Bypass", which is probably one of the best low-budget movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Â«Strangler" is basically one set of the film, filled with mist and shadows, the method used by most poverty lines studios to hide collections, or lack thereof. But here, it works well. Ghost Charles Middleton (more popularly known as the Ming Ruthless) rocking around the swamp murder of those who participated in its unlawful penalty for murder and generates some sympathy from the viewer. His last victim to be the daughter of a ferryman ..... he is concentrating his anger not only at those who are directly involved in his life, but their families as well. <br /> <br /> Rosemary Laplanche makes his usual imitation of someone in a coma, which runs for its style of acting. She offers herself to the strangler to put an end to the murder, but as a sop to the audience Strangler see the perfection of her gesture as a sign that his mission was completed, he returned to the ancestors, some punished. If Ulmer (who directed "detour") directed "Strangler" she will be hanging from the nearest tree and work Strangler was to be done. But who's complaining? This is not a story that is the main attraction, but shrouded sets, lighting and general gloom piece. He stands just behind the "Bypass" as the high point of China
