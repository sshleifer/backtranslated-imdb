Citizen X says about the real life drama of the search for a serial killer dubbed the "Rostov Ripper" It's a great film shows the long journey it took to try to apprehend the killer. The film shows how politics can HAVER helped the killer to continue his fury for more than 12 years. (Perhaps, more than 50 victims, mostly women and children) Performances Stephen Rea as the lead detective and Donald Sutherland as a general guide for the investigation was superb. Jeffrey Demanov as the Ripper Andrei Chikatilo. This type of film that will mesmerize you and immediately you have the Internet, exploring the real case. This is a film not to be missed. This is not a debut, I believe, on HBO and never get a theatrical release in my mind. great film
