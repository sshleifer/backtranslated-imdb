I studied the novel by Charlotte Bronte in high school, and he left me a striking impression. There was a beautiful novel about the struggle of a young woman, to find love and acceptance in the dark days of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and an ordinary character with a strong mind and a will of its own. Her story is told through the eyes of its own Bronte Jane was both boring and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our study, we observed in 1983, the adaptation of the story, and it blew me away. Mini-series does not only make an effort to remain faithful to the original text of Bronte and the essence of this story, but the actors portraying the characters were simply excellent. And Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (lover Jane, by the name of Rochester) brilliantly captured the essence of their characters. I can not imagine anyone in their roles. (The rest of the performances of Rochester in other versions, such as the 2006 version lacks enthusiasm, energy and tenderness needed to reflect the Rochester exactly. I'm saying that Timothy Dalton took the first place, because it has all of these characteristics in its portrayal of Rochester. ZIL Clark not only looks like Jane Eyre, but it captures the quiet Jane, but firm and passionate nature brilliantly. she is holding in his emotions, Jane books at appropriate moments in history, but allows it to fire to go out in Jane hot scene . chemistry, Clark Dalton and draw in their scenes also with the trust and loyalty of Jane and Rochester committed relationship.) As well as supporting actors fit their roles perfectly, and kits suitable for the Gothic character of the story. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this version of the classic fairy tale Bronte. If you have not read the book, you can watch this production, the exact introduction to this remarkable story.
