At a time when Hollywood is making money, showing his weakness, despair, crime, drugs, and war, and is this a movie that reminds us of the concept of "indomitable spirit". If you feel beaten up, this film will free your mind and set you soaring. We all know how hard can life be, once we recall that the persistence and courage we will get later. That's what this film has done for me and I hope it will be for you.
