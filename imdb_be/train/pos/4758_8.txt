After an anonymous call about a spaceship that would crash in the frozen forest, two police officers find evidence that the event really happened, and perhaps one Martian away from that place. They lead to the nearby Hi-Way Cafe, and they find a bus stop, and seven passengers waiting for the reopening of the bridge in the snow. However, the driver said that he had only six passengers when he parked the bus. While questioning travelers, strange things happen in a diner, with the lights turn on and off and the turntable on and off. If passengers are released and the bus is behind his journey, a passenger returns to the diner and uncovers a conspiracy invasion of Earth. <br /> <br /> Â«Will Real Martian Please Stand Up?" is one of the best episodes of this great series. Intriguing story is ironic and witty dialogue, interesting characters and situations, and it is strange and totally unexpected plot point at the end. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "O Marciano" ( "Mars")
