This movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - sloppy installation, little to no continuity, furious dialogue, bad (one might even say, does not exist) acting, nonsensical storylines, frames that are too long and it is perfect ... for MST3K-style riffs, not to mention the «Corpse Eaters Drinking Game»: Scribble on the forms ... take a picture - Sign your name ... take a shot - a bad catch Foley edit ... take a lot ,. many shots <br /> <br /> the only reason why I did not rate it higher than 8, because there is not enough gratuitous nudity and because, despite the insane harmful, it's only for an hour - hell, the film, as it should have at least 20-30 minutes longer!
