I must be honest and say that I bought this movie, not because of the content, but because David Cubitt in it; I know ... shallow, or what? - but, come on, Mr. Cubitt fantastic actor, to say <br /> <br /> I did not really know what to expect from watching this movie, I read the other write those. on other sites, but I have to say that I have been involved in the world of the brothers almost from the get-go. David Cubitt, Theo, and Colm Feore as Ryan is so believable as two estranged brothers, the film passes through their relationship, they begin to try to get to know each other again after the death of his parents. The scene where Theo learns that Ryan Gay played brilliantly, he literally walks on stage and trying to leave without noticing Ryan. - which, of course, it has <br /> <br /> The film was very well known and so incredibly boring, moving, uplifting and a celebration of life in the unit. I walked away from this feeling of melancholy in which Ryan has passed, but also with the knowledge that he has given hope and unconditional love of former drug addict brother Theo. I agree with another reviewer who found the scene where Theo says that he is the father to move, and I would go a little further, to say that I actually vocalised my thoughts on Ryan, when he harshly says Theo, "What makes you think you can be a father, "and Theo simply says" you ". Teo takes time, but it is a small exchange of dialogue speaks volumes to almost self-pity aspect of Ryan, who brought up sharply simple retort. <br /> <br /> A brilliantly conceived film on all counts, acting, directing, writing, etc., everything is so well done. I can not ie go anything else to say about this movie, except to say that it is very difficult to deal with the death of a loved one, but it's done beautifully, in an infinite degree. Respect to the subject matter and the outpouring of love (without being contrite and corny) says a lot in this rather selfish world we live in today. well done to all concerned. <br /> <br /> There are not many films to bring me to tears and give me pause to think about life in general, as well as glad for all the things that I'm not sad things I do not, but this f lm made, it was incredibly uplifting given subject.
