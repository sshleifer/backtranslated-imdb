Little Edie and Big Eddie characters that anyone can feel compassion. Despite the fact that their house was dirty, it is somehow understandable, given their mental illness. On the bulletin board poster wrote that "Little Eddie has survival skills of eight years." It reminded me of when in the theatrical version 2009, Big Eddie Little Eddie says, "If you get stuck, it's only with yourself! "These women have all; beauty, talent, intelligence, strong faith in their judgments and actions. Maybe if little Eddie was not so hard on myself for the first time that something is not working, losing hair, her work, and the love of her life, she would have done it. It somehow ties into what I think it is a mental illness: its inability to take themselves when times are hard, and sees good times ahead. The world will never know what happened if she had not listened to the pleas of her mother, "Come home, Eddie! Let me take care of you! »<br /> <br /> However, for obvious reasons, these dangerous women somehow manages to be brilliant, heartbreaking and sweet, even in their very dirty house. These women were extraordinary, and their interaction with each other to bring the humor and sadness. If Eddie was one of her emotional breakdown, housing that could be, or how she wants to get out of your home, because it feels like a little girl, one gets an intense desire to hug her and tell her that "everything will be fine! »<br /> <br /> Great documentary !! <br /> <br /> 9/10
