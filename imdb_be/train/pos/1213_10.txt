This film really contradicts the first, as far as the origins of the bears on the care and Care Bear Cousins ​​goes. I will not deny. However, if you look at the "part II» as a separate film, it's a very good film. I remember watching it in the early '80s (and fitting in its target demographic audience at the time), and absolutely love it much more than the first film (not that I did not use that one too, it's just that this one seemed a little something extra to it). Of course, it is darker than the first, too, but perhaps maybe that's why he's so good. And deep in the deep as subtle ways as well (that children may not fully understand, but still can be a little scary, because it puts into the atmosphere, and adults look will surely get faster as I now watch this movie again now in my mid-twenties), where you basically have a young girl doing a deal with an evil spirit / demon in exchange for something else. Get the picture? But just watch that as a child, of course, as I said, it may have been a little scary, but nothing hurts. In fact, if something gave me another fantasy game that I could play when I was at that age. I can not tell you how many times I used to pretend Dark Heart wanted to put me in jail, I have to help him capture the bear Care, trying to get me to turn to the dark side of it, and other such things, etc. So this film was also good for my imagination. And it's also got a great emotional depth to it, too. I watched it at least once a week. <br /> <br /> Also Hadley Kay was the perfect choice for Voice Dark Heart (I've always thought so, and I'll always be). <br /> <br /> Now it's just too bad that they never made the soundtrack available. Sometimes I just want to hear Growing up without watching the movie, as well as this. <br /> <br /> «What good is love and care, if he can not save her?"
