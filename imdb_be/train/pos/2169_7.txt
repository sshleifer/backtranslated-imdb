Well, first of all, ignore the last person "review. They recognize to sleep through it, so it is not surprising that they did not understand what was going on !!! As a thriller / horror go, this film is not so bad, it certainly is very watchable. From the opening scene, you get an idea of ​​what exactly is going to be the cause of all the madness that follows, and the end came, you were right to constantly clear. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, it was pretty awful at times and like the old movies go it was passable. Big watch late at night! I give it a 7 out of 10 generous.
