I will not lie, it's a great movie. I saw him about four months ago at a local theater. I saw it a second time, and I was a bit sad in slow stages. Sid (bummer) is not all that is commendable, but Diego (mountain lion, I think) is really good in the film. The animation is excellent, and the story is a touching ending. It is worth to children 10 and under, but teenagers are likely to find it almost sad. In addition, the uniqueness of the characters so interesting. As I said, it's a pretty good movie, but I would rate "Toy Story 2" and "Shrek" above. 8/10
