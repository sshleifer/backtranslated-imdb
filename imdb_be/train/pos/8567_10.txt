I enjoyed the movie and would suggest to anyone just for a good time. Do not take the film too seriously, because remember this is Disney, and it is appreciated by the good clean fun of G. This though some parts may be recognized by adults, but the kids would not notice, especially the "triangle" between Cruella, Cruella Le Pelt and Alonso faithful valet. Glenn Close is fantastic and really made Cruella her own scary and believable, even when it is "cured" of her fur-loving ways, it can strike fear in the audience with her shrills, which literally shake the theater. (I even found myself jumping in his seat, if it catches you by surprise with its "bipolar" as a loving dog Ella.) In general, I'm going to see him again in the cinema, I found that like it so much.
