Well, I must say that it was one hell of a fun movie. Despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty bad, and there were some strange moments when the film seemed to turn dark blue for no reason, I was not disappointed. The story was actually very interesting: the last member of the Poison Clan must track down five other members and find out which one of them uses his skills for evil, and who uses them all. The catch is that during a workout, all of the clan were masked, and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names. <br /> <br /> The battles a joy to watch as each member of the Poison Clan has a different style of fighting frog (my favorite), the snake, scorpion, lizard and centipede. The fight scenes are the actors jumping everywhere, and fortunately, the camera remains planted and uses quite a wide shot so that you can clearly see all the action. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of the film is that history tends to pull a little bit in the first half until the first battle sequence. But stick with it and you will not be disappointed!
