This whole movie is worth watching just for the wonderful last minute - his best ending of any movie I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, just fine. <br /> <br /> I found this wonderful film, even a French taking yourself too seriously deep matter what happens. I loved it - it's a great love story. And I loved how the Algerians were woven in - and, by the way, the music during the end credits is great. I want to CD!
