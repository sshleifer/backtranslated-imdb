This trio of fairy tales, "Shakti", "by Devi" and "Kali", an experimental commune (or some such thing) is a group of Taylor-Eriksson, who took people on a trip in itself, and in the realm of unknown, and left little damage here there, I'd say. Many years later, some of these injuries are still hiding and waiting for the right moment to show themselves. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband had died under mysterious circumstances, in fact, he was torn, and the suspect was a man who can not exist. It seems that this woman is capable of projecting some inner demon, or because the person finds his sister, who was killed when she tries to talk to the woman, while posing as a reporter. Devi tells the story of a young man who wants to "jump out of his skin." He was a skinhead, speed freak and sent to a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of this community, which leads to the good doctor, helping a young man to realize his wish. This is perhaps the best of the three segments. Colitis tells the story of a doctor who is trying to "treat" a woman who has been part of this community and lets loose a demon that lived in this woman, but a miracle when he did it, or if it is weakened, because it does not I could survive in it anymore. All three of these tales is quite terrible because suspenseful you never quite sure what to expect, and the room, and settings so unlike conventional horror films, he adds to the strangeness. It's kind of a low-budget look and feel to it, but he also managed to conjure up a pretty eerie atmosphere around, to his credit. I watched it with false mouth open most of the time, and when they came to a real panic (and blood), he hit pretty hard. I found it very interesting and disturbing movie, and liked it very much. Good little find, this is the one I would give it an 8 out of 10.
