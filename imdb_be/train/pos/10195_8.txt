Joe Don Baker is one of the few actors who are often better than his stuff, and almost always under estimated. He was in the tone of a movie or as a heavy or a hero, and has the type of strong, solid presence, Wallace Beery made a half-century before. Baker can deliver material that will sound funny coming out of another actor, and that's what's so cool about it. He really seems to mean what he says, no matter how clich√© it is obvious or silly, that puts it in league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. This is what has made walking Trilogy work so well, and that's the magic here in FINAL justice. This was a significant success in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it's aged much better than many of the perhaps more well-known click-era actions. Moving the action from Texas to Europe, there is a real timeless quality that does not shake you from the action on the screen. Frankly, I've always enjoyed movies Graydon Clark, who is director of the no frills in the same vein as the 1970 th years, Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his best. COMPLETION OF JUSTICE is one of the lost gems in the late 80s, the same MAN ON FIRE in true grit and violence. I believe that if they do it over with The Rock, is a whole new audience will love it as much as I do.
