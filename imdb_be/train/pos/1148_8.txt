This is one of those movies - like Dave, the American dreamer and local hero - which keeps time interest the viewer again and again. Lightweight films rarely win the Oscar, but the one who did the casting deserves one more foam. Even after one has seen the film and knows what will happen, it's still nice to look at how the various aspects of the development of the plot. However, the whole drama is a melodrama; but it is quite appropriate to a film with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now, why can not I write crap like this," I think it is a pity that the television and the Internet censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation.
