watching it as a kid. Although I would probably find it a god-awful now, it was a good-natured horrible things, as I was only seven or so. I also recall that work on Saturday afternoon puzzles while watching, so I do not really paying much attention. However, the scene with the rolling boulders has since been burnt in my head. I asked many people, when they have seen the film, but to no avail. 12 years ago, one man said that perhaps he had seen, but he thought it was only a dream; bizarre chatter, like the wind. This is not a dream, my friend. Nha dreams now. Again, I have not seen him since, but I can not wait to find a copy and stuff it in my VCR. Anything that can be built for 23 years in my mind deserves a "10".
