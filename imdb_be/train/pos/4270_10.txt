Ko to tamo PEVA is the best comedy of all time. Believe me, I've seen a lot of movies and comedies, but tell me, which of them will make you smile every time you watch it. But the truth is that the humor in this comedy is special.It caratherisic Serbia. And all the former republics of Yugoslavia, know it very well !!! So I think that the rest of the audience (eg, in Europe) can not enjoy it so much. Since opening subtitles spoil things. But they should at least try !!!! Yes, it's ironic! This is the best film in the history of Serbia, and the world does not understand! :-) If you have a chance to see this, did not blow up OK!
