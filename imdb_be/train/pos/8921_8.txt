I look at this page, and seems to be frowned upon I have to listen to someone Rove and recitation in the real classics. Of course, I agree that all have an opinion, but here's my: <br /> <br /> This film should not be missed either classic horror observer, and should be considered a lot of casual viewers around the world. Of course, he lost some of his sense of smell and grandeur with age, especially in today's world of CGI effects, but that's not why you should like it. <br /> <br /> You have to like it, because it really is a horror film, even for today's standards. This is a common ickyness will creep you in the same way as the original audience, so do not slam the classic, if you did not give him a chance. See, but not with a critical attitude. Be careful to have fun, as it was originally intended.
