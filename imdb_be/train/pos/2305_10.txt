I thought that it was a very good movie. It would be nice to see a little more in a film about two sisters, knowing each soul the same boy, before he was killed. I am sure that if the film was made in such a way, it would be quite the other end, which is why it made this move a good movie. This shows that no matter what happens in your life with your brothers and sisters, you can always get through it, and that if this 2 sisters deal with the boy (the same boy), which works through the pain and the pain It is doing things to look better and easier to work out between the two of them. It's good to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life, you can still get through it to become even closer after it again. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I'm still at the moment, when we are talking about. I seem to find myself watching it every time it comes on. It would be nice if there would be a part 2 to this film, maybe having an older sister to come up and have a child, it would really make a great finish the story, as he died, so he will keep it alive despite the fact that he's dead.
