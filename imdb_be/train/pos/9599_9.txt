I saw this film at the film festival in Santa Barbara film, and there was not a dry eye in the house. It's incredible to see not only what a great man Darius, but how great the rest of the team and also at such a young age. <br /> <br /> It also made me think how disgusting MTV was, and how to time the opportunity to engage and inspire in a positive way, they refused. It indicates whether or not they take care of the youth and their audience in general. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful and heart-warming true story ... your cloth, but it's great to see how caring and inspiring the youth of today can be.
