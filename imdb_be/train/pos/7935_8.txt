Hood of the Living Dead was a lot to live up to even before the opening credits. First, every game "... Living Dead" is the Holy Mr. Romero and instantly sets the high standard to which many of the films can not afford to seek. And secondly, my movie-watching the satellite professed doubt that any urban horror film Leprechaun exceed seminal The Hood. Skeptical, we settled in the watch. <br /> <br /> We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and kind-hearted zombie film. Oh, of course, the budget is low, and, of course, the director's fans friends settle an actor, but Hood of the Living Dead love zombie movies ~ d. Cheap? Yes. But when it's cheap, you can clearly see where love holds it together. <br /> <br /> Rico works in the lab during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night. He dreams of moving from Oakland. Prior to this scheduled flight, however, his brother shot in driving past. keen scientific mind Rica possibility is superior or CPR 911: pilot injection regenerative formula his laboratory. Unfortunately, little brother wakes up in an ambulance as Oakland bloodthirsty zombies! Chaos and lawlessness! I think that it is more economical to eat your enemies than to avenge in driving past, but then again, I am a poor judge of the complexity of urban life. (As a poor judge? In response to the bloody scene involving four men, I suppose, "Ah-ha! White T-shirts at all, so that the blood shows up. Cost! I used the same technique in my low-budget horror film." Said Jordan "No, it's a gang dress. White shirts were banned from New Orleans bars for a time as a result." Ah.) <br /> <br /> many movies are in someone's living room, so there is a lot of hanging and waiting for the zombies. But the characters are cute, and the film sincere-- it exceeds your budget in the spirit. <br /> <br /> Zombie explanation: If a man plays God, there is a zombie! Or maybe: Follow the FDA approved testing rules before experiments on humans! <br /> <br /> contribution to the canon of zombies: It is the first zombie film that I saw with driving past. As for the real zombies are coming, the infection spreads from the bite, as usual, but rather unusual head shot entirely work-- heart of shots that kill. Zombie pulses, the absence of which proves the true death. And these zombies are doing is pretty cool Jaguar Growl sounds. <br /> <br /> gratuitous zombie movie in a joke: a mercenary by the name of Romero. Groan. <br /> <br /> Any zombies: Jaguar-noise small zombie brother, of course!
