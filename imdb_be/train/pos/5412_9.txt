As a fan of Pokemon, I enjoyed this film very much. It introduces a new legendary Pok√©mon (as does every movie), and adds the depth of the relationship between his characters. I, however, do not wait for those who do not enjoy the Pokemon fans (This includes most adults). Some of the lines were commonplace, but it may be somewhat inevitable when copying films in English. Animation was beautiful, but had a couple of pieces that do not look good. Although the villain seems trite, I think the film did a good job on the bike through the different types of villains, and I guarantee you that they are not all like this. Those who do not like it, I say to each his own, but supporters of the Pokemon will love it.
