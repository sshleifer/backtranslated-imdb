I'm a huge fan of Woody Allen, and so when I saw that it plays in the movie, I could not help myself. I wanted to see how Allen would follow his magnificent film Match Point, seeing as this is one of his films shot in G.B. (Which is unique among the Elena), and that seems to be his new muse, Scarlett Johansson. Scoop is much easier than the MP and the humor is the most enjoyable aspect of Scoop in. The plot revolves around the character Johansson (journalism) student who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman), and it must decide whether or not to find the truth. Oh, and all this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allen. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the performance Johanson, but I'm a little biased, I could watch three hours film with Johansen in the frame of history and remains fascinated. It plays a ditsy, yuppie favorite awkward, which is kind of a variation in the sense of a stereotypical character neurosis affected Elena. It adds the appropriate body language for comic effect. Needless to say almost everyone who sees it will find character Johansson sickly sweet, and that's a plus. <br /> <br /> Elena Allen ... He still plays the same character, the same as Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. What is happening in this film makes me wonder, when I see a little bit neurotic hypochondriac again however. He was not in the cast of his next painting and spends more time behind the camera only recently ... <br /> <br /> Jackman as enjoyable as the suave, suspect in the murder of a millionaire. I can not say that Jackman is not doing anything in particular, to its role, but it does not suit his character nonetheless. <br /> <br /> With a plot point of view, I can not help but feel that it is fresh ... actually stinks The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johansson and Allen greater detective like anything. However, I have to welcome Helen to its end, because it is a bit smarter than your typical unoutstanding version of a Hollywood movie. Instead of all be black and white, all are painted in shades of gray. Being completely innocent, it has nothing to do with him and not make an unequivocal guilt. Although the plot very old man Woody still has a knack for liner. I found it hints at his latest movie is interesting ... Let's for humor, laughter and fun. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you enjoy watching the work of Elena. If you do not see something else ...
