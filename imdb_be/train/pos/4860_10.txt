A Damsel in Distress is a pleasure because of the great songs of Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a terrific supporting cast, led by Grace Allen and George Burns. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, a stupid story for Astaire movie has him as a star of American dance in England with Burns as his publicist Allen and his secretary. They come up with the story that it was a mistake to love with women victims of his left and right. He works in a font that is being held captive in his castle on the power aunt and dutiful father. Stupid story. <br /> <br /> Great songs include foggy day, things are looking up, good work if you can get it, and I can not be bothered right now. Fontaine does not sing, but makes a short (and decent) room with Astaire. Surprisingly well in several dance numbers with Aster are Burns and Allen, including inventive and fun romp through the amusement park. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (Albert), Ray Noble, and my favorite - Ivan Duggan as a leading madrigal singer <br /> < br /> Ian Duggan is in the middle swoony trio that sings nice work if you can get it .. its funny facial expressions. She was also the scene of the kidnappers in the W.C. Fields comedy, old-fashioned way, playing Cleopatra Pepperday. <br /> <br /> A lot of abuse was heaped on the film due to the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as already mentioned, it would be terribly miscast. TCM host notes that were considered by Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews. Slave. Two other potential disasters. Fontaine well as Alyce and allows dynamic musical numbers belong to the Aster, with enough comic Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Fun movie, great songs, good pronunciation, and Ian Duggan in a rare spotlight!
