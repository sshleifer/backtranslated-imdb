This is one of my favorites. Great music and some fun bits. I laugh every time to Millie, the maid, pretending to be a debutante, holding the dainty handkerchief, chatting, and mindlessly polishing the furniture with her as she talks. I just can not ever pass her French accent is never a problem, as they try to pass it to the boss's daughter. <br /> <br /> Seeing teenager Mel Torme and very young Frank Sinatra singing is fun. My mom saw Frank Sinatra in the theater at about the same time the film came out. She said that they could not clear the "Bobby-soxersÂ» between the films (in those days, you should not leave between the indices). This film shows how appealing and attractive young Frank and to evaluate his early talent as well. And Victor Borge gets a little in his usual, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting film with a sweet, simple story. Nice to meet you.
