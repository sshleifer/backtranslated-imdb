With a wave of Austen films of the 1990s, this is my favorite, even more than "belief", which was the one who converted me into an Austeniana. Before you see the "Emma" I have seen the two previous versions, but in one Emma, ​​seemed all wrong, more lady-pile, and in the second half it seemed like it might impostor, while here it seemed just right, young and dumb and stubborn. In general, I think that the attitude and atmosphere of the production of the charm of the novel is extremely well; in fact it is one of the most enjoyable, fun things I've ever seen, and in the nature of Christmas treats. Scenario unusually well-formed, and the application in the adapter as a ray of light, which shows Harriet Emma in the church, all in storage. Mark Strong as Knightley's not what I would expect, but I enjoyed it very much: he strongly manifests usually say, the practical side of the character, unlike Emma affectation, and his choleric attacks on Frank Churchill's pretty ridiculous, Bernard Hepton does g Woodhouse figure almost Carrollian absurdity; Samantha Morton, as a protege Emma just as soft, just as firm as it should be. And, as in the same producers of "Pride and Prejudice" taken measures that are possible characters can be trusted connection - definitely in some cases. For me, this production has been and remains a delight.
