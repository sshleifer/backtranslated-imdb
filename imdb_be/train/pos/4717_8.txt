How can anyone not like this movie? I think it is a fun parody of the old gangster films; If you've never seen them look at it instead. Michael Keaton has the ball in this role, how things are going. One Man mutilated every time he speaks English and Griffin Dunne plays the clueless D.√Å., but my favorite part has to be Joe Piscopo. He has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston in this movie star, lampoons gangsters lot funnier than the "Mafia" made for thugs.
