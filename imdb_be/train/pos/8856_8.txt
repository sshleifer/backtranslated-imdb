Game devil begins promisingly, the installation of simple robbery that goes awry, reported in various aspects (in Rashomon style). Around the hour mark, Sidney Lumet makes this film that much more than the sum of its parts; it eventually turns into a multi-faceted family drama exploring the full scope of human emotions / relationships, as the story comes to its climax Scarecrow. <br /> <br /> As with Lumet, he manages to persuade exceptional performance with its stellar cast, without any notion of excessive action or parabola. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character, and often overshadows Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother Hank. This does not mean that the hawk is not bad; in fact, it is quite adequate to the above, in the troubled role that suits his style. Marisa Tomei is perfect for her relatively brief appearance (the fact that she bares her flesh adds to it). Albert Finney character (Andy and Hank's father) is the most intriguing, and in my opinion, he deserves a little more screen time. Amy Ryan is also doing its job properly. <br /> <br /> Game of the devil is not an exceptional movie, but it proves that Lumet was still at the top of his game in the (imaginary) twilight brilliant career. Many of its features and trademarks are here, not the least of which involves the use of its characters. Charged with the script killer (no pun intended), the clever dialogue and the stimulation and worthy assessment Games Devil is a must see. Really underrated gem. 8/10. 3 star (4). If you just enter their Top 250 248. Highly recommended.
