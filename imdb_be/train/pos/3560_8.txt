Mankiewicz Sun remembered most today as one of the best directors in Hollywood history, but this film proves that it is. Already a success, making the complex American drama, such as the Letter to three wives and All About Eve, as well as the successful adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar to life, Mankiewicz makes an amazing job bringing this hit Broadway play movies, and do it with style. Marlon Brando is ideal as Sky Masterson, even if he can not sing very well. He is the only actor who could pull it completely wit its apparent coolness and clarity. Frank Sinatra great singer, as expected, and does a good job acting as Nathan Detroit. Gene Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando hiss with great chemistry. All support the actors do their role, especially Sheldon Leonard, Harry the horse is very funny bit. However, Mankiewicz should be given most of the credit for that fine musical in its own right on the screen in such a way that it feels real in many scenes, but still the story in his own world. In general, Guys and Dolls is a great music and works on many levels, it usually should not have.
