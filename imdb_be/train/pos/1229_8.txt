I waited long before seeing it, like all the reviews that I've read about it said that it was terrible! I rented it was expecting the worst, and while it's unlikely best Sandler movie out there, there's a lot worse! Sandler often talks to the camera, and the film does not take itself seriously, but it's all part of the fun! A great way to spend the day, and you may even find yourself laughing once in twice! A good film, well worth the rent!
