Diego Armando Maradona, and is still the best player, the game offered. Not just an athlete, but an artist. It documetary if the World Cup in 1986 will live forever in the memory of every football fan in the world. Because of its huge and unbelievable goals, that he killed against their own country (England). There is absolutely no sense of decreasing the star. Although I do not undersand Spanish, I can appreciate the Argentine storyteller. In fact, he was crying from happiness, and can hardly express emotions ..... All that I have written can be meaningless and difficult to understand, but readers ..... you have to look at it to know what I mean in mind.
