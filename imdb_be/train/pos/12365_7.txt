I'm surprised no one has mentioned that there are two versions of the same movie. Lion's video in both the same, but here is where they differ: In one version (the version that I have seen most often on the TV broadcast), a group of clergymen, who guarded the gates consists of "Brotherhood of Guardians", a (fictional) splinter group priests and brothers "excommunicated" from the church. In another version, which I had seen only once on television, clerics, guarding the gates are depicted as priests of the official church, ie the Archdiocese of New York (or, perhaps, Brooklyn). In addition, in the previous version, most of the relevant scenes, the priest is called "brother" (and in some scenes, you can see where the mouth speaks, "Father," yes, but the audio dubbing says "Brother" so-and-so. in the latest version, I believe everyone is called "Father". <br /> <br /> in any case, it seems to me that one of the two versions more or less partial re-shoot the other, with all the "Brotherhood of the Defender 're scene shot as "Archdiocese" scene, or vice versa. (Kind of reminds me of expressions Raymond Burr scenes in "Godzilla"). I videotaped and ersii off of television broadcasting, so no, I did not understand it. Can anyone shed some light on the story behind these two versions of the film?
