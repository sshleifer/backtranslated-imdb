Excellent cult film from 1979, in which students Vince Lombardi High School faced a new, dictatorial principal named Miss Togar (Mary Raven). Togar a music hater and musical tastes blame students for their sins. Leading the charge against her is easily amused Riff Randell (PJ soles), # 1 Ramones fan, which, most of all, wants to rock band to record their songs. <br /> <br /> Now * that * is an impossible film to resist. First of all, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by artists such as Alice Cooper and the Velvet Underground in addition to infectious non-stop range of Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy», «Sheena is a Punk Rocker», and "Blitzkrieg Bop» are only a few of them. Further, the cast really gives it all its forces from the soles of the ideal choice for the role of the reef; it is a great pleasure. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are serious, like Tom and Kate, the Ravens are well cast against type as the arrogant and contemptuous Togar, Clint Howard, one of his best ever parts like toilet holding Eaglebauer entrepreneur and New World patrons such as Dick Miller, Paul Bartel (especially interesting as a music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele fun as always. And, of course, it is a pleasure to see The Ramones play themselves. <br /> <br /> The film is the true spirit. The energy level is high, one of the stories written and directed by Alan Sheet bringing more flair to the cause. There's also a great sense of humor. Gag paper airplane is an excellent example of this. It extends right to the style of "wipe" transition stage. There are even funny giant mouse created in the future make-up effects distinctive Bottini, in one of their early gigs. <br /> <br /> About as good as the credibility challenge, defend-one's-deal movie party can receive. "Rock 'n' Roll High School", very simply, a great cult movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
