Either or, I love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this film. I again visited it many times, and he always keeps. A little too stylized for some, but it seems to me that any opera lover will love it. Zhuison, Fellow Canadian, has a better chance with his films and his cast, and it almost always pays off in the film that are not in the center and somehow delicious as this one. I have often wondered at the small number of acting roles Cher, if she chose to minimize this part of her life, or she does not receive a sufficient number of good roles to chew. I found it to be a great actress who can retreat into a role, as in this particular one, or be loud and brash and violent, as in "The Mask." I have discovered that the comedic strokes ample time (a hair salon called "Cinderella"), but it was the whole goal as a writer and director. Nicolas Page Angst-ridden plays tenor opera, all the extravagant gestures, at one point, asking the knife so that the cut his throat. Brooklyn scenes are magical, this Brooklyn under the moonlight, idealized and dramatic, as well as opera. Overall a very satisfying movie do not like a long shot, I loved the ending, all together, like a Greek chorus, each of the subtle nuances and mixing with the other, the camera pulling away down the corridor, leaving the player to speak. 8 of 10.
