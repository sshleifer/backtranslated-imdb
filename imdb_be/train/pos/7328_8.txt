I liked this movie lot.I rented waiting for something not so bad to spend evening.It was particularly satisfying experience. Some scenes were cheerful and managed well in the film is not meant to be just a silly slapstick comedy, but with some sense and moral values.It controls on both counts.The leads are all good, but especially the guy who's the star, also wrote and produced the movie .I've never seen any of these actors before, but they were nice and I care about what happens to them in the end, who says lot.The script is smart and engaging and has a refreshing feel to it, I think you will not be disappointed, to look at it.
