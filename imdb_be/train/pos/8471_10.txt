This is one of my favorite g-Motos, and I've seen them all. As usual Lorre its self as a charming Debonair Mr. Moto. Etuill pretty funny plays perfectly funny curator, comic routine here, and there are many suspects who glance. This fast-paced and fun. <br /> <br /> archeologist is not quite the same smell as Thomas Beck, the usual second lead in these programmers, but it is adequate. Stepin Fetchit aboard, and while he speaks in a stereotypical manner of his funny lines, not detract from his mind, and he really saves the day in his short time on the screen.
