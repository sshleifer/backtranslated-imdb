So I'm at home, flipping channels one night, and I meet this man to wear heels and makeup, standing in front of a colored background on HBO. Naturally, I did a double take, and decided that I would look for a little while. I do not change the channel until it was finished, it was incredibly fun. The next time it was, I made sure to tape it so I could watch it over and over again, and it remains one of my favorite things to watch. During the first few minutes, you can say that the audience is not quite sure what to think, but he is quickly gaining them with his incredible sense of humor and wit. While many comedians network together in my mind, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing, and it's nice to hear jokes about such things as the history and puberty, when most comedians stick to current events. His show stayed with me after that. I went to Italy for the summer, and all I could think about while I was there it was like "Italians are always going on scooters« Ciao ... »10 10 See. You will not regret it.
