This is one of the best movies out there, and it says a lot that it was for television. I really wish it was on d.v.d. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt gave a crude performance. She played a rookie police, abandoned in the serial killer case perfectly. When it falls apart, because he kills another child it was amazing. She was so lonely, so he gets to her. When she talks about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber as a serial killer was so shocking! He really brought her into his dark world. It was Oscar worthy. When he speaks about the murder of children, scary! When he realizes who she really is! What a scene !! <br /> <br /> They do not make them like that anymore. It was a real thriller, without being gory.
