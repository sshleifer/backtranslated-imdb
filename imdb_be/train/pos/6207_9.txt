I just saw this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Supporters of Hal Hartley will not be disappointed !! And if you are not familiar with the work of the director ... it does not matter. This film could definitely stand all alone. I have to go a second screening ... it was amazing I need to see it again - and fast !! <br /> <br /> This film is very funny. This dialogue is very clever, and Posey's performance is excellent, as it plays a starring Fay Grim. Fay Grim last feature redefines the world and the characters introduced in the film Henry Fool (2000). Visually, the most characteristic stylistic feature uses the routine use of mown (or Dutch) angle, which can often be seen in the works of the past Hartley appears in various shorts, available in possible Films: short works of Hal Hartley 1994-2004 collection, and The Girl with the Monday (2005). <br /> <br /> I watched this film most closely to September 11th. Textually, Fay Grim adventure in the story backdropped against the changed world after September 11, 2001 Without going into serious spoilers, I consider this work, and the story-world as a bold political and original portrait of geopolitics, which rarely, if ever , to the forefront of mainstream cinema fictional post-911 so far (see Syrianna: from notes - Mark Cuban Exec Prod in both these films ... interesting, to say the least.). <br /> <br /> And finally, for those who are closely associated with the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this film is a funny shy and self-referential. That being said, the character of Fay Grimm begins in the film, exactly where it was when Henry Fool ended, but by the end of the film ... the knowledge and experience were shared Fey changed and expanded over the narrative. What could be in store for the future of Fay and family Fool ... ?? I can not wait for the third part of this story!
