For a long time fan of the greatest creations of Peter O'Donnell, I watched this movie on a DVD without any big meet expectations; I actually expected to achieve disgust for the remote control within fifteen minutes. But instead, I thoroughly enjoyed this production, and I particularly liked and appreciated both producers and directors failed to say Modesty Blaise back stories. They managed to avoid the trap of making (bad) film version of the book that we are all so familiar with, choosing instead to focus on the period in the life of modesty is only mentioned in the novels. <br /> <br /> As for the production values ​​(and I'm not a student cinema!): Yes, the film was shot on a tight financial budget and time and perhaps that shows ... but it spoils the pleasure of the viewer? In this case, I think not. Instead, we are introduced to one of the world's largest literary heroines and given a taste of its capabilities <br /> <br /> In connection with casting :. Because we are in unfamiliar territory only people who really matter are the modesty and (possibly) Professor forehead. They were very specific to me. Alexander stage, described by some as wooden and too thin to be the heroine of action led to the poise and coolness of the modesty of the screen; Her technique (when it came to martial arts), but most importantly embodied integrity, which is the basis of the Modesty Blaise canon. <br /> <br /> OK, so we all know that this film was produced by Miramax in the range of n to modesty Blaise character, it was done quickly and cheaply, but ... I, for one, can not wait to see the following products in this series of the manufacturers - as long as they keep to the core values ​​and characterization of original stories!
