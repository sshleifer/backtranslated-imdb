Broadway and film actor-turned-director John Cassavetes (from Rosemary's Baby) creates a masterpiece with this one thousand nine hundred seventy-seven film. This gene stars Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Gazzara, Joan Blondel, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson has a cameo Peter Falk. The premise of the film: the aging stage and film actress (Gena Rowlands) re-evaluates his life after obscessed fan dies in a car accident, trying to get her autograph. The film has a slow tempo and a dark, gloomy, frightening quality. It has a cinematic view of the 60 and it even reminded me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without supernatural horror. Fears here are the ones every successful actress has- it is aging, and it will be useless in her career. In addition, she feels that she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality, humanity and dignity. She lived only for her career- she has no children, do charitable deeds, etc. gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of the film. It falls apart. It is in crisis. Gena Rowlands really falls into the tortured soul of the character and plays the role very well. She's a terrific actress, and this 70-film a refreshing contrast to the often violent films and period movies or disasters or adventure thrillers. This is a film with a lot of deep emotions, but there is a cold, cynical feeling as if Cassavetes criticizes mainstream movies and actor 70s generation. Either that, or this film is a product of the 70s, which was very cynical in many aspects- deception Nixon, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values ​​are not great, and the film is not very well known, it is a very memorable film with obsessive moods. Kudos undervalued and late director Cassavetes, who died in the late 80s.
