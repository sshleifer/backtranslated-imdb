I also went through a very painful personal loss (twice), and this film reflects the gut wrenching reality of this experience is very good, life is out of balance, nothing has any meaning, and the meaning of family, etc ... <br /> <br / > it was nice to see an ally again. She's one of my favorite movie actors. <br /> <br /> I've laughed and cried as the story unfolded. Great story and cast. Well done!
