It is very dark and intriguing horror thriller type is based on the idea of ​​religious killings. The storyline centers on a mad person who lives in Texas, USA, who suddenly goes on a killing spree with her two young sons after being instructed by God to rid the world of bad people. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton, who directs this film plays a crazy father, who is known as the Hand of God assassin while Matthew McConaughey plays his best performances to date, as the eldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton, who decides that he can no longer retain the goods only in its deadly childhood and uses flashbacks to tell the story of obsessive FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe plays). <br /> <br /> I can not think of many films that literally kept him chained to the viewer's seat from start to finish, and it is certainly one of them. Even if you want to stop the preview, you can not because of the sheer power of this film. <br /> <br /> The directors filmed the movie very well, and they help to set the plot through the good scenery, to act in this film is great, but when there is a drawback is that some parts are very powerful and can bother some people. <br /> <br /> While the concept of the film is very dark, small children help reflect the brilliant idea through action. It really spine tingling film and guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat throughout. I highly recommend this movie for those who like horror, anxiety and powerful films, or those who just want to see something else. <br /> <br /> 8/10
