In a sense, this movie reminded me of «Jumping Jack Flash». Remember Whoopi Goldberg in the chopper? Whoopi furious with tranquilizers? Whoopi as Blind Lemon and imitate Mick Jagger? Great moments captured on film exactly, but the film is still bad, is not it? That's how I feel «Rich In Love». Man hears his wife sings for the first time. Postcoital teens talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eating ice cream out of a bucket, and elsewhere, has excellent waking moment about his missing wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character of her acting wardrobe. But there are only whispers the story here, and you can not wait for it to move. Only when the ex-Go-minute Charlotte café in Graz gaining momentum great pop song makes waking paintings ... and then it's all over! <br /> <br /> This picture is equivalent to a lazy summer day in the deep American South.
