By 1987, in Hong Kong gave the world such films as Hung summit in `Clash Spooky Kind" Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic `A Better Tomorrow», `Zu Warriors' and klassicheskiy` Mr. Vampire". Jackie Chan had international success in the video, but it was a `Chinese Ghost Story», that the HK movie was his first real theatrical crossover hit in the West for many years. <br /> <br /> Western moviegoers never seen nothing like it. It was a film that has taken various ingredients used HK cinema for many years (flying swordsman, martial arts dance wildly and supernatural) and mixes them to create a film that was unique in its look, feel and performance. Forget about the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned, is the original and best. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching (hitherto best known as choreographed action movies such as in Woo `A Better Tomorrow 2 '/' killer ') have, under the watchful eye of legendary producer Tsui Hark, We created a masterpiece of science fiction / horror movie. And with such an experienced crew at his disposal (at least 6 martial arts coordinator) chances of the film is nothing but great it would be impossible. <br /> <br /> editing amazingly prolific David Wu (who wrote / directed `Bride With White Hair 2 'and edit those classic games, as` Better Tomorrow 1/2/3',` Hardboiled «and kultavaga` The Club ") is quite simply brilliant. His craft with perfectly choreographed high-flying, tree climbing sword fight makes them one of the best HK cinema has ever produced. Fast moving, strange, but never confusing them, even today, the top of their art. <br /> <br /> The crew of filmmakers also have done wonders. This is a film where every frame is a well-crafted picture. Where lovely blue colored night sequence, ghostly mist shrouded the ubiquitous are exciting platform for the spirit of our history unfold. This is a film where all weave fantastic beauty. Even silk gowns and dresses worn by Xiao Qinghua become living part of the film, the ever present silk flowing in romantic sequences or battle scenes on the screen. Even a simple scene where Xiao Qinghua change of clothes transformed into a thing of beauty as there was on the set every skill combine to create the most memorable scene of such a simple act. Kits also surprising that gives other worldly meaning of forests, and the temple, and the severity of a scorched, flag filled wasteland hell of a strange ending. production design by Zhongwen Xi deserves the highest praise. <br /> <br /> Another important factor in the success of films is the music of Romeo Diaz and James Wong. Hong Kong movies have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of the sequence, but `Chinese Ghost Story» Music, quite simply, vital. At the time of the opening song, the musician becomes as important as the characters. <br /> <br /> The number is the perfect combination of modern and traditional instruments. Drums, bells and guitar pound away over the sequence of actions to great effect, but at a slow, achingly romantic works, he comes into his own. here; flute, strings and female choral effects create what are probably the best pieces of music heard in the film HK. Add to that the female vocals, stunningly beautiful song that plays over the love-making Tsau-Shen and Xiao Qinghua, in (nothing ever seen, but the effect is remarkable. It is lovingly innocent film romance) and you have a striking example of the power of film music, may have. <br /> <br /> And we certainly have acting talent. Leslie Cheung ( `A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2 'and a very popular singer) is outstanding as an innocent customs. His work (fortunately lungs) comic sequences never over, and his scenes with Joey Wang played with just the right amount of passion and innocence. <br /> <br /> Joe Van (who later would mostly assigned to support roles in films like Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau classic "God of Gamblers") never looked more radiant than she does here. She is the epitome of ethereal beauty. Her image tragic Xiao Qinghua is stunning. She shows her characters sadness that it has become and what she did to make, but also produces a subtle eroticism in scenes where she leads a man to their terrible deaths. Veteran actor Wu Ma ( `Mr. Vampire," "Swordsman") great fun as a wise, brave, but very grumpy yen. He walks a fine line between eccentric and annoying with practiced ease. And what could so easily be a character that could damage the film is actually a surprisingly interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> But what about the monsters and the Beasties?, I hear you cry. Well, they vary from the rather rough, but stop motion / animatronic zombies fun that inhabit the temple (as a result of a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to chew on entertaining the unsuspecting Tsau-shen), to pretty bad, but surprisingly effective lord Black. Complete with an arsenal of evil flying heads, and quite outstanding performance wire. Most of them have not, to this day, has not been crowned. <br /> <br /> But the most prominent effect is the creation of a killer language tree spirit. We first encountered this thing in style, sweeping the effects of camera symbol `Evil Dead" as it forces its victims down the throat to deliver a deadly French kiss that turns victims into zombiefied husk. But later he showed in all its mad glory. It can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after mining, breaks tree, wrapped around buildings and coils is slimy length around people before lifting them up and throw them in the trunks of the trees !! It can even burst, to show fang-filled mouth! This is a blatant idea, given the deeply romantic main plot does not work. But this is a fantastic and unforgettable effect. <br /> <br /> So what it all boils down to is a classic example of Hong Kong cinema solutions. The present work is a team that gave us a really innovative cinema. This movie is packed with wit, invention, action, monsters, martial arts, ghost, fantastic ideas, stunning visuals, beautiful music, and most importantly, that it is a strong charm, one of cinemas most touching romances.
