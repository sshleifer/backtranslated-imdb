Kudos to Cesar Montana to revive cinema Cebuano! Panaghoy with Suba very good - it is a drama, action, romance, and a scene that will make you laugh <br /> <br /> While the story is not that original (love triangle -. Or to make a quadrangular love Japanese occupation, riot American as a lord), his idea something cool, especially it uses its original language -. Bisaya for Filipinos, nipongo Japanese and English for the US <br /> <br /> This film will go as one of the best movies Pinoy year. <br /> <br /> Go look at it!
