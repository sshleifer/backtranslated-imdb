I think that's what this film wants to say at the end of the film! Curse or Australian? I still do not know, but what I know that I really liked this film, but it may not be my favorite movie! <br /> <br /> A great story with great actors, but with a terrible end ... To make you cry and say, "Oh, she's so good ..." However, who did it? What really happened? Who is this guy? No answer to these questions ... nya <br /> <br /> The mysterious film with a good sign in general ... I give it a 8/10, going to 8.5!
