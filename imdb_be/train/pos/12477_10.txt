My family and I looked at this film often for many years. It is clean, healthy, mute and touching. Showing us the sympathy between the two families of the two countries thousands of miles away from each other, and the most uncanny coincidences, it is almost as if the hand of God was to be interfering. <br /> <br /> 5 yo Zhodel Micah Ferland, who plays Daisy heart-stricken little girl, does an excellent job of performing the duty of it, and to me she was Priam's choice for the lead role. <br /> <br /> as a whole, 10 out of 10. There are no negative side of this sweet human history. Children of all ages will be tears, then joy to look at it and it will bring the family viewing with smiles and good feelings.
