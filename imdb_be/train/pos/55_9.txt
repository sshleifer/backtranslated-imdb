At first I was not sure if I wanted to see this movie when it came to my guide, so I looked it up on IMDb and thought that the cover looked pretty cool, so I thought I would give it a try , waiting for the film, like an elephant. <br /> <br /> Once I went by that I love Alicia played the character perfectly engaged Phillips, I realized that a good job, this film makes towards the creation of the relationship between Alicia and Deanna. So Alicia Deanna plays Erika Christensen almost throughout the film, but we finally find out what they are, even though polar opposites, they have one thing in common, besides being present at the shooting. They share the loneliness and the extent to which manifests itself as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> I just have to say how much I love this film and was happy to see all the positive reviews about it. I could not even get through the elephant, because it just seemed to be exploiting the tragedy of Columbine. This film, on the other hand, was a convincing and realistic. Busy Phillips action possible chain !!! It's a good thing, and I would like to see it progress in some of the more mature roles.
