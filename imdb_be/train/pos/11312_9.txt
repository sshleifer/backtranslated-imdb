Ossessione is in very poor condition, but is currently undergoing a complete restoration in the laboratory Digital Film in Copenhagen. The material used is the "Master of positive" second generation of the original print Visconti managed to escape from the Nazis. It was tested at 4K Spirit (as 2K RGB-data), and then processed using the software recovery DaVinci awakening. After that, everything else is manual labor, and we do not expect to complete before the beginning of spring. Somewhere in the next year it should be available on DVD and, hopefully, also released on HD DVD. This film is excellent, and we hope that the recovery effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come.
