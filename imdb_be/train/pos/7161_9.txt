Favorite movie. I loved the two families, who cross paths in history. Just a matter of when Sam dies, how to continue his family line? He is not the son of Madame Zeroni and Zero must be related, but does not say about any other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. I never mentioned any other children or wife to him talking to and fall in love with the teacher? Maybe she had a child before becoming kissing Kate Bandit? Even with errors in the film. Just loved it. Action was fine. I do not know where the story was with Mr. Sir as Marion Women in the end, but makes his character even funnier. Another «counseler», it seems concerned about the children, but, of course, maybe not so much. Poor Warden had to have a really smelly because childhood is, if she grew up.
