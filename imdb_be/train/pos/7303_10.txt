I just had time to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Being made almost 30 years ago, I thought that the terrible moments are pretty tame. Boy, I was wrong. There are some great moments, shivers down your spine. Even the acting was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Pleasence was superb. <br /> <br /> On the other hand it can be a bit slow to start, but as soon as it will go to stop him. This makes all the imitators, such as A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream look very tame. I can not say that it is better to Carpenter, because I have not seen that a lot of it, the only one I remember from it is Starman (I think he did it). Halloween is the crown of the horror genre.
