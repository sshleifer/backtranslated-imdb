It was hard for me to believe all the negative comments regarding this all-star movie. I laughed through the whole picture, like the rest of my family. The film clearly defined himself as an old gangster comedy - the players were in hysterics - I'll bet they are good old time doing it. Of course Goldblum and Dreyfus were great - and what about the Everleigh sisters, each of the two Falco, and enchanting music in everything. Rob Reiner made a big laugh limo driver, and Gabriel Byrne ridiculous neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, sleepy nature of Joe and the entire morgue and serious references Digger. Paul Anka was his usual entertaining self, with the added attraction of running scared after Byrne decided to make it a duet «My Way» Welcome home performance Vick. <br /> <br /> I am of the opinion that this film was a comic tribute to Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfus well imitated him. I also believe that no one, at any age, would not even think of imitating the actions that have taken place in this film - it's a joke - not terrible "gangsta" movie. Cars and clothes were great, as well as decorative, "Vicki place." <br /> <br /> In fact, I think of the «Mad Dog Time» as a musical comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, TV criminal dramas and talk shows. I would recommend a video on the evening of family entertainment.
