But this film is full of wonderful <br /> <br /> surprises and performances. He has a stellar performances with <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz and Helen Hunt (including a rather risky nude scene) <br /> <br /> and Wesley Snipes and William Forsythe.

" I was <br /> <br /> extremely moved by this film, it's a hard-hitting, yes, but also <br /> <br /> very tender moments and laugh out loud moments. A rare gem.
