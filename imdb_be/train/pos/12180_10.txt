In my opinion, A GUY THING is a cheerful, witty, sexy, romantic, and does a great chick flick that guys will also enjoy. I thought that Jason Lee and Julia Stiles as a blinded confused groom-to-be, and his soon-to-be sexy cousin in law. If you ask me, they lit up on the screen as if by magic. You may also feel their chemistry between them. Before we wrap this up, I would say that the performances were top notch, the direction was impeccable production design was nice, casting was perfect, and the costumes were designed at all. In conclusion, for anyone who is a supporter of Jason Lee and Julia Stiles, I recommend this film. You are in for a lot of laughter and thrills, so, go to the video store to rent or buy, kick back with a friend and watch it.
