This is a complex documentary that shows a lot of things about the beginning of the gay life. To put it in perspective it was when Gay was the word that is used for homo-sexual revolution, and not just to homosexuals as a descriptor. Or is it still used that way today? I believe that most of the film takes place from approximately 1968 to 1989 he was released in 1993, so it's been around. <br /> <br /> I was touched documentaries, capturing the love of one person to another for some 20 odd year period. Love manifests itself in such a way that only true love can be. There are many scenes of incredible pain and empathy, along with scenes of joy and pleasure. There are scenes of life as homo-sexuality as a gay. The film itself was a work of love, and I think this is brilliant. <br /> <br /> At least one out of the film understanding of the devastating impact of AIDS. As I write this, I wonder how long before this movie, I think, have been installed. Advances in medical, political and social sciences and culture that have occurred since the film was installed (about 15 years ago) weird. However, it is obvious in the case of illness of the AIDS epidemic, we have not done. Heck, I believe that we have not done on all fronts. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's just a damn good documentary. I urge anyone who feels that they do not quite understand, gay life, gay issues, the destruction of AIDS, to see this movie.
