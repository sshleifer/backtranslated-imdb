I watched this film did not expect much and not knowing anything about it. I loved it. Very good, tight plot, intriguing hook in the form of an ugly, fat, deaf girl and ex-Con and at a pace that kept everything flowing without haste. <br /> <br /> It is much, much better than the film De battre mon Coeur s'est arreté the same director, who was sad and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The only thing that did not quite work was the fact that the supposedly ugly, fat girl was not ugly or fat: solid, of course, and far from the traditionally beautiful, but with such a character in her face, that she took on the screen every time she was on it. Superb. I want her to be in more films, and better than those that it generally is. I saw little Gilles wife and little mustache, and they both looked like garbage, and I saw all De battre mon Coeur s'est arreté, and this, of course, nonsense. It seems there are a few coming up, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.
