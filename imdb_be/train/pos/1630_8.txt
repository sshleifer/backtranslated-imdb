I very well may be one of the few who really stuck to this film. I also saw this movie when it came out, and I agree with the last post that Up The Acedemy was way ahead of its time. Humor in the film purely MAD magazine. I do not understand why MAD stand for this function. He was also one of the few films of the early 80's, to accompany the killer soundtrack of punk and new wave bands that came out of the memo at the time. I have a soundtrack, and I'm constantly to this day. What can I say? There are certainly worse movies out there. I do not think spanking to be as funny as Up Academy, there are some really good laughs throughout the film, and the jokes fall either on stereotypes or being laid. Hey, no one said it would be The Maltese Falcon.
