Odd Couple is a comic gem. One is the funniest script ever committed to celluloid - exceeded only Streynzhlav, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends: obsessive-compulsive Felix and sloppy, irresponsible Oscar. Oscar wife has left him, because it is impossible to live because of his irresponsibility. Felix's wife leaves him at the beginning of the film, and after a failed suicide attempt, he settled in poker friends Oscar. That's when the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant jokes. You are probably already familiar with the "FU" a joke, but it still works brilliantly thanks to the comic in time Matthau. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments when Lemmon tries to clear his sinuses in a diner, and when the Pigeon sisters being fascinated respectable Matthau and Lemmon is completely out of his element. This one requires repeated views!
