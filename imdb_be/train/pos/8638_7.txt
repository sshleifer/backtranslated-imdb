David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes plays a young journalist couple who want to go to California, but can not afford, so they "ride share" with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis), to save on costs. The idea is for them to stay at various sites along the path of the murder, the place where serial killers have done their job, because Brian (Spiritual) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) his photographer. What they do not know what Pete (Earley) and .. Lewis is a serial killer and a girlfriend who just goes along with what he says, I do not care Pitt, as a rule, but it makes the validity of psycho role terrible thing the fact that it makes them so good, I actually know people like him before, no, not the killer, but with much the same thinking. In any case, as the road trip goes along, of Carrie realizes that other about money, but Ereli seems to always come up with the cash somehow .. ..never to him that it leaves someone dead here and there to make it though. Lewis makes her role we LL, one that she copes with not too bright waif, who has a good heart, but does not realize that it does not have to put up with knock on Earley as she does what he does not like. As things start to get more unacceptable Carrie insists that another pair of advancing at a gas station, and unfortunately, this is the moment when she is inside, she sees a newsletter that tells her exactly who they were ride-sharing with, then things go downhill for them at a rapid clip. It's not the best movie in the world, but it's not so bad ... I watched that was supposed to be "unrated" version, but I wonder how many have been cut with a nominal version, because it seemed fairly tame me, in really ... not that it makes his family fare or anything, if that's not possible, Manson family. 7 out of 10.
