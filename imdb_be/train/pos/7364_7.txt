It's not always easy to explain what the movie is, but this time I think I've found. It reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (small time criminals killed the drugs and do some silly things Scotland) and The Witch Project Blair (due to the filming style) <br /> <br /> This is the loyalty between them. two friends, one of them gets out of prison, and the other has not yet been caught. With the stolen car they drive through the Scottish countryside, but the ran out of gas. As they try to find a certain amount of fuel, they found a farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer said that they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them. What it all goes wrong. One of his friends accidentally shoots a farmer's daughter, and they have to work. The following people are hunting through the fields and forests of Scotland. Two friends are literally running for their lives. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this film was shot in only 12 days. Well that is not entirely incredible, because much of it is always in the same place: the Scottish countryside, but I still think it's very strange. Especially because it's actually not a bad film. It may not be the best movie ever, but they can still be proud of what they have achieved. I had a good time watching it, and in general, I enjoyed the movie. I give it a 7/10.
