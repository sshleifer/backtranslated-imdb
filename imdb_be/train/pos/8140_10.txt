I first saw this film at some movie channel (HBO?) Some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and CB4 seen in theaters. Anyway, promo for it caught my attention, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, immediately I knew it would be good (CAUTION!), And I was right. Parody lyrics alone make this film worth watching again and again (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and the delivery of the film was great. You have to love satire rap groups (obviously, NWA), some rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), the humor and the three members of NWH. Who can forget the tons Deaf to scratch his ass? It's too bad the film did not get the credit he deserves, as it was overshadowed by the CB4 time of their releases, but, in my opinion, much better film. If you know and like 90th "gangster" rap, you will look and laugh at this movie for a long time. If you can not or do not like "rap", you will enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.
