Let me make one thing ??., For the most part, the mentality of those who run the show in Hollywood openly p * Gossanepidnadzora me at once as a whole and more specifically with regard to its treatment of love, iconic characters from the comic pages. Why? Well, let's take a typical scenario, the Executive Board meeting of Hollywood to show us ?? .. <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 "Hey, there's a lot of dollars to learn from the superhero movie these days. <br /> <br /> A good question Executive No.2", let's take one of the haste, then! ?? we do a happy swimming in a hat and choose a superhero randomly to base a movie on! (drop occurs and the famous superhero name drawn out) <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 «Excellent! Now, how do we get to play the role? <br /> <br /> Executive № 2 "Who is big box office star at the moment? <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 '* name * great actor appears in the things this week. <br /> <br /> Executive NO.2 But it really fit the role? I mean, he's not like the character at all. <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 «Who cares? He is a great name; We will be doing a film with him in it anyway. <br /> <br /> Executive № 2 "You are absolutely right! And besides, we will fill the whole film so full of brilliant special effects, to appease the masses stupid that no one will ever question it anyway! <br /> <br /> The above scenario illustrates one of the reasons why I did not wanting to most of the modern superhero film. All style, entirely matter, but simply pathetic cast of the most significant findings. Of course, to be fair, there are exceptions to the above rule; If Hollywood really gets it right ?? take a cast of the original (and still easily the best!) Superman; Christopher Reeve, and more recently, Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men films. <br /> <br /> But back to the common negative traits reflected in Hollywood today ?? .. would not it be great if our studio executives were always chosen actors who actually fit the role? Well, in this less than perfect world, one director only does it believe it or not, throwing the actor on the basis of their actual resemblance to their comic book counterparts. It is called Collor. Unfortunately (but usually) Hollywood is not as we have still allowed Collora to direct a feature film, but fortunately for us, he gave us tantalizing glimpses of what the end result is likely to look like in two (yet) known super hero short features. One is the excellent Batman: Dead End, and the other is a mockery of the trailer entirely fictitious film called Worlds Finest <br /> <br /> Well, let's not shy about our words here ??. this is absolutely amazing stuff! <br /> <br /> casting Mr. Universe winner and male model, Michael O'Hearn (who looked just as strange, but it was completely devastated in lackluster Barbarian) makes the most ideal choice to play iconic man of steel. . In fact, in terms of physical similarity, no, of course, was not closer approximation to the comic character <br /> <br /> In addition to the Clark Bartram returns fresh off his wonderful images as the Dark Knight in Batman: Dead End ; Again, another very thoughtful piece of casting! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ?? Unless it's really a real, full length film! Hollywood studio executives ?? take note! That's how it should be done! <br /> <br /> As a final note, I once again strongly intrigued by cleavage of this short film aroused fans. It is significant that the most corrosive and passionately adverse reactions against him explicitly to come again (as well as with Batman: Dead End) from the younger, less kinematic study audience; fact gave them a few grammatical primitive tirade and liberal use of basic diction. This unfortunate state of closed thinking really sad phenomenon although above our studio executives in Hollywood, of course, derive great pleasure from. After all, these same dishonest people, in all probability, exactly the same kind of CGI is interested, popcorn filling imbeciles who dig into the most crap that Hollywood churns out on a flood these days.
