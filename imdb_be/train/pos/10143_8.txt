It was a beautiful scene, one of the best in both seasons. Right down to the horror of change, with a story that is way way above average MOH episodes, if there is such a thing. man's wife almost burned in a tragic car accident in which he was riding. Its airbag has been deployed, it we did. She burned beyond recognition (big makeup BTW), and has not given much of a chance to live without a complete skin graft. BUT, even in a coma, she continues to die, but brought by modern technology, and when she dies within a few minutes, her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit. The massacre, of course, follows, as well as some extremely bloody murder, as well as some very sexy scenes. What else could you ask for, you might ask? Well, not so much because this baby has it all, and very satirical ending, which is to leave a smile on the faces of most of the audience. I just loved (Wrong Turn) the direction of Rob Schmidt and he has a great knack for horror. Great episode, this one I'm buying for sure.
