As a Gentile, I have to say that this film has little, if any Magickal values. This "fun" movie magic, and did not mean to teach us anything except that love is the strongest of all Magick, and never use it in a controlled way or vindictive. This is a lesson everyone should learn, not only pagans. <br /> <br /> It has been said, this film is beautifully written and performed sweetly Kim Novak and venerable Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Zhingold provides excellent performance as Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many credits to mention a movie, with the exception of Ms. Jane Marbles with «Murder By Death») was beautiful, like a vaguely-HO- capable upstairs neighbor Ms. Novak Queenie. Also starring Jack Lemmon (great job) and Jim Kovacs (brilliantly witty). <br /> <br /> "Witches can not cry. Why they can not shed a single tear, because their hearts are full of Magick. They do not have time for silly things, such as love". Queenie. <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) is Manhattan witches. Hidden deep in the secret underworld of the craft, they live among other people of New York, as one of them, not so much as with the result that raised eyebrows. <br /> <br /> But, swims Shepherd «Shep" Henderson (Stewart), stable, no-nonsense, dedicated businessman engaged to an old college rival of Geely yang. <br /> <br /> In a bizarre coincidence failure, he discovers that moves into the building and Gillian instantly "bewitched" by her charm and grace. When you use Magica, with a little help Pyewacket (Gillian familiar, trained by Robert E. Blair ) and Queenie, Jillian starts to work in this beautiful new dream man to return to her old enemy. <br /> <br /> But Magick should never be used to control or hurt, and Gillian learns that the hard way in the most bitter image. Not only that, she has to face what she did, but she has to face her guilt Shep. <br /> <br /> C critical point of view; However, the film takes a serious turn: the consequences are very dated to the point of being a clean camp. Some of the sets were, seemingly, was shot in the basement of which a small house, but at least the characters were original and interesting. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, Pyewacket dwarfs. Big cat! More training Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> In a note to the little things, it is the roots for favorite TV sitcom Bewitched. This introduces the original Samantha and Darrin. All the characters notes are present and accounted for. You have but to look to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites, and I watch it often. <br /> <br /> This film gets 9.1 / 10 from. .. <br /> <br /> enemy's :.
