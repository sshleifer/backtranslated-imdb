This is a very intriguing short film by David Lynch, and speaking on behalf of the David Lynch is probably enough for many people. This is your typical Lynch shortly. Blonde and brunette in a dark room. Blonde crying brunette says threatening way to blonde, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> With a lot of quiet moments, but with intrusive music with Angelo Badalamenti, there is an amazing form of uncertainty. This short feels a bit like "Mulholland Dr.", a film I liked, so I liked that as well. It is likely, especially for Lynch fans, but there is a chance that you will like it.
