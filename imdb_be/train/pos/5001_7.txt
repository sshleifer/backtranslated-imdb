Aardman's doing it again. Next to Pixar, Aardman Animation again and again proves how to make animations correctly. <br /> <br /> I had a great time watching the first episode Zhetsony. I thought it was translated well for American audiences. My only concern is that the majority of the audience is not going to get the subtle humor in this show. <br /> <br /> As a supporter of the BBC version, and a short film, I knew I was in for when I sat down to look at it. The animators did a great job, combining pre-recorded voice in a perfect match of animals. Look at the first episode of the goat, which sounds high, and the dog on the street who continue to call «Dawg» each other. <br /> <br /> Is it for everyone? Not by a long shot. In fact, I would be happy to see the show in the past throughout the season. But, as I said, the audience is not going to get it.
