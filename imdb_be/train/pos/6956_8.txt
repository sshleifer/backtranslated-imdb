I must say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was super cute, and I do mean super cute. It was all "sex" content that the majority of Ivan Reitman comedy is there, but with something a lil extra, chemistry. Mind and Luke both have this awkrawrd, but believable chemistry that seems to go beyond in every scene. And it seems to create these weird, twisted and interesting relationship with the powerful "sexual" tension that you laugh until you can not feel your face more. Anna Faris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each other's roles perfectly, and even Wanda Sykes, and a small part will keep you laughing. Although this kind of comedy is not for everyone, but I have to say that I went to the person who usually does not enjoy these films, and he's laughing like crazy. This film is certainly not for everyone. especially young children, as some moments a little too ... well, let's say for the young adult audience. In general, I was pleasantly surprised by this film a viscous ending I found a bit weak compared to the rest of the film. (3 1/2 * 5 *)
