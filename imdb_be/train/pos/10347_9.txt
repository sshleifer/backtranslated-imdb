Lovely minor film, juggling and comedy detective, romance and drama genres as deftly as Lt Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas) balances his devotion to his girlfriend Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondel) and his duties in force as a detective wasp. <br /> <br /> This mishmash may not appeal to all viewers today, but in the day, it had something to offer every member of the family of the current movie, and permission to quite a sense of fatigue, compared with the duty section is original and refreshing, as well as can be expected. <br /> <br /> Â«The Amazing Mr. Williams' contains what must be one of the most outrageous blind dates in the history of cinema, and its bright comic wit sparkles. Ridiculously frocked, Melvyn Douglas delivers some of the best lines: "I would walk down the main street in tattered towel, before I let any woman to control your life", and effervescent Joan Blondel allows its arrows fly with typical aplomb: "Good grief You look as my aunt Nelly '! <br /> <br /> The crime of standard solutions here, but the fine cast of character actors help bring the material to life. <br /> <br /> From today's point of view, "the country, Mr. Williams," is perhaps the most interesting to him penetrating comments on the basis of gender as socially specific design, the more pliable for its seemingly rigid boundaries. At the while most of the comments of sex occurs in a surface battle of the sexes, sometimes it's both subtle and penetrating, playing not only in some of the finer details of the film, but in the battle of the genres, which reaches its climax in the final scene.
