What happens when someone has so much social unrest that they cease to function? As soon as one person can get? If mundane crap we have to do in order to be part of society becomes too much, what happens? Frownland explores these questions. Definitely a strange original debut with Bronstein. Tons of weird and claustrophobic, as we get into a guy called Keith's mind, which is so messed up it is unlikely to form a correct sentence. We follow him around as he tries to make contact with people and function from day to day. Most of us know people like this- people who say "I'm sorry" too much or "I appreciate it," when there is nothing to evaluate. Thus, we know that there are people out there like this, but why someone wants to make a film about them? Well, because it's interesting and Bronstein and leading actor, Dori manna, does an excellent job. This film is about an nya-commercial, the film can get. Several friends rented it for a few years, they have saved money. It was filmed on 16 mm film and scratched look pretty low budget. In the absence of a distributor, it can be hard to find, I think it was an accident screening within the last year or so. Hopefully it will be on DVD at some point. I saw him in Silent Cinema in Los Angeles. There were 10 people in the audience, among them, Crispin Glover, if that tells you something about how strange this film. Highly recommended.
