Some films seem to have to be done before we are ready for them. As I watched this movie, made in 1988, in 1999, I thought I looked O.J. Simpson debacle (although I have very different views about the innocence of persons in a given situation). <br /> <br /> Australian media when the film is to be believed, ate a possible infanticide and the truth was abandoned in hindsight. It was scary to see the stage invasive, swarming hordes of media, funny account and half-lies and the debate over the alleged fact from people at all levels of society. <br /> <br /> Equally appalling is the description of the media as indifferent and uncomprehending of technical information in the case. I want to see more done on the issue of religious prejudice in the case (the accused seven-day Adventists). <br /> <br /> Currently, these circuses have become commonplace, but it only makes it more important lesson. <, Br /> <br /> Streep is excellent, as usual, and this is the best I have ever seen Sam Neill. Aussie accents get a bit thick at times, but not incomprehensible.
