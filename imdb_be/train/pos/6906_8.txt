I enjoyed this film. It's been fun, cute, silly, and entertainment. I had a great throw and actually was killed by some critics, for reasons that I do not really understand. No, it was not the "Grapes of Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was an enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> Julia was an incredible psychotic "man for man." The history of a little silly to be sure, but it's not high drama, folks. I happened to see a review of the film, probably the only good he was, and then crashed into him one night when watching a movie. I've never heard, as expected, Sun stink until I I saw him, and I'm glad that I've seen. in the end bought VHS tape into a bunch of bargain, and I watch it a couple of times a year.
