I saw his film in Dallas, Texas, when he left in 1986, I recall them giving away prizes for the show to see the movie. After watching the film, I can understand why. The film was not bad, and it was not great. The problem with this film was that he was trying to tell a side story. They created a new story, new characters, and tried to wrap it around the Saga Masters. My biggest complaint is that the plot of the second wave of the Robotech Masters to attack the Earth. They even used the same stage of the Saga Masters, but with a different dialogue. As a child I loved the movie. But, unfortunately, I did not see him as an adult and can give a better overview. Looking back, I was disappointed, but now I would like to see the movie, and to reconsider its position on it. That being said, will someone please release this film to the world, to judge? I love ROBOTECH and can not wait for the shadows Chronicles.
