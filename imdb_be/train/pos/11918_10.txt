"Angels in the distant" was originally one thousand nine hundred fifty-one film of Ted Turner's library; Disney adapted it in 1994, this time with the help of the California Angels (now the Los Angeles Angels), as a team (Disney used to have it in the Anaheim Mighty Ducks hockey team, as well as a good use of the words, yes ??? ??). <br /> <br /> This movie was about a few orphans who wanted to start a family. The man promised the children a family, only when the Angels win the pennant. So he called one night about it. The boy who could see he prayed aid, which comes on the way (and the only boy); For example, if the first angel came down, the player hit the ball so hard, not only did the broken break, so did the ball !!!!! For most of the post-All Star season in 1994, the Angels were on the top of the AL West (of which my home team the Rangers is one and it still is). However, they lost the game, because the boy was in court, not in the game White Sox / Angels (Central Division was not in baseball then, consequently, Chicago being in the West), and no angels were there to help . Thus, it created a new rule: No Angels can not help in the championship game. But wait! In the final championship game, the Angels won !!!!! It was really a miracle <br /> <br /> What I liked about this film: It's a good movie. I mean, I prayed every night for the past few years to ask for help at school, and so on; Look at me now! My work was good !!!!! Thus, for one, it shows that if you believe that God would send down His angels to help you with any problems you may have in your life. And second, it is a family baseball movie that is always interesting. This is an old Disney movie as well; I saw it only recently on the New Disney Channel (Blech !!!!!). <br /> <br /> Â«Angels in the outfield," change your life forever, once you've seen !!!! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
