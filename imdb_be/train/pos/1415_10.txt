I saw the German version of the film on German television and I was really surprised. In general, I like to watch documentaries, but I can not remember what I saw, it's better than "Earth". I knew that some of the scenes from the Youtube video that I found randomly viewing. I also remember to have seen the film at media stores, working on the reflected HDTVs. After watching the film, it's obvious to me why the footage is so popular Youtube and management of multimedia retailers among users: It's just so strange and exciting that you can not help but to look at the screen, no matter where you are at all interested in nature documentaries movies or not. <br /> <br /> Without hesitation 10 out of 10. Of course, there are more exciting films, but in relation to documentaries "Earth" is definitely one of the best of its genre.
