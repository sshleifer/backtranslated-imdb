Just kidding. <br /> <br /> You are looking for greener pastures in the form of ripples in New York, Jon Voight young optimist Cowboy (near Forest Gump-type) Joe Buck from Texas. It did not take long for the Big Apple, to mercilessly swallow him and his ambition is completely and very quickly Joe is being targeted as a cold New Yorkers and cons of your street thugs. Given his pure heart, he took pity on one of these thugs, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), and then moves along with him in his apartment, and the collapse of the two literally struggling to survive. <br /> <br /> While the North is labeled as a comedy drama, it is best described as a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy in my eyes. This, above all, a beautiful film that stylishly in capturing the modern hippie vibe of the late 1960s with his mandatory breakneck Warhol party film and comparing it with an ultra-urban New York. The film overflows Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere between them, thereby highlighting its off-site location. We believe him to struggle to fit in, but just to get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy tears to my eyes, it is also rich in content and project a lot of heart. I believe that this film was inspired by Forrest Gump with her pure heart, and out of the place of the protagonist and, to some extent, movies Crocodile Dundee, as is the case with almost exactly the same kind of humor - the contrast between the country and the Cowboys slick cosmopolitan New York. Very convincing and sensational creative film that I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8,5 / 10
