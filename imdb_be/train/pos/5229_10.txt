This film has already received horrible ratings of just about everyone who voted here, but I am here to say, if you love movies like Dude Wheres My Car and Dumb and Dumber the movie for you. If your in films such as Citizen Kane and Casablanca Id sugest you have another corner. Nevertheless, I still love this movie and everything about it, even if it is a kind of «Kiddy» is one of the few films I and my Freinds were able to continue to watch over the years and quote, if possible. GREAT MOVIE. This film has to Addis number 1, because it's so damn high class. The only problem with this film you can not see, because it was made-for-TV movie channel, which no longer exists. So I do not know how to get this movie, id like to buy it for the DVD, but I can not find it anywhere. I still have it manifested from the time when he was the first, you can come if you want, and watch it Bute I could sleep. this movie rocks and explain everything you need to know.
