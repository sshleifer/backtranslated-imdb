While the UK has produced some hilarious comedies and slippery in the 1990s - Ab Fab, men doing bad, one foot in the grave, etc. - 70s were a real golden age <br /> <br /> In the 1970s were. whole new territory to explore, including the sexual revolution, feminism and slowly developing awareness of the need for "sensitivity" of which, twenty years later, it is politically correct. Attempts to deal with the confusion of the modern world have been carefully subtle and not so subtle themes in everything from sketches of Monty Python's Flying Circus for sitcoms like Man About the house. (By the end of the 70s is the "martial arts" has led to a more meditative and sour-sweet comedies, such as the masterpiece of the butterfly.) <br /> <br /> A man about the house is an excellent example of good Britcoms that time - a little secular , bold, fresh, simple, sometimes defiant, with some well-made observations on modern life. Compare this with a cynical '90s show such as Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe that the two were set up in the same country. <br /> <br /> A man about the house is one of the biggest Britcoms 70s, right up there with good neighbors (The Good Life), and about a spin off of the House, George and Mildred. Its quality is evidenced by the fact that - as with the good neighbors - its creators, authors, and many of his actors have continued success in British television.
