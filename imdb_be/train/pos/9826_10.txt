This low-budget erotic thriller that has some good moments, but much worse. The plot revolves around a female lawyer, trying to clear her lover, who is accused of murdering his wife. Being soft base film, which entails it under cover strip club and have sex with potential suspects. As plots go for this type of genre, not bad. The script in the order, and the story has a good sense for someone at 2am, watching it miss too many plot holes. But everything else in the film, it seems cheap. The leading actors are not so bad, but pretty much all support those incredibly bad (one girl, it seems that she is drunk and / or high). Cinematography poorly lit, with everything looking grainy and ugly. The sound is so terrible that you can only hear what people are saying. The worst thing in this movie is the reason you see it, sex. The reason people are watching these things for hot sex scenes with a really hot girl Red Shoe Diary situations. The sex scenes are not hot, they are careless shot in this porn style where everything just a master shot of two people walking on it. The woman also looks like they shelter from the porn shoot. I'm not trying to be rude or mean here, but they all have that breast implants and burned / weathered appearance. Even the title, «Deviant Obsession», sounds like a hardcore movie. Not that I have nothing against porn - in fact, I love it. But I want my soft rod and my evil separately. What happened with actresses like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Uirri and Kim Dawson? Women who could act, and who would fully awaken you? What happened to the B erotic thrillers as Body Chemistry, Night Wolf, and even stripped to kill. Of course, none of these masterpieces, where, but at least they did not feel like a movie. In addition, they are pushing the envelope, which go beyond the relative position of a prude Hollywood on sex, sexual obsessions and perversions. Now they just make movies without malicious willful sex.
