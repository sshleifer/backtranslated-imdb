Viewing most films Ringo Lam, I can say that this is his best film to date, and the most unusual. It is an ancient China of the period cranked full Funky martial arts, where the placement of underground lair full of traps and dungeon plays a big part as any of the characters. Action is fantastic, the story of a tense and entertaining, and a variety of design truly unforgettable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise has not been available on DVD and VHS is next to impossible to get your hands on, even if you are close to the second largest city in China, North America (like me). If you can find it, do not miss it.
