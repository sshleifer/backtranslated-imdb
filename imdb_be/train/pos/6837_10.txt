Typical film De Palma has made a lot of style and some of the scenes, which will lead you to the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> The majority, of course, is what makes this film better, as the average thriller, this is the style. It has some excellent editing scenes and some scenes are really nervous breakdown, which takes you to the edge of your seat. The best scene from the film; Museum scene and lift murder. There are some moderate sex scenes and movie pace may not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this film. So that the film may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also quite good, but it really is a style that makes the film work! This can only be for the fans, but casual viewers should also estimate the increase tensions in the film. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting character is drawn a good throw. Michael Caine is an interesting choice of casting and Angie Dickinson works the same way as it looks good (not bad for a 49-year-old!). <br /> <br /> The score of Pino Donaggio also commonly De Palma movie costumes as well, as well as the cost of other De Palma film, «Body Double». <br /> <br /> Brilliant nerve wrecking thriller. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
