I could not wait to get my hands on this, when I read about Fred Astaire teamed up with George Burns and Gracie Allen in the film from a screenplay resident Wodehouse and music by Gershwins. It is definitely worth a look, but do not have a cohesive quality of Fred and Ginger movies. <br /> <br /> history will probably be better to read the book Wodehouse, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting downright painful to watch (especially the young boy and the maid). <br /> <br /> But ...! Crooked dance is worth more than most films. I never knew that Grace Allen could dance, but boy does it in this movie. Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of the rotating discs in the Funhouse? Imagine tapdancing one high heels! She holds perfectly with Astaire and greatly improves the overall picture quality. <br /> <br /> A few good songs, especially fun nice work if you can get it and Stiff Upper Lip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns and Allen. I had to go back and watch the dance of the curve again once titles.
