Although the film did not go down in the annals of great movie, it's an interesting way to spend a half hour with the family. The film is finally released in the video, where he was to debut in the first place. <br /> <br /> a film about an eclectic group of friends who gather for lunch, which they called «The Hungry Bachelors Club», Jorja Fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down payment for a restaurant that she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays Cadillac loving mystery man who becomes her lover. Fox gives a moving and understated performance and Nana reliable talent, as always. Michiel de Barres is a dial tone over the top as the attorney. The ensemble casts - some of familiar faces - work well together to bring this silly group of characters to life. This is a good car service, and one of the few you can watch with the whole family.
