I recommend the family, if possible, to show it to the older child only.Some of the material in the film may be too disturbing for kids to handle.Now that Thats the way, let me explain about this movie.This is actually a documentary on male Fox, who in the beginning is protecting its territory and seeking mate.The, starting with a magnificent sunrise and the score, taking.You breath better soak in as much of the scenery as possible it will get ugly later.They given as a fox and fox names, but I n e I can think that they are for such me.He struggling with this burst male to win her love.They later create a den, and a fox gives birth to four cubs magnificent, one of which is blind.There many happy and playful moments with fox family, but tragedy strikes and failure too soon.The first victim is blind puppy who gets too close to the high tide and washed away.The second victim is the mother, while the theft of chickens deceived dead chicken hanging on pole.She unconsciously keeps up trap.While g put on escape, she rips off part of her legs, causing her to bleed to death.The rest of the fox family forced to watch her die under tree.The man is now a single father, is forced to take on the mother roll and alone dad.He to teach them the skills necessary them for later life.It is not enough, when two of the puppies now grown to meet an ugly fate of their own; due to negligence and cruelity with man.I will not spoil the surprise ending for you, but it shows a farmer and his dog near his tail.And deserved it after the end of what was a family audience and foxes put through.I like to say that I saw it when it first came out in the early 1980s, when we had what is called Showbiz cable.I was only 4 when I saw it, but I never could understand why they would not let me see all it.Now I know why, after I secretly watched, when he came to Disney, when I was feeling emotionally 9.i insides of at seeing all this evil is going on.I was moved to tears.But dark and ugly as she was, she is purpose.To allow people to what is happening in these and other species, and why they endangered.This documentary wanted to get the message about this on endangered species, and I'm hoping that this is not a fake worked.Its the true nature of the life of Disney films, they do not teach about why the animals gather extinct.The attempt to land, killing off foxes main production and senseless killing of these beautiful animals, led to their becoming endangered.I sorry that yang would make the continuation of this film (Glacier Fox 2005) to see if they turn better.Maybe it has to be a fox pup named Teresa and her siblings growing up.This type of film also reflects what is happening to human family time, especially if one of the parents suddenly dies.The surviving father takes on the roll of both, and is trying to teach important lessons life.It is not always enough to protect them when they are adults, especially when some of them life becomes ruined.Or they are victims of the tragedy all around themselves.Best soundtrack and desks tour I've ever heard.
