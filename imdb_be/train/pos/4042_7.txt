The film begins with a bunch Walking Dead looks sitting in separate cages, waiting for their inevitable encounter with death, provided the electric chair. <br /> <br /> Then, our "hero", called tensya is made to the chair, he is all-powerful, and then .... he is still "alive". AHA! He is given the choice of some terrible military guys that look really cool: Either we spare you until we are convinced that you are actually dead, or you can go through that door and take what fate may lie ahead of you "Our hero. He says so to option 2, and then the actual story begins. <br /> <br /> He wakes up in a different kind of cage (very high technology and very large), where he finds another inmate, who also survived the electric boogie ride the speakers voice tells them that they are free to do whatever anywhere, as long as it does sound a little suspicious, but the two men are taking in this room: .. what else can they do? <br /> <br /> what these two men did not know they were set together, so that they can awaken the inner desire to kill them. largely unknown to scientists in the background p ** S them until they decide that they should kill one another. It sounds strange? in fact, but there is a big goal to make it all. This is the part that w ould be entirely revealed, and so it should remain undiscovered. <br /> <br /> But do not worry, it is unknown which leads the viewer to watch more of this pseudo-thriller, the front it has a very different approach to the question: How long can you stand to be with a man who son of a bitch, and you have killed it to get free? <br /> <br /> In the first hour mostly trying to wake your interest, it sneaks up on you without really knowing it. Then it becomes a roller coaster with wild matrix as an action fight scenes with a touch of individuality in honor of comic books, from which the film is based on. <br /> <br /> The film is really very special, so special that conventional theaters will not consider it in normal conditions. However, the story is fascinating, the music is fantastic and the actors make them a little bit (some more than others) to make the film truly unique. <br /> <br /> If you should be so lucky that your cinema or video store has it, watch and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream films to earn huge lumps of cash. <br /> <br />
