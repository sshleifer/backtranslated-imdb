I have one word to someup this film, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater crying. This film shows the difficulties that Darius sufferes with muscular dystrophy. The film was very well done, and really made you a part of the film, I was so emotionally moved by the film, because it made us remember that we are very lucky to be perfectly healthy, some people in this world, then we have less fortuate. And sometimes we have to let them be, and help them, until the very end. I would give it ten stars, they gave Darius was if they did not ask, they did't do it for money, they did it for a friend in need, Darius, the world must know, Darius went west.
