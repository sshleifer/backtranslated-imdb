Shakespeare's plays have a way of transcending time. Language somehow breaks the time barrier. but perhaps it's the actors who actually do it. <br /> <br /> After the disappointment in Romeo and Juliet (version with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), did not dare to take on another modern version of Shakespeare. To my surprise, Othello was great! <br /> <br /> His character played so well intern Kenneth! even thoough It's really evil and vile character played so well that he does what Shakespeare intended for charater be fun for the audience to hate. I must say that the performance of Fishburne here was really good as well. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to Shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read the book), so.
