I was very impressed with this small, independently from each other to make a picture. The story of a couple of social misfits who meet, become friends, and to provide each other with support systems and did not seem to have enough, as children, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but always provocative. Music, mostly underground group has been used to great effect, as it has been experimenting with angles, filters and slow or fast motion techniques. Representation (findings play writers and film directors) are among the best I've seen in the last few years. If you ever felt like forcing a square peg into a round hole, I really believe that you will appreciate "by hook or by crook."
