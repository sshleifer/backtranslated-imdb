Personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies like this treasured little gem. Back in the eighties, in the early eighties, I found this film, like many other released at the time, "Night Watch", "bad manners" or even "King Frat" artwork and advertisements on the back cover and the temptation to tease you. <br /> <br /> Of course being the era of such films as I have already mentioned, as well as such things as "half-witted" and many others, have captured the imagination, and, fortunately, for many years I still I remember some with love, some with contempt of many films that help to maintain my love for this genre, as a parody or styling. <br /> <br /> Made for many years after the huge success of "Animal House" and to see how he took down over the years, now I know that there would be no way this film ever eclipse cash bucks to get above also will not linger in the memory, as well as the rest of the National lampoon. <br /> <br /> To be honest, not all that was carrying National Lampoon logo was a wild success, but Me Class Reunion is one of my favorite movies, with instantly recognizable characters such as Bob aloof Spinnaker played to perfection Herr Graham, so good in Charles band «Terrorvision» are still stored in the former glory of his youth. Or how about a bold and assertive all Stephen Furst as a high school lazy drunken sex mad bum Hubert Downs. <br /> <br /> sweet as. What it makes me wonder. As I said, personal taste will not survive. People can be so hard, so it will never win any awards or compare with the likeness of his peers within the comedy world. He has his dignity. As one of the earliest scripts written by John Hughes, who would later go on to make one of my favorites of his work «Weird Science», as well as having an excellent topic title by the great Harry US bonds. <br /> <br /> what else I can say that this film is just waiting to be again and again and again.
