I think that Â«BlackAdder Third" is one of the best in the series. <br /> <br /> Actuelly all the episodes funny, personally I like the episode of 'French invasion', but one of the superstitious actors in "Macbeth" is also very funny as Rowan continues to play with them in reality (in English ) Humor at the highest level <br /> <br /> Actors :. never say that again, always referred to his Scottish play; Blackadder: Oh, you want me to tell the Scottish Play? Actors: YES Blackadder :. Instead of Macbeth ... <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Rowan and I have a big part of his job, but I think he made a series of Blackadder particularly good <br /> <br /> I hope that Rowan will continue their great style, but I think we can count on him, because he is already working on Bean 2 film, which will be released this year, I can not wait. .. <br /> <br /> I lost 3rd BlackAdder 9 out of 10 rating.
