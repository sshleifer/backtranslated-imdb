And Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such verisimilitude, I just cried. Glenn Close role as Ruth, showed her, wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under her husband's authority. "Let him think about what he did," Robert Duvall character, Joe said rack. History captured rural family accidental death case of his brother's son, called «The Stone Boy,» meaning that he was so depressed and overwhelmed by what he had done, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then at the end, when the character of Jason Presson Arnold, let it all out to a stranger, I was so heartbroken for him, I actually thought about some of the awful things that I've done in my life. I personalize and identified with his character. Frederic Forrest and the role of Gail Youngs, Sun added not so much a film. I thought, Frederic Forrest, who played the antagonistic, philandering brother of Ruth, Andy, like a jerk who does not do anything to try to help the situation. His wife, Lu, played by Gail Youngs, acting like a crazy-lady whipping around Arnold out of frustration with their own problems, without pity, and blame him for their troubles. I really could not feel sorry for these two. While Lou was trying to keep his marriage together, she was unsuccessful. And does not solve their problems effectively. They really have not done anything for the film and were totally inappropriate. secondary role Wilfred Brimley grandfather was touching, he was the only character that featured Arnold attention. I felt that his role should be developed. Players simply did what they felt was adequate and sufficient. Nevertheless, I really liked the ending so much, I smiled and wept tears of joy. I felt good. In Hillermans again were family. I actually wanted to be a part of this family. They were so realistic.
