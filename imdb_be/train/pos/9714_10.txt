What do you get if you cross a matrix with The Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you've all seen the Matrix today. Matrix creators say it's "anime inspired. Just from watching the trailer for this classic, you can see where they got the story from. <br /> <br /> The film is a kind of set in 1980s Japan, and it really shows. the costumes, the music and lyrics (in the latest version of the English language with the help of AD Vision) all, as they were directly borrowed from the era. I believe that this was done at the time, too, but due to certain plot points this is not to subsidize the film! <br /> <br /> As you probably guessed by my relation to the matrix, the world is not real m, It is not really in the 1980s. In fact, it's more like 2480's. After a nuclear war on Earth (or "Biosphere PrimeÂ») 's ecosystem has been destroyed. The survivors, we are forced to flee into space ., where he continued conflict Once a planet (or "biosphere") have been abandoned, people are living in megazone - cities within the spacecraft, where, with the help of hypnotism techniques and Truman Show-Eska illusion that they were made to judge that they are, we're back on the ground, in the most peaceful time in a while ... in the 1980s. When the young Shogo gets expanded mysterious looking bike, it leads him to learn more than he needs to know ... The Garland (bike that becomes Furs), gun with the 2400-ies, helps Shogo in his escape from pursuing the military. As more and learned more about Megazone, war is closer to home, and due to friction between the military and the computer, the war goes megazone too ... I apologize if these points are considered as spoilers, but the story is contained in the main that way to the synopsis. <br /> <br /> Emotions run high in this film than in a greater degree, The Matrix. Do you really believe that the war goes on, and Shogo really became very traumatized by what he discovers. What begins as an uber-cool Happy 80 Flicka becomes a tragic history of war and unreality. These characters are real people, not cardboard expressions we've seen flipping around in bullet time in the Matrix. There really has a sense of suffering people can pass after being trapped in a conspiracy and the war. It may just choke you until the end ... I know what I did. <br /> <br /> The animation is very impressive, as this day, and image quality for ADVision DVD incredible for his age. art style is beautiful and resembles a traditional anime, very cultural. Be prepared for a lot of blood and violence, there is also an erotic sex scene. <br /> <br /> The ending can be seen as "there can be no end", looks like the matrix, or is supposed to be continued may appear that I have not yet had the pleasure of watching. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is one of the best anime I've seen, in fact, one of the best movies I have seen, and, according to many, is one of the greatest anime of all time. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend ADVision DVD, because they are taken in English is incredible and makes the film justice, and can be purchased from the Artbox for two sequels, when they will be released, which will have one and those the vocal actor. <br /> <br /> in general, MEGAZONE 23 is an incredible movie, and deserves to be held high, and should be essential in the collection of any fan of anime. Heck, even my mom liked.
