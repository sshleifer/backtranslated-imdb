Expecting to see the "cute little film" from mainland China, I was ill-prepared. family dynamics, society and the inevitability of change have rarely been studied so well on film. Each character is tough, and I was completely drawn into the story. The organization is much harder than American audiences are used to. However, there is no difficulty after progression, even when reading the subtitles. Jiang Y, as the retarded brother, constant bright light. Leave your cynicism at the locker. He will be there when you check out.
