The country is stupid is not for everyone. In fact, it may be, in the Land of blunt anyone except Lynch, and that's what makes it funny and collective cartoon. Violent? Yes. Profanity? Yes. Absurd? Yes. Piece of trash? Never. DumbLand beautiful picture of some Americans who do not have the brains and hit his wife and children for the sake of pleasure. From MÃ©xico I can say that I love it! My favorite episodes: 1 my teeth bleed, all the noise around and violence make me cry and made me for my bed. 2 Get the stick! Yeah baby get it and learn a lesson: Some people will never be grateful for their actions. 3- spine. The greater the Lynch episode of all, music, surrealism and very sweet revenge ...
