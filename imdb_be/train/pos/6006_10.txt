When I saw it, as a child, he answered all my questions and dispel the fears and misconceptions that I have had. It is easy to see, because it is animated, which makes it harmless. It has no moral bias or "instructive" aspect, so that no one should have any objections to it. It's a nice movie that just gives the facts of menstruation on encouraging "mundane" way. I hope to show it to my daughter.
