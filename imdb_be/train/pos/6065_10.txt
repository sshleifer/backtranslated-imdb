This film horrible- in the "so bad it's good" sort of way. <br /> <br /> storyline is heated from many other such kind of films that I will not even bother with a description of it. This sword / magic picture, a child, hoping to understand how important it is in this world has a "nomadic" adventurer evil memorable / magus, princess, hairy creature .... you get the point. <, Br /> <br /> The first time I caught this film was a very severe winter. I do not know why I decided to go watch it on an extra five minutes before the channel, but when I caught site Gulfax, I decided to stay and watch it till the end. <br /> <br /> Gulfax white, furry creature looks like Chewbacca, but not as useful or interesting to watch. He looks like someone stuck a bunch of white mahorok carpet together and forced the actor to wear it. There are scenes where it looks like the actor can not move inside, or that he almost fell. Despite the fact that he was not in the movie that much, several scenes are worthy! See how he tries to smack talk to Bo Svensson, taking a comparison Solo-Chewbacca to a higher level! <br /> <br /> I actually bought this film just because of this character, and so far it somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may look like sh! t, but he made this movie !!! The only reason why I have never seen a continuation, or even looking for him, because of his absence! Perhaps, if the final film is crowning the trilogy, Gulfax will make a welcome return!
