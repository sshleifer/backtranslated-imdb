I live in Missouri, so the direct impact of terrorism is largely unknown to me, it brought it home. The fact that the two men came on the line in a way that those members of the FDNY and NYPD did, just to document the horror that unfolded on the same day. This film is a testament to those who lost their lives and the true evil that terrorism brings.
