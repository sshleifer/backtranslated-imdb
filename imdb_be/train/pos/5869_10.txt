after only watching Deer Hunter, which is a masterpiece, a film Jacknife had big shoes to fill.it it has the same theme as The Deer Hunter, a devastating effect on a person after the Vietnam War.Robert De Niro in this film, as in the Deer Hunter and very good here as Kathy Baker.but this film belongs to Ed Harris, who gives a powerful, emotional and impressive performance.the film based on the play, and there are one or two scenes where it felt obvious me.by, I just mean that, for these one or two scenes, he felt, as I watched the stage play.that not that a big deal, and in fact does not detract from film.i really liked it movie.it entirely epic as The Deer Hunter.they roughly similar age and have similar themes, but they are two very different films.i thought was The Deer Hunter big, and I also think that this film was great.it is acting in this that makes it so great.for me, Jacknife is 10/10
