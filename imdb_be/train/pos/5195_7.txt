As a lover of bad movies, I definitely hit paydirt with this. The plot is not so bad, but there are a few cases where you really need to ask yourself: "What the hell is going on here?» <br /> <br /> There are many many things that make it the most fun bad movie kogda either. First, Rudy Ray Moore got so fat and slow, if the film was made, that the special effects are made up of speeding up fight scenes to double the time. There is also a scene where there is a slow-motion instant replay, jumping on a high wall ten feet (playing with him falling backwards), naked man coming out in huge letters, and sex, which literally brings down the roof (with cable, raising the roof to catch on fire). <br /> <br /> Of course, there is Rudy Ray Moore film would not be complete without completely gratuitous and random comedy club scene, where Rudy ridicules all customers, inserted with people doing some weird dance. There are so many things bad about this movie, but they do not in a playful way, and if you take your eyes off of the film, you can skip another mistake <br /> <br /> Rating :. 1/10 for the actual value for the cheese factor 10/10, 10/10 to choose from errors and inconsistencies, the average values ​​of up to 7/10.
