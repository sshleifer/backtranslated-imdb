Uneducated and bold, beautiful TESS storm COUNTRY daughter fisherman squatting on the ground of the rich man. Energetic and bold, she captures the heart of the son of a millionaire, but violence, terror and sudden death that will haunt her the near future, before it can claim to be the sweet world of happiness. <br /> <br /> Mary Pickford absolutely charming in this lovely, heart-wrenching film. She thought Tess to be her favorite role, and she fills it with all manly joy and enthusiasm, which made it for many years the most popular movie star in the world. The story has all the elements necessary for a modern fairy tale with beautiful Mary, distraught heroine suffers from any kind of dangerous, stressful situations. Atmospherics first course, with open sets fishing village is particularly well thought out. <br /> <br /> In the supporting cast, Hersholt stands out as a dastardly villain who is trying to boost Pickford, to marry him. Hersholt, a very gentle soul of the screen, one can brilliantly reflect the full moral corruption of his hero. <br /> <br /> This was actually the second time Pickford filmed TESS. 1914 version was one of her first important film, but production figures were somewhat obsolete by the standards of the 1920's (no close-ups, for example) and Mary by creating their own movies & powerful enough, in 1922, to do everything, the film that she wanted, I decided the only time in his career, to remake the film. In the end, certainly lived up to her expectations. Both films were very popular at the box <br /> <br /> A fascinating study for some future researcher of the film will be the influence of Christianity in the life of Mary Pickford. it certainly functions as a golden thread through the silent films she made. Although the romanticism inherent in the very nature of the silent film can cause these spiritual feelings, to look a little embarrassed today, we are forced to take their sincere reflection, the most repetition, with sincere beliefs of Mary. The TESS, a beautiful scene, in particular, stands out in this regard: Pickford teach themselves to read through the Bible. She points out Lloyd Hughes (who plays her lover), the word out of the back of the book that she did not understand. He mimes for it (the word is obviously `crucified ') and turned Heavenward in the full sense of sacrificial stars on her face, Mary becomes positively blissful. <br /> <br /> magnificent new score for TESS was delivered by Jeffrey Mark Silverman, which perfectly accentuates the beauty & the pathos of this remarkable film.
