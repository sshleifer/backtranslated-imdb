Well, here's the deal: if you are easily offended, you might want to stay far, far away from this. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed. In fact, I probably blushed more than I laughed. And if I was not literally blushing on the outside, I red on the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this film that confuses you, then you just do not have any shame. Whether it's a badge of honor or not, in the eyes of the beholder, I suppose. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that I laughed quite a bit, but it's a film that I just can not give a blanket recommendation because of its subject matter. If I said, "This film is funny, go check it out!" And some sweet, little old church-going lady head to the theater and have a heart attack during one of the graphic explicit sexual situations, well, it's just that I do not need my conscience. <br /> <br /> Since it is lustful? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than Uninvited. Honestly. My mother would have left during the first stage. I feel it is my duty at least to warn you about what to expect. <br /> <br /> There are several reasonably smart comedy here, but this is what I've come to expect from a man (Judd Apatow), who had a hand like Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald; the only person whose hair and beard were white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for their money. Paul Rudd declared, "When I hear ya Can Be There, once again, I Ya can burn this place down," funny, but it's one of those things that most viewers do not appreciate. <br /> <br /> And when we see a quick 3 other retrospective Steve Carell singing cameo in Word Up, I laughed a good two minutes after the joke is over, while the majority of all chuckled, and then forgot about it . <, Br /> <br /> Oddly enough, despite the vulgarity, there is a great moral of the story. The film does not reflect Karel like some weird loser just because he was a virgin. He truly portrayed as a cute, jealous character. Of course, it's a little strange. After all, he has a poster framing Asia "more video games than Asian Child" and a collection of toys, representing BOSS Man million, but we have never led to believe that there is actually nothing wrong with the fact that he is virgin. As strange as it may seem that there is something like "it's normal to expect" message. <br /> <br /> But man, oh man, please keep in mind that it pushes its R rating of how it can go, It was, of course, intend to Apatow. According to him, he simply let some of the young people (especially Rogen and Malkov) improvisation and speak as they usually say, all in an attempt to find a lot of new ways to be contaminated. If you can cope with it or talk that way by yourself, then you will love this film. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of profanity and sexual jokes. I believe that the subtle, intelligent humor is much more interesting than 200 performances, discussions of sexual F-word or Fratboy. But that's me. As I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they are sitting in one of the most vulgar films that you probably ever in the theater. I just do not know how many women will be interested in the fact that it is being discussed by people in a poker game. Honestly home, you might not want to know. If you've ever been interested in why some girls think guys are rude, well, it gives you a good idea <br /> <br /> There you go -. My humble, honest look at what to expect. Whatever your guide. It certainly should not be treated with Sunday school classes, mother, grandmother, all members of the opposite sex families, children of any age, or anyone who is easily offended by profanity or explicit sexual discussion. If you want to see it with any of the above, then you seem to have no concept of what it means to be uncomfortable.
