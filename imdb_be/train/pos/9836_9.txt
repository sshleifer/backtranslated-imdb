Despite the fact that it is not as bad as it is iconic predecessor (ZOMBI 2) I actually like this better. This is due to its faster pace, the best settings and a cool 80's soundtrack. It is loaded with action and has a sweet gore effects from Fulci. Zombies are not really look so disgusting as zombies 2, but they still look good. This was done very well, but it certainly has its share of cheesiness; for example, some zombies move very slowly, while the other as fast as a ninja. Braindead some while others say funny lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to Italian horror? There's even a flying zombie head! How happy that? Definitely a must see for fans of zombies and gorehounds. it is likely to satisfy most fans of fighters, as well. Also check ZOMBI 4.
