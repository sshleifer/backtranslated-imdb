This film is funny, original, and beautifully directed. I was a big bad SWIM fans, monitor its film festivals, when & where I can. I've seen it half a dozen times now, and each time, captured response from the audience confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films to come out in years. Almost every festival he shielded, it is either sold or won the Audience Choice award. It is clear that people love this movie, and even more clearly why they do it. Cinematography beautiful, brilliant acting and characterization, the end of a fantastic, and the direction is filled with compassion, wisdom and art of the perfect time. Hard to believe that this is the first film Ishai Setton in. I hope he will be released soon, so everyone can see it.
