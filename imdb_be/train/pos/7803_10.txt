I just finished watching this movie in the history of my GCSE class. it was fascinating and was a brilliant understanding of what actually happened during apartheid Biko law. How can someone say that this film was the most boring or dull 2 ​​and a half hours of my life I do not know, because I was hooked from start to finish. it was great as Denzel Washington portrays him and showed him how he fights against apartheid law and have equal rights for black people. In one part of the Steve Biko said police, we're just as weak and a person like you is to show them that he and all other black people in South Africa did not differ from whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he fort for what he believed and did not believe completely in apartheid. He and Steve Biko have created a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and went on to wake up the world. I loved this film and highly recommend it to people. it helped me to understand that racism is not correct, and that all are equal, their fate should not be determined by the color of someone's skin.
