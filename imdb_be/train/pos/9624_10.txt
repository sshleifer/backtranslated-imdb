I thought the film that was great suppose to be about the romance of the unknown with little in between. <br /> <br /> Rob Stewart excellent actor, I do not know why people continue to give him a bad rap. As for Mel Harris is a great actress, and for anyone who thinks it looks too old for Rob is only five years old. <br /> <br /> Rob had a leading role in their own TV series, as well as one on the Scifi channel. I'm sure you remember Contemporary Heat aka sweating bullets and Painkiller Jane. <br /> <br /> He also starred in several television movies, and is now making a TV mini-series. <br /> <br /> They need to give him more leading roles, he is best.
