All that my name may sound strange, but there was nothing there! <br /> <br /> In any case, I have not seen anything like this before it was crazy! Of course, it's a good thing. This humorous interesting movie and my absolute favorite all the time how they are woven into one other thing! Like chicken little ,, fish pretending to be King Kong and Runt Pig saying, Â«Twas beauty that killed the beast" War scenes worlds and much more. The Walt Disney Company have not lost contact, perhaps not for this. Moreover, how they did it, how they watched the movie, and it was like a home theater. <br /> <br /> However, some parts do not fit. As with the original Lion King, Timon and Pumbaa entirely with Simba when he beat Scar? In this film, they are not! they fought backstage hyenas. Ther Moreover, the reason why FUIB not so sure that he was alienated from the other animals, and it's just Timon, Timon, Timon. Does anyone realize that only history Timonn was told while FUIB was only a memory? <br /> <br /> But, in addition, IT "S GREAT!
