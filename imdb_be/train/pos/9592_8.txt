This film was released 12 years ago, and was a revelation even to those who knew something drag scene in New York. Textbooks on the resistance performance not to mention such vogueing houses. Anthony Slide "Great team member" does not say anything. Julian Fleisher «The Drag Queens New York: Illustrated field guide" to the flowchart of influence brings Julian Eltinzh, Minette, uterus Warhol and 90s club scene - and postdates the film - completely ignored at home. Even Laurence Senelick in the "waiting room" - the closest thing that we have in the final book of the performance drag quickly rushes past film and gives background information that would be expected from it <br /> <br />. I understand, from the film, as well as various articles on the Internet, I found that the house system passes a few decades ago. The main performance of the film member of the house until 1990, seems to Crystal La Beija in «The Queen», 1968. historical context is the biggest missing piece "Paris Burning". <br /> <br /> The film is valuable in that it focuses on a scene otherwise ignored. This is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989, a sad fact that Venus Kstravagansa was killed during the shooting provides a very dramatic ending, but it is not the only film to include transgender murder in real life. As we now know, Dorian Corey was a mummified corpse in her literal closet, but it was not and did not leave until three years later. <br /> <br /> From a historical importance, but we still need someone to do a book or a documentary that provides more context.
