For me it is a matter of life and death, just something simply the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> From start to finish it oozes class. It stimulates, food for thought, the mirror in the postwar world and relations between peoples. <br /> <br /> cinematography is simply stunning, and the effect of mixing black and white and the Technicolor, to accentuate different worlds running smoothly. Characters and plot development are almost perfect, and the attention to detail contributes to thoroughly believable fantasy NO <br /> <br /> No matter how many times I watch the film. - I watched it a lot - it never fails to touch me. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. It is as fresh today as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If I had allowed just one film, and to keep watch over a matter of life and death will be the film.
