This is one of those movies that they are too much for the encouragement. When you look tanker, then you might as well watch a movie. Almost all the funny scenes spoiled in the preview, except for one, which just happens to be Jennifer Annisten funny. This is a typical Jim Carrey humor, and it's really funny. Just do not watch this movie expecting to be surprised. In general, if you like the Jim Carrey comedy, or it is a must see, or just watch the preview and you will be just as pleased.
