Old vaudeville team Willie Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) was one of the most famous, but they broke up hating each other. More than 20 years later, they agreed to meet for a TV special ... but know they still hate each other. Willie's nephew / agent (Richard Benjamin) is trying to make them work together. <br /> <br /> big hit in its day, and he won the George Burns Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I (somewhat) like. It was written by Neil Simon as his non-stop intensity. Some of them were funny, but the jokes make Willy and insanity Ella was not. Besides, I never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor, and something about it just rubbed me the wrong way. In addition, his character is so pungent you are sick it quickly. All that aside it was fun. Burns only big throwing of one-liners with ease and even Matthau was a good match with him. Their verbal battles the best sequences in the film. In addition, Benjamin is very good, like nephew, Willie tries to get the two of them to work with each other. For me it's worth a look at Burns alone. This jump started his career in a big way, and two years later he had another hit with "Oh, my God." Thus, it is good. Just good - not great. Matthau character does make it hard to love. I give it a 7.
