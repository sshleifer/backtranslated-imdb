I first saw this film when I was about seven years old and was completely fascinated by it then, but could not figure out what the film was called for many years. now I'm twenty-one and accidentally stumbled on a movie about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory is a little hazy film was, I was in no way disappointed with what I saw. animation in this film is a magnificent conjuring up the whole world, which is so believable and so well animated, that you are drawn to the film that alone. But this film is also a story that will charm and entertain the child and adult. floating island, crazy general, a friendly pirate grandmother and well-constructed love story, the film will not fail, I would recommend this film any.
