This is one of the films, which do not require any brain or thinking, this is a very funny time passes, you forget for the next hour or so. I was very surprised, the current John Abraham, he usually plays a gangster, like a character from a straight face, because of having to play the exact opposite and make it successful, managing to shine among comic geniuses such as Paresh Rawa and Akshay Kumar. I was also very surprised with 3 girls in Akshaye, because that's where the role not require a lot of talent, but mostly moaning about dissapearence Akshaye (other girls), I was surprised how they were able to install and the actual person, and you able to distinguish between them, which is a good thing, and most of the songs is good, is a colorful and fun way to sad Sunday night it will be a sure ease your mood.
