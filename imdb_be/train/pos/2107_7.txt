I recently bought this movie with a bunch of other laser disks from eBay. Usually, I'm the military and adventure films, but sometimes I like romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you are bored today's special FX movies, and high-gloss romantic comedies you should check the shop on the corner of a quiet evening, What I like about the film that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing fake or pretentious about them. Take Mr. Matuschek, for example: When he finds out his wife is cheating on him with one of his employees, he tried to shoot. Not only because of the humiliation, but because it was unfair to the character of Stuart. (OK, weired example). <br /> <br /> So, the focus of the film is narrow and predictable plot. Still, I enjoyed it very much. If you like Notting Hill, then you'll like the corner store. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me of Jimmy Stewart.
