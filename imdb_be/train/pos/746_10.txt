As I reach the "bottom" 35 I find myself shaking my head more and more sex crazed, under the influence of drugs teens today. It was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day, as it is for teenagers today. This film drives that point home to the core. If you are a late 70's fan you will love this film. With Kiss-concert posters Angel of the rock movie! <br /> <br /> Watch out for young Laura Dern. Why they did not have more songs with the Runaways, I will never know? <br /> <br /> I had a problem with the character of Randy Quaid Defloration 16-year-old girl. While he was away, she and her friends have a party that destroys the house guy. The police came and everything, but nothing is said about all the underage drinking, and how these children got their hands on this stuff. <br /> <br /> foxes belong there with overflowing, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused, and children as one of the all time teen angst movie. <br /> <br /> I say buy and watch it with your children and talk about all this.
