I've seen this with several expectations and absolutely loved it! Bend It Like Beckham is a pretty typical awkward age film about a rather unusual girl. It Parminder heating ( «ER») 's breakout role, playing Jesse, a teenager in England, which is sandwiched between her traditional Indian family and its love of football (that's soccer for the North Americans have). And despite the fact that it is actually much older than her character, she plays the role of pitch-perfect <br /> <br /> This is a film about friendship. - Jess specifically friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), her team-mate, who is also going on the family, especially her mother, who wears purple nail polish and little bows on shoes, and Jules who want to be more feminine, wear lacy underwear and flirt with boys and terrified that sports games is that her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess and love to play in the game, and there are problems trying to convince their families to let them go after their dream. In addition, they are, unfortunately, they both love the same man - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Love triangle causes a strain on their friendship. <br /> <br /> In some places, Bend It Like Beckham delivers a cliché. In other scenes stretch too long, and this film probably could benefit from tighter editing general. <br /> <br /> But it was refreshingly funny coming-of-age story, a clash of cultures, and the love of football. We are talking about women's authority in pursuit of their dreams and support their friend. Funny, charming and funny, Bend It Like Beckham is the little movie that could ... and did. <br /> <br /> Well. 8/10.
