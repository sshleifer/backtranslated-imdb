I really do not understand why people are so upset and panning of the film! Remember folks, this SNL movie and not something that should be unpredictable and original in plot or direction! Home Man hilarious film, although sometimes silly, wacked-out with the cast and, as usual, Wonderful performances Ferrell and Tim Meadows. And some of the jokes are stupid, and let the characters unbelievable, but his comedy! I really do not understand how he could not laugh a lot during this funny movie. Anyway, all I ask is that people take it as it is - SNL, silly and irreverent comedy. Nothing that wins awards, but, nevertheless, some modern comedy gold. "10-4 apricot!"
