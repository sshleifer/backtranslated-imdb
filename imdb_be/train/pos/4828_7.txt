Rupert Friend gives an idea of ​​how Prince Albert, which raises "The Young Victoria" to unexpected levels. He is excellent. It is known that Queen Victoria fell into a dark, deep depression after the death of Prince Albert, and looking into the eyes of Rupert Friend, I understand. The film does not take us to his death, but on the incident, which may very well could have cost him his life. An act of love. I believed in it, and I have to say it. I believe that he felt was real. Nothing anyone gets anywhere near the delicacy and profundity of characterization friend. Emily Blunt is good, but I do not believe for a minute it was Victoria. There is no real sense of time. It can not be her fault, but her prince has earned the crown.
