It was the best documentary I've ever seen !! I just saw the Lords of Dogtown and would like to know more about Stacy Peralta, and was surprised and pleased to find out that this is one of his films, as well. Great J Stacey! I pushed back at work last week, bored O * & ^% less, and the film went on. Growing up in Orange County in the 80 years I was moving up and down the local beaches, and so did my dad when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I moved the body, boogeyboarded then moved from there. This film just won me over. This was the way to my time, but it was awesome to see what these guys went through..TRUE Pioneers! This film is a commodity collectors.
