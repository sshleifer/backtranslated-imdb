I was a fan of the book ever since third grade, so of course I watched the movie, read the sequel, and then watched TV show. It was a good show itself, and now, as an adult, I still enjoy the show. My only real problem with it is that it does not follow the book. The first time I saw it, I was so disappointed that I turned it off. But this is coming from a girl who belongs to the first addition of the book. But after a while, I decided to give it a try again, and ignored the book (such as what you should do with the Harry Potter films). I found a number of cool! It was a clean cut, and that everyone can enjoy, with just the right amount of comedy to keep it all going. It's really nice! Clean and beautiful!
