The movie was great, except for a few scenes with Esposito. I enjoyed the way he collected all the detective on the series and wrap up some story that has never been addressed in a series (thanks to NBC ...). It was great to see Pembleton and Baileys together in their most human, and most of the main parties. Braugher Secor and did a great job, but, as usual, will be forgotten. It was painful to see that it was the end of Homicide. Memories, tapes, and repetition on CourtTV just not the same as watching it come on every Friday. But the film did his job and did it very well, presenting the big picture of life after Al retired, and family relations that existed between the block. I liked it a lot.
