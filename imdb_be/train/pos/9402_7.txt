I saw this film only after hearing raves about it for years. Needless to say, the actual experience was a bit disappointing. Still, Alec Guinness is vigorously perfect throw in a fun, when the template, to travel through industry after World War II England. <br /> <br /> It's a familiar story about the troubles of everyday coming up with the perfect product. Remember a car that runs on water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it is a fabric that will not wear out, wrinkles, or even dirty! Of course, manufacturers of fabrics and their workers were horrified prospect of being put out of business, and so the plot becomes a little thick. <br /> <br /> Guinness makes the whole enterprise stands and watching it explode Plant Research Laboratory again and again is quite a blast! (Those British ... always well done when under fire.) The film is chugging along just as senseless invention of Guinness, but it's a good trip all the same.
