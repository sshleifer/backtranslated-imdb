I really like this show. I can easily see how he achieved cult status. This is an original and thoughtful. For some reason, though, I have never felt such a response from him, I could. This is not the kind of package the door is open, the winter cold, which was supposed to be from the this strange room. Every time I watch an episode, I consider myself a push, and insists on its reply to a number of nameless, formless matter. <br /> <br /> Before continuing, let me get ahead of it so what follows is my opinion, and my opinion only. Different strokes for different folks. <br /> <br /> I would like to have seen more scenes in «American Gothic", which was filmed at night. There's too much light of day in this show, and I think he had a tendency to counteract the unknown. We do not fear the light of day in the end. We are concerned that in the shadows. The devil is not always in the details. What we do not see, it is often the worst <br /> <br /> The second - and this is one that is likely to lead to tar and feathers. Gary Cole is a very talented actor ... a character actor. I have followed his career from the Brady Bunch films on, so it pains me to say that it probably is miscast Lucas Buck. He was almost too petroichan, too cute to be evil incarnate, even biblical standards. Lucas Buck is a drug. He heroin. He smoked a base in a food laboratory next to a gallon of Drain-O. You keep coming back, even if you know that the end will be insanity and death. It should be like a moneylender final. He is the creator of the book, but overwhelmingly condemned. Of course. Do you have the money, and soon you will also have the broken fingers; severed hand, decapitated head, and finally the damned soul. Turning to Buck is an act of desperation, and every time he's around, there should be some immediate surrounding perfection - with interest deteriorating daily. - in the air <br /> <br /> This is all generosity, all attached line, and by the time you realize that you also know that it's too late <br /> <br /> This leads me to three :. they showed Buck a little too often. He most scenes, in fact, that may have caused it to lose its edge. Sheriff will be like next door mythology. He apocryphal acquaintance. Many would know "c", but the unfortunate few really know him. He would be the material of flashbacks, and mysterious conversations, and a wonderful person to deliver this part of the exhibition was to Deputy character, Nick Sears painted. <br /> <br /> Four, the show can be very self-reverential - to a shortage, some might say - and this symbolizes the whistle «Meet Me At The Fishing Hole" in the pilot episode. I think we've already established that shot Cassidy and Raimi was for anti-Andy Taylor. We probably do not need the concept delivered to us via Fed Ex. I realized that for the first five minutes, so, for me, the piano on his head there was no need. <br /> <br /> These remarks all that, to me, would make a good show perfectly. I also understand that the manufacturers had their own unique style, and that there was a lot of hands in the soup. In its eternal quest for LCD programming, the network plays a role in the death of this series. <br /> <br /> The smallest of these jerk-offs costumes could do was air the episodes in order. <, Br /> <br /> Get real. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is a heavy loss for both genre fans and casual viewers alike.
