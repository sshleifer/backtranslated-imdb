I saw this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it so much we bought a VHS and enjoyed it so far. <br /> <br /> The plot has been well discussed, so there is no need to go over it again. The fact that this film deserves repeated viewings. Americans, especially, are not going to get all the jokes the first time. I know I'm not. <br /> <br /> This film is funny, touching, sad-- all at the same time. If Rey proposes a toast at the wedding of his daughter, shake it induces. If Karen calls Tony "Brian" as he tries to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. If Bean finally drove the woman in black, this is too funny words <br /> <br /> And the music :. This is as good as any movie soundtrack I've heard in recent years. I danced in the living room "in the world.Â» <br /> <br /> Each performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy was rightly praised for his role as Ray, the man who had too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, a nice keyboard player who carried the torch Karen all these years. It has an attractive look guilty, that makes women want to hug him. But all the actors are equally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to the pan, you read about the film and see it. This is a gem.
