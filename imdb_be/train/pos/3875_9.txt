This film was made by one of the most absurd comedians in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. I was shocked for a moment that he made a romantic comedy, but knowing that he was a hard movie fan, has been seen in every local festival and the local Cinematheque, I had a positive feeling about this film. <br /> <br /> Damn, I was right. Immediately, the script (written by Pelletier) slightly twisted and difficult to adhere to, but in a fashion Peltier is a unique 90-minute horse. <br /> <br /> tightening inspiration and transformed allusions Dangerous Liaisons mostly (by Laclos) «Les Aimants» consists of twisted games, writing notes on the fridge. Throughout the film you get an excuse to find out who is who and who write to anyone on the damn fridge .... which pops up in an interesting love. <br /> <br /> Great story, great pictures, great quotes from other films. When we ask more than the first film?
