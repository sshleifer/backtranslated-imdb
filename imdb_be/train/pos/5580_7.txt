Young beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) marries an older man (Zvonimir cattail). Unfortunately, he can not satisfy her sexually, and ignores her. Frustrated, she goes home and plans to get a divorce. Then, one day, she was swimming naked in a lake in the middle of the forest. Her horse jumping with her clothes ... and she runs after him! She meets a young and very handsome Adam (Aribert MOG). They make love, and she understands that this is the man she wants. <br /> <br /> ENDING SPOILER !!!! Of course, as it was done in 1933, she should be punished for his sin, so that leads to a tragic ending. END END SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> This frightened people in 1933, but it's pretty tame by today's standards. Lamarre in nude swim displays nothing, and when it passes after the horse completely naked, that specified in a extremely risky or coated branches and the like. There's only a few minor shots of her breasts. Also, if she has sex with Mogadishu, it does not display anything, but her face, but you can see her achieve orgasm. These scenes were considered quite extreme in their day and cut out entirely from the US release. Now today they are back. This film will go to the PG-13 easy now. <br /> <br /> shocks aside, it's just fine. It is beautifully filmed and there is next to no dialogue. with the exception of music through this can be a silent picture. Fortunately, all the actors are good - Lamarr and Mog by themselves, and they are so attractive that they just take your breath watching them. Moreover, the sequence where they make love easily one of the most beautifully shot and speaking sequence I've ever seen in a movie. Scenes with sexual symbols (there is quite a few of them), unfortunately, quite evident today. I actually began to chuckle during one <br /> <br /> Thus, a large area, beautiful images, attractive actors, good acting all around - but I was not exactly impressed by it. I found low-speed film (beautiful pictures do not make a picture for me), some sad, obviously, static and negative ending. I can live with the end, but it does not justify the other problems that I had with him. In addition, the final sequence is really amazing - and absurd. That's why I admire this film more than anything else. It was well done, and I would recommend it, but with caution. Many people seem to love this movie, so I'm in the minority. Use your own opinion.
