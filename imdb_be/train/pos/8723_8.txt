Animation was amazing and funny film. Two circus bugs, Tuck / Roll were very funny. If you wait until the credits end, you have seen a very funny sequence of the film, where they showed errors, pretending to do something wrong, like in other films, that was clever, as he made the character more human and beliveable.
