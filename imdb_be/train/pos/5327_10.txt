As an experienced fan I recommend this film as faithful to the facts, and well acted. As 11-year-old living in Istanbul, I heard some friends talking about the new musical sensation that caused the girl scream. I thought, hmmm, when the girls love them, they must be shit. Has only records at that time were Hayley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Soon after some time on vacation with his family at the military canteen in Ismir I heard the song (which I later found out, was «Love Me Do») and was struck by the difference between it and each song I had never heard of until now . When I heard the album "Meet the Beatles of my elder brother, I was hooked for life. After reading the final book of the beginning (Davis), I was surprised that this film was followed by the facts very well, except for leaving a large part of the floor, and some of the drug (it was touching to use methadrine / dexadrine). >
