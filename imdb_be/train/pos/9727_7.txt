Simon Pegg plays rough rough and often out of control celebrity journalist who had brought from England to work on the big American magazine. Of course, his winning ways to create all kinds of complications. Fun fact based comedy that co-stars Kristno Dunst (looks pretty adult), Danny Huston and Jeff Bridges. He works in the first place because we like Simon Pegg, in spite of his bad behavior. We fully understand why Kristen Dunst continues to speak with him, despite his frequent screw-ups. I liked the movie. It is not be all and end all, but it was a nice way to cap the evening sitting on the couch watching movies. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
