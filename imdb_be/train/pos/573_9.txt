I've always loved movies showing life as it is. Life is sometimes sad sites, no real story, not necessarily a happy ending. "Where the river flows" perfect title for this film (and the novel by Norman MacLean). Life ebbs and flows like a river, and it has its rough spots, but it's remarkable journey. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot to the film. His story has a friendly feeling that corresponds to the image perfectly. As a director, he is restrained and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for the action, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt works amazingly well, like brothers. I do not know how to describe Tom Skerritt and speeches Blethyn, except what they really feel real. "The river runs through it" a great movie. <br /> <br /> 8.6 10
