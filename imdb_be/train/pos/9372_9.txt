Red Rock West is one of those rare films that keeps you guessing all the time as to what will happen next. Nicolas Cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he is part of a small town, trying to find a job. Dennis Hopper is a bad guy, and no one plays them better. Look for a short appearance by country singing star Dwight Yoakam. This is a serious drama most of the time, but there are some lighter moments. What is important is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort!
