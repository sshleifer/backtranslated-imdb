Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940), starring Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler) <br /> <br /> 19-year-old Hedy Lamarr in the world the first glimpse occurs in the first moments of this 1930 treasure, as it sweeps across the screen in the angelic wedding dress. This was to be the beginning of a legendary career. This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman to ever grace the silver screen. <br /> <br /> It (Lamarr) wedding night of Eve and her older husband does not seem interested in her romantic advances. She retreats to an empty bed, and in a beautiful scene, she is busy with her wedding ring, as the realization of her matrimonial mistakes overcomes her. Husband more interested in accuracy and order than he does in love. Mahato used great angles and untouched shot frame to capture a significant talent and beauty in Lamarr. In the absence of the words uttered at the beginning of the film, she is able to understand our compassion, our hearts and our support. It is this combination that has been prepared in 1930, the audience for what they were going to see how the story unfolds. "Ecstasy" is considered shocking for its time ... Some people thought that it would be scandalous. <br /> <br /> She returns home to his father's name and file for divorce. The next day, she wakes up with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. She should just go out and feel the freedom of the countryside and the fresh air. Eve comes to riding and comes across a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in movie history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person ever to appear naked in the main movie. Her playfulness in the forest and her adventure skinny dipping in the lake was legendarily scandalous. But the audience could not stay away. Like many of today's movies, debates have made it a must-see film. <br /> <br /> Eva naughty adventure to introduce it into a handsome young man who helps her find a horse that ran off with her clothes. After an awkward meeting in the end they fall on each other. Their first romantic date was almost as controversial as a nude scene, with its blatant eroticism waves. Nevertheless, Machaty does an excellent job in these romantic moments. Machaty creates one day when Eve literally seems immersed in her new lover, using a fine early focus of the camera. <br /> <br /> It can not be overstated how bold this performance was in part Lamarr. Many might assume that this is career suicide. Instead, she got her international fame and attracted the attention of Louis B Mayer, who signed her contract with MGM. There are some really erotic moments in this film, even by today's standards unscrupulous. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in 1930. Again, Machaty was very clever with his image, leaving a lot of imagination. But we are very good at what we see, and it is supremely well done to understand. <br /> <br /> The meeting of the former husband of Eve and her current lover, perhaps, inevitable. However, the consequences of this meeting are not. The film takes a few twists and turns in its final act, and it all makes for a great story and a nice debut on the big stage of the film stars on Hedy Lamarr. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this once controversial, is now tame film and urge you to look for it in a reduced form on DVD. This follows easily, if only for the pleasure of Hedy Lamarr. But the story is also fascinating and the direction ahead of its time. "Ecstasy" is a memorable early treasure <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com. - TC Candler movie review !!!
