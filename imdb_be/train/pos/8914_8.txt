I grew up in Royersford, Pa. City, where the market was Jerry. I remember my whole family coming out to watch video. I remember a guy showing «Blob» for me and my brothers in a bucket. I also would like to share the fact that my mother was in the movie. Her hair was the same as Aneta Korsaut, and she was sick one night, and they saw my mom and asked her to get in the car Steve McQueen for some shots behind. They paid her $ 25.00 and gave her talk, until she died in August this year. My mother was not a teenager, and she was a few months from the birth of my little sister.
