Well, first of all, I've got this film as a Christmas gift, it's free! FIRST - This film was supposed to be in stereoscopic 3D. It is for the most part, but every time the protagonist in his car film falls flat in 2D! What !!?!?! It is not so difficult to shoot in the car !!! The second - the story is not very good. There are many things wrong with it <br /> <br /> Third. - Why do they show all the deaths at the beginning of the movie! This made the movie suck every time some planned to kill !!! Be careful for a good laugh, but do not waste your time shopping. Just download it, or something cheap.
