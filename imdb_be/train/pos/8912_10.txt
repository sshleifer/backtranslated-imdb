I have read a lot of comments on this site criticizing Blob for being cheesy and or mannerisms. The film was reproached amateur action and weak special effects. What do you expect from a group of people whose only experience was in the production of low-budget local production (Valley Forge PA) Christian shorts. Let me say, I am too critical reviewer, that this film never took upon himself all that seriously. This fact should be clear from the unmatched music theme complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits. For what it's supposed to be, this film perfectly. I have seen several recent attempts to ultra low budget, Blair Witch Project was one of them, who have absolutely no entertainment value or intellectual thought of their plot. BWP was pure excrement. The Blob, on the other hand, a well-designed, good script and thoroughly interesting. The scene in which the old meteorite comes and pokes the mass contained in a stick was great and made a really horrible. The scene in the doctor's office with a blob slowly under a blanket on a gurney while he absorbed the old man was a cinematic masterpiece of horror. The bottom line is that I love this movie. I challenge anyone there to take $ 120,000.00, inflated the dollar value today, and make a movie anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the Blob. It simply can not be done. PERIOD! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
