Its a good thing I'm shooting a film before seeing the rating viewing this site. It was a great movie that I will add to my selection Christmas. The cast was amazing selected and Ben Affleck plays a good lead. I would say viewers who have not seen the movie, so go ahead and buy it. I rate it right up there with the Christmas holidays. The film was very funny and well written, and Ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well. What he says and does it just as I would assume that the person is too much money to operate. The film is much funnier than Santa Claus and Christmas with the Kranks. In addition, it has a good story and teach the true meaning of Christmas, which you can not buy love with money.
