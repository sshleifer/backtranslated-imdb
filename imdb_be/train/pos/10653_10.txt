I know that it is now fashionable to hate this movie. I have seen hundreds of spook films, including the original 1963, he Ghosts, as well as most of the Hammer films. This film could not restrain himself and not hold back at all, which is probably why so many of today's viewers do not seem to like it. However, many viewers can take from under the control of films like Scream, because the killer knife more easy to believe for most people than demons or spirits. In fact, this movie had a lot of great scenes and the action and special effects were great. I've seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish film, and does not try to type of realism 6th feelings. Ghost lets go and certainly not boring. Perhaps this film could still turn to John Carpenter fans, but more of a traditional story structure. Haunting old was also a great movie from 1963. It was even worse. See as well as Innocent and The Legend of Hell House Pamela Franklin.
