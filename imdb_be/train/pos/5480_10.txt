This is a great movie, it shows that our government will be up to other countries, if we do not like their government. It's not as bad as what Reagan and Bush number one made in South America, but the United States still has no business messing with other countries as it is. This movie also proves that the American media spouts government propaganda. That's exactly what they did Aristide in Haiti. The reason for this coup against Chavez failed this Chavez was selected from more than 90% of the vote. <br /> <br /> This film is not just a political documentary, it would still be a great film, if it were a drama, it is surprising that it is real. <br /> <br /> another reviewer is lying when he says: "Chavez seizes the airwaves," the private media operates anti Ch√°vez propaganda all the time.
