Ah, from the "Eyes Wide Shut" Kubrick (Track 2), "I got it just as I arrived at the door. This "Waltz number 2 from Jazz Suite number 2" as part of Dmitry Shostakovich conducted here of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Yes, I went and picked up the soundtrack of the tower. What a treat!

It is not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely devoted to the comprehensive cost of the film.

Director Marlene Gorris with "Antonia Lines" (1996 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar from the Netherlands) gave us quietly sensitive film - is not without its troubling human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family seeks, lovingness and respect. The front end of the object of the mind games and mathematical logic of chess. Under it can be easy sentimental drama set in the late 1920s.
