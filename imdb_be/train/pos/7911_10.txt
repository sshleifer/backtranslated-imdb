As a child I loved to computer animation, although it was very limited, and tools were almost non-existent. This film, as I sat in awe and watched the strange images and almost hypnotic music, formed in me a desire to create a movement of things in the computer. It is a package deal between the music and videos that really packs a one-two punch. If you know of any child who wants to participate in computer animation, it has to be. <br /> <br /> I still, after almost 20 years, this film the course as one of my top 3 favorites. Originality, I think, is still unsurpassed most modern McMovies, Hollywood spits. Now I wanted to see if I could re-do it yourself; If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then this film deserves imitation TON =)
