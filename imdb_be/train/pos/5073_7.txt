This docu-drama that one would expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us the "Gandhi": beautifully photographed, compelling cast, well written in a measured, competent way that Hollywood is discarded in the 30s, and scrupulously accurate. It stands out as a genre film, excelling in his portrayal of the Indian (or, respectively, for the Canadian setting, "First Nations") culture, and stood with «Black Robe», how wonderfully photographed part Canoe country and its culture (here, about 1934). This idyllic portrait comes the drama of its subject: of Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, Scot raised in Hastings (England) from maiden aunts, who have become so obsessed with the "Native American" stories about his childhood, he went to Canada, he disappeared into the woods, and He became a hunter and adopted son ozhibve group. It was a vain man with a habit to get married and give up <br /> <br /> Indian bride, none of which seems to have thought less of it, because it was extremely charming and roguish character. One of his wives (one more intelligent than he is, according to the majority) stuck it into prominence as a writer and an early advocate of the protection of the wild north of the country, and this forms the focus of the story Attenborough. Chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (wife Gray Owl Pony) is an attractive and, if not Firya, nevertheless, very touching. A good movie, if you need some time off from the madding crowd.
