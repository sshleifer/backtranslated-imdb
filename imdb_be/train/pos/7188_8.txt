Together with the "King of the rocket men", it was still repeated on BBC TV in the early to mid-eighties. If I was downloading a time capsule of that period these two series, of course, to go. <br /> <br /> Someone was watching it for the first time will think it's stupid, but it's one of the best examples of Don Del Oro "serial." make you laugh (When I was a kid, my nickname for him was Mr. Dustbin head), and it was interesting to shoot, he says. "your bullets can not harm me", he stumbles backward, seemingly less fortunate I also like how he manages with Sebastian in the first episode of <br /. > <br /> I watched it again, because I had good memories of him from years ago, there are some good tricks and good music but it has the ingredients you would expect, including water, rockfalls, runaway wagon ... In the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner) swordplay was not nearly as good as I remembered, and it has the inevitable "flashback" episode! he gets a 8 out of 10 because it is still suffering from a slow tempo, padding, and other tricks. If you are interested in this series, I recommend a book by William Whitney "on the door, into battle, out door to ChaseÂ», although there only a small entry on the series in it.
