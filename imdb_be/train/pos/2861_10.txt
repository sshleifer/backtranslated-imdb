I love this show and my 11 year old daughter and I love to watch it together. It teaches a good old-fashioned values ​​meet, daring and entertaining form (albeit with a few predictable story much of the time). It's also a lot of fun to make fun of ... you know, rewind and insert your own dialogue, instead of actors. <br /> <br /> I set my DVR to record all episodes, and I happened to catch the tail end of the episode (just in time for the next one, beginning ... so I do not know what episode it was), but it was absolutely terrible sequencing errors! Adam handed the sheriff Coffee small sample of the "skin", which was torn from the wool of an Outlaw, as he attempted to make his escape, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Well, Roy happened to the coat, so he put it on the table and put the samples directory exactly where he was taken out of. The sample was exactly right ... I think it would be almost impossible to tear off a piece of leather (Naugahyde? Yes. The skin post-1950? I do not think so). Well, the sample lined up perfectly, and the mystery was solved. <br /> <br /> Not 10 seconds into the scene, we see again the coat, still lying on the table Roy. But this time, the sample is more like a form of North Carolina and is now in a completely different place on the coat (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat) and the seam (which was smack dab in the middle of the sample), no ... like a seam coat. My daughter enjoyed a good laugh, we played a short scene over and over again! This simple For YouTube, I tell ya! <br /> <br /> We're still totally love the show, although sequencing errors make it very fun!
