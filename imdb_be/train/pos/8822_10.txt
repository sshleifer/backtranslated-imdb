Soft transit with nonsense secrets of narrative logic. In no time, no place for a way Vigalondo could not delight in the B / W by means of the imagination, and in spite of (because of) the tight budgets. <br /> <br /> C spacetime film reaches unity intensity short poem (almost haiku). Spain, land ambulance poetry in B / W (Â¿remember early Bunuel?). <br /> <br /> A must see for encouraging our faith in the young cinema outside the US.
