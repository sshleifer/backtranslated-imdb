First quickly "shut up!" For those who say the movie stinks. You can not go to every film that is waiting for "Citizen Kane." It was a really fun movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only flaw in this film, I do not think that was enough solder between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should have dwelt more on this. In addition, the movie is good fun. Selma Blair should eat something. It worries me. But it still looks nice. So yes, I recommend this movie for a date or a light Saturday during the second half of the fun of the day. Go <br /> <br /> RATING :. ** 1/2 ****
