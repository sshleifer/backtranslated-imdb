Canadian director Mary Harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some artistic excess of the sixties and the eighties hollow stingy. With Â«The Notorious Bettie Page", she points her inexorable eye fifties America, disguised era in the moral rightness of Joe McCarthy, experiencing the beginning of a sexual awakening that would lead to the free love of the next decade. Harron and Guinevere Turner, her co-author, is clearly not interested in the standard biographical sex symbol. This is a film about an underground icon of the era and how its sheer shameless sexuality detected as predatory instincts and impure thoughts about the culture of untouched beauty of the naked body. If the details of life Bettie was the whole movie was concerned, why would finish it for her the most tragic period was supposed to start. It is obvious that Harron more interested in America's attitude towards sexual imagery now and then. Together with the fearless performance led by Gretchen Mol and stunningly atmospheric cinematography W.Mott Hupfel III, it achieves this aim great, raising the mirror of the past, making the viewers to explore their own "educated" 21st Century attitudes towards SO- called pornography. How America is choking under the new conservatism, this film needed more than ever.
