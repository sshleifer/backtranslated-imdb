Firstly, I would like to point out that the people who criticize this film made some egregious errors. Everything that has a rating of less than 6/10 is clearly utter nonsense. <br /> <br /> Creep absolutely fantastic film with stunning movie effects. Actors very plausible narrative and thought-provoking horror and graphic content is very alarming. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of mystery in this film. There are a lot of questions, as the audience was called strange and bizarre creatures, which makes the habitat in the dark rat covered tunnels. As «Craig» created and what happened to him? <br /> <br /> A movie with a large coefficient of a metal mold. The film with so many unresolved issues and the film, which must be taken into account, along with other like 28 days later, Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. <br /> <br /> Look forward to more of these fantastic films !!
