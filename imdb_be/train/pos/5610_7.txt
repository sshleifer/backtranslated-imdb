Roman Polanski masterfully directs this kind of variation on the same theme as repulsion. I can not imagine there is one honest film goer is not able to recognize the outstanding director Les Locataire, yet both parts dyptic may not be satisfactory for most people, including me. <br /> <br /> Polanski very well make us feel the inner torment of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion himself in Le Locataire), starting from a certain lack of confidence in the near future to turn gradually in the psychological embarrassment finally blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise. Together ordeal for the characters and the audience really different from the fear and tension of horror films, because there is no tangible supernatural element here. While horror films allow a catharsis (whether it's cheaper or more advanced) Polanski sadistically torment us, and if in his latest opus dark humor is permanent, we are basically on our nerves, unlike on the edge of our places. <br /> <br /> Gripping horror, the whole thing to play with the audience's expectations (as an alternative to cheating and their performance), but not in the literal sense of the nerves of people. In my book Rosemary's Baby is a much greater achievement as pure paranoia and simple rationality is in constant struggle: the story of a pair moves in an amazing apartment, whereas we have to identify with one character. Moreover, if the imagination, all the items in the hero's mind is the most uncomfortable situation, because we, the viewers, are forced to judge it, reject it while we were cleverly lured ( "paint" n devices ") in life it.
