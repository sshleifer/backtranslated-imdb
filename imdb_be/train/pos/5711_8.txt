The Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the great directors of cinema and great pioneers created a gem of light comedy, which, for all its lightness is an innovative and technically brilliant film, which is clearly under the influence of these filmmakers, such as the Marx Brothers, Lubitsch, and Mamulyan. The plot, witty story of a poor artist who won a huge lottery jackpot, but should look frantically around the city of the missing ticket, basically just a device to support a series of surprisingly witty comic scenes taken in the dream world of the imagination. <br /> <br /> One of the director's most impressive things about this film is that, although it is located in the heart of Paris, and does not include anything really impossible, it reaches a stable and featuring fabulous / fancy atmosphere in which it seems quite natural that people sing as well as they say, and that the struggle for the stolen jacket should take the form of a football match. Another memorable element is that Le Million includes what may be the funniest opera ever put on film also enjoy casting (Oh, blonde braid soprano "I laugh, ha ha!"!): Clair gathered a group of strange, sharply different character actors, each of them with deadly accuracy illustrate the "type" of the satirical French bourgeoisie, so that the film seems set Domiya prints to life. <br /> <br /> fun takes a while to get rolling, and I discovered that the characters are not as emotional part, because they can even be in a light comedy (as, for example, in many films Lubitsch.) to these reasons I refrained from giving it the highest rating. But these minor quibbles do not detract from the captured recommendations. <br /> <br /> If you see this? In all senses. It is highly recommended if you want a classic and influential work of cinema or just a fun comedy.
