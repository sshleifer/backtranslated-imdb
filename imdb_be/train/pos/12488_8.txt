I do not picky about horror movies, and I'm ready to watch just about any of them. This does not mean that I'm ready to re-watch a lot of them, or that I will not be criticized for them. This movie is terrible, and very well done. In fact, I think this film will make a great double bill with the Session 9. <br /> <br /> I have to show before you get on my observations, I watched it alone. I started to watch it before going to sleep, and got about 15 minutes before I realized that it was too effective, so I kept the rest in the morning. Even while watching him in broad daylight, he was still terrible. Nevertheless, I can not vouch for how effective it will be when viewed in the larger group. <br /> <br /> After the death of his daughter, it is time to move to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death. Let me make a point of this death - this is one of those rare films do not shy away from the death of a child. It is much more important, because it sets the tone, and explains much of the action that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> A couple of not very good. Wife distanced themselves from the relationship, and her husband is doing what it can to try to get her back. While some of the comments that have complained about the action - one stated that they act more as a father and daughter than a husband and wife, and it's legal. He tries to give her more directions. This is the role that men sometimes take over. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of panic in the film, and most of them are non-violent, grotesque though in some respects. The story itself feels very easy for most of the film, and takes an odd twist near the end. As long as the queue is not absurd, it is certainly not what you'd expect from how things were progressing. <br /> <br /> Moody, atmospheric and very well made for what appears to have been filmed on video.
