Half a dozen short story interests me enlighten us about life in Finland. These stories are interwoven, and each of which comprises a stage in which the sound is heard shot. This indicates that the events depicted take place at the same time. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a banjo jump, which promises some excitement, but the early history of fairly low key. The film improves so stick with it. Two broken marriages in history, which are providing a lot of drama, and the scene in the hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief. The last moments with his wife, both convincing and touching. <br /> <br /> While the various scenes of family life take place in Finland, the theme of a general nature where you live. <br /> <br /> The collection of short stories rarely satisfies both good intense 90-minute drama.
