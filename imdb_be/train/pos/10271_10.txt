This film should not be compared with «The Sting», or other capers / Heist / rogue feature films. What makes it such a great movie experience what he has to say about relationships, cheating i trust. This is also true for the sharp criticism of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink, which is so easily fooled, and then act in a primitive form in the final. Has Mr. Mamet had a bad experience in therapy? Very, very recommended!
