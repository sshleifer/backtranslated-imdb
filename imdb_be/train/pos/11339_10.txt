Jake (mesmerizing Anthony Demark) simply "transfer" of injury, two squabbling parents in an understandable way? Could be a real creature? Writer / director Shelli Ryan carefully balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing. Her choice with a single installation - suburban home - adds to the feeling of despair and claustrophobia <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Brizhers are very convincing as angry, but loving parents .. However, this is terrible minor characters, Mrs. Bender (by Barbara Gruen), went crazy nanny and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a sleazy real estate agent that linger in the mind. Jake's Closet is a dark childhood inspired portrait is a special kind of hell.
