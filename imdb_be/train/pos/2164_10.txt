I watched it last night and was amazed at the heart of the storyline, excellent character development and good karmic vibe emanating from actions and film in general. <br /> <br /> I do not giving too much of the plot it starts with an ordinary Joe, switched to work in the office every day, which is becoming inspired to take dance lessons. On the way the main character, and assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor to learn the lessons of others and themselves. <br /> <br /> The story has a prologue that dances in Japan symbolizes the sociological, so it's not quite so easy to learn how to dance in Japan, both here in the US <br /> <br /> film carefree ; you will laugh out loud some of the gags. However, it is also worthy of so difficult to describe. All the characters in the movie is taken seriously, as they are, and no one is reduced because of their "imperfections". <br /> <br /> I thought about taking classes social dancing with friends. It just so happens, a friend gave me a video to study dance. Whether it is synchronous or what? I think so, because now I'm really geeked, to give it a try. <br /> <br /> Look at this wonderful family film (small children can not get it, but teenagers will of course) and smile at this care you can show it again and again. <br /> <br /> Why do they have to do a remake of Shall We Dance mystery, as it is perfect as it is.
