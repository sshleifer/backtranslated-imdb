Antwone Fisher story of childhood abuse and neglect is a source of inspiration for all of us who have witnessed or experienced severe foster children. Abandoned restless mother, Antwone never seen his father. Growing up with the "church going" offenders using Â«N-word" is not only to intimidate and hurt, but also as a period of grace, as a young man witnesses his best friend was killed in a robbery, leaving the racist and tease, serving on Navy, Antwone anger slowly turns into a positive force, when a psychiatrist instructed the Navy and love enters his life. <br /> <br /> scene where Antwone met his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film. Overwhelmed by the unexpected confrontation, the woman listened in silence to hear the young man to tell her how he lived a life without crime, drug addiction, fatherhood kids left and right, all, in spite of its extremely unfavorable conditions. <br /> <br /> If this scene was not strong enough, the next one is driving it home (and opens the flood gate) to welcome home reception Antwone; dozens of smiling faces and open arms saying that it is part of this big family. <br /> <br /> One of the messages delivered by this remarkable film is the fact that there are a lot of well-meaning and sincere people who are working to help orphans and unwanted children. Even if some of the houses, and administrators do not seem to care and are self-serving, many of them give their all. A character who found the "file" Antwone once he revealed the circumstances of his birth, one of the "bright lights" system in the dark. <br /> <br /> DVD includes a French language track, different versions of subtitles, as well as additional features and information on the adoptive parents. <br /> <br /> As a Clevelander, I appreciated the location of the frame. No matter where you are, you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical stone.
