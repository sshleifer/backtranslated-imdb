I loved this movie. I knew it would be chocked full of camps and stupid as in the original series. I found it very heart warming to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar all together again. Anyone who loves Batman series from the 60s should be used whether the return to the Batcave. You could tell that the actors had a lot of fun making this film, particularly Adam West. And I'm sure he'd love to jump back into his Batman costume was the script required it to do so. I told a few friends about this film, which has decided not to see it ... now they wish they had. I have all the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this film will join my collection. Thank you for the reunion of Adam and Burt.
