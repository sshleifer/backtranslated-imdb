So, the neighbor killed neighbor. Reminds Iraq. As I watched the American flag (50 stars in 1864?) Pull on the horse, I realized why this piece is lit red white and blue does not bother me as much as our destruction / indifference to the Bill of Rights. I am a Southerner, and should have some historical memory. <br /> <br /> Watching character Tobey McGuire learn to respect the dignity of a former slave, as he looks for scalps blacks and Germans (his ethnic origin), supplied in a poker game ..... it was interesting. Many twists in this film. A wife who is forced into her marriage, shows how desire, and a strong will, characteristics, we are not used to seeing in "respectable Victorian southern beauties. <br /> <br /> Crazy wacked with renegade Southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin, Copeland head Horse-thief gang, Inc. in Mississippi, was hanged on time. Groups of homeless people wandering through the countryside, armed. I remind Iraq? and how we look at the facade of religion and ethnic origin? and why southerners still fighting the civil war today. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that we can not use the same knowledge in our country, we only handle broke and occupy, kindling civil war in the world. It Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, which happen to have the misfortune to sit oil. Wild killer eye in Missouri, sabotage Lawrence, Kansas could so easily be the rebels we are struggling now with no success. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly was a tribute to his father to the Yankees, who moved to Lawrence erecting school "before they build the church. And for this reason, they will win. "Yes ????? I taught history in Birmingham, Al, and we were taught that the North was much more industrialized and richer ..... why they won. Of course, they, too, God was literally on their side. As you can see here, if freed slave shows that it cuts to free his mother sold into slavery in Texas. God, what a terrible legacy of slavery has given us. <br /> <br /> By acting is very good, a lot of blood and gore, as warriors ride into battle with joy (but did not hear any rebel yell, so reminiscent of football matches in Alabama). You can also get a real sense of how the war was stupid as Bushwackers jayhawkers and gather their strength for another raid. They do not take into account why they are fighting, so we will. Just a senseless slaughter. <br /> <br /> You are also brought up to date with what armless children return home from Iraq as Bushwacker (aah, that connotation), the first has his arm burned shut, trying to save it, then he amputated, and then dies. So much suffering for such a stupid reason. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is fantastic. Now I must return to DVD, and get the production notes, one of my favorite parts of any movie. I suspect that this film was written by Gore Vidal as the spoken language of the type you would associate with that era, if you knew the story. Dialogue is certainly suggestive. Not your usual blood and guts war movie, by any means. You see the wounded, but still on active duty soldiers, still struggling, because they have nothing else to do. You can see the southern raider living with the land, stealing indiscriminately. However, in the beginning, did you see the fight stop, so that women can be evacuated from the danger. As I read the escalation of the number of women and children, who are dying in Iraq, I mean, "Where we lose a sense of pride as a people?" I forgot why I was looking for this movie and bought it after 20 years, but some book somewhere praised it. With good reason. Tobey in his best pre Spideyman. Buy a DVD or rent it. And tell me why others praise it, not just liberals CEST Mol.
