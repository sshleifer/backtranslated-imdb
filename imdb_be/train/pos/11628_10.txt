"I do not want this to get complicated, Leese. I must assume that it is going to read it. "Fear takes off at 30,000 feet in this taut thriller. Night flight to Miami quickly turns into a battle for survival when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) implements its seatmate (Cillian Murphy) plans to use it as part of a frightening attempt. The minutes tick by, it is a race against time to warn potential victims before it is to late. <br /> <br /> One of the many causes of why I love this movie, because of the chemistry between the two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who is also my two top favorite actors. For example, the early scenes at the airport to play more like a romantic comedy: two people continue to work with each other .... I have to pass it on to two, as well as to create a movie like this work. Especially the character of Murphy .. Jackson, who actually seems kind of complicated, so that it acts a charming and innocent, but he is trying to do his job and make the League feel trapped physically and mentally. I mean, in some parts it does seem concerned about Lisa. <br /> <br /> A great thrill ride all the way to the end. A lot of films that I did not want to see a prequel or sequel about, but in reality I would not mind a prequel to this, which will be held from Jackson surveilling Lisa. My favorite scene is probably what Headbutt scene, because it was so unexpected. Was also pleased that the build-up to the famous "pen" scene. If she was going to make his move? It was also good that the change in Makedoy League, where she changed themselves from being a victim to resist. I also loved the scene where she sits in the food court and pretending to ask some will give an overview of the food court. How great was his whole Murphy weezing .....
