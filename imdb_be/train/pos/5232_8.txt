This film is a journey through the mind of the writer, caught up in his paradoxical philosophy. He explores the ghost when the question "who am I" and "what am I doing? This bold and thoughtful enterprise. There is a cargo of remarkable images, dreams, style, Escher-like paradoxes that resemble hand image itself, or, more precisely, erasing himself. More and more we go for a writer in agony over what to say and what to remove, we can see that he's calling his wife, who went to Peru, leaving him to care for her child, a task it performs less and less attention to the time, he was so busy with his dilemma, he hardly looks at the child more. His wife comes back and makes the scene, destroying their records, and helps him to go over the last Treshold, while it does not erase it-I. Interspersed with eye-pleasing and I-destructively, the story mainly philosophical. We are talking about loops Mayan world of illusions. The paradox of the film, however, is that it requires a lot of talking and thinking to prove that thinking has to stop. For more than two hours a provocative beauty and rapid philosophizing movie made me long silence or a short film. If it was the aim of the producer, he succeeded quite well.
