Someone mentioned to be "at the right time in the right place," It was so exactly for this documentary that I had doubts about the authenticity of the scenes, and thought that it might have included some effect, but it is not. It's all really. The history is nothing new for the people of developing and / or poor countries. It sheds light on the manipulation of the people by the corporate media, misinformation, artificial polarization of people, deliberately creating tension in the streets, sometimes to the ste nor the army, intelligence services or even the government (in the opinion of many, led by the US) using an agent that attack "any" side to provoke mass violence and, thus justifying their coup. The naval officer in the film mentions it too. the fact that they wanted to see people face on the streets. All of these scenarios were played in Turkey (US pet dog in the Middle East), throughout its history, which has gone through three coups in recent years, the secret plans made by the Turkish army have been exposed, ironically by the pro-government religious / conservative media and opposition and religious doctrines of the army, which is very important mosque bombed an army agent to provoke people, etc. <br /> <br /> what makes this film unique in that they were shooting from inside, perhaps by accident, when events occurred. It is clear that the directors of Chavez. it caused whether or not the director to filter and manipulate events and information, I do not know. <br /> <br /> And whether Chavez will be defending the Venezuelan people against the dictatorship of the US and world economy without stifling any opposing thought to power and ultimately become self indulgent tyrant, history will tell. <br /> <br /> But, at least, Chavez is hope, and I think it is worth taking a chance.
