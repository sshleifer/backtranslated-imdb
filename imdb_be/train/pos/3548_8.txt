Just I saw this film version of Guys and Dolls Frank Loesser for the third time with my mother, who had never seen it before. She was pleasantly surprised voices singing, Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And she thought that Havana sequences where Simmons and Brando dance storm were excellent. It was pretty impressive to me, too, and, as a rule, the highlights of the film. Directed by Mankiewicz, this film, which has emerged as a Damon Runyon story takes some time to slow stimulation with non-musical scenes in the first, but it pulls you in some time. Another story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not so convincing for me, but still had its charms, especially during non «Sue Me». Also loved "Sit down, you rock the boat" number Stabia Kaogo in performance and Sheldon Leonard and BS Pully. With a theatrical look everywhere, Guys and Dolls is not a great film music, but, of course, very good.
