This film was absolutely BRILLIANT !! Each performance in this film perfectly, especially Jake Zhillenhol and Chris Cooper. It seems that Mr. Zhillenhol will be a huge film career, if this is anything to go by. I thought that Joe Johnston was an odd choice as a director, he is usually associated woth big-budget blockbusters (Jumanji, Honey I Shrunk the Kids). He pulls out each scene with sheer class. My favorite scene where Homer tunnel goes down and looking at the sky, descending, like all his dreams were, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant acting driven films, as well as its big-budget blockbuster Faire, which is also great. KUDOS !! for all involved in this masterpiece!
