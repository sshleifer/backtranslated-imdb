In addition to a great film Metropolis, it is a very old pure science fiction film. Although from time to time a little instructive film and the action can be a little wide, it is a great movie for two reasons. Firstly, it is very original in style and content. Even in the 21st century, NO movies that I can think of is that there is nothing like it. Secondly, for its time, the special effects were absolutely incredible - using matte paintings, models and large molds to create amazing scenes as a post-apocalyptic world, and a great city tomorrow. Of course, you can sit and bang the film because, by today's standards, the effects just so. But you must understand that this state of the art, when the film came out in 1936, and it should be really impressed the audience. In many ways, the sets look very reminiscent of the "modern cities", presented at the fair in 1939 in the world. <br /> <br /> I think that the film is also interesting in that it seems to be torn by the question, "people really so stupid or we are doomed to greatness? "The end result seems to be a bit of both! How exactly <br /> <br /> One last note: I saw it twice on TV, and only a short time ago on video. All three times the sound and print quality stank - especially the sound. If it is available on DVD, hopefully, it's much cleaner and provide additional captioning. Since the sound in the video is kept cut, I would really appreciate it!
