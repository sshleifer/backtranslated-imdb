I saw it on the flight over to the U.S and was a bit skeptical at first as some people have said that there were so many characters in it that you do not get to know any of them. Nevertheless, I do not find this at all. The film is very fast, but this is due to the nature of the director and the stars. The chase scene is beautiful and so it may be predictable, but perhaps that is true for most films. The main villain a bit summed Christopher Eccelston not as convincing as it could be, but the fact that it is still a good movie.
