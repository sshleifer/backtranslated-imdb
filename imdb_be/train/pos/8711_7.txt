It is beyond my comprehension that so much debris Norway remastered for DVD release, and still gems like this not get a shot at recapturing their former glory. I give it 7, and not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few films SciFi made for Norwegian television. This film is not less than the film-historical gem that is in many ways foreshadows the first alien movie. And, honestly, Blindpassasjer was the first! Perhaps Ridley Scott or someone in the team to see the mini-series? However unlikely, the fact remains that the scenes are very similar. Well, _much_ budget is lower than in the Norwegian film, but given that it's really well done part of the work to the age of uninhabited Norwegian film-making, which, incidentally, lasted until the '90s.
