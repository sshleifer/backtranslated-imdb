Not a day goes by without a new released computer-animated film, so now we really have a chance to see more than a few interesting effects. After watching the ice I felt that it was not that big impact on me than some other movies of this genre. <br /> <br /> But it's because I'm a big guy, and I'm sure this is a very enjoyable film for children (possibly up to 14 years). The story is quite simple, and the "actors" fun in a nice manner without any crude or sophisticated humor. Even "evil" wonderful, fluffy big cat with these funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending, which was a little disappointing for me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in the sadly), but the big thing for the kids. And except for some fights no one dies (even when he gets trampled by a mammoth, several times), which made the cartoon feel. <br /> <br /> Computer animation part is good, but nothing special, except for some very pleasant cartoon scene a sense, when you feel like walking into the pages of a good painting or comic. [This means a lot of work, though!] <br /> <br /> There were some gags that made me smile - I accept, the creators have tried to meet these adults - but they are difficult to detect and (in my opinion) better go unnoticed since he does not feel in history. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie, but it is rather in the ideal world-and-fluffy-animals-for-kids Disney stencil. If you hate cute animals doing funny things to watch at least once.
