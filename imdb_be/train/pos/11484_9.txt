I have just returned from the Montreal premiere of zero-day ... and I'm surprised as hell to find a negative comment about the film. Basically guilty of Coccio makes simple and overestimated the social message ... Well, Mr.-I-to-reviewer, it's easy and overestimated the film critic with a social charge. <br /> <br /> I do not that I want to expose my life here, but I'm from a small town with a similar school than those guys go. Decline and ignorance on the menu. The thing is ... I know how to young children can be forced to do so awful. High schools have become battle fields of conformity. It's a real ugly appearance. You must fight their way in life, as well as others. It's hard to explain, I was bitten by a lot of people dosen't realize that universities are mounds of human intelligence. Meanwhile, the parents close their eyes and smiling about how their lives are in their comfortable suburb perfect. <br /> <br /> The real motive of the film is not about the fact that their management. It is this death as a quiet suburb, and all close their eyes and try to create the atmosphere of an ideal city. Cal put it well. This is a wake up call. Drama is everywhere and can take all forms. In this case, the little dramas (as Andr√© called fag to wear Penny J.C shirt) forms in life worse nightmare of the entire city. Andre & Cal took the most extreme way to express their pain. Malaise of disagreement in an era when you need more than ever to be like the others, to be accepted. <br /> <br /> I like especially the last scene, where some guys are burning crosses Andre & Cal as if they communicated with the pain, Cal & Andre spoke of their blind fury of their community, their refusal to think about the causes of certain acts. <br /> <br /> It may seem aggressive, like in the movies, but Coccio meditates more than whining or saying. That Andre & Cal live reality ... and scary one who can get to the other children. <br /> <br /> Reckless film ... manufactured homes and a strong sense did Ben Coccio done very, very disturbing film.
