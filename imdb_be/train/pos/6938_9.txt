For the viewer who comes to him for a long time after its adoption, "Winchester 73" have something in common with the "Casablanca". While you look at it, you get the feeling that you look at the cliché line encountered so often in the genre; then you realize that clichés become clichés only after a copy of a particular movie, and they were so widely copied, because this movie was so great. In other words, it is an original work. <br /> <br /> «Winchester 73" is a joy to watch. Wide story line somewhat predictable, but mostly because you've seen them copied so many times in later films, and yet it still contains a number of twists that will surprise you. Dialogue, Shagan and direction Mann fine. Stewart shines in particular, and if you're a fan of this "must see", but he is not alone in providing good performance. It is noteworthy that many of the most thoughtful and / or witty lines go to a secondary character. Because it makes these characters (much) more than a cardboard cut-outs, he added realism of the film. <br /> <br /> It's amazing underrated film, and should watch out for. The DVD also includes an interview with Stewart, who provides some background on the film.
