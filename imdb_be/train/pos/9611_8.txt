It was surprisingly reasonable for a television movie, and completely faithful to his own experience bulimia. It was in fact well understood, and I can only assume that it was written by someone who has been through such an experience, because he had all the little details. The characters were pretty well drawn, and speeches Uinningoy and Alison Lohman were great. I think what I like most is that they have made them a specific and reasonable, and there was no dumbing down of the causes of bulimia Beth (this was not some kind of "diet out of control, due to the pressure placed on girls in the mass media information, the pressure we're really not going to appeal ... ") Her mother was not completely ignorant -. all too often on television, they would take issue that everyone has some understanding and trying to tell us that their protagonists with ' are the last remaining people on earth who do not ( "Tsu roar diabetes What is that? Oh, my world is askew, Doctor, please explain all this to me, as if I were a little kid, "etc.). It was great that her mother was a psychologist and even she does not see the signs. A scene where the bets were not torn too melodramatic and sensational, and are more focused on the need Bulimics' privacy, and is controlness. The scene where Beth says her mother, she bulimia would make me weep, if there were no other people in the room. <br /> <br /> So I liked these bits. What does not work for me as well was the end of that went back to the territory of TV movies, we know and do not particularly like, but I believe that they should have been wrapped. "You can also cure your child's eating disorder, if you have lots and lots of money and live in America ...Â» <br /> <br /> And I can only say again that I really like Uinningey. It excellent.
