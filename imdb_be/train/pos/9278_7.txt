The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, two other films by Jafar Panahi, what I saw, the director of the mine strange amount of depth on subjects that seem, on the surface, little. The offside tragicomic Panahi tribute to Iranian women stand up for their rights, I do not think he's as successful. Not what it says it does not matter, of course (and it's too bad that, like almost any other film Panahi, the Iranians can not see). But, after a while, the film feels a little flat, and it feels like a long time, even for 90 minutes. Not to say that I do not like it, though. The actors are all fantastic, and the celebration of the end of the film is contagious. But this is not an important job, in my opinion.
