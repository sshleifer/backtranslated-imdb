This must be one of the best movies about serial killers that I've ever seen, and this is coming from someone who absolutely loved the silence of the lambs. HBO Altyn here. This film is convincing from the first moment to the last. <br /> <br /> This film has so many major topics it is difficult to say exactly what it is. This chronicle of a decade of research of Russian serial killer Chikatilo Andrea. Stephen Rea gives a brilliant performance reserved as an inexperienced medical examiner, which have been responsible for the investigation, and Donald Sutherland gives even more performance, both with the participation of its cynical above, and the only person in the Russian government are willing to help him. Both of their performances subtle masterpieces --- Rea starts naive and does not want to compromise and Sutherland starts to separate i almost pleased with the situation. Toward the end, Rea became more tired and knocked system, while Sutherland feels more passionate and idealistic. <br /> <br /> In any other film, I would say that Sutherland's performance stands above the rest, but even here he competed Jeffrey DuMann, as does a serial killer. DuMann brilliantly creates a character who is her compassion, not hate, we think we have found --- he's a monster, but he wants to be, and we get the idea that it is just as disgusting, what he is doing as we are. He tormented, embarrassed but vicious as well. <br /> <br /> If you can take an incredibly dark object (and it * very * disturbing), then you should see this film.
