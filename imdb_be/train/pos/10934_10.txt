After watching this intense martial arts movie the first time in almost 18 years, I have to say that does not lose its mystique or his scary martial arts action, as I remember from my youth. The history of the dying martial arts instructor sends his "unfinished" the student to find the 5 former members of his clan poison, so that they do not seek the happiness that each master holds hidden. Fearing that his last student did not have enough training, he instructs him to befriend one of the five "poisons" in order to defeat the other four. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about the choreography and camera work. A great movie in its own right and is quite possibly one of the best martial arts movies ever made. Classical !!
