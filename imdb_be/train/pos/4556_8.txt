I watched this movie in the joy of the county. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the best movies of all time. It has a timeless value that you can get so much from it is amazing. There are parts that are moving, funny, and just fine. <br /> <br /> All aspects of the spots on the image of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% real, even small Irish subtleties were covered. <br /> <br /> use of low and high shots gives two great looks on Cristy (look at it). <br /> <br /> performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible. I've never seen an actor do it, ever. It's really weird. <br /> <br /> And it's so cool to look at, it flows so well, it's probably the closest year can get to the real life experience. I love it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, you should see it. Do not have any doubt about it, there is something there for everyone.
