Pinjar is truly a masterpiece .... It's a thought provoking film that makes you think and makes you doubt our culture. This is, without doubt, the best Hindi film I've seen to date. The film was to be shown at film festivals around the world, and I believe, would be a serious opponent in Cannes. All the characters were completely discard and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were obsessive in his role. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film tells of the division are very very important story, and one that should never be forgotten. <, Br /> <br /> It has no bias or prejudice and distributed protects human history. Where no country is referred to as good or bad. There are evil, evil Indians and Pakistanis are good Indians and Pakistanis. Cinematography cool and melodic music, meaningful and memorable. Everything about the film was amazing ... and that acts only took my breath away. All of them were absolutely reject.
