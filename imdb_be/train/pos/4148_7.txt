Let's set one thing straight: this film does not seek to revise the genre, it's not a doctor Streynzhlav of Young Frankenstein. It's silly flick, with three large female leads (I can not remember any other comedy with the same characteristics), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler on SNL and indie queen Parker Posey, charming as ever. The story is basic: three girls were "losers" in college, and even after his wards. Poehler dog trainer (who can not even get a date with a blind man), Posey is the assistant to the senator (who "has not been touched by a man since Clinton was in office," ... I caught that one in a few minutes .. . I was a bit slow, good!), and Dracht is gay (bride Seth Meyers of the SNL, funny). They have to prevent "loose" the senator's daughter (on the always cute Amber Tamblyn from the television series "Joan of Arcadia"), to embarrass her during spring vacation. of course, therefore, they have to go to watch her, and some fun is worth it. in general, mild, about pack of comedy, rather short and very pleasant
