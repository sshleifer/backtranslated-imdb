My brother brought this movie home from the rental shop, and I remember waiting for what it is opening. I think the title is especially pushed me. I can not remember from the film with such low expectations and be as victories. I watched the movie twice before I let my brother take it back to the store. It is very seldom that the film speaks to me like this one did. I was totally caught up in the situation of Ruby when she was trying to make its way through her life. The bad thing about this film is that it seems to end so quickly. I could have continued to watch for a few hours. Another drawback is the fact that I was dissatisfied with everything, Ashley Judd did so. She is so perfect in this film. This film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time.
