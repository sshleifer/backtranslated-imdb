It's very exciting, fascinating, tragic story. Very good, and for the most part, quite accurately, given that this is a television film, not a documentary. They create several fictional characters, and merge several real people into one character, but otherwise this is a good retelling of a very tragic and dark story. <br /> <br /> the final moments of the film, which shows a mass suicide / murder, almost directly taken from audio recordings made by Jim Jones. This recording was made during the last 44 minutes of the Temple of the peoples. It is available in several places online. This part of the film is almost spot on in this regard. <br /> <br /> In summary, a documentary, it's not. However, it covers most of the basic elements in the People's Temple history.
