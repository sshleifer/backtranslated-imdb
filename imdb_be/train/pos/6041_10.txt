This is one to watch several times. Excellent written the show they would have to live the story or know someone who did, because they nailed it. Freebird made me relive and laugh at my misspent youth. The title was a great choice. Great movie, setting, plot, characters and soundtrack. This biker flick, but it would be a shame to pigeon-hole it in this way. Funny bone, such as the Trailer Park Boys in the UK If you have never seen TPB, to make a point, if you like this movie. You'll thank me. I hope that I will see more of these characters in other films. Sequel? It can be done. There's a whole lot more light, I would like to see their eyes.
