(Q) What do you call 100 film critics buried up to the neck in sand? (A) A good start. Well, I do not know, Peter Mattei from Adam, but if it is a promising filmmaker his filmography suggests, "Love in the Time of money" is a "good start." Cool shooting with fancy music box style of music, it is a film looking at the chain of sparse relations, as it moves from person to person A to person B, etc. C ... ... and again finishing persons A & B in a rotary fashion, film gently explores the unfortunate circumstances of nine people with finely rendered by hatching, starting and ending with a street whore and her customers. The disadvantage of this film is the lack of history, which may have something to do with a number of critical bursts he received. I watched a hippo "Angels in America" ​​last night and it was boring at the end while this little concatenation character studies kept me spell bound. Be careful. Maybe I'm the only person who really liked this movie. (B)
