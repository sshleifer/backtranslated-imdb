I have seen many television movies in his time as a student, most of the normal expenditure of time, the US television throws. This one, however, is well designed and built, and had a very nice twist at the end. Having only seen Richard Dean Anderson MacGyver and Stargate, I was surprised by its excellent performance, rather than a range of expressions from A to B, he usually gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Zuniga after quite a long time, starting with The Fly II. Also nice to see Robert Guillaumme starring again. I can not say I've ever Jane Leeves seriously after days of Benny Hill, but it just failed to cope well in their roles. Overall, highly recommended film.
