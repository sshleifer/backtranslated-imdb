Gerard writer with more hyperactive imagination. He is also gay and Catholic inclined to Catholic guilt and something clairvoyant, or so it seems. The trip Flushing he "seduced" by Christine. When he discovers that the new boyfriend of Christina is a little rough trade he was presenting from a distance, he decides to stay. In the end, forced heterosexuality has its advantages. Then he realizes that the previous three husband Christina all died a violent death. Is Christine kill them, and he and a friend, Herman, is the "fourth man"? overheated, over-egged melodrama Verhoeven is a perfect blend of Hitchcock and David Lynch, OTT full of eroticism and religious imagery, and an awful lot of red. A lot of time it looks and feels like a dream, and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real or fiction Gerard. Fun to clarify it. In addition, the fact that Christina is a much more likeable character that either pedantic or bovine Gerard Herman means that we are unlikely to be the root for all of the men on it. In fact, it's fair to say the answer Gerard can not come quickly enough. Great performances also with Jeroen Krabb√© and Reni Sautendizhk and easily the best film Verhoeven him surprisingly subversive of the sci-fi "Starship Troopers."
