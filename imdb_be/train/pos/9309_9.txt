Dear God, where do I start. this is not a bar or the best movie I have ever seen. angles are great, but in my opinion, was the best actor. why the writers for this film do not write big budget movies will never understand. a second casting. it's great. this is the best film of Ted Raimi there for sure. I know that some of you were not likely thinking, "not because he has a lot better", but not your wrong. Raptor Island is a work of art. I hope that this has to be the best film of the year Goten instead bad movie crash with a bunch of no names and no lizards. I believe that this film is really the most amazing thing EVER.
