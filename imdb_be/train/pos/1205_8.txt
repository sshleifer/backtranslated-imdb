This film is the fact that its name describes. - an attempt to get you to buy that writers have to offer <br /> <br /> First of all, it's kind of fun to see in 1996 in style of Toronto, I remember, with all his silly hairstyles, sunglasses, clothing, and attitude. It actually has not changed any; just a good, safe, cheap, backwater provincial small town that makes a great meeting place for the international film types! It is also fun to see Kenny and Spenny head to Los Angeles to find out what it all again Toronto, only with an amazing assortment of beach bums, musicians, fortune tellers, and even more arrogant types of films. <br /> <br /> I do not see Pitch as a film to be enjoyed; it's not fun when the audience does not like to watch whose hopes are violated. I accept the Pitch as a warning that power and money really belong Execs studio and industrial buildings. Potential (and "successful"), writers, musicians and actors still only transient, even if they reach the big time. <br /> <br /> So, Kenny and Spenny trying to sell you a warning. Buy or not, but the message is still there.
