Once you have seen this little cute and comic movie, you will definitely feel better. Cheer Yves Pelletier, B., to generate this small wonderful movie moment that for me, will be recognized as marking the film in 2004 for Quebec. Actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon put all touching performance. I would compare the feeling that this beautiful story gives you the ones that Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain gave me. So if you like a beautiful film by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I would say that you should also, as the first film by Yves Pelletier, B., Les Aimants
