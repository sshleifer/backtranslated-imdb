Red Eye good little thriller to watch Saturday night. Intense action, a great villain and unexpected effect. <br /> <br /> Some of them might not want to see this movie, because it is a very short 85 Min and 88% of the movie on the plane and just talk. Do not worry, they pull it very well with the smart and witty dialogue. <br /> <br /> A PG-13 movie, it seems, the new base for director Wes Craven. But enough, of course, it is suitable as much violence as he possibly can in this thriller. <br /> <br /> This movie horse is cast. This film needs good actors to deliver dialogue and thrill. If they did not have such actors, the film would have been lost and sad. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy Batman Begins and 28 days later. Rounding this cast Brian Cox of the X-Men 2. <br /> <br /> Walk was great in this movie. Just when your thinking it's going to get bored they put a twist on you. Fortunately, this is not a long movie and does not feel like it either. . Much better than the other flight-flight movie plan <br /> <br /> This is my flight plan Comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend . Not too long, not too shabby. <br /> <br /> 8/10
