I do not know that the movie some of these people have seen, but they must have seen various "Joseph Smith: The Prophet of the Restoration." The one that I've seen <br /> <br /> I think that the film was both well done and inspiring. I think it is definitely worth a look. This is obvious from the outset that many efforts have gone into making this film. Background scenery beautifully. <br /> <br /> I think the film does a good job painting of Joseph Smith as a man and as a prophet. spiritual experience of Joseph is portrayed tastefully and respectfully. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend to watch this movie.
