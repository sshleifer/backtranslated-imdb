After playing a nymphomaniac in Written on the wind, Dorothy Malone finally said goodbye to her cute sister / wife role and demonstrated the ability to play mantraps with the best of them. She and Gloria Graham played the same vagrants - and for its efforts here in a very manipulative role, Malone won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar <br /> <br /> The film she is not quite to the Oscar standards. But it's strong enough melodrama under the skillful hands of Douglas Sirk in. There is almost noirish look to an explosive opening scene, and it sets the tone for the rest of the fireworks in the history of soap, which is Rock Hudson, Lauren Bacall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone as its headliners. <br /> <br /> infighting among residents of a wealthy family with a background of oil are the main focus of the drama, with an emphasis on the strong supporting players, Stack and Malone. Both of them, both hands grab the opportunity and the Stack, should also have been awarded for the sterling work as weak, alcoholic brothers brought to despair of their wild motives. <br /> <br /> star rating less impressive work to do, but do it with their usual skill and persuasiveness - Hudson and Bacall. They play their roles more lovely with a quiet power and understanding. <br /> <br /> The use of color is particularly striking (as it usually happens in the film Cirque), and yet it does not prevent me to think of the film as a Technicolor film noir in the spirit of God the judge her. <br /> <br /> Well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast.
