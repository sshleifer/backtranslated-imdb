Very good adaptation of the novel Amrita though. Urmila and Manoj Bazhpay gave their best. <br /> <br /> there is a natural talent in film, and I felt it through. It looks like Bollywood, finally gave its charm and had some quality artists performing on the screen. <br /> <br /> Content wise, the film is drawn a lot of what happened during the separation, showing the suffering of a particular family, and also shows that confidence in the life beyond the scope of religion. <br /> <br /> The best part was, they do not do a drama with a lot of tears shed and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just loved it.
