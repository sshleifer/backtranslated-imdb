Look, this is quite possibly one of the best movies, America has to offer the rest of the world. Hate hate this movie FREEDOM themselves. I remember that in the early '80s were a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak, Communism threatens us all, and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. With this confusion came the hero, STROKER Ace. Ned Beatty's performance in the film showed that he was never again to be type cast as a one-dimensional sacrifice in the wilderness. His triumph is a source of inspiration for all. Chemistry on screen between Burt and Loni draws obvious comparisons to Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors poet. Go this film tonight!
