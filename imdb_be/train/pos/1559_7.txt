This particular episode of Smallville, is probably the best episode in the air, since the reunion. This is for many reasons. For example, it takes back some number of its roots. It welcomes the return of Lionel with alleged long absence, the Plaza LuthorCorp office in Metropolis. This room was not in Smallville for a very long time, and seeing him again brings a lot of memories from the past Smallville. Not to mention, Lionels conversation with Lex's always great. <br /> <br /> Another nice return, and UV guessed, is Bart Allen (aka Impulse), AC (aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone (aka Cyborg), Not only is Stephen Deknight unite former justice league, he mixes them with the formula Smallville such a unique way that it almost feels like a feature-length film. <br /> <br /> From there, you'll get the basic story, Green Arrow forms a league, trying to undermine 33.1, Bart gets rave, Clark saves him, and the object is blown to kingdom com. All this is well and gracefully, with a good mix of stealth, action, pace and suspense. Oh, and Cyborg are some exciting new updates to this character justice league :). <br /> <br /> Music is probably what makes this episode so well. If you remember correctly, the first episode was directed by Stephen Deknight Agless from season 4. It was a mediocre episode, but something felt out of place. maybe it was the music, or action, or the fact Clark Sais in the end "we have not found, you found us", like did people lose faith in the claims. But luckily Steve Deknight redeemed himself in this episode of Justice. <br /> <br /> I had a few quivvles of justice that made him reach the full 10. First of all, too cheesy Justice League exit with the object expolsion Ridge. I mean it would be soo much cooler if we say, Green Arrow and Cyborg took off on the bike Oliver (rememeber the arrow of the episode). Clark and Impulse must obviously ran, Aquaman has to swim through a different route. But it was incredibly cheesy Su, he put on the 2 points of the total 10. <br /> <br /> Secondly, another cheesy moment, not as bad as the first, but if the green arrow Sais "Let's save the world" it made me shudder. In general, according to the values ​​of the existing performances, music, direction and production, the pros do outweigh the cons, and it is still one of the best episodes in Smallville history, and perhaps the second best episode of the season 6. <br /> <br /> 7 with 10 ...
