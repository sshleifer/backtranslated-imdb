Original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I was interested to see how the sequel will work given that they did not use any of the original characters. I was very surprised how it played out. As a rule, sequels never as good as the original, with a few exceptions. Although it was not a great movie, the writer did well under the main theme & vampire lore from the first stroke. Jon Bon Jovi was initially flaw, but it turned out to be a halfway decent Slayer. I doubt that anyone can exceed the performance of James Woods in the first, though ... if you do not bring in Buffy! <br /> <br /> In general, it's been an hour and I would watch it again. <, Br /> <br /> I was left with two questions, though ... what happened with Jack Blood and how Derek Bliss came to be a killer? I think we just have to leave the show.
