Lots and lots of information to digest, and if you've seen Zizek, you know, his pace. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you have not seen most of the films, or at least some other films by the same filmmakers show in the Dock, you'll be somewhat blurred. <br /> <br /> And the list of the film for a long time. Director includes Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and conversation (Coppola) <br /> <br /> There are some movies Segway, like Star wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but I suspect that this device. To be sure, Zizka never boring, but if you do not buy (or if you remember) psycho analyst, you will be annoyed no end. <br /> <br /> But you must not be like setting, clips, the way the movie interspersed with these clips, Zizek points never boring.
