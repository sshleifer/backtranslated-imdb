As a former 2 time champion of Okinawan karate, I love movies about sacrifice for the sport. But this film is about so much more. This film is so good and so deep. I recently suffered from a very serious injury and largely sorely lacking passion. Almost all clear to me. And that silly little movie touched me so deeply that, as of stupor I was reminded of what life should be about. This is a film about life. Life your life for yourself and towards others. Empowerment. God Bless "Bend It Like Beckham" I think this is a real jewel.
