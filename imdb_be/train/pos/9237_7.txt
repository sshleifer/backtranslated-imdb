This film is very good. Six months ago, I bought it on DVD. But at first I thought it was the original film. I have seen the series, and it's a good movie, but here they put Â«The Living Legend, Part 1 and 2", and "Fire in Space" together. Just as they did with the first film, but also with other episodes. But still, this is a very good movie. Only weird ending (you do not see what is happening with Pegasus). But I still think that it is very good. Actors and special effects were good. If you have not seen it, go see it. Starring: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Schwartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
