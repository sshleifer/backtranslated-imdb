I do not think anyone but Terrence Malick and possibly Tran Anh Hung makes a movie on a pure level than Claire Denis. However, I do not like this, her latest film, exactly the same as its 2001 masterpiece «Trouble Every Day» (although it is very close), which itself is one of my favorite movies. He's only because the narrative is perhaps a little too elliptical for its own good. Do not get me wrong, the fact that the film barely has a story on the whole is truly one of the best things about it, but I think that Denis took about one degree more than you need to go, and thus, the film did not flirt with obscurity and a few key points of the plot have been clarified in some way (for example, that the main character goes to South Korea, to get his heart transplant, rather than just to show him there suddenly without any explanation as to where he is and why it's there). In addition, some of the other characters seem unnecessary and, as if they were the only bases for Denis to use the actor, she is just like (the character Beatrice Dali in particular, it's a little distracting, because you keep expecting her It will have some value). Nevertheless, the film is an incredibly absorbing and cinematography goes strange. This is definitely a very masterpiece in its own way. At least as good as Denis more well known, "the Beau flour", if not better. Claire Denis has to be my favorite French director at that time, even better than Leos Carax. In addition, I have to admit that the South Korean sequence whether "Lost in Translation" is better than the film itself (and I, unlike some, I'm a big fan of this film as well).
