I used this film in a class of religion, I taught. Goldfish swim happily in his bowl on the top floor of the apartment. Young boy and his mother away from home. The boy gave the money to buy milk. On the way home, he stopped at the carnival to play the game. Next to him stands a man in a black suit, looking a little scary. Boy drops a bottle of milk. It breaks. A man in a black suit gives him money to replace milk. This scene alternates with what is happening at home. Black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment. He (?) Detects fish bowl and looks it. Fish swims vigorously and flips out of the bowl. By now, a lot of teens in my class, and I fell in love with the fish. Cat takes the fish in the mouth and we all hold our breath. Cat falls fish in a bowl. Dual storyline involves a suspicious man in a black and suspicious black cat. And the cause of superstition. Both are not to blame. It was a great discussion starter in my class.
