Elephant Walk (1954) Starring Peter Finch early as the landlord in some God-forsaken plantation, where there is always the danger of mad elephants, or the English, remained in the midday sun, and Warriors. Well, in the end, they do, after typhoid or cholera outbreaks, of course, and much mayhem ensues. Taylor replaced the ailing Vivien Leigh in the pot boiler / adventure film. If the elephants storm the house and Liz trap on the front stairs, I still have goose bumps. Thank God, Dana Andrews around to save the day. One of my favorite guilty pleasures. In color too!
