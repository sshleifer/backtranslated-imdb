I think that this film brilliant.there many reasons, but here are some of them 1) good actor Tom and Tyler 2) shiny machine gun scene, which was part of the light 3) I thought that the end was a nice twist because I never expected that, in the end, it's good all the credit Sam Mendes.as and these 3 points in the form of film of the film as well. I am a student film in college, and we studied this film in detail, and it was one of the best films I've seen for years. I would just like to say a big thank you to all the people who are involved in making this film. Finally, I would like to say, the best scene in the film machine gun scene where John Rooney gets to kill him just pure brilliance in photography scene in silence while John Rooney said: "I'm glad it was you," it is much better so I think, because the viewer to create there own sound, and the sound is completely different for each viewer simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading this commentary written by Ross Kirk at the age of 16
