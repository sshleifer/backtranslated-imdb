I found this movie hilarious. The parodies of other popular movies of the time were one of the funniest I've seen in this kind of cinema. Give it a try. If you've seen the movies that this film is a substitute and you get a sense of humor, you have to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> I (and others who watched the movie with me) felt a funny role in the film (this is not a spoiler, because I did not tell you what really going on) was the scene of the "screaming" from gizmo MIB. When they first detect the device and do not know what it does ... and then again at the end of the movie ... you'll understand when you get there. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film is that I have never been able to find it in the DVD, so that I could buy a copy.
