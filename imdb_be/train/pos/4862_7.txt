This musical is clearly ambiguous, and none of the elements do not fit together, but it somehow manages to be mostly pleasant. The plot contains some elements Wodehouse novel, but not one of his virtues, though he co-wrote the screenplay. The songs, though charming, do not have anything to do with this particular film, and unusually rough squeezed into the story, even by the standards to Oklahoma. Burns and Allen are doing their usual chip quite competently, but did not get in the tone of the rest of the film about forty IQ points. <br /> <br /> There are a few highlights. Reginald Gardiner does a good job when he says that this radio station, and stops the robbery as a silent actor. And there are a few bits of writing that could only be written Wodehouse, although much of the film feels like a production of one of the meetings he later parodied Hollywood.
