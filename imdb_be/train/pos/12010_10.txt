. Warning: mild spoilers <br /> <br /> The history of Joseph Smith stands out as amazing - even move - episode in American history and the history of world religions. This film reflects the events in the life of Joseph Smith, whom Mormons revere as a prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on earth. I still saw the movie twice in the first month public display. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith shows first the youngest of the trio of brothers (Alvin, Hira and Joseph), who, in a very young age, need surgery. This operation is done without our modern conveniences, it was bloody and difficult. The scene has helped to show coherence Smith family and the relationship between brothers and between Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> Joseph and the subsequent religious confusion praying that lead to what Mormons call the First Vision, it was interesting drawing, Face of Jesus never stated, but you see the unmistakable marks of the nails in His hands. Abandonment of religious leaders and many in his small New York community sweetened with at least a bit of the marriage of Joseph to Emma. <br /> <br /> This film is not clearly outline the events in the history of the Mormon Church, but simply jumping from scene to scene. This is not a criticism - just. Note the style <br /> <br /> Practice and tail condensation is shown and it is particularly dramatic and moving, when Joseph preaches about the love of the Savior with a scar on the face, was attacked recently. <br /> <br /> film skillfully depicts both the joy and the growth of Mormonism as a children's church, at the same time constantly deepening opposition that has spread to the height of the local authorities, as well. <, Br /> <br /> film shows a lot of scenes from the life of Joseph, including some fine moments that show his attitude towards Emma. An attempt was made to show the depth and complexity of the life of Joseph, including his fierce love for his wife, infinite love for children, his mind, his courage in the face of a dirty and dangerous opposition, his religious feelings, and his sympathy. <br /> <br /> As Joseph and Hyrum trip to Carthage, never to return home alive, most of the characters from the film, whose lives have been touched by Joseph shown a way to help reinforce what has already been seen, but the creation of the final the scene to be more powerful. <br /> <br /> In the end, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum drawn, and viewers were left to ponder the events they had just witnessed. <br /> <br /> When I first watched the movie, I assumed that this was done in the church to enter Joseph Smith, who are not members. I no longer think that this is so, although I hope that the film can do just that. As an insider, I believe that the film is a celebration of Joseph and well strengthens the good things that we already know about it. I'm curious to see how outsiders will watch the movie -. Will they just see it as propagandic, the epic story of American religious person, or something else <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully shot, family, moving, and hopefully something good for everyone. The fact that the events depicted actually happened in these United States is interesting to consider in light of the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religion and respect (as a whole) to the law - we moderns take for granted.
