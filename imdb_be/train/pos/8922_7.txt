The only notable thing about this film is that it was the first big starring Steve McQueen. <br /> <br /> McQueen undeveloped talent and raw, but is refreshingly honest in this small mannerisms of the sci-fi horror. Steve reveals himself as an anti-establishment, a hot rod car loves an actor who would become an icon of the polished film industry just five years later. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen would say he hated this film, and that "he was a blob." But everyone has to start somewhere and drop cute, fresh and innocent. B that we stayed that way. < br /> <br /> The plot is fast paced and, although predictable, still entertaining hour or so. and it's really interesting to see Steve McQueen before he became king Kool (and Anita Corsaut, before she became a friend of Andy Taylor). Middle a friend sent me a DVD some time ago, and it is a treasured addition to my collection of Steve McQueen movie.
