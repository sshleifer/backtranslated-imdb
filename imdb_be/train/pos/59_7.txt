While I was a video store, I was browsing through a dollar rental and came across this little gem. I do not know what it was about, but I just gut instic about it and wow was I ever right. <br /> <br /> The story centers around two girls who have just gone through the school shooting. One of the girls Alicia reble teenager who is the only witness to the full attack, while the second is Diana another survivor, who survived a bullet in the head by some miracle. Thrown together fate, they begin to slow and painful healing beautiful display and move on. <br /> <br /> I just hate it when a strange films fall through the cracks. Because wow, that speech Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen, not to mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD has been sorely lacking special functions. Oh, and some jump cuts in the film was a kind of dissonance. But all in all a great movie.
