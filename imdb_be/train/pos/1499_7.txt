For fans of horror films such as 1970's Hammer, the film should be a treat. The only thing I do not like in the film was the fact that Cushing was spent on the worst episode. In general, however, it is a solid, spooky little movie. If this is not the best film of Amicus', this is definitely one of them. The best episode on the right is saved for last, is the one with John Pertwee as the horror film actor - it's really cool. As well as Pertwee was in this role, it is difficult to believe that he did not do more of these types of movies. In general, it is an entertaining film that scared the heck out of me as a child, and that still gives me chills to this day.
