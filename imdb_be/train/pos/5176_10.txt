A must see movie for anyone who ever went to a camp or wanted. This film reflects the absolute essence of summer camp is all about. It's funny, it's compassionate it makes you want to see more about the characters as soon as loans are starting role. If you have not seen this movie..what are you doing? receive your butt and start the video store. Have a great summer :)
