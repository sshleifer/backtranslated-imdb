It is so to say the continuation of the animated Batman, and it's pretty much as good as it is, to and for the same reasons, there is a lot of action in it subject to his good voice-over actors are very good, such as Kevin Conroy as batman, Mark Hamill as the Joker, etc. really good villains such as the Joker, Two-Face, Catwoman, Clayface, etc. so I'm sure that you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of Batman, because it is very good. So make sure that you are watching on TV or rent or buy a collectors edition, because it is really good <br /> <br /> Overall rating :. ********* with ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** to *****
