First of all, do not go in expecting another Revolver vagina, or the blocking of the stem, it is a different kind of gangster film. <br /> <br /> I saw Halle in the night, and this film is definitely divided audience. This is the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking that it was? It was awful, and the other half will go to think, what was it? That was cool. Personally, I love movies, I do not understand, i.e.Mullholland Drive and suspect, so I enjoyed the Revolver. <br /> <br /> It certainly was not perfect, though. I saw a big turnaround from a mile away, at least part of it, and although sometimes some loose ends remained unexplained well, Revolver leaves many questions seemed inexplicable without cause. In addition, some of the scenes, as well as animation and the scene where the sorter is murder spree (in fact, one of my favorites), although, strange scenes look seemed to just be there, because they were strange to see not because they fit with the movie. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it was a lot of good things too. I thought the acting was excellent from all the main actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore, and even Andre Benjamin (which was a nice surprise). This film definitely kept my interest, with one big, anxious, action, scene after another. If Ray Liotta was kept under the table wow .... well, you should see it. The script was very well done and the soundtrack, as well as most of the films of Guy Ritchie, was great. <br /> <br /> Although the step below films such as Fight Club, Mulholland Drive and The Usual Suspects, it was still strange fast-paced, psychological thriller, with lots of twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the film ended.
