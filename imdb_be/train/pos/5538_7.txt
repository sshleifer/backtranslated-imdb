Couple (Janet and Richard) go hiking in the woods near a giant swamp. After camping and outdoor recreation, the couple takes refuge in what they think is an abandoned farm house. Soon, a couple of escaped convicts show and, after long delaying the inevitable, they continue to rape Janet and Richard's castle in the bird cage. <br /> <br /> This is the last house on the left, as the film has to be one of the most underrated horror movies ever made. This is one of the most sick and twisted in the early 70s Shockers. In addition, I found that it is quite charming and beautiful in its perverted tons. I love CAGED terror. Music definitely helps lend a sense of identity for the film, as well as a lot of beauty. I found that the film is quite terrible. <br /> <br /> The disadvantages mainly deals with the stimulation of the film, which is to say that the film is a bit slow and tortuous. Although I do not mind walking around because of the beauty and suspense of the film in question, I think it will be like most people. Act is not too good, and it is not a dialogue, at least at the beginning of the scene. This film takes a bit more patience than usual, and it's really not for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a good movie. Not the biggest horror film I've ever seen, but it's certainly a lot of fun. It's not exactly an easy movie to find. You can find it in the used section of many stores, if you look hard enough. It is not for everyone, but if you're a fan of weed movie, then this is definitely worth checking out.
