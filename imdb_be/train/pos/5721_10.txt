I'm not sure I understand where all these enthusiastic anti-Grudge people say here, maybe it's just that some people like to talk about things. <br /> <br /> The film is, of course, imperfect (unequal actions, some may have difficulty with the time change, the actors too are ready to go, I'd really rather not go, and so on), but IMHO there are some things that are more than compensated for the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> First of all, I loved the "violation of the rules" a little bit. Normally, when you leave the house with ghosts villains leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, get one and find the mysterious paranormal token type. NORMAL (half a spoiler announcement) if you are hiding under the covers, they can only get you through this small hole you PEEK later. NORMALLY at the end of the ghosts, they became less terrible, because you know that they just do not realize they have been released, or whatever. <br /> <br /> Secondly, production was exceptional. Despite the fact that the film was loaded with special effects, or supernatural bits while short was very well done. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie variety for those who think that Freddy and Jason is the ultimate horror come (nothing against them, they have their place), but great for those who are already I began to adopt conventions for granted, and do not have problems with the TBC.
