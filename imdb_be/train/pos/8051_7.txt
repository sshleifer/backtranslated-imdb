"One of the earlier efforts Hung. Humor by the way in terms of how Hung Lee tries to mimic movements and facial expressions, as well as in a bit where ridicules Hung Jackie Chan Drunken Master. Action is also quite good, especially when .. Hung takes the trio of martial arts experts in the end it is not the greatest film, but very good for "70 Kung Fu, especially if you're a fan of Hung and / or or Be careful, though : most of the video version of the film has a rather poor quality. There is also a sign in black, which some people may find offensive. <br /> <br /> Sammo Hung is a rural pig herder who moved to Hong Kong to deal with some bad guys. Summit turned on his dead-on Bruce Lee's reincarnation when fighting! <br /> <br /> This film is often billed as a parody of Bruce Lee «Enter The Dragon», but this is not true ... the summit is a rural shepherd pigs - will have Bruce Lee -., who moved to Hong Kong, to help his family run a small open-air restaurant is located in t When a new job, he was forced to defend the diner from the local gangsters looking for protection money. If the summit goes into battle mode, it goes to his Bruce Lee's transformation, which must be seen to be believed! This film is quite sloppy in many of the fight scenes summit battles against people who, obviously, actors, rather than martial arts, and there is one character that should be black, who plays an Asian man in the heavy (and absurd) makeup. But the fact that this film is not enough in the budget and accuracy, it more than makes up in the atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for a good mood. "
