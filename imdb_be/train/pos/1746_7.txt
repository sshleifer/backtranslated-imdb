White Lugosi gets to play one of his rare good roles Man in the series, based on a long hit radio (which was also the source of the film, where Lugosi played the villain.) Lugosi cuts a fine admirable figure and its sad that he did not get more roles where he could be the guy on the team, in a good way. Here Chandu returned from the East to help the princess Naji, who hunts Ubasti leaders of the cult, who need it to return from the dead, high priestess of the cult. This is a beautiful globe trot serial number, which is great fun. To be sure, Shagan little slack, more like one of the leaders (producing studio) feature, the rip roaring adventure, but it's still nice. It plays better than two feature films that have been cut out of it, because it allows things to happen at their own pace, and not feeling rushed or feeling that, "Hey, I missed something." One of the trilogy three good series Lugosi did the rest SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
