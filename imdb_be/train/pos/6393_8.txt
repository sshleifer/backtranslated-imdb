It must be seen independent movie fan, but it also holds up well against the mainstream movies. I think we have the makings of the next Woody Allen or <br /> <br /> Trentin Tarrentino here. <br /> <br /> hurt low budget. No special effects whatsoever, and they seemed to be used by the surrounding lighting (shot in digital video.) And yet this film is not enough for you, and do not let go. The script was a bit strange, but the actors and director to drag him with complete realism. It has humor, it has intrigue, and it has pathos, and it all works together. <br /> <br /> There is no need to describe the details. If you want to see an independent <br /> <br /> masterpiece, a virtual lesson in how to make a low budget flick that really works, see this. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, it is also interesting. <br /> <br />
