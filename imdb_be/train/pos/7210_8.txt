New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) 46-year-old and the rapid decay; as the film opens, the last game Mr. Cain flops on Broadway. TV reviewers scoff at Kane and he gets drunk. Turning on the Long Island Railroad Kane lands in Montauk stead residence in East Hampton. Finally coming home, Caine comforted tightly dressed wife Dyan Cannon (as Myra), unfortunately, the excitability of heart disease. There, Caine and Mrs. Cannon discussing a new play called "Deathtrap", written by hunky young Christopher Reeve (as Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), a former student of Kane. The couple believe Mr. Reeve «Deathtrap» is a hit it is necessary to revive his career. <br /> <br /> Cain "Trap Set ?? For angrily Funny Who'll-Do-It ». <br /> <br /> Directed by Sidney Lumet, drawn-Broadway hit Ira Levin Sun deviate too far from the stage of origin. Throw pleasant and plot twists are still exciting. One thing that does not work (for me) was the end of the curtain; Of course, he played better on stage. «Deathtrap» is an interesting movie to watch again; performances dead on - but, in hindsight, Reeve hello gives Caine at the railway station, East Hampton was simplified to a smiling "Hello." Location is very East Hampton, but the mill pond and look the same. And much hype love scene surprisingly cool. However, the game was so good, "even a talented director can not destroy it." And Mr. Lumet did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
