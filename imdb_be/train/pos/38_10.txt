One of the best Three Stooges shorts ever. Spooky house full of evil men and «Goon» call to the best people in the detective agency alert. Shemp is in great shape, in the famous scene in the dark. Emil Sitko provides excellent support, in its role Mr. Goodrich, as a target area in killing. Before this is over, "experience a little shovel» Shemp in use to great effect. This 16-minute gem is moving as fast as any Stooge short and packs a double wallop. Highly recommended.
