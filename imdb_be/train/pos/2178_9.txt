With plenty of sunlight shone light and shade filtering through the i window in the room, tracking shots that go through the crowd with a hand-held camera, fast paced editing and extreme close-ups here and there photos there is a thing in this exciting, artistically made the film. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film begins as a bit of fluff on a beauty contest. The film begins in a warm Sunday in the local pool, where we meet a great Lucienne aki Lula (played by Louise Brooks) - a little boast in front of the staring men in the pool, she soon decides to enter a represent France at the beauty of the Miss Europe contest, unfortunately it is very jealous, tap the groom (quite annoying guy, actually). Strutting down the runway ten contestants to express themselves in bathing suits, while the winner was chosen as a participant who gets the longest applause (I was wondering, could not the girls just walk slowly, to prolong their time - and thus , the applause - on the podium)?!. Lulu quickly chased Prince and the Maharaja, but her irascible dandy does not like courtship paid to it by other people or her adoring public, on the subject (I guess he just wants to be in my house, cooking his food food, and staying on -this field of vision, as well?). <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks beautiful and charming, its presence helps to improve the film, but it's actually the way it is photographed, that held his interest the most, a little distracting is an odd duplicated sound that is bit off. Print this version looks very clear and complete a nice contrast, though. Watching this, I was just trying not to notice problems with the sound and watch the movie visually, and I found that the film is excellent, well worth a look.
