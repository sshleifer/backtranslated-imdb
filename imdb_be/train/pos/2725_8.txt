«In Cold Blood», adapted by director Richard Brooks from the famous novel by Truman Capote, is dealing with the hard and senseless murder of a family of four people on a pair of hapless criminals. The film stands out as a character study of murderers in particular trigger man Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> In roles include several well-known names, but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson is perfectly together two criminals with disparate parties. They play off each other effortlessly and Blake also gets a lot of opportunities to learn the idiosyncrasies of his character. The rest of the cast is only an average and not worth the comments below. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks won an Oscar for his script and direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, though the script does miscalculate with some heady stories in the later stages. Oscar-nominated cinematography Conrad Hall as first-class as editing. Also worth noting is the Jazz by Quincy Jones, who provided the last of the four Oscar nominations for the film. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other crime films, this one is not to praise violence. Brooks turns killers Into helpless characters, rather than the flat of their conviction. Do you agree or disagree with this statement the film really is an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend this movie for that reason, as well as the expertise with which technical aspects are handled.
