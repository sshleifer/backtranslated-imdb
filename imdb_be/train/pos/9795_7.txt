I have always said that the cartoon Batman were much better than live-action films. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the animated films, but of the bunch, it is the poorest, and it's pretty disappointing. <br /> <br /> «Mask of Phantasm" will rank as the best, and then "Finest in the world", and then "the Zero Sub" and then "Return of the Joker", and finally, it is the last. <, Br /> <br /> This latest animated film, there is a mysterious new Batgirl in Batman Goth and intends to identify whether it is a friend or foe, she goes on a quest for revenge. <br /> <br /> But, as Bruce is linked to the three young women, he begins to investigate and finds out who is the new Batgirl. <br /> <br /> tons this film is unusually light, considering most of the films dark and moody, which was quite disappointing. Bruce behaves strangely out of character most of the time, the villains reused from the latest movies, and while the action scenes are spectacular, they are really nothing new. He also has a dramatic impact on other films, especially with the «Sub-Zero», which was heavy drama and character development. <br /> <br /> All in the film feels quite reworked and secondary characters are charming, but no one is really sick. <br /> <br /> All this time, I really enjoyed it, I had a blast, and the identity of the new Batgirl is awesome, but it was not as exciting as I d hoped. <br /> <br /> (** half of ****)
