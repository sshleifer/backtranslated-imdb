TÃ©a Leoni playing Nora Wilde, a serious photographer who is going through a bad divorce. She wants her freedom, but she comes in the room. She wants to legitimate the photos, but is hired to work for the tabloids like the paparazzi. Her boss played a strange and charming Holland Taylor. The show was well-written, most of the time. Nora tea begins to develop in a very memorable character, but the network does not support just a comedy, and they are still there. Even if they had brought in George Wendt from Ur, they made unnecessary changes in the cast and characters. The show was good in the beginning, and the audience get used to it, but if the network fails it as bad plastic surgery.
