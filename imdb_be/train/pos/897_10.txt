What can I say, I grew up watching us do part, Hum Hain Aapke Koun and I have loved. Soraj always been different. Movies are a part of our life in the evolutionary time Soraj creates something that's hard to find. Love and joint family, loving and great. Vivah is a journey for the couple, who get to arrange a marriage, which includes organized and love marriage. Shahid has done an excellent job. Anupamji as always excellent. Amrita Rao quit different, although I felt like something else to me, she do not like this role. We have seen it in Ica Vishk and Ab ki Baras and Main x to Na. So throw another role, that it is not and. She was beautiful in the main heh ~ d on Na and Ica Vishk, but maybe she could have put a little more in this role. In any case, a great time to work on Barjatya. This film rejuvenates the values ​​that we have forgotten. Sweet Movie year. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure if it is a remake, but in any case, a brilliant story that is original. Soraj films were brilliant all the way, so we always expect something different from him. Great job to all the cast and crew all. Great family film to enjoy with their parents, brothers and sisters, friends and love ones. I give it 10 out of 10.
