A great film that shows the miserable life of two old walnut. They could not live together or separately. Gulya constantly, sometimes at the same time, they are hashed and re-hashed the past; It is happening and what would happen Coulda Shoulda. I found myself laughing sometimes, but mostly I was taken with how completely bored and left the two women. Watch this.
