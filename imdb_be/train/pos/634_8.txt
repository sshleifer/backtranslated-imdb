I was one of about 200 people who have been lucky enough to see an early sneak preview of the film. <br /> <br /> Stardust worth Tristan young man on a quest to find the fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves, to prove his love for her. The only catch is that it fell on the other side of the wall, the doorway between England and the Magic Kingdom, known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This movie was just a joy to watch, it has something in it for everyone, all the scenes played out beautifully and the comedy is spread through the film, which makes it funny without being corny. If I had to compare loves another film, he should probably be princess bride classic. <br /> <br /> All outstanding performances, beautiful Claire Danes do you like it in the picture Yvaine principal star and naive at rated Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a stellar performance as the maximum over Larnia ... but the performance to talk about Robert De Niro ... in every scene that he's in his hands down, he steals the show ... <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for jokes fantasy love this movie. Guys do not start from the description there is enough action comedy, and not to mention a lot of eye candy with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer, to keep you entertained throughout. The cinema is dead, and continues with the feeling of the film ... nothing about the film does not seem forced.
