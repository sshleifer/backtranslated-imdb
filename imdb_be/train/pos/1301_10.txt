I loved all the work Cream, even is such a small and valuable catalog of master. Even if they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of his songs (Spoons and frog off the Fire Wheel is a prime example) are still rock the socks more than half of any given mining act today. This strength of the gel on the stage is given one of the most ahead of the rock group holidays when one of them shows the Royal Albert Hall last year. They may have become older, and their fans, but the energy is still there, with great offerings of classic blues songs, as well as their own. To issue a White Room, Sign, Politics, Beds, shine your love, not one as skip a beat. Clapton's solos have a degree, that sometimes it does not, when on stage with his solo. Ginger Baker, said enough. Jack Bruce is strong enough, with his vocals since some power that Clapton never could get on their own. As a result, if you want to see what shows were better wish you saw last year (well, some may have seen them), it's all on this DVD, with cool features.
