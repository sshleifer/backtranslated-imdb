In my humble opinion, this film has not received the recognition it deserves. Robert Redford lives next to me here in the wires, Utah, at Sundance. Like much of his work, and it was my favorite. I wish that more people do not appreciate it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before he came to the big screen. She gave me to read, after we saw a movie together. The film and the book got emotional place in my heart, and I was sentimental for a few days after watching the film. Sometimes love is not enough to keep your loved ones from harming themselves. We see it in our family relationships, but our love and our families and their history to endure for generations of time. Cinema was a perfect and exciting - I was in awe of her beauty and how well it is brought to life by the words of the author, Norman MacLean, "But when I'm alone in the darkness of the canyon, all existence seems to fade substantially with my soul and memories. and the sound of Big Black River Foot, and four counts rhythm, and in the hope that a fish will rise. in the end, all merged into one and a river runs through it. the river was cut into large flood the world and runs over rocks from the basement of time. on some of the stones timeless raindrops. Under a rock the words, and some of their words. I suffer from water. " These words, taken from the book, and said at the end of the film (Robert Redford, who tells how Norman Maclean), mostly writing, in my opinion. Any possible shortcomings of the film can be marred by the beauty and elegance of history and cinematography. It was beautiful!
