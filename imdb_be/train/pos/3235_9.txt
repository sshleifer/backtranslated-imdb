Great movie, a realistic picture of modern Finland, touching and profound. One of the best Finnish films ever made. It captures surprisingly everyday life in Central Finland, a small town, passions and weaknesses, joys and woes. Bright start autumn sun creates a cool atmosphere that informed the study of people in the society welfare. Lampela is indeed one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. It shows that you can make an exciting movie without guns and bloodshed. His next film Eila also worth a look, although the history of women's treatment, who are fighting for their jobs are not as universally appealing as a destiny in Yawkey.
