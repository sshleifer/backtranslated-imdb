We have seen this in my classroom female health problems, to point out how women are treated worse men in many countries, and I absolutely loved this film. I plan on trying to get a copy of the watch itself. The story is very touching, and I would recommend it to anyone. I am a supporter of different cultures and this film was just what I needed. This is a film for the whole family, in spite of its rating. This is a film that I will show to your children. Professor of our class, designed for the film to primarily be too educate women, but this film was more than that. This is one of those movies that stick in my mind forever, and will be the favorite.
