I offered to rent this film to his friend, and he must, as he had already seen the film, and he said that it was good. I thought the name was a little mannerisms, as version of this product was named "Fear: Halloween NightÂ». I expected this film to be a little Halloween rip off with murderous wooden guy. But he was discovered with a good scene and a murderer immediately scored two victims and flashed forward twenty years later, when his son, who was a witness to his score two people (including his mother), and he even witnessed his father's suicide occurs in isolated cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend, where he tries to face with their fears while wooden statue comes to life with the spirit of his fathers. Very good to continue, and I've never seen the first one.
