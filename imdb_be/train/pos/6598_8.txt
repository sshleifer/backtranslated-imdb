I saw this film when I was traveling in Brazil. I found it hard to really understand the Brazilian culture and society, because it has so many regional and class differences. In order to see this film in SÃ£o Paulo, was itself a revelation. This shows that something in the daily lives of many Brazilians. On the other hand, sometimes it's a little over-dramatized. And this is the only negative comment I have on this film. It is sometimes too much, too much sex, too much killing and too much cynicism for one movie. The director can shoot some things are a little more subtle, it would have made the movie more effective. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I liked the movie, and as the story unravels itself. The characters are complex, and are very similar to real people. Not very American actors and actresses with a lot of makeup, but the people who might be ugly and beautiful at the same time. This makes the film a realistic, even if the story is not so convincing.
