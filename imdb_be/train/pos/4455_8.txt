Although I liked on the city better I liked it. I am a novice when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I've heard of them, I've never seen anything with them in it until recently. The first one I saw singing in the rain, that made me a fan of Gene. I think it's better too. But I thought that this movie was good, and all the movies there are some parts that are better than others, but in my book it's an amazing movie, and I love it. Frank and Jean make a good team. I still have to see them together in Take me to the Ballgame. But I stick to my guns bushel to say that I really enjoyed it, and I love it!
