This is a great movie for all generations X'ers. That another world is America in 1972 compared with our psychotic 21st century. You can get an idea of ​​what passed one thousand nine hundred seventy-two America was like watching the movie. I found that the clothing and style of the car was returned to me pleasant memories of a much better country than we have now. Just think ... if there were only 4 or 5 television stations to choose from. There was no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, avian flu, Freeway General snipers, etc., etc. The Vietnam War was a little bit more. There will still be 7 years before, Star Wars comes out. The personal computer and the internet will still be 29 years old. <br /> <br /> If this film first came out producers had to sell the movie itself more than any other film company did not want to. Thus began a tour of small Protestant churches across the country, which are shown on a film projector (Those were the days before VCRs, of course). The pastor of the church, which would would be interested in displaying a thief in the night of his congregation to receive a copy of the film. He then created the evening to show him in a church meeting or dining area. Community members are invited to "non-conservation" of friends and family, and it will be the social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you can get past the limited production values ​​of the film, and just look at him nostalgic value, then I think you will enjoy the movie more. Of course, I am speaking as XER generation. <br /> <br /> If I had a time machine, I would go back in 1972, and say goodbye to the cesspool of the 21st century we have now.
