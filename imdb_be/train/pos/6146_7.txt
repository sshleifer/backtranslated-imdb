Maybe Disney in hopes another Mary Poppins, but that's another story, and while Angela beautiful it was quite a different performer great Julie Andrews. Having said that, perfectly cast Lansbury and provides a magical view. There is something magical point about her character and she gets excellent support David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can carry a tune, but he certainly is not much chop as a singer. It does not matter, he was such a talented actor, you do not notice. There are some great cameos from very different time favorite stars, like Roddy McDowel, which gives a winning performance and loved Tessie OShea, which does very little, but it's nice to see the old gal again. It is also nice to see Jaffe and English king Bruce Forsyth television in small roles. The account has a few great songs especially the salty sea, and age does not believe. A large number of portabella road stretched to the limit, but it has a lot of theatricality. The effects look a bit clich√© now, but the scene with the German invaders were attacked by a wild army in the film is quite convincing. Children are not as annoying as other films, but one does struggle to understand that the youngest boy said. I loved the marching song of the army home. The militia was very important for the UK, and it's warm tribute. Animation is lovely, much better than Pixar's, which I find grotesque. Warm happy film and his surprise, it did not do on stage.
