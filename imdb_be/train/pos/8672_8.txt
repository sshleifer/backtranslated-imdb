last PPV WWE was a hit with the fans, but for one reason only in 2006, a ladder match, which was only determined to Paul London and Brian Kendrick vs. William Regal and Dave Taylor. But with the recent PPV buckwheat being split in December, the WWE knew what he had to do something to the fans again said it was useful when he presented MNM and The Hardy Boyz to confusion and announced that the match would be a ladder match. <br /> <br /> match was tough and one of the best ladder match I've ever seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a mess. Johnny Nitro did not even check their partner, they just kept on like nothing had happened, and Taylor and Regal did not do anything during the match, except for the affected people, with several staircases arrows. In the end, London and Kendrick retained the name. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere on the show Kane defeated MVP in a decent Inferno match when he put a silly costume MVP on fire. Chris Benoit beaten Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the WWE Cruiserweight Title in a solid effort. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a mess, King Booker, together with Finley to take on John Cena and Batista. The action was bad, and neither cared who Baptiste chose for his partner <br /> <br /> In general, the results: .. Kane defeated MVP in a match inferno <br /> <br /> Paul London and Brian Kendrick retained WWE Tag team titles against The Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Rega match stairs. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to retain the United States title in a decent match. <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to keep the Cruiserweight Championship. <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman beat The Miz in a terrible match. <br /> <br /> undertaker defeated Mr. Kennedy in the last match away. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista defeated King Booker and Finlay in the bottomless match <br /> <br /> Overall -.
