«Moonstruck» is a love story. There is not a novel, there are at least three, but they all relate to the same family. Loretti family. Loretta (Cher) is going to marry Johnny Cammareri (Aiello). She does not like it, but it is sweet and nice person. When he goes to visit his dying mother in Italy Loretta meets Ronnie's brother Johnny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny had not spoken to each other for five years, and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course, they immediately fall for each other. <br /> <br /> As the story and history of the love of parents and uncles and aunts Loretti develop something that you just have to see for yourself. Everyone has seen it is a delight to watch, with Cher as a bright star in the middle of everything. She won and really deserves the Oscar this year. Cage is pretty good, and Goofy, as well, and Olympia Dukakis, as a mother Loretti and Vincent Gardenia as her father awful. This film is funny, charming and, therefore, very pleasant.
