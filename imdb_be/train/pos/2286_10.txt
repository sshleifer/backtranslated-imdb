The people who made this film skilfully done great service to the new, which stands as perhaps the best game works centering on the human sense of guilt and responsibility of man ever published. Nolte takes the role of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., and makes it his own, staying true to the image of man Vonnegut, who lost everything (k) for love. <br /> <br /> There is no shortage in this fine adaptation.
