OK, this film starts as a cheesy Lifetime movie and not recover until almost good through cinema. The script full "cheese" and "down" and the plaster is not very well focused for the most part. In the first half of the film a little girl grated on my nerves. I do not think that this is one of her best acting work. The only reason why I bought this movie because it was on sale and was Ellen Burstyn in it. She is beautiful, but this is not one of her best acting performances. The story is based on real events, and this helps the film. In fact, I do not even like the movie in the first and got disgusted when I saw the footage of the balloon trip, I mean..let it will get where it is suppose to go out and do it! But all is forgiven by the time it reaches its destination and the story comes to an end. If this does not bring a tear to the eye, nothing will! It's cheesy and predictable, but also makes you feel good about the world again.
