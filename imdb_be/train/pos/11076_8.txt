I'll start with the fact that it is unfairly be prepared just about everybody! The fact that this is not what anyone expected, especially from Guy Ritchie. The fact that everyone was waiting for was the Cockney geezers and good liners "do I, as DAGs?Â» And so on, but it's much more mature than his previous works. I agree that it is confusing, but the facts are there for us, we just have to see them and listen harder, this film requires all your attention! Look past the cool and brilliant look of the film, try to listen to the dialogue, not to admire the performances and I think we all get a better understanding of the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it has its influence on modern classics (Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, and so on), but that in general the original in both directions and walk around with a score unrivaled. I feel that if everyone was watching this movie over and over again, they would realize it is much more, and possibly to evaluate it for a great part of the modern cinema, what it is, and I also hope that Richie still it is useless, as the I far prefer it to his mockney "masterpieces".
