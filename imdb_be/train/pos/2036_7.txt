- SMALL SPOILER in MI! - <br /> <br /> When I looked at the votes for the "Creep" today, I was surprised IMDb users appreciate so much the film "1". I wonder what people expect from this kind of movie? There are so many people to watch a movie without knowing anything about it? <br /> <br /> «Creep» is a horror movie, and it's very good! This automatically means that it is absurd story full of holes, glaring dangers and simple one-sided characters. So why complain about it? Just grab the popcorn and coke, comfortably in his chair, and then ... enjoy ... scared to death! The first 60 minutes, if there is almost nothing more than Kate and lonely subway station is incredibly frightening. There is uncertainty and fear in every corner of the screen, and you will give some jerks just because of the sudden sound of the flashing neon lights in the back of you. (In my view, a sound editor did a better job in this film.) <br /> <br /> When Kate met her stalker film quality drops, but he still did not become a bad film. The second part of the movie is not scary at all, but Gore effects are well made, and the story is well developed. (... as long as you keep in mind that this is a horror movie you're watching and Discovery Channel!) So if you want to do very, very frightening hour. Just watching the first hour «Creep», and then leave the cinema or turn your TV. You know the rest of the story anyway, is not it? The bad guy dies, and Kate is the only survivor. But even if you're watching this movie to the end, you will not be disappointed <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to push the alarm to the next level, do what I did after watching this film .: Leave film on a dark night, go to the next metro station and take the last train home ...
