"The Birth of the Beatles", to be the US TV movie released in the autumn of 1979 was in fact still the best movie that tells the story about the four lads from Liverpool who made a revolution in the music industry and the world. According to the standpoint of former Beatle Pete Best. Performance of all the cast is excellent, but, in particular, the performance of Stephen MacKenna as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was produced by the legend of rock 'n' roll era, Mr. Dick Clark. Who a year earlier even a TV movie was made in 1978, has withstood the test of time, "Kurt Russell" starring in the title role of another musical legend; "Elvis." This film was directed by an unknown director named "John Carpenter," which continued to lead other successful films such as; "Halloween," "Escape from New York", and «The Thing». The same can be said about the director of "The Birth of the Beatles", Mr. Richard Marquand. He went on to direct other theatrical blockbusters such as "Star Wars Return of the Jedi", "eye of the needle" and «Jagged Edge» among many. The only film telling about the Fab four that I know is Back Blow, who was a theatrical release in 1994, however, the critics do not take care of it, and not the public, because he did not have a long life in the theater. Birth of the Beatles is very nice and simplified movie that gives you the essence of the beginning of the legend, and struggle, and n azbavlennyav they went through and finishes there the pinnacle of success, when they come to New York and appear on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. I highly recommend this film.
