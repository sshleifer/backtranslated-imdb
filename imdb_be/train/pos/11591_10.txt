I, too, was looking to find this movie for quite some time, and it would be great to find it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> I saw this film when I was about 6 years old, The Netherlands . And I was very impressed by it. It has previously been shown JUNGLE BOOK Walt Disney! <br /> <br /> What I remember from this movie is fragmented. I remember that Indian boy was friends with the eagle. I was very impressed. For some reason, he was thrown out of his village (do not understand the reason for this). When other boys were throwing stones at him, he climbed the cliff and jumped off. At this time, it turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle other. As an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace. <br /> <br /> CB
