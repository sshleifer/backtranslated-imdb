This film was very funny, I would like to have it for my vintage collections of 1970s, the movie should again see a list, I know it's characters, they are the people I have met over the years, and that tells me to look for this comedy Unfortunately, it was not delivered on DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx always clown comedy, Pearl Bailey a great game, as his wife witty and arrogant, Norman's son with a secret not sure that it will have a future if it is outside, Dennis Dugan crazy funny man. Miss Dobson prostitute with a heart and little conscience. Love, passion, strange family ties, the film has the right to returning for an encore performance, the comedy of the situation with a combination of events, as it can and must find his way as a remake, I think I found the actor will be very difficult, perhaps impossible, except for Jerry Seinfeld played by Dennis Dugan role, it identifies several episodes of Seinfeld, which also led me to Norman, you are keeping them in the near future was known not possible, it is impossible to reform the pretend girlfriend Hooker and infidelity of one of the parents. This film was a wild ride with a taxi driver advised, reminds me of the episode Kramer takes the advice of his caddy over his lawyer. (The episode of Seinfeld) Parents have a jaw dropping moment there, have fun on the fun shouting back to me.
