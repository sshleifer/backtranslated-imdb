GOOD. There are people who do not see in this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) If you do not see it if you do not like satire and black humor. 2) Do not like it when you are offended by _The Watchmen_. 3) If you do not see it if you want a serious superhero movie. <br /> <br /> The rest, run, do not walk, to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's quirky, it's a wonderful sendup every bad superhero cliche known to man. Occasional forays into junior high humor will not spoil the fun of insincere discreet Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as a few funny little pieces Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (Good to see Lasserre to get a job, too.) I laughed all the way through. Through serious, a little strange, but -good-.
