It was a very good movie, I liked it. I thought it was pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it's not about dieting, it's about the pain so deep that they must find a way to deal with them, and they choose it. Beth was very definitely turn the character and the scene where she confronts her mother about the eating disorder, you can see the pain inside her and hear her voice, and you know how deep the pain she feels. I also think that one of the best lines in the film, where the beta shout the words: "This is not about you." To his mother. These words were so precise, and added so much that the scene in the movie. I think that this scene has been determined the most important scene in the film.
