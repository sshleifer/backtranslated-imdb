This may be a remake of the 1987 Autumn Tales, after eleven years as director Mabel Cheung claimed. Mabel uses rock music as a medium in this film to express their personal attitude towards life in which love, desire and indirect disorders play a much crucial role. Rock music can not be the best way to express the deep sense, and yet it is not too stupid to use it as a life underground rock musician bitterly more intense than usual. The director focuses on the figure of fine affection and ultimate vanity of life, not just rock music. The love between father and son, lovers and friends subtly and touchingly delivered through a fine performance. Mabel is not trying to decorate the rock musicians, as artists at all, instead it tries to reproduce the real life on the screen, making great efforts working years on this project and the collection of information in the Beijing underground pubs. <br /> <br /> Daniel gave probably the best performance in all his films made so far. His innate melancholy and isolation of suitable blue mood of the film perfectly.
