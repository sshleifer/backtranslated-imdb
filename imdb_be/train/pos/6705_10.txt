And it's not because of her days on "Clarissa says It AllÂ», I had a little crush on Melissa Joan Hart, who at the time of the show was popular was already well into her 20s, but is still able to get teenage roles. "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" was the next big leap Hart after her "Clarissa" days. Based on the comic book, Sabrina Spellman - you guessed it! - teenage witch who is trying to balance their magical tricks with the demands of everyday life of a teenager. She assisted in her efforts by her two aunts and wise cracking black cat as she walks out of high school, college, and finally to her career in journalism. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hart shows heart and soul. "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" is quite touching and very funny, and it's a shame that I took so long to realize how big it was. I just wish there was some new episodes that we could all enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
