Immediately after the Second World War, Powell and Pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal rift develops between the UK and the US. While there were many "overpaid, more sexy and over here" type comments. Somehow, they came up with this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of all time. He has everything. Romance, poetry, emotions, religion, drama and very nimble. <br /> <br /> I can not explain why, but it hits all the right buttons, and even though I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points across. <br /> <br /> It was a perfect action, as distinct sets, inspired by the script? Who knows. * DO * But watch it, and you'll see what I mean.
