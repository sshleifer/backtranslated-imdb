Lauren Bacall lived through Humprey Bogarts husband illness and death, when she made this film. Rock Hudson was at the top of its 1950 stars. Dorothy Malone in top form, and won an Oscar for his support. Robert Stack was nominated and falls a little less than a role. <br /> <br /> The history of a little soap from another time, but just as necessary as most dramas. It's amazing how well drunks can go in this film, and also how quickly sobers Stack in several films early sequences. <br /> <br /> You can understand why actors are so good, in fact production-wise this film is very good. You can tell Bacall distracted during this film, as in the time of her actions in the order it appears emotionally drained in some sequences. <br /> <br /> The sexual reference in this film is so soft that many of today's young viewers would not understand what they are. The film does a good job of telling the story, and in fact leaves the sequel to be made in the end, although no one was ever made- although written Beyond the wind is not a good name.
