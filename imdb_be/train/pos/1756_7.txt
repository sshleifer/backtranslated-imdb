"" 40 Year Old Virgin " '' made me laugh a lot. I do not care if it is considered very sexy comedy, I just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes that are present in this film. Steve Carell is ideal untouched nerd Andy Stitzer, and I think that the scene where the hair is removed with wax his chest Andy one of the coolest, especially because it is real. Many of the actors and actresses in this film there is a well-known or already known, by the way. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. He's a little strange, and collects a lot of toys, but it seems harmless. One day, during a game of poker with his friends of their work, they discover that Andy is really ... a virgin! And he's already 40 years old! After this surprising discovery, all his friends are trying to make Andy's sleep with a woman ... the problem is the lack of clarity in which Andy gets especially now, when he's really starting to like Trichet, a woman he met when she bought a DVD-player in the store he works for.
