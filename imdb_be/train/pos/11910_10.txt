Lovely little thriller opens Trevor Howard in his Jag convertible and ends up on the docks in Liverpool. It's all the thrills and spills, as a former spy must restart his career in the same way as it gets serious R & R cataloging butterflies (like the English is it?). <br /> <br /> Trevor Howard and Jean Simmons frolicking London Newcastle upon Tyne to Liverpool (via Ullswater) - he had just been thrown out of MI5 or something, and it is, you guessed it, on the go, wrongly accused of murder. There's a seedy docks, the rolling hills of the Lake District, sheep, country pubs, cop lost, waterfalls, lots of amateur cyclists, car chases on the roof, and many Chinese people (do not ask), and it's all very Hitchcocky and Hannayesque ... <br /> <br /> ..and a devastating example of the British Noir ...
