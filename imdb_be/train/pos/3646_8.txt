Walt Disney's "rookie" is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor league Picher, who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history, ending nearly 10 years of retirement and make his Major League debut in 1999 at the age of 35 <br / > <br /> film begins with a short synopsis of the childhood of Morris, which included a series of repeated places - his father was in the military. And even then, when his family settled permanently in football madman Texas, Maurice passion remains strong for baseball. <br /> <br /> childhood segment then jumps forward around 23 years to adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid), who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at the big lake high school (in real life, it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake , Texas). He noted that he was trying to make a career as a baseball player, but it did not work. <br /> <br /> The team Morris struggled, and he lectured them about the rejection of their dreams. They turn the table at him, telling him that he should try for a major league team. Several times, when he sends them into practice, they expressed surprise at the speed with which he throws. Maurice seem convinced, but agrees to a deal with his players, who, when they win the district, he will try to <br /> <br Major League team. /> Big Lake area does win, and following its end of the deal, Maurice visiting Tampa Bay Devil Rays try. Phenomenal, he's throwing 98 miles per hour - faster than he threw during his minor league career, and outstanding speed, even for pitchers league. After another attempt with the team, Maurice offered a contract with the Devil Rays <br /> <br /> This leaves it with the firm decision. - remain in his comfortable life, or again to realize his dream league, passing through Little League pound to make some money and spend months at a time away from home. And the decision is even more painful than during his first visit to the minor leagues, because now he has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Maurice signs with the Devil Rays, starting at AA and moves quickly to the AAA level, one level below Major League Baseball. But as the season winds down, the chances of getting it "calls" are becoming increasingly thin. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I love this movie. There are many excellent performances and cute characters, and it's easy to find yourself really pulling for Morris. In addition, the film does a great job, which shows professional baseball to both major and minor league levels. And most of all, it teaches timeless message on holding tight to your dreams, even if they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve. <br /> <br /> However, the film has some drawbacks. Although generally accurate, it exaggerates and even makes a few things. Check http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. In addition, on the same stage, with the exception of the one in which he prays with his players, the movie completely ignores the Christian faith Maurice. But, considering the left wing zeal Disney, this is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Presumably, a lot of hype / inventions were made to make the story more dramatic. However, the 20-minute documentary about Morris, which is included on the DVD, there is some information that makes his story more dramatic, but excluded from the film. <br /> <br /> For example, from birth to his family settled permanently in Texas when he was 12, Maurice is again 14 times. His initial career minor league ended after four operations, through which it has lost half of the muscles in his left (pitching) shoulder, making him throwing 98 miles / h is even more inexplicable. <br /> <br /> In order to fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it's good to not only watch «The Rookie», but watching a documentary on DVD, check the above link to inaccuracies of the film and probably also read a biography of Maurice, as well as "Members". I have not read the book, but I hope that one of these days. <br /> <br /> But in general, "rookie" very good portrayal of wonderful stories and is a powerful testimony of the power of dreams and the celebration of the common man. 8/10
