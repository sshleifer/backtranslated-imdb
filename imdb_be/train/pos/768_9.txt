Kinematic this movie stinks. As much in action. But <br /> <br /> do not care. If you have a strong idea of ​​what the 80s were <br /> <br /> how (for many of us in the Innercity anyway) and what is hip-hop, Zulu <br /> <br /> nation, and break dancing were really like.Great music, great <br /> <br /> dancing! It's almost like a documentary time is now past <br /> <br />, when hip-hop was a way of life. It is also interesting to see the new <br /> <br /> New York looks like the epicenter of a nuclear attack. Some viewers <br /> <br /> may be too young to remember that it was a poor, run-down city <br /> <br /> during the 70s and 80s. This is the best of all the hip-hop / break <br /> <br /> dancing films released around this period. Of course, <br /> <br /> 80s is now considered to be a joke of bad television shows and <br /> <br /> films, but those of us who lived through it will never forget <br /> <br / > it lovingly for a time when music, dance, and graffiti were fresh, yo!
