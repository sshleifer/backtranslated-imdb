Long defunct prison, closed more than 20 years, re-opened, and Ethan Sharp (the late, great character actor Lane Smith) after a security guard there are on-site warden. As prisoners are at work fixing up the place, they are instructed to get into the old performance room. It unleashes February spirit that inflicts relentless havoc on both guards and prisoners; cool as can be restrained inmate Burke (Viggo Mortensen, showing real composure in an early role) is thrust into the role of hero. <br /> <br /> I know that this is not an easy task to praise the film for its atmosphere (it was filmed in an actual abandoned prison near Rawlins, Wyoming), but it raises the horror film to a higher level. He has a great sense of anticipation, set at the very beginning. Director Renny Harlin made his fourth directorial effort here; He got it in the "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" directing gig and effectively began an impressive career in the movies mainstream action, thrillers and horror films. <br /> <br /> It may have roles, but he has a way of throwing bringing them to life: Chelsea Field, as a young woman vying for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick, like a tired veteran convict Cresus, Tom Everett as careful against Rabbitt, Ivan Kane leaving Lasagna, Tommy "Tiny" Lister, how courteous giant Crumb, and Arlen Dean Snyder as captain Horton. It should also be noted as an early acting credit for Kane Hodder (as a vengeful spirit), which helped him land a gig * play Jason Voorhees in "Friday the 13th" series. <br /> <br /> Worthy of special effects, moody lighting gently prolific genre cinematographer Mac Ahlberg, Music Band and the ghost of Richard Christopher Stone, great visuals, incredibly dark place, and generally noisy and intense presentation helps make it quite interesting. It is disgusting, disgusting, and good fun for the fan horror. <br /> <br /> 8/10
