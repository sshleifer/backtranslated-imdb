I absolutely loved this film. I bought it as soon as I could find a copy. This film had so much emotion, and felt so real, I could really empathize with the characters. Every time I watch it, the ending makes me cry. I can really identify with the character of Philip Busy, and how I would feel if the same thing happened to me. <br /> <br /> I think that all higher education institutions have to show this film, maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same. I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone. Especially those who have suffered from a school shooting. <br /> <br /> This is truly one of the greatest films of all time.
