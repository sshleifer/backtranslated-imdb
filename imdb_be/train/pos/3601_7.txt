Michelle Rodriguez is a defining actress who can be a force for charging other actresses to watch. She has the nerve to put yourself in a rarely seen tough girl role very early in his career (and remove) it is a feat that should be recognized. Although her later films classify it in the same role, that this film was made for her strength. <br /> <br /> Her character is a romanticized student / soldier / lover, struggling to overcome its existence disappointed in the projects a bit overdone in the film ... but not the girl. This aspect of the film is not very original, but the story goes in depth when heated relationship that this girl has to deal with to come to a boil and her primitive rage takes over. <br /> <br /> I haven "did not see the actress to take such an aggressive stance in making the film yet, and I'm glad she gets that first turn there in Hollywood. This film received 7 from me because of the history of the average youth of the ghetto, but he has such a great actress painting rarely seen in the role of a minimum budget of the film. Great job.
