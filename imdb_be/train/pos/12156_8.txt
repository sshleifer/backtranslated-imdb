Some of the background details of the story are based, is very, very weak on the real events of the era in which it is located. History combines some of the details of the famous Leopold and Loeb case, together with a small amount of Aimee Semple McPherson. <br /> <br /> story begins with two mothers (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds), who bullied as they left the courtroom. The crowd seems to be more likely going to do them bodily harm, as their children were simply guilty of a heinous crime thrills. One man in the crowd, apparently cut his hand winters as they make their way to the waiting car. <br /> <br /> Shortly after they come home, they begin to receive threatening phone calls, so Reynolds believes that they both move to the west coast together and open a dance school. Dance with the success of the school and they are pleasuring incredibly disgusting parents who think their child is the next Shirley Temple. One of the parents of these spoiled children multimillionaire, which is fully packed with Reynolds, and they begin dating. Life looks very good. But when the threatening phone calls started again, Winters meets with flipping - behave as it is close to a psychotic break, and it recedes farther and farther into the religion - to listen to the radio, "Sister Alma" almost constantly. Again and again you see Winters on the edge and eventually culminates in a very bad thing !! I will not say more, as this may damage this disturbing and entertaining film. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this film is very much like a horror movie Bette Davis and Joan Crawford 1960s as «Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? »,« Straight-Jacket "and" The Nanny ". Although none of them is not entirely intellectual fare, at the level of kitsch they are very interesting and fun. Drawing up very well, and there are some nice twists near the end, which makes it all very interesting. Winters are long, like a gentle and crazy lady and Reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39-year-old I've ever seen. - plus it can really, really dance <br /> <br /> My only concern about all this is that some of them may find winter hyper-religiosity in the film a bit tacky - like a cheap attack on Christianity. At first I felt that way, but if you meet sister Alma, she seems sincere, and abuse, so I took the religious winters only as a sign of madness -., Who, I believe, is all that was intended < br /> <br /> by the way, this film is packed with "who Slew Auntie ROO?" - another Shelley Winters horror film from 1971, and a lot of fun ... and rather over-the-top!
