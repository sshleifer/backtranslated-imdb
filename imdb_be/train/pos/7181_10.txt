Eyeliner was running about 6,000 years ago in Egypt. In fact, it is not something that most of the duration to be around the 12th century. I do not understand, the series flopped. There is a second season airing currently does not exist? It's amazing to me when comments made by those who are either ill-informed or not to watch the show at all. It's a waste of space on the board and another time. The first show of the series has been, it can be a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place, but you can expect from any show. The rest of the first season perfectly. I can not wait for the second season to start in the United States.
