Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. Do not wait for production values ​​in movie theaters, but expect high quality direct to video release. <br /> <br /> It is configured as Timon and Pumbaa start watching the original Lion King in a darkened theater and abruptly switch tracks and start telling their own story. This is done with frequent interruptions comedy. For example, in one particular moment of intense trading house commercial pops on and upset FUIB understand that he sat on the remote control. These little moments pepper the movie, and whether or not you find it entertaining or not will largely depend on your sense of humor. If you are particularly worried about the films that deliberately remind the audience to watch a movie than this may not be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Animation best that they have invested in the DTV line of Disney, virtually seamless and integrated with the original material. The new, independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original. Voice talents are all well made, though I could not help but think of Marge Simpson every time I heard Kavner. <br /> <br /> Many of the jokes in the film are well-known to viewers as processed over generations, but are more than comfortable with the familiarity of old friends quirks than the annoyingly repetitive. <br /> <br /> music made me realize how much I enjoyed and miss good music integrated with the Disney feature. Toe opening feature "to dig a tunnel" is well choreographed and cheerful. Timon and Pumbaa to take on the sequence of the Lion King's discoveries and their introduction to paradise too funny. The only problem was to reprise "dig a tunnel" at the end of the film, switching his lyrics and melodies from defeatist to be lifted. <br /> <br /> storyline is very well done, and the integration of new story elements makes it almost perfect, although the last bit on the hyena chased stretched plot a little trust. New story does not seem to cope saccharin or emotionally charged moments of good, or better, when he refers to the total comedy. <br /> <br /> In general, it is worth buying. If you like all the bonus features that come with a typical set of 2-disk, and then go for it. Pinscher for a penny, that is still willing to invest in a good movie, wait until he falls four or more dollars and go rent it immediately. <br /> <br /> Damion Crowley.
