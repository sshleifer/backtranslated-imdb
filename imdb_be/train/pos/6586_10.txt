Jeremy Brett Holmes simply the best ever, narrowly edging out great Basil Rathbone, of course, and this is probably the best film adaptation of the novel Conan Doyle. <br /> <br /> length adaptation includes some new plot thread that fits in well to the environment and the drama intensifies hatred one feels for Milverton. <br /> <br /> excellent performances from all sides, especially from Robert Hardy, and both Brett and Hardwicke fully rounded and comfortable in his role, make it a great part of the drama.
