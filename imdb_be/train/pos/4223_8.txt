The film has a large writing genre history. It has all the usual ingredients of Colombo; Way Lt. Columbo approaches and bonds to its suspected as the mystery unravels for him, Columbo dog in a cat and mouse game that is great in this, and, fortunately, and relieving some good humor, mostly involving Colombo character. It's all written, despite the fact that he does not even have a truly original concept. Columbo detective stalking / killing of writer novel several times has been done before in a movie Columbo. <br /> <br /> It is also very good film director James Frawley, who has since directed more than 5 Columbo movie in the 70's and 80's. He presented the film with style and really great and memorable sequences. <br /> <br /> This is one of the more slowly moving Colombo films, despite the lack of time is too long runs. The style and approach does not always work well for movie Columbo, but it does in this film that may not be in the least due to the movie actor's performance. <br /> <br /> Most of the Columbo film starred a large well-known star or a star from the early days of film, as a film of his killers. This film stars rather an unknown 81-year-old Ruth Gordon. She had not acted in an awful lot of films throughout his career, but it is still well known to a few, mainly for her role in the film "Rosemary's Baby," which also earned her an Oscar. It was a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting that some people may not like it, though. She earned her more than 4 Oscar nominations throughout his career, to her victory in "Rosemary's Baby", in 1969, it has a lot of interaction, as well as with Peter Falk in their sequences together. <br /> <br /> The film also stars a young GD Spradlin. I say young, because I only know it from recent productions with his career, despite the fact that he was 57 at the time of production of Columbo. He's still alive, but retired from acting, ever since 1999. <br /> <br /> even better than in normal recording Columbo movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
