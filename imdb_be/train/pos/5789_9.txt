This is one of my favorites along with Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing "Sandy" and Agnes Moorehead-and-The-tiny astronauts episodes. <br /> <br /> It is important to accept, from the middle of 1961 ,. the long Cold War, the US was then involved in the laid-down city scene, a rare close dialogue starving characters, their shabby shape, and the minimum action "say" it all: the absurdity of the on- going conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization, and all that is sweet and redeeming about it. <br /> <br /> This "fable", because it was done at the time in which the events have turned out differently, for example, the second Berlin crisis (spring 1961) and following the Cuban Missile Crisis (October 1962), it would actually have been a reasonable representation of one of the largest US cities, destroyed and have a lot more miserable survivors, I also see this as a "bike", because it is not just a cautionary tale, but because it the most redeeming all of our popular myths: it is a love story set in a bind position, and with the participation of two very mismatched lovers.
