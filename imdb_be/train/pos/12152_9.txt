I just saw this movie on HBO, and it was really good ... the tragic love story indeed! I really appreciated the fact that the guy in the heart of history lost the use of his legs in an accident. It is rare to see a love story with someone who is disabled. The love that developed between this character and the woman who comes into his life beautifully reflected, as I'd like to think love can heal someone's heart. Laura Leighton ... all of 27 when she made this film ... was as big as a woman, so full of life, it is able to revive the heart of the guy. Unfortunately, since his family is rich, and it we did not have a "problem" to develop. <br /> <br /> He plays on HBO a few more times this month.
