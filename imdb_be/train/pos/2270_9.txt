The film is a little "thin" after reading the book, but it is still one of the greatest films ever made. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte really «vonneguty». He does a great job of expressing the feeling of the book to the film. Not many films deal with a sense of the book, as well as the Mother of Darkness does.
