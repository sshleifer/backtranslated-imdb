A unique film about the confused woman (Lindsay Crouse), which is involved with sharp swindlers. Joe Mantegna gives the performance an Oscar caliber Slick group. It is a charming first hour, and Mantegna show Kraus "rope" their cheater games. Story line unravels a little later, but still stands as a unique picture of the innocent involved in a dark world. Definitely worth a shot.
