This film is smart. That is, more than most other films, it goes beyond the lowest common denominator - stupid people is not likely to appreciate. The story also relies heavily on dialogue. It has some parallels with the difficulties of translation, but before the sun is much brighter, the less abstract, and just so much better. <br /> <br /> script, characters and even a bit surreal atmosphere to feel absolutely realistic. Actors play quite brilliantly. Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and acting as the melt is great together. <br /> <br /> The dialogue becomes very personal questions, with the risk to become a bit over the top. This, however, remain on the right side almost all the time, although I found a few things a little bit clumsy and awkward. Balancing on the thin line requires provocatively talented actors. Sometimes it gives excellent results, and in general, this film is simply huge! Only very, very rarely "love" in the movies, the images in such a way that I find credible and realistic. Every time this is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think that a tremendous and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this regard. It still looks amazing in this film, 12 years after. <br /> <br /> This is just a gem of a film that you can not miss. One of the best films I've seen since the 1990s!
