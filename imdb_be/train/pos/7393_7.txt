This film has been impressive. My first experience with a foreign film, it was not too long and not too complicated. I myself enjoyed the subtitles; and the story was surprisingly fresh. History grown son visiting his elderly father and brother slow after a long absence appeared routinely on the ground, but it was very touching and realistic. There was also some subtle humor to not lower or bore audiences.
