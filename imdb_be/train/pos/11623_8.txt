(You know what I mean after you've seen the red-eye ...) <br /> <br /> In general, Red Eye was better than expected, a thriller. He goes to a slow start, and slowly builds. But by then it was all over, this is a blatant lie! <br /> <br /> It's hard to pinpoint what makes this thriller ... how exciting I found it. Besides that, quite simply, the director has done a commendable job pulls you into the action that otherwise would have been a mediocre story. Rather, I tend to forget that I was watching a movie. That says a lot. <br /> <br /> Another factor, I think, is the "closeness" of the victims and the bad guy ... and that over time, you begin to truly belongs to the victim. 8 out of 10 poor, more like a 7.5 ... but it's very good!
