I caught this film at a screening test. I was very surprised to find a really sweet and funny story. Good acting. Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The male lead is Awsome. Very funny movie. It takes place in the best locations in New York. He made me want to go there. I just saw, "You've got mail" I thought, "It had to be You" was a much better story. Fresher. <br /> <br /> It was clean and great for the whole family. I think it will be good. Audience I saw him loved him. I would definitely recommend!
