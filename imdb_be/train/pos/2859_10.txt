I know it sounds strange coming from someone born almost 15 years after the show stopped airing, but I love this show. I do not know why, but I like to watch. I love Adam the best. The only disappointment is that the only place I found to buy the seasons on DVD in Germany, and it was only the first two seasons. This is disappointing, but that's okay. I will continue to watch online. If anyone has any tips on where to buy a second after 14 seasons, please contact me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already have the first one. The only down side is that DVD-drives, which are in Germany, they only play on a portable DVD-player and my computer. Oh, well. I still own it!
