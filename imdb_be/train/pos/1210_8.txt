Hey, if every villain introduced himself, saying: "I ammmmm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRTÂ» I think they might be laughing, but for young children, it is a moral story with memorable music. <br /> <br /> Music so catchy, mind you, that I still remember the words after seeing this film in twenty years. I would definitely suggest this for young children.
