The only time I saw this film when I was 10 years old. I remembered all these years, I could not sleep for a week or more after viewing it. It's just absolutely rattled me. I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft. Worth, Texas, and I will never forget. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of it for me to see, as an adult. It took a lot of research to figure out which movie it was, but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in it, and were finally able to get the name and reviews about it. I really liked it, but he gave me quite scared! Jaqui
