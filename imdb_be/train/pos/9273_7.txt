In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has formed a part of all life, including everyday items. But people still continue to live their lives, usually just do what you would expect, like going to football matches to cheer for the national team, as it is in the running to qualify for the World Cup. In addition women are not allowed to go to a football stadium to watch the game. <br /> <br /> Often funny movie's behind a small group of women who were caught sneaking into the football stadium and a small group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a corral just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple desire of these women do not cheer on the team (nothing subversive there), and a little human touch on the life of each person are added to a fine commentary on humanity in relation to ideology. <br /> <br /> amateur action, good script and dialogues, a very enjoyable film. Bend It Like Beckham, kind of - the warm heart and joy in everyday interests and meet people.
