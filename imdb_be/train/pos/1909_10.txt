Initially, I watched 8 simple rules on Disney Channel UK for the first series and got completely hooked. If they do not show it more \ was annoyed, but then 1 satred showing the 2nd series. I do not think another series begins after I read John Ritter died, but the second series was not strange the last series of back is a wonderful old standard. I hope that they are going in the near future, although I could see everyone make more shows show a thousand times. Keighley couco my favorite character, like a fool Bridget, as well as on countries of Charmed. Rory is good too, it shares my name and Grampa as well.I'll keep watching it until it will not end until then I hope he carries on as funny as ever
