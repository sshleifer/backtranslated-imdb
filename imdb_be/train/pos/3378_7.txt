This film came to me highly recommended Matt Groening. Well actually I looked like The Simpsons and Futurama, and gets a mention in both, so I figured, "What the hell." The film brings home some "what if" that make you realize how lucky we are in this day and age, when we take simple things like soap and water for granted. Interestingly, however, that this year the 2022 men still shaving with a safety razor single blade! It's nice that the perpetrators no more than download a movie with unnecessary special effects, ray guns, etc. Some of the "furniture" look good once you understand what it means. Remember that "Tuesday is Soylent Green Day"
