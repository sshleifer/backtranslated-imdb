I was 5 years old when I saw this music video while relaxing with his family to St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with her. 27 years later, he is still the original inspiration for achieveing ​​a goal that I have given to carry out from now on! <br /> <br /> This tragic story of a hard-core "behind the scenes" of the entertainment industry during the late '50s, "Sparkle" successfully reflects the struggle of three young sisters who are looking for their place under the sun. This story could be a biographical story of many young aspiring artists that can materialize when things seem to happen too quickly and role models are not available to lend a helping hand. <br /> <br /> The phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack carries the story with each song. On being exposed to situations that left little choice for a strong long-term decision to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead, three young girls, sparkle, sister, Dolores, represent different routes that could be taken if you go to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society. <br /> <br /> This film could possibly spawned the idea of ​​a "Dreamgirls" on Broadway, and Mariah Carey's "Glitter" 25 years later. As a member of the audience both performances, I saw a lot of similarities in both the "sparkle" of history, as well as in "Saturday Night Fever», «Glory", "Flashdance" and off-Broadway smash hit "Mom, I want to sing."
