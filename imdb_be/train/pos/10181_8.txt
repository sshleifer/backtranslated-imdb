I originally bought this DVD, because he was the SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover, and I thought, hey! Another film starring Shahrukh Aishu and little did I know that Aishwarya will only appear in the item number in the last quarter of the film in the song, which she shares with IBS and helps to introduce his character that the film only about 15 minutes. Shakti is a film about the love of a mother and endurance. This film is about transformation, ignorance, majority going to the course and covering the harsh realities of life. Item number, in which SRK and Aishu are has nothing to do with the film. It is actually a dream sequence that occurs while drunk character SRK is blacked out drinking. He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is sexy street girl who appears in his favorite hangout spot one day dressed poorly and begins to seduce him. Song Title «Ishq Kamina» (loosely translated as "Love is a bitch!") And it just smokes! Do not miss it.
