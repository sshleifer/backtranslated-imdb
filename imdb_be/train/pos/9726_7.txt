Well, it was a pleasant surprise in the end. its trailer did not predict a good movie at all, it was even a bit misleading. Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, funny and caustic. Less real, though, I do not think that the guy who got where he got to show signs of such disrespectful towards all that his current company serves. One does not become a top suit just to doubt all of a sudden again. The ending of the film, during the show Dolce Vita, was too banal, cliche and rather disappointed. And, of course, such a person, as a character Pegg will not last past its first week in the journal lightning New York like this. I hope that one day I will see a decent role, written for Megan Fox, where she was a bad actress, playing in Bimbo. And by the way, I do not understand why it is a "sex symbol" of the year, I see hot girls in almost every cover of every magazine.
