what's wrong with you people, if you have not been taken out of the car action sequences and Jessica Simpson hot body, you are important thread in the head. Of course, the film is not a masterpiece, I do not think he wanted to be. It was fun and funny, I've never watched the show when I was younger, I just recently saw an episode, and when I watched the movie, I felt that it was the same kind of atmosphere. cinema seats were almost shaking, and car sequences were good, because she did not give birth to me and pulled out, as some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and Jessica Simpson clearly hot, I just want them to use it more in the action sequences. In general, I had a hell of time watching it, and I would go and see him again soon, and I'll buy it on DVD. People enjoy it, what it is.
