"Before Sunrise" is a great love story and should be among the Top 5 of my favorite movies ever. Dialogue and action are great. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna, represented in the film, does not exist (you will not find the poet sits by the river in the middle of the night), and it is not possible to get to all the places only one night, or (especially if you are unfamiliar, and it's your first night in Vienna). But this is not the point. Relations between the two characters is much more important, and this part of the story is not entirely unrealistic. Although, nothing ever really happens, the movie never gets boring. The ending is really boring, not as "Titanic" or something. Even if you do not like love stories, you have to see this movie! I was a bit skeptic about the sequel, which will be released in the summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.
