Excellent novel comedic drama about Italian widow (Cher), who plans to marry a man who suits her (Danny Aiello), as long as it does not fall on him stubborn, evil brother (Nicolas Cage). The script is sharp with lots of great lines, great acting, accents (I said) is an advanced and beautiful cinematography. New York never looked so good on the screen. A must see in the first place for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - they're both fantastic and deserved Oscars, which they have received. Beautiful, funny movie. You must see!
