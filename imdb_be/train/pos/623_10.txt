There's not a lot of movies around, which gave me a sense of how Stardust done all throughout the film. Like a fairy tale type as the princess bride, Stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy catcher since the 2000s and 1990s. Exciting, fun and equipped with excellent imagery and unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro Especially I defy anyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the film, you know very well how it would end, but it's a journey, not a destination, which fascinates the audience from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Ten star, not a decimal less.
