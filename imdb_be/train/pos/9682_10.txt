I absolutely loved this film! It was so good! This film tells the parrot, Paulie point of view. Paulie is given to a little girl Marie, as a gift. Paulie Marie helps to learn to speak, and they become best friends. But if Paulie says Marie fly, it falls, and the bird goes away. That's when the adventure begins. Paulie goes so much to find their way back to Marie. This film is so sweet, funny, touching, sad, and more. When I first saw this movie, it made me cry. Birds courage and urge him to go find Marie all this time, it was so touching. I must say that the ending is so sweet and sad, but you have to look to see how it goes. In the end, the janitor tries to help him after hearing his story. Will he find his long-lost Mary or not? Find out when you look at this sweet and heart warming film. It will touch your heart.
