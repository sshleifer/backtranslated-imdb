The last wave is never going to win a wide audience. This is a slow, but exciting movie for those who are willing to go along with it. Australian lawyer properties are asked to take on the case of five Aboriginal people, who are charged with the murder of one of their own. A variety of omens and signs will soon emerge, and death of a person includes a tribal issue, which is not intended to be the white man's court, and quickly lawyer with difficult to distinguish reality from fantasy. It seems that the end of the world may be at hand, both he and the natives knew it, but nobody does. Richard Chamberlain as a lawyer is at its peak here. David Guptil, a familiar face from a few other Australian clicks and a decent actor, is one of five Aboriginal people in court. The last wave is simply not for everyone, more than magnolia (as happens to have amazing things falling from the sky). Check it on a slow Saturday night.
