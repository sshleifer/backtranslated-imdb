One of the most enduring comedies Cary Grant is Mr. Blandings builds his Dream House. Although, judging by the size of its housing will house a dream today. Cary still had to make a good living in advertising, even if it was with the devil at the time, trying to come up with a slogan for the ham with the brand thumps. <br /> <br /> What made this film so popular was the housing shortage in the years of World War II, post. Who are returning veterans asserted their rights under the GI Bill of Rights, which includes mortgages. The problem was there just are not enough homes to meet the demand. Around the time the book Eric Hozhinsa and films were so popular, Congress passed and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender- Wagner housing, the government marked the first time in the residential construction business. <br /> <br /> I had an uncle and aunt, who were at about the same time to build your own house, which they moved to in the early fifties. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy they had two daughters, and were looking to get out of inner city Rochester. Their location was not as wide as the house in Connecticut with eighteen rooms, still they lived there for the rest of his life as Cary and peaceful, probably did. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up, threatening to send Cary cleaners. Cary and peaceful as Melvyn Douglas around to offer advice, usually too late. In truth, he's kind of sweet at the Peace and Kerry knows. <br /> <br /> The role of Myrna Loy is simply a continuation of Nora Charles. If you can imagine, Charles moved to the country and William Powell, having headaches Cary Grant does, the film will continue to operate normally. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings builds his Dream House is still working well as comedy, as situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate, who had lived in their dream home together for over 40 years.
