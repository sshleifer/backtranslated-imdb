GOOD. I'm addicted. I live not far from Shrewsbury in England, where this wonderful film was made. It still looks the same now. I remember when they filmed here are pretty lively, and fake snow on the streets for several days in a row. Often, when I'm going through Shrewsbury I see a street or a house, and it will remind me of that movie. <br /> <br /> Scrooge George C. Scott is more realistic character than many other adaptations, its appearance is not a typical miser. Scott is a big and imposing. The person who finds those who are smaller than he is worse. <br /> <br /> We all know the story and quotes. The book is one of the most treasured works in the English language. And I do not believe that there are a lot of cynics who will say that the people are not able to change and redemption. This version of the film reflects that quite nicely. George C. Scott can be an American, but he plays the role of the English miser with excellent craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you have not seen this version I would strongly recommend you do. This is usually for a very small amount of money ... or do you also have in mind?
