Please note that I did not say that it is better ... only more enjoyable. The lack of social commentary and realism helps to keep things moving. <br /> <br /> I was actually kind of surprised that it was not a film Troma, as it has all the trademarks, including TROMA spewing acidic liquid, the severity of. villain after each murder, rape ridiculous bath scene (something hard to get upset because the rapist snowman), and blunt deputies <br /> <br /> There's a lot to like: <br /> <br /> 1. Snowman on he noted that he does not have legs, or feet, a police cruiser drives around the city. <br /> <br /> 2. Despite the fact that there should be close to (or below) the freezing breath shows a draw, and there is no sign of exhaust gases of cars when the cars working. <br /> <br /> 3. Snow reminds you more of flocking or Styrofoam peanuts than the actual snow. <br /> <br /> 4. A teenage girl gets her boyfriend a fuse for only a few hours after her brother was brutally murdered. She convinces him to invade the house of the sheriff, of all places, to get it. But first, she tells him that he must build a nice fire in the fireplace and open wine. <br /> <br /> 5. After the head teen years Jake cut sled runner, his father arguing with the sheriff about Tommy, the son of the sheriff, had nothing to do with him. Sheriff says that Tommy did not fight with Jake because Jake "at least two feet higher than Tommy." At this point, someone in the background chimes, "No more!Â» <br /> <br /> 6. when the evil snowman finally begins to melt, the sheriff struggling with flat snowman made out of a fabric for a long period of time. This is much better than Tarzan fighting rubber crocodiles or Gladiators fight with stuffed lions. If I was an actor, I would not be in able to keep a closed face at this point. <br /> <br /> in general, an interesting film. There's MTEF Ava even that much blood.
