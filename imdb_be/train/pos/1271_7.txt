Who had never seen this film based on the novel Kattsenbaha entertainment, and taking into account the speed of the first assembled for production, we have decided to look at. "Just Cause" and not a terrible film, takes too many liberties with the original material, Jeb Stuart is not completely successful in his treatment. Arne Glimcher directed. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think when a young black man dragged to the local police for questioning Police brutality. In the end, Sheriff Tanny Brown and Wilcox police officer, did not show no mercy in beating Bobby Earl, who is accused in the murder of a young white girl. We believe frighten the fact that employees do with the prisoners. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangeline, grandmother Bobby Earl goes to the north, to ask the distinguished Harvard professor, a retired lawyer, a young man Paul Armstrong wants to protect him. She is an old woman convincing enough for Armstrong to take a look at the case. He also believes in the innocence of a young man. <br /> <br /> It's not what we thought they were. If Blair Sullivan, the man who is serving time in the same facility, Bobby Earl, comes forward to tell how it is linked with the murder of a young girl, and changes the dynamics of the case. How it plays in the film, it serves to confuse the viewer and distract from Armstrong arriving at the truth. <br /> <br /> This thriller has made gratifying Sean Connery, who played Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, intense actor, makes a great impression as the sheriff, who, as far as we can see, is guilty of an abuse of his prisoner. Ed Harris is a great opportunity to show why he is one of our finest actors. Blair Underwood, Capshaw, Ruby Dee and the young Scarlett Johansson seen in supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The film, even with its flaws, does not disappoint.
