one of the best low-budget films from Germany! This is the dark side of a new era? if you believe in the esoteric, please do not watch this movie! he takes down all your positive imagination away. This film shows that beyond the fa√ßade of peaceful spiritual introspection is the world of extreme iniquity and terror. I hope that there will be a 35 mm copy soon! Andreas MARSCHALL first film is just the beginning of a new field, create movies with a few euros! I'm waiting for the second hit!
