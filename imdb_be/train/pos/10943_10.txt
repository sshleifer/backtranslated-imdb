I have to vote this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that it happens to see this review, took pity on me, whisks me to Hollywood and involves me in his bizarre / funny world. But in all seriousness, it was good. The first episode, obviously, to find his feet, but he's got that Silverman strangeness running all the way through it. This is not the kind of comedy to laugh, but it's a good thing, there are too many laugh-track to it, and it would not be right the remarks when to laugh, it is for the audience to hear their inner clown laughing at the absurdity of it all. I can easily see this as will Bizarro Drew Carey show with its wonderful characters and incredibly strong central character. Well worth a look, looking forward to the next episode. Very good chance from the usual comedy there. <br /> <br /> ps, Sarah? Call me ....
