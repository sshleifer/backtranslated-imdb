I just picked up the DVD release of the film during the holidays in Norway, where it was released with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed and powerfully acted. Tiny drawing «Frits» the main character has a surprisingly open face, reflecting a painful precision of the tragic events that unfold around him. <br /> <br /> Earlier in the film, we see that his father, whom Fritz loves so much has mental health problems, and it is brought up, when the brutal headmaster denies assault the boy, and believes that it was his own father <br /> <br /> climactic scene where Fritz refuses to show any respect for the director. simply stood his ground and chanting "Liar," as he brutally attacked in front of his classmates have a scene, you probably will not forget. <br /> <br /> In the movies, only weak point is the rather formulaic «Flower Power» teacher who uses each "teacher-friendly" trick in the book. Besides, I'm sure this film, you will truly enjoy.
