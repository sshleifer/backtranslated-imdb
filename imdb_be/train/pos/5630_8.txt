Marjorie (wonderful and exciting performance Farrah Fawcett) just avoids an attack in his car a vicious serial rapist Joe (superbly played with chilling authenticity and intensity of James Russo). However, Joe is stealing her purse and finds out where Marjorie lived. He pays her a visit one fateful day. After exposing Marjorie to great degradation and psychological violence, Marjorie manages to turn the tables on Joe and locks it in the fireplace. Marjorie is going to do that with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Mastrozimon cook harsh, gritty and often disturbing morality tale that astutely nails severe cruelty and painful humiliation of rape, as well as showing how every person, when pushed to the extreme, is able to shocking acts of violence and cruelty. Joe sees women only as objects, and Marjorie only see Joe as a "pet." However, this film is its enviable loan refuses to make Joe to be just a one-dimensional creep vile; instead, it is terribly real and ultimately pathetic man monster with his wife and child (the highest recognition of Joe, in particular, really bitter). Fawcett and Rousseau are outstanding in leads; they receive excellent support from Diana Scarwid as a passive Terry, Alfre Woodard as a healthy Patricia, and Sandy Martin as cute Yvonne employee Sudow. And clever cinematography and Curtis Clark J.A.C. breaking up, skin crawling cost Redford significantly increase a substantial claustrophobic tension. This powerhouse.
