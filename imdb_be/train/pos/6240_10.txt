The dog days are one of the finest films I have ever seen descriptions of life in modern cities. This is a very tough and cruel in some points and, unfortunately, it is very close to reality. Isolation, despair, deep emotional dead ends, problematic issues, perversion, complexes, madness. All things that are present in large developed cities today. It makes realize once again pityful condition in which people have a lead company. <br /> <br /> The downside of living in the city has never been shown on the screen as well. I just wish it was a lie. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Therefore ... 10/10.
