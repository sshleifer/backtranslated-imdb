Thank God, ABC picked it up instead of Fox. The best description (for those who know) really Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me well. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure whether the experience of death and destiny early in life I am a fan of Bryan Fuller, but I certainly enjoy its production. I also enjoy the checkered floors, pies, talking toys, gravelings and other mischievous things :) Although a bit «Burtonesque», of course, I think it has its own niche, which requires J Depp or HB Carter be surprising artistic a children's playground. Here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adult life, breaking each and actually makes sense and makes us want to live life to the fullest!
