Sidney Lumet, although one of the oldest of Directors, there is still a game! A few years ago, he took "Find Me Guilty" proof to all that Vin Diesel can actually act when he gets the opportunity and the right director. When he retired after the film (a masterpiece in my eyes), no one could blame him. But it is still going strong, his next film has already been announced in 2009 <br /> <br /> But let's stay with this film right here. The list of actors is incredible, their top notch performance. Small nuances in their speeches, the "real" dialogue and / or situations that develop throughout the film simply amazing. (Time) the film structure that keeps your toes all the time, mixing time line so smoothly that it seems natural to edit / flawlessly. History is enhanced by the fact that, albeit in a "normal" time structure, it would be at least a good movie (drama / thriller). I can only highly recommend it, the rest is up to you! : O)
