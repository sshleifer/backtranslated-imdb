School Rock 'n' Roll has a special place in my heart, because he introduced me to the Ramones. I was too young during the mid '70s heyday of the group to be well aware of them, although I had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. I finally saw RNRHS on TV one day in the mid-80s, when I was fifteen years old, and laughed all the way through it. (? Is not it the dream of every middle school kids to smash his school and blow it up, all set to a soundtrack Rockin ') I wrote the following airing of the film in a year or two later, and continued to watch live Ramones sequence over and over again, thinking, "Man, these guys kick ass! I have to check some of their albums! "The rest is history. Twenty years, countless of LPS Ramones / cassette / CD, as well as three Ramones shows later, they are still one of my favorite bands and RNRHS still cracks me up every time I watch it. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny left us (R.I.P. all) at least we have this film and tons of great music to remember them.
