It's so rare to find a movie that delivers a story that can not be figured out at every turn. Surprises for all captured. <br /> <br /> A few things that I could not understand, however, that here you have a lead female character who plays a "good girl, a hard worker," and yet in the end, it ends up being anti-social venture. It was not enough to make me not like it, though, but it gives me pause. <br /> <br /> Another thing I could not get was an old man, who was taken to the police at the end of the film. I never get who he is and what his questions. If anyone has any ideas, I'd love to hear what they might be. <br /> <br /> The film was exciting and fun everywhere and always left me guessing. Very worth seeing.
