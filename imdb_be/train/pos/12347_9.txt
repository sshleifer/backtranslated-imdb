This is a great film about a brothel in the fishing village that can be best described with the constellations and the direction of the older works of Kurosawa scene, combined with the fact Dostoevsky in human psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladov), Shakespeare's tragic drama and Anderson and vivacity. Scenario amazing scenes are beautiful and chromotherapy some scenes to be really reflected in my mind. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a little action, so if you do not like all the feelings you would have come to your expenses -. We are not talking about the mysterious geisha and samurai bushido proud of them pour all of them, but also about life, work and the kinds of people anywhere at anytime. Excellent and exciting tribute to Kurosawa, definitely worth a look.
