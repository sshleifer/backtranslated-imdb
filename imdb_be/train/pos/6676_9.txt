****** note: "Mystery Men" MAY contain SPOILERS ************** <br /> <br /> So, who are these simple terms, the mystery men the sub group -geroyav desperately trying to live their teenage fantasy lives while botching their real identities and their super identity. Spoonbill (Bill Macy) works construction during the day and at night, leaving his wife and child at home when he travels down the street, looking for crimes to solve the problem with its unusual and unique fighting style shovel. Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware youngest day and throws dishes at a crazy villain night when his mother was not keeping him busy last Snooping. Mr. Furious working in a fight to earn his salary, and then takes out his frustrations on his friend at night, throwing ill-acuity into friends and enemies, and threats to get really angry (leaving everyone wondering, so what?) . Ben Stiller breathes such life into the character, you can not help but love him. <br /> <br /> The three nights spend, trying to capture that "moment of glory" they dreamed of becoming a real ... Super Heroes. It is obvious that this can happen. Champion City have Captain Awesome, finally .. . flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logo on his suit to stop an extra shot or two. Greg Kinnear turns in a stellar performance as the sale of middle age, trying to regain his supporters focus on the end of his career. <br /> <br /> In order to restore that "extra magic" that could win approval Again, CA releases Casanova Frankenstein, waaaaay over-the-top threat played to perfection frightening Goeffrey Rush. This mad genius has created «psychofrakulator», to deform the Champion City in the reflection of their own follies ... and ultimately capture C. A. within hours of his release from prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men, to stop an insidious plan of Frankenstein, but with the materials at hand as the Disco Boys protect Frankenstein, the trio will need a little help. <br /> <br /> Recruiting begins, and after a painful set of games the team is in a Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), who initially only has a real talent in the team, with its mystical bowling ball, seemingly animate vengeful spirit of his deceased father ; Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who claims to be invisible when absolutely no one is looking at him; Spleen (Paul Reubens), received a mysterious powerful flatulence furious gypsy; and many underloaded Sphinx (Wes Studi), which is indicated to be able to cut in half the weapon with his mind, and then spends most of the rest of the film hitting nonsensical puzzles and effective over-wise. <br /> <br /> This film really is a cross-genre romp. Anyone who wants cloth films on neat categories of fighting a losing battle. This is a parody / spoof on the superhero genre - from pseudo-Burton sets recycled endlessly (and sometimes decorated with a large number of fake material) in ridiculous costumes, comic book genre gets a very good parody up. But at the same time, it is a serious superhero movie as well. Immediately. Although it is not necessarily a unique idea in itself (for example, the film is a kind of reflecting short-lived Inferior Five works D.C. comics), it is quite innovative for the big screen. It offers the world of comics, which requires a suspension of disbelief to accept, in any case, it throws the inevitable Wanna-BES - and we all know, when superheroes were real, so these guys really. If the Big Guy with S flying around New York, you would have seen half a dozen news about idiots in lingerie getting their examples feet on a regular basis. Of course, the fights pretty well shoveler ducks, and blue fork Raj throws with great accuracy - all part of the super-hero of the world. But does that make them real super-heroes? Only in their minds. <br /> <br /> This film is also a comedy, albeit dark. Inevitable when trying to point out the ridiculous nature of the patent super-heroics. One-liners fly like a comic genius on stage to throw many bits to play off of. Especially amazing is the dialogue of Janeane Garofalo from her bowling ball / father. However, it is not a comedy in terms of side-splitting laughter and jokes forever memorable. He mixes in a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but never really fully enterprise in any of it. <br /> <br /> What really makes a good movie Mystery Men, after all, what is a very attraction. Weak / lame good guys in the end is justified and for one shining moment, in fact, become super-heroes; fairness fed; and the film ends with a scene that is thoroughly imbued with realism (as much realism as possible, in a world where flying bowling balls and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops attempting to mark the film, the film can be large romp. <br /> <br /> Of course, no film is perfect. Claire Forlani off as a sad and unnecessary, as Mr. Furious' love interest, despite the key role as his conscience. Tom Waits, it seems, somehow confused by his lines like a mad inventor Dr. Heller, although its opening scene picking retired home in a nursing home is worth watching alone. And the villains never more than a gun-toting lackeys (paragraph which are made in the film). Cinematography impulsive and inconsistent (eg, as in the average comic book, so it's forgivable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery and special effects never sufficiently integrated into the rest very well. <br /> <br /> However, in general, this film is incredible. You will probably have to be a fan of comic books and superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest. <br /> <br /> 8/10, in my opinion.
