Observation Before the Devil is one of my best experience constantly in the movie. I was intrigued by my mixed response to the film -, the extreme views and to me indicates that the film touched on something either embraced or denied by a general audience. This is one of those films that have stayed with me, and I continue to reflect and think about it. <br /> <br /> Of course, DVD will cover some of the themes and shooting elements? Which include: the return of the film Sidney Lumet, time, technique change detailed in the narrator, an excellent combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well, masterly direction, a relatively rare focus of Hollywood movies give the male characters and basically condemned to fight to become the open checkbook for its women under the age of presents, but the performance is nonetheless resonant Marisa Tomei, and, of course, beautiful Hoffman with this central monologue about the sum of its parts - for me the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> Phew! Of course, a masterful film. So imagine my disappointment, watching the long-awaited DVD - only to find in the comments or per frame, no interviews, no additional services <br /> <br /> Hey. - distributors - sort it out!
