Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed by "Baron" with this fantasy series about the three superhuman spies who unloaded «The Six Million Dollar Man». It was my favorite when I was a teenager, and I like to watch it until now. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt was unmistakable on-screen chemistry, Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while juicy Bastedo sulked his way through her role Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nichols made a surprisingly rough Tremaine. Until now, the best episodes, written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation Brian Clemens, while Spooner own "Interrogation" compared favorably "The Prisoner." I regret that there has never been the second row; the concept has been so much life left in it. Will Craig and Richard were rivals Sharron defeats? What if Tremayne learned Champions powers? Champions know there are others than those we have seen the ability? We will never know, alas.
