Firstly, I do not know what to expect when I started the video. <br /> <br /> At any time someone brings iconic type of movie genre and adapt it to the present time, something becomes inexplicably lost in translation. <, Br /> <br /> This is not the case. This film has just begun on the right track. It's part of familiar territory, but failed to take it to the top as well. Crockzilla any stage? It has to be seen, but just try to keep a closed face. This film takes some of the old classic films cult fun and knows how to mix it easily in a modern production. It's good to see someone fills a need in the market. Very well done. <br /> <br />
