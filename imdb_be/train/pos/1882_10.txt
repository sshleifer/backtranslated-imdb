<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the most perfect movie ever made. His return to glitxy, Sterling romantic comedies 1940s..but modern touch.The writers of all with wit, charm, humor and tenderness, the cinematograpy breathtaking (New York never looked so beautiful), and, of course, have a throw! Dudley Moore is in the performance of his career as a loving drunk Arthur Bach. It is also a thoughtful and real..one of the best lines of the movie is its bitter "Not everyone who drinks a poet ... some of us drink because we're not poets." Big Sir John Gielgud won a lot of deserved Oscar for his excellent performance as Hobson, Arthur's valet and caretaker.Although he considered a "take the money and run to the role," he brings to the character all the talent, experience and bravura with expert tragidian and sly comedian. supporting cast also thisworld, by Geraldine Fitzgerald brazen Grandma Bach to ambitious mafiosi Stephen Elliott. <br /> <br /> evaluation is also very catchy and compliments the film perfectly.The only real problem with the film is bad condemned it spawned a sequel.
