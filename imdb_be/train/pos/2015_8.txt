This may not be one of the best films ever made, but overall it is a very pleasant, light-hearted piece of foam, in which all the participants seem to be having a good time. Especially recommended for its good health factor alone. OK, so Frank Sinatra "action" leaves much to be desired, but his singing is an excellent emollient and the songs fit into the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra went on to make many more movies, where his undoubted acting talent shone, but in this, his first venture into Hollywood, his voice rather than his actions, his main contribution to this film. I just watched it again on TV, and it still raises my spirits just as it was the first time I've seen it many, many years ago.
