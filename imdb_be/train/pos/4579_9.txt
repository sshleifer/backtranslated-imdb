I think that this film was reasonbaly well. It's kind of surprising that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all. I enjoyed a lot of them when they were small children on Full House. In any case, the casting was good, and the movie had several funny. I'm kind of mixed between all switching places and their names. It's just kind of an older version of It Takes Two.
