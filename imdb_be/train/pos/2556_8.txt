And he made the film as the film was good for television. acting in it, and the story was so great. it is one of the few films that I saw that I felt to deform their opinion, because after seeing it I was afraid of the reaper is going to kill me through my computer screen. There were only a few minor things wrong with this film, but it is very easily over looked. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Jr. made an outstanding role in this film, along with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. This film is just so much uncertainty, and it made me want more, because I never thought that the budget telefilm low can be so strong. After watching this, I read the novel the film was based on the (four times), and it too was great pushed. If you ever see this movie come on TV, I'd watch it. The effects in this movie were pretty well done, I honestly do not know what living calcifying people will look, but with the way the FX team has made this film, I was amazed, and all this testifies to the fact that all these bad made for television movies out there with low budgets entirely suck so bad. <br /> <br /> watch. It's really good, is not really, it is!
