This film was last week, and although at the time of the day (around 6:00 pm), the quality of movies is almost never a good (at least here in the Mexican TV), I could not turn off the TV. The story of Madelene Moore really touches you. She does not come across as a very nice character at first, but seeing the whole movie, you just want it to be like this. This movie really leaves you thinking. And I think that is mainly because of the large steps Brooke Johnson. I've never heard of it before, and no wonder seeing her in another movie, but it was great to great effect. Compliments to Brooke. I hope that I would see her in another movie in the near future.
