Double Exposure was a huge surprise. It contains outstanding performances (particularly by Callan undervalued), thin film and a compelling storyline. In other words, it is one of the most outstanding efforts of the horrors that have emerged since the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Callan plays a fashion photographer who feels dreams of murdering his models at the time when he was reunited with his brother mentally unstable (which happens to be lacking arms and legs). If Callan model dreams of murder actually be dead, the photographer begins to doubt sober ... but there's more to the picture than he sees. <br /> <br /> This film never got it deserves praise. Most critics and filmgoers fells him with a horde of slasher films released at the same time, but he stands high above the bulk of this sad lot. This is a reasonable and unique, which is not something that you can comfortably be said of most films of this genre, but it is also strongly developed and implemented. Double Exposure is a gem of its kind.
