Hole, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, have been successfully transformed into a fascinating and well-made film. Starring Sigourney Weaver as an overseer, Shia LaBeouf as Stanley and Cleo Thomas as the Zero, the roles were well cast and the actors portrayed their roles well. <br /> <br /> The film was weaving between storylines that all led up to the end. The main story of Stanley Yelnats and his punishment by spending half a year in Camp Greenlake. The second story of Sam and Kate Barlow. This section deals with racism, and it is a deeper story line in the movie. Thirdly, about Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, explaining the 100 years of the curse on the family Yelnats. In my opinion, these storylines were woven together very well. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the belief of many people, I think you do not have to read the book to understand the movie. The film is fairly easy to understand. <br /> <br /> action in the film was well done, especially Shia LaBeouf (Stanley) Cleo Thomas (zero), Sigourney Weaver (caretaker) and Jon Voight (Mr. Sir). Other members of D-Tent, Jake Smith (the Squid), Max Kash (zig-zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (armpits) and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray), enhance the comic movie, however, the best part It was with zero and Stanley, who made a great team. <br /> <br /> Although this Disney film Holes, he has to deal with some serious problems, such as racism, shootings and violence. a dramatization of the film in some places very well done. <br /> <br /> I would suggest this movie for people of all ages, regardless of whether they have read the book or not. You should not miss it.
