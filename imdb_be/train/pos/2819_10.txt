This film bufoonery! and I loved it! "Dragon LordÂ» (Jacky Chan) and his friend, "cowboy", completely made the film fun, meaningful, and just stupid. The film is a rare combination of good fight against evil and (i) signs and fun, which grows up. Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young "dragon lord" (so named because he was the son of a wealthy family) and "Cowboy", which include the implementation of intelligent, sophisticated ways to avoid studying (with the help of all household , including the teacher), competing in a rather boyish (and idiotically interesting) ways to get the favor of the local girls, competing in the "football" (you'll see what I mean), and the list goes on. Somehow, they find themselves in the thick of the battle to keep the party valuable antiques and the lives of several people. <br /> <br /> The film has its serious moments. But they do not oppress, and inspire. Liveliness boys, entirely lost in this exchange, but in fact used against evil. What I really liked about this movie is how it ends. Nha typical confrontation (which in itself was strange), but well, you'll see. Let me say that it really captures the spirit of the film. <br /> <br /> silly, witty, informative and nostalgic. great movie.
