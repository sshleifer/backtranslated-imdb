I bellied up to the bar, waiting to see what this hot sultry day in the beer of Texas, but was pleasantly surprised. After suffering through a Â«Saturday Night Folly," I had no desire to meet again to make in some south Texas animal .... and I did not. John Revolta was good as jealous beast, Scott Glenn was well cast as thuggie ex-con, and Debra Winger as always delight. * Love * Plus is a woman, the soundtrack was a dynamite [and this is from a guy who can not stand the sound of the music of country]. Interesting film all the way.
