Although the style of the film is not understated and realistic, as the sound version, would be likely, this is still a very good film. In fact, it was regarded as an outstanding film in his time, he was promoted to the first Oskara` (losing WINGS). I still think the wing to be above the film, but this just fine, despite a little overplayed on lead, Jannings. <br /> <br /> Jannings at all of tsarist Russia, living out its last days of making a few bucks in the 1920s, as a Hollywood extra. His luck seems to have changed as it gets casting - play Russian imperial common fight against the communists during the revolution. Naturally, this is not a big part of the continuation of the wise, but he also gets old to think about the old times and the revolution. <br /> <br /> This is what happens next, I leave with you, but it's a very good film - especially at the end. By the way, note the William Powell as a Russian director. While what has been done in 1928, with cosmetics, he does not look much younger than him in many of his subsequent films.
