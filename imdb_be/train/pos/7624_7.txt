Quite a memorable film about a variety of animals slaughtered people, in particular, like "Willard" that stars aging character actor (in this case, step down a bit to the level of Les Tremayne, who puts in a distinguished only performance I've seen him give) in the role of man, whose life is unbalanced, and who subsequently decides to use their other animals to take revenge on those who wronged him. Yes, this is one of those movies where pretty much all mean, so that you will be hurt, when they die, and in fact, the choice of actors, locations, etc., could not be better, giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadence. <br /> <br /> nature of Tremaine is the "Snake Bender," and he, of course, the most interesting of the film: the age of the snake collector who receive the music of John Philip Souza in. If the local preacher clamps down on their practice of collecting small animals from local school children as bait for their snakes, and his friend is getting married to a stripper (breaking his ritual Wednesday night band concert), he goes on a spit in the process of creating a memorable piling clunkers under a rock, where he dumps the debris after getting rid of their unfortunate owners. One fun game you can play while watching "Snakes" to bet on which car to land further down the cliff. <br /> <br /> In general, very cheap and exploitative, but it really is a lot of fun for fans of these types of films.
