Bored with normal staple mediocre movies to watch this Halloween, I've seen time and time again, I took a chance on the "Watchdog", hoping that he could get my juices flowing horror again. Mind you, I had just returned from seeing the Dark Castle remake of "House on the Hill Haunted" - a complete and utter crap. Fortunately, the "Guardian" blew me away! In riviting story of a model who moves to a spooky house in Brooklyn Heights, the film offered all that I hope to find a good movie - (1) Campy and fantasically juicy character, exchanges and dialogue, including hilaraious turns Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and especially, Martin balsam, as absent-minded professor - (2) a monstrous terror! Do not give away the frame, but there is a scene in this movie that chilled me to the pancreas - (3) Fantastic Gore, stunning makeup and silly (if very rough) direction of Michael Winner, which flows quite well with this impossible to treat. If you loved "Evil Dead 2», «Dead Alive» and «Deep Rising» - it will be your queen pets. Just to emphasize his love for this film - after I watched it for the first time, his jaw dropped, I rewound it and watched it again. Currently, one of the favorites of all time. Do yourself a favor and check it out!
