Why was it not released? I kind of thought it would be a bit rubbish, since he was not. How wrong a girl can be! This film is, in a word, fascinating. <br /> <br /> You will be enchanted. He holds your attention from the start, and his pace never slows. <br /> <br /> In the final part of the movie, "Scene", as it was (without giving anything away, you saw in the trailer) is also not to be missed. You have chosen the favorite, you're in shock, you can not go and make a cup of coffee, because you need to find out what happens. Adrenaline rises, and you can not look. Cudos to the actors, it is very plausible. And do not stop there, they have the ultimate shock to you. <br /> <br /> It also makes you question the reality show, and if you watch. And how far from it we, really? Endemol (which makes a big brother) of a TV show in the Netherlands last year, offering a kidney to a dying patient in need of transplant. Shaw was found at the end of a hoax, supposedly to raise awareness about organ donation, but we are too close for comfort?
