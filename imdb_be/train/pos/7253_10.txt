Not sure you can call it anti-war film, it shows at the elite level the war. These elite troops, who know what they do and are proud of it. Even if they are a pacifist, they still use the skill level and defeat your enemies, even if it goes against the order to be a pacifist. Movies slowly and quite calmly and in many ways is fairly tame, like war films are-more so today's standards, no body parts flying off as the sun in contemporary films. It's brutal in other ways, though, as you can see, the killing on a personal level. It's more of a thinking man movie. Once you start watching, you do not want to miss anything. I thought the man in the film and their interaction, is that the film is not the fight itself o- or large gripping storyline. It could be called a war Triller. <br /> <br /> If you are in the art of war, when you read or see on the SAS program, and so on, you want to see this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> Comparable film The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49th Parallel (1941) with an all-star cast, The Naked and the Dead (1958), with Cliff Robertson. All unusual in its own way and to show the war on a personal level. Enjoy!
