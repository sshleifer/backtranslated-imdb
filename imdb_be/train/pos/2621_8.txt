Disney has done it again. A brilliant way to Timone and Pumba back to life once more to say about how they came to meet and help Simba when he needed them. I love this movie and watch it again and again. It shows how Timone lived with his family and other meerkats, before heading out to find their dream home and adventure. Then he meets FUIB and things change. Together, they are looking for in a house Timon wants and repeatedly failed to state that it is ridiculous as Timone is becoming more and more crazy. Simba then turns up, and we see more of his childhood, than we did in the previous two films. The rest you already know.
