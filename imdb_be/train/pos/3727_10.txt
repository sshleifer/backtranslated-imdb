Tigerland is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and, in my opinion, even ahead of the full metal jacket, a film of a similar nature. Bozz is playing exceptionally well Farrell, and the character that stays in your mind long after the film ends. Ending brilliant cut Schumacher - with melodic harmony singing and slow mo troops preparing to leave. What movie.
