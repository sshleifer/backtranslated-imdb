IQ, in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, funny and romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was really dumb guy. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) is more suitable for Catherine (Meg Ryan), than James was. Anyway, all who will be involved in this film did absolutely excellent job. Now, in conclusion, I would highly recommend this sweet, magic and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any fan of Tim Robbins and Meg Ryan, who has not seen it. You're in for a lot of laughter, so go to the video store to rent or buy, kick back with a friend and watch it.
