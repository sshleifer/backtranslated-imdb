This film was for a while in my collection, but it was not until my friend reminded me about this ?? until I decided that I should look. I do not know much about Close to Leo ?? just that he was supposed to be a great way out of age movie, and it deals with a very serious topic ?? AIDS. <br /> <br /> While the person who has the money ?? Leo ?? script wraps the way in which Marcel (youngest brother Leo) coup√©s with the illness of a relative. At first, all trying to hide the truth from Marseille ?? He is believed to be too young to understand the disease of his brother ?? the fact that Leo also contributes to the reluctance of gay parents do Discus with the young Marcel. I know from experience that in many cases, the majority of older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young it does not automatically mean that he can not accept reality and act more adequately, even himself. Except for the fact that the family tried to hide the truth from Marseille, they left a strong impression for me ?? how they supported their son ?? even after the truth about his sexuality and his illness. The fact that they allowed the young Marcel travel with Leo to Paris to meet with his former boyfriend was quite a gesture from them ?? most families I know, will be reluctant to do. There is a lot of heat in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together ?? You can see them to be true friends, caring for each other. <br /> <br /> Close to Leo's great drama, which I highly recommend
