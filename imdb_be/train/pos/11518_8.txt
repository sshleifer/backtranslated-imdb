You can do a lot with a small amount of money. Blair Witch proved. This film supports it. This is nothing more than sitcoms length and complexity. However, because it is John Cleese, like Sherlock Holmes, he manages to be fun, even on a budget who can not afford the lace. The highlight of the film Arthur Lowe as sincere, awkward Watson, its dimness and slow film irascible wit Cleese in. If you ever run across a movie to watch for the freaky laugh or two.
