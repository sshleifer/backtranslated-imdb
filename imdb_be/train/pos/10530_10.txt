What a wonderful movie ... <br /> <br /> Accompanied by Oscar-winner gorgeous, emotional and dreamy music composer Rachel Portman, the film is a pure delight worth watching more than once a year. <br /> <br /> The incredible casting ... <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect for the role of Emma. Toni Collette was great as Harriet Smith. <br /> <br /> character who stole the film was MISS BATES !!! It is fascinating to watch, you can find yourself on the edge of the seat bitwise just hanging on her every word and laugh hysterically at her. One of the most endearing characters I've encountered in ages. With one of the opening scenes, when she thanked Mr. Woodhouse to send "that beautiful doe-quarter of pork ... Pork MAMA !!!" she shouts in her kooky and clearly people with hearing-impaired mother, Mrs Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Law) who looks miserable and lost. <br /> <br /> comic way that Emma avoid gratings Miss Bates is building itself on one really turns the scene into a picnic, when Emma insults Miss Bates, who takes her to dig into her evil heart. Then we see poor Miss Bates stuttering and on the verge of tears and just crushed one can not help but feel your heart ripped out her on her behalf. It's the classic scene, one will be rewound and played more and more ... <br /> <br /> The ending is right up there with «Sense & Sensibility» and provides one of the biggest life lessons about how to marry your best friend. .. <br /> <br /> I hope that this film carries you all in the same way as it does itself. <br /> <br /> I loved it!
