As I said at the top, four stars is just not enough. This is one of the best films I've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life. For people who do not really like or understand it, you do not have a real appreciation for art, or you could have a short attention span. <br /> <br /> Even if I had not seen all of his films nevertheless, I must say that this is Spielberg at his peak. It is very sad to see that movie, as big as «The Color Purple» do not come too often, because I think that we are all in desperate need of a first-class movie entertainment in these difficult times. <br /> <br /> Movies like this is more than just a movie; they are works of art that should be evaluated more. <br /> <br /> The idea that he was nominated for 11 Oscars (even the best film of the year) and did not get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can be sometimes. Spielberg was not even nominated for Best Director! He should have swept the Oscars this year. <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows how unfair life for some people. <br /> <br /> If only the movies even it is good ....
