«CASOMAI» was the last movie that I had seen before to get married just last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first film that I was looking for, after I got married, because we promised to provide a copy of our priest. <br /> <br /> Sometimes reality is not so in addition to fiction. To all those who wrote that the priests, as "Don Camillo" does not exist in real life, I would recommend them to visit my Priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> For the rest, I would only recommend them to see this movie before and after 'I' day :-) <br / > <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
