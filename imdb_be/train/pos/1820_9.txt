I remember this movie from when I was a little kid, I loved it then and I still do now. I managed to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday and was more than delighted, because I found it so hard to find him before, and he rented out only when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie, because he learns to be a good dog. The film is filled with fun songs and music. The animation is brilliant, and the voice of the characters is perfect. This film has always been sentimental for me, but I think that if I had not seen the film, when I was a kid, I would not have found as brilliant and exciting, as I do, but I still believe I have to still I like it because I'm really into animated films.
