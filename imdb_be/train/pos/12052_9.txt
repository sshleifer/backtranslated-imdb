I saw it on television, so long ago that I can not remember when it was, but it still stands out as one of the most terrible, the most unnerving movies I have ever seen. There is both subtle yet intense fear induced by the woman in black lurking on the edge of the frame, it is not clearly visible, so that you feel (as an attorney character), not knowing whether it's just a fantasy or not. It is also one of the few films that really made me scared to keep watching. "Value of production" to be hanged, good movies about the director's ability to create an atmosphere with the help of the film, the actors, the place / sets, music, attention to detail and ... the view. A real jewel.
