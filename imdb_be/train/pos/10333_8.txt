It was a great small American propaganda film, which is both very creative and openly discuss the Nazi atrocities were revealed to the entire duration of the death camps. While at the end of 1944 and in 1945 will open just as evil and horrible as they are, this film, unlike other Hollywood films to date, is the most honest movie I have seen the era of Nazi atrocities. <br /> <br /> film begins in a courtroom in the future - after the war is over (the film was made in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fictitious world court, the Nazi leader on trial for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm fully repents and one-on-one witness is called, depicting the life of Grimm in 1919 in a series of flashbacks. Firstly, it appears that the film will be pretty or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis. However, after some time, it becomes very obvious that Grimm simply sadistic monster. These episodes are surprisingly well made, and will certainly hold your interest and make the movie seem less like a piece of propaganda, but a legal drama. <br /> <br /> In general, the film does a great job, considering the film mainly stars of the second-tier actors. There are many compelling scenes and speeches - especially the very prophetic Jewish extermination scene to the end, he could not help but bring you close to tears. It was also interesting is around the same point in the film were some super-creative scene that use the crosses so that you may not notice at first. Overall, this is a must-see for history buffs and anyone who wants to see a good film <br /> <br /> FYI -. This does not mean, as a serious film criticism, but Hitler was referred to as "the paper hanger" This is a reference to the myth that Hitler once made money putting up wallpaper This is actually not true -.. Before he was "starving artist" , homeless and well served in the German army in the First world war. Terrible face, yes, but not paper hanger!
