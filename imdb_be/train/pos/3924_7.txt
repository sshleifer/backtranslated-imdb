It is one thousand nine hundred thirty-nine film directed by John Ford and writer Lamar Trotta tells the fictional story of a young lawyer, Abraham Lincoln, his ordeal (literally) and its burdens. This is a sentimental film, fairly well done, but hardly breathtaking. Casting Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems to be a mistake, for while the actor was right for the quality of the boring, even with a few inches of make-up and false nose, it is too beautiful for Honest Abe, who was successfully tatty. This is a good attempt from the Fund, which is nothing if not sincere, but his miscasting throws off the whole movie. The supporting cast is excellent, although it includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford Lincoln too deferential in circulation, which is represented as just shy of the saint, and in the final scene of the film goes way above.
