This show, without a doubt, one of the biggest show ever to be on television. I mean, whichever is greater, suspense, drama, comedy, it has everything, and with such a simple story: the plane crashed on the island. The characters are great and Evangeline Lilly HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows us that he is a great actor, Josh Holloway is so great, Jorge Garcia fun, I could go on and on. In addition, unexpected plot twists, back stories of characters, the music, which is at the end of each episode. JJ Abrahms proved once again that outstanding writer and producer he is. I mean, it's better than the ALIAS is, and I loved ALIAS. Those who do not watch the show, definitely worth to consider getting a DVD, and watch it, because they produce something great. This show might be the best show in the history of television !!
