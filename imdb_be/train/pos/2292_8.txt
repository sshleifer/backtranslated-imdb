Just watched this early Bugs Bunny (the first time it is called here) and Elmer Fudd cartoons on ThadBlog as those associated with YouTube. It was Chuck Jones first time directing "wascally Wabbit" and, as a consequence, Bugs has a different voice, provided by Mel Blanc, than the Brooklyn / Bronx one we know more. In fact, according to Thad, he Channeling Jimmy Stewart (his "shy boy" personality type of the time). Anyway, after Elmer buys his favorite, Bugs is all bad at it, turning the radio very loudly, pretending to die after his boss repeatedly throws him out of the shower, and saying, "Turn off the lights!" every time Elmer catches him in his bed. Even with a different voice, Bugs, of course, his mischievous self and I laughed myself in blue all the time! According to Tada, there is an additional scene in the late Elmer Bugs just letting the house after the hell he went through, but it is probably considered to be too boring, because he suffers from a mental disorder at that point, so it's just as well that lost Scene . Anyway, I highly recommend the rabbit Elmer.
