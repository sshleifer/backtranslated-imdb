As a prototype of the classic Errol Flynn adventure movie and that have a good history, as well as two more brilliant co-stars in the Maureen O'Hara (that exquisite beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can only recommend this film to all those with even the smallest sympathy for romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hollywood at its best!
