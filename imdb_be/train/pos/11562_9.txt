I just can not get over how brilliant pairing Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. It's like the movie did not even need the extra characters, because you never get tired of dialogue between the two. <br /> <br /> Lemmon was in several well-known films as Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau was fresh off his Oscar win in the Fortune Cookie (other Billy Wilder film also Lemmon). This particular film was not as great as this, because history can not withstand such a long time (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, it is in a short hour and a half, even though the introduction of the events that led to the ending of the apartment Lemmon Matthau is a bit long (it was this sentence). This is a minor quibble, though, and for the rest of the time the work you have a marvelous time. <br /> <br /> I already wrote a commentary on how next to this film sucked and I will not go into it. The reason why this is such a joy it is likely that the film was made in the same way as the innocence of American films begin to fade quickly into oblivion. There are some sexual references, but they are dealing with such an innocent way that you could not even get a "Well, I never ..." from the most prudish person there. It's kind of fun to watch a movie with a long-forgotten era, and that was probably why the continuation does not work because you were Matthau and Lemmon say a lot of words and a diaphragm does not fit them. <, Br /> <br /> known, now they are both gone, and you can just be happy that you can enjoy them in a beautiful film like this. I think the only male actor in this film, which is still alive, John Fiedler. Edelman has recently died. So there you have it. Simply one of the best comedies and movies ever <br /> <br /> Add :. I only recently learned that John Fiedler died so all fans of it, I am deeply sorry. I did not mean any disrespect, and I will try to be more careful, I l blahing next time.
