As mentioned, all the women who go naked in this movie basically is absolutely gorgeous. The plot is very cleverly reveals the hypocrisy of the female libido. When people are around, they want to be haunted, but if there is no "men" are not around, they become persecutors of the 14-year-old boy. And the boy becomes a man very quickly (we should all be so lucky at this age!). Then he gets up the courage to pursue his true love.
