I found this film to be very funny, I loved how he made of Policy modern sports. This movie is not as funny as South Park, but it's pretty funny. And since I'm a fan of the sport, I loved how they made fun of some of the more ridiculous things in the sport. This film is ideal for lovers of non-sports too, probably better for them actually, as they have to go through life wondering why people go to a sports event so close, when there are so many crazy rules and subtleties the sport and the fact that it means absolutely nothing. I also found that the actual game they invented to be interesting, it's kind of like a horse with the basics and mentality outputs (for shooting people). Overall, I highly recommend you see this movie, and believe that you will end up like this film. However, if this style of comedy is not your favorite, you probably will not like it. (But with some comedy)
