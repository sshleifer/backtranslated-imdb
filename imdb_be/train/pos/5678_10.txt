We could use Black Adder, even today. Imagine Rowan Atkinson restoring the role of the assistant of the Prime Minister plays a great Hugh Laurie. Hugh sensational, like a fool, Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant. I love the episode, Kenneth Connor Guest stars like the British theater. Every time Edmund says Macbeth. Two thespians do silly little act to ward off evil spirits. These are the most interesting things that you will see. Of course, none of this brilliance and comedic genius can not be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, who is also behind films like Love Actually, The Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and a Funeral. Black Adder funny and too good for television. Humor can be a smart, sexy, and funny all in one. I had hoped that last night on Saturday Night Live that Laurie would honor his background in the British humor. If the gang on SNL did some research, they will know what a treasure it was to have a Hugh Laurie decorate their stage.
