All dogs go to heaven is on par with Watership Down for kids scary movies. Both were dark and rather sinister, but at the same time the most fascinating experiences a child can have. It was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I was in love with Charlie, and at the tender age of about five or six years, I admit ... I was in love with a cartoon dog. All dogs tell the dark story of sweet cad Charlie and his accomplice Tickling. The story begins with Charlie escapes from death row and snobby to the nearest club to do some gambling. Of course, as a child I did not understand the concept of the film. I loved the songs and animation, but as I got older, I am starting to wonder why I was not disturbed by this film as a youngster. It deals with a rather adult themes --- play gambling, murder, hell and prisons, but in the world of sweets Disney movie, is that every child should watch out for once. <br /> <br /> Yes, there's some crazy transvestite crocodile scenes and hellish scenes frighten me more now, when I was little, but it gives a sharp message that should not be ignored by parents!
