This is one of the best films Jodie Foster there and largely ignored because of the misconception the public about it, as a teenage movie. It has excellent performance, in particular, to the scene of battle between Jodi and her mother, played by Sally Kellerman convincing. Three girls who play each Jody few amateurish, but I think it's worth a look.
