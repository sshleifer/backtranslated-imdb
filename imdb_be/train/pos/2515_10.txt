Moon Child, starring Japanese rocker Gackt and Hyde, was a better film than I expected. In fact, I was very impressed, and it immediately became one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> Set in Mallepa, the story of a group of street orphans, Shaw, Shaw brother Shinji and Toshio, who rob and murder to make a living. On one of the robberies, Sho meets Kei vampire Hyde burning in the sunlight. After a rough events of the true nature of Kay's Set, but no one does not avoid it. <br /> <br /> Time passes, and means that the immortal, never change Kei raised Shaw, and two of my very close relationship. Sho and Kei then faced with the Son in the hideous combat weapons, and they become friends quickly. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with the sister of the Son, Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time jumps forward again and shows Shaw grown, this time void of Kei. It also explains that Shaw and son became enemies. <br /> <br /> After the tragedy after tragedy, this film dives into real life, and all the difficulties, focusing on friendship and love. It really is a touching film that is sad but beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> As for the action, I think Gackt has done an excellent job. Hyde did an amazing job for a first timer. <br /> <br /> Arrows were excellent, but the film is so, it is rare and short terrible shots. <br /> <br /> In general, I must say, this film amazing, moving, and I highly recommend it.
