This film is, without a doubt, a perfect 10/10 .. for all you people out there who appreciate this film low marks because he does not have "a good story" or something like that, it would be ridiculous, saying that the film Jackie Chan is bad because of the story, says porn movie bad because it has no plot! You see Jackie Chan to fight SCENE, for his actions are not so much focused on the good story or something like that, if you look at the way he makes movies, and compare it with other American films from that era and even later you will understand that the films of Jackie Chan fights were over the top scenes and not so good sites while American films had good stories, but crappy scenes compared with what does Jackie Chan at the time. Porn look at porn, Jackie Chan watched the action, I think you people are rating it bad, because there is no story, because you think, how to evaluate a good movie smart movie critic, but as I see it is a good movie it is a film that can keep me entertained. Of course, in the middle of the movie it was sad, very sad, but the rest, so to speak, that all scenes and stunts, do pay a lot for it all. It really changed the way, as the American fighters have been created, they have even Stollen scene from this film. If you want a true man, a true artist, then watch this movie and more with Jackie Chan HES clean in all respects. He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park, and even in today's films. American films belong as much on special effects and safety wires and understudy, and many others. Police Story and many other films of Jackie Chan are the parts of the work of the true artist, who just goes all out and very talented at what he can do. masterpiece
