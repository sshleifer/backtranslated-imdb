It is rare to see a film as flawless as it is. This is truly one of the best acted, most highly structured films I've ever seen. Each line of dialogue could be interpreted in different ways, that applies to each of the three main characters in different ways. The film weaves the internal network of motivations and double crosses that Snare you and refuse to let go. Add to this that the slow-burning romance between Kevin and Faye both moves, as well as all that has ever been committed to celluloid, and you have the ingredients for a perfect film. This exposes the romance of films like "Titanic" as the hackneyed clich√©s they are. If you are looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry, it is not. You must dedicate yourself this film. You can not have a conversation while working in and out of the room. This movie requires your attention. Treat it with the respect you deserve, and you will get a lot out of it. If you think, "Titanic," the greatest movie ever.
