I loved this show, leaving the republic! The story was one of the best I have ever seen! Even tough, the image quality was not the best, but good. Fencing in this series, too, a little bad, but not terrible. They just need to practice some more. As I said, the story GREAT! You just sit there and wait to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is great! This is the same guy who's maid of music for a version of Walt Disney Zorro, which the maid music Fightin Legion. The costumes and the building is very good. Zorro is really cool and so are legions! I highly recommend this show. Buy! <br /> <br /> I like that Reed Hadley plays Zorro! He's funny, smart and bold! Manufacturer: 6.
