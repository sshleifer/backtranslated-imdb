Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio contract and went to Hollywood. He remains in Hollywwod Hotel (of course). At the same time the big star of selfish Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has a tantrum and refused to attend the premiere of his new image. In a panic, the studio hires counterparts Virginia (Rosemary Lane), to impersonate her and Bowers to take her to the premiere did not tell him that it's not Marshall. Of course, they fall in love. You can pretty much figure out the rest of the story on their own. <br /> <br /> The plot is old (to put it nicely), but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very cute couple and have beautiful voices singing. Rank well (emphasis Â«Hooray for Hollywood") and directed by Busby Berkeley, demonstrates its unique visual effects really fun drive in the musical sequences (with Edgar Kennedy makes his patented slow burn). Glenda Farrell as a few funny bits like Monas Sister Jonesie. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not so good. The rest of the cast mugs fierce and much of the humor is simply not funny. Lola Lane particularly nasty just trying to play mono for comedy. Also there is racism - stereotypical black maid is played for laughs, and there are some really horrific racist "humor" at one point. This is probably what keeps it away from the TV most of the time. I understand that it was decided at the time, but it is perceived as disgusting today. <br /> <br /> In general, so-so movie with some serious problems have helped a good cast and some great songs. I give it a 7.
