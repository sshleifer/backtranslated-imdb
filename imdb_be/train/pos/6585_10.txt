After watching the Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should never show such a conceit to imagine that it could ever come close to the image of Mr. Brett, "one of the most interesting characters in literature." Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes, and, in my opinion, there can be no other. Great actor Basil Rathbone, I must admit, a close second, but still the second. One could make the argument that Mr. Rathbone scenarios were worse absolutely the best performances of expression granted Mr. Brett, and before that, I would agree. However, when all is said and done, Jeremy Brett always and forever will be the only actor, really "become" Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this subject, and we, the audience, were left to enjoy the unique Mr.Brett performances. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
