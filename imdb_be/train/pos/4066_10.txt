Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), more than any of the films of Hayao Miyazaki, the narrator brings joy to the audience. This is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again; it's just magical. It is a crime that he took this long to be released in the States, but now that he's here to check it out! And stick to the original language; dub changed my impression of several characters, something that should be avoided at all costs, in the translation of the movie (or book, whatever.) <br /> <br /> I give him ten / ten.
