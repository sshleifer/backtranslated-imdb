I think, Dark Angel is great! The first season was great and was a good story. With Max (Jessica Alba), as the runaway X-5, the creation of Manticore, trying to adjust to a normal life, but still "save the world". Manticore and hunting throughout the season, which gives a range of some extra spice. <br /> <br /> The second season, but suddenly felt a little strange compared to the first. The plot is a sort of disappeared, and some lost a bit of the charm of it, mainly because of all the strange beings "" are. Do not get me wrong, the second season is good, but a little to the majority of "Manticore". Nevertheless, they managed to get back on a promising new plot in the final episode of season 2, in which I had a lot of hope to see more. <br /> <br /> So what I really want, so they can start making new episodes. And with James Cameron for this he can not go wrong. Since closing, I would like to say that this is a great series, but I still hope for a third season!
