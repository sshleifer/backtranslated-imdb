Story "The Woman with the Past" is fairly simple and largely adapted directly from Eastwood spaghetti westerns: A mysterious stranger arrives in the lawless city, which is headed by kingpin and starts shooting up the place. Even the opening credits and the music that spaghetti feel: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. Really interesting twists that beautiful stranger (!) Female, Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on of Harley, and location in the city, somewhere in Japan. <br /> <br /> In this action film, there is a significant amount of gunfire, some of them good, some predictable, and other stains somewhat sentimental, but it's a lot of fun. Ryoko treats it with the gun credibility and aplomb and gives tribute to the thugs. It was not so much acting challenge for her, as it was a physical problem, but she handled things very well. It is much more like Otsu shows his acting skills in the drama of NHK, «Musashi." <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend the movie, if you're a fan Ryoko Yonekura (which I love, I) and / or "girl guns" film fan and it holds up to repeat views. For me, there is something in the highest degree and inexplicably attractive "girls with guns" films as «La Femme Nikita» and «The Long Kiss Goodnight." And have a wonderful gal like Ryoko starring in it, just a lot of icing on the cake.
