My friend recommended this film, referring to his vocal and Flexion resemblance to De howling, the protagonist of the film. I believe that to the extent that I can see that and maybe a bit more, I'm not sure whether that image is commendable. <br /> <br /> This is a rather unique work, the only film to which it may have a moving similarity is True Romance, and not for the content or shooting style or tempo of communication (Whale Music, it's just so much more, well, relaxed.) But instead of that they are both modern love stories. <br /> <br /> In general, I'm a big fan of Canadian films about music and musicians (for example, I would highly recommend Hard Core Logo) and this film in particular. He has an innocent charm that Des is not always the likeably guy, but there's something about him that attracted sterling kind of empathy.
