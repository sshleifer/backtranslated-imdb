Here's what I know about the "Atlantis" before watching it: <br /> <br /> * - This is officially the first animated sci-fi adventure from Disney. I'm not sure how well that (I love to nitpick), but it made me curious is the first time I've heard it described <br /> <br /> *. - Preview of the species, for the most part, pretty darn cool. Obviously, it was also "very mysterious" according to some critics after the fact <br /> <br /> *. - It was, perhaps, so much that Disney said, "Screw it, let's reissue" Spy Kids »<br /> <br /> So, with all that said, how this movie <br /> <.? br /> Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I youngsters for an animation fantasy, which includes the mixing of music and unbridled special effects in one way or another, "Atlantis" out of them all. This is the return of all CGI eye candy shots in "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", so it's almost effects animator Best-of Show. The symbols may not be as memorable (except, perhaps, a medical ship employees), and yuzhet a little sad, but this is not a movie that you watch the story. <br /> <br /> This is a contradiction that worries me. "failure" (as it's "only" took like five hundred million or something, I know animators who would kill to see fifteen dollars of it) of the film in comparison with the popular "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc." was seen as evidence of the traditional animation of death. I do not think that's true. How do you explain the film «South Park»? And what about the "Final Fantasy"? Indeed, the history and art have all, not the method. I do not know that the return of Disney movie will be like, but I do not think they have a picture yet.
