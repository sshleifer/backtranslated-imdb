I love the TV show. the first time was hooked when I saw him. I wish I was there to act with them. This applies to reality, when you love someone and you think you want to spend the rest of my life with, then the turn of events that you meet someone else, and that the more people who you want to be. You are in a situation were you have to choose one or the other. Someone is going to get hurt, there's no stopping it. Decision-making is difficult, but you want to continue to be unhappy if you might be. Why go on and live the life that you thought that you would like or think that you are doing it right, and you're both miserable. This other person will not wait for the waiting time of life, they have a good life. Deciding that you really want to be better in the end. Creating the best of what you have is a good thing is good. Money, cars, houses, etc. .... do not make you happy, having one person that you really want to be with, to share it with is doing.
