It was a really great movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the entire baseball team. Jay Hernandez also very nice actor who is very nice to look at. Chemistry team was once they got together was exciting, it just goes to show you what can be achieved when minds come together as one with one goal. This team has returned from the brink of having multiple loss of the season to win almost all. I love movies like this, they are actually very inspiring. <br /> <br /> In addition, the character of Dennis Quaid to get a place in the top league. Nothing you can do, but the root of this guy to do. It just seems that if someone has to do something, they're going to do it. Things just happen to fall into place, and does everything click. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, this film does make you think about the fact that "nothing is impossible."
