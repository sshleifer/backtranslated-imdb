The main reason I wanted to see this film was because of the excellent cast. A ton of my favorite actors in one film still striking to actually see. But this film took me by surprise. It was not what I expected at all. It's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember that I could not stop laughing !!! And it was not just acting, that did it for me. The screenplay was written by surprise. Every time when you expect something to happen, did not happen. There were so many twists and turns, but it fits the whole tone of the film, and not looking as pretentious. Cinematography, along with many, it was absolutely beautiful, as well. I really can not say anything bad to say about this film! Expcept, I would be pleased at Andrew a little more time on the screen!
