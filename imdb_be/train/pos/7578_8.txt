Katz, who played a blind swordsman "Dato" A total of 27 films is crowning the trilogy Hanzo with this wonderful film in which he gets to make love to a ghost, Mako Midori ~ d (Blind Beast). <br /> <br /> a large regiment, often used in the pursuit of justice, forever extinguished. <br /> <br /> Katsu was his usual arrogant self, it persecuted those who would steal from the treasury to lend in usury quantities to those who can not afford to pay. <br /> <br /> in the usual strange fencing and skill big guy he was present, along with the blood. <br /> <br /> I'm going to miss him.
