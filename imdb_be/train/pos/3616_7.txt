Casting unknown Michelle Rodriguez as Diana was brilliant. It is perfect. Her acting inexperience actually works in its favor. We have never seen it before, so it really feels like its history. It also brings through a real strength. This works against it, though, because we had it, and I do not doubt. You should never be rooting for it to win, because it never goes against any fighter, we do not think she can win. Since boxing movie, it crashes. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it really is not a boxing movie. How to make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer who is not a boxing movie? You do not. But Karyn Kusama there anyway. Like many indie films, «Girlfight» defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore, which can darn about to happen in real life. <br /> <br /> Diane doing poorly in school. It confuses people she does not like (all the other girls in her school, for example). It does not fit. Her father makes her younger brother Tiny learn to box so that he could defend themselves when the going gets tough. He gives the money to his tiny boxing session and does not give anything Diana, as if she has no need to defend himself nor anything worthwhile to make her life. Little wants to go to art school (cliche 'stuff), so he gives his boxing allowance Diana, who really wants to box. Things get complicated when Diana fell in love with another boxer Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who is looking to become a professional. From there the story is winding down for the inevitable ... the two meet in the amateur title fight. <br /> <br /> That left me cold, I did not find any of it all that interesting. It's just a little too plausible. Children with tough life growing in the harsh urban areas are falling back to the sport. Many professional boxers climbed out of these circumstances. Mental and physical training it requires firmness lends itself to games like boxing, where your friend is angry. And this time a girl. Think <br /> <br /> There is another position to take:. Finally, the boxing movie about a girl. Women's boxing has been around for a long time. Cruelty we usually see in boxing movies is replaced here by a discussion of their lives and their feelings. The whole battle thing is used as a platform from which to draw the big picture. Respect. Overcoming adversity. Self-knowledge. <br /> <br /> I recommend «Girlfight», because he has a good spirit and is an example of the excellent work of the first director of the time. Conversation never rises above the quality of the soap opera, but the story itself really changed my opinion on certain things. Yes, the world now seems to be the best place. The film made it <br /> <br /> Class :. B-
