Two sniper to travel deep into the jungle in search of their goals; slimy American drug lord and visible whole. <br /> <br /> moderate success in building a wistful atmosphere Sniper by most accounts a very solid thriller, taking this time setting its characters and their plight, and finished in some good action sequences. Director Llosa is not always successful in maintaining a gloomy mood and can be tightened several history; some workarounds here is not to add to much. But this film is much better than Stallone / Stone parody specialist. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane usually incredibly tedious, does amazingly well, as an inexperienced Sniper teamed with veteran Beranger. As for Berenger this film proved to be his last good big-budget Hollywood enterprise. He can do this kind of role in his sleep, and he was very convincing here, reprising the role twice directly on the continuation of DVD.
