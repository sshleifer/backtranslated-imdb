As a rule, production of logo Full Moon warning sign to avoid the film. But as I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films, I gave him a chance. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. Not great, but it's something else. The film includes the fight against mystical (evil) "brother", who wants to dominate the worlds, and the name of the character. Dr. Mordrid also have to deal with people, and the power in the material world, which he does successfully. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can move between "sizes", and it does so in order to find the satellite, guarded fortress; However, the guard was blinded. His eyes are destroyed pit. Thus, the master sends his hands in front of the other, and hey presto! His eyes have been restored! This kind of healing work, perhaps with eyes only. <br /> <br /> Later, Mordred and his "brother" to animate a couple of skeletons in the museum animals to fight. Guess one wins. <br /> <br /> However, the side of this, the picture is not entirely bad, but just like a comic book. more "human" adventure doctor Mordred is all right, and Combs plays the role convincingly. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot worse.
