In a series of brilliant-packed episodes, this one stands out as one of my favorites. This is not the deepest episode, there is no big meaning or message. But it's great fun, and there are some wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> But what makes it really stand out for me is that, as far as I know, the only episode * * Twilight Zone to * double * snapper ending. on the right area is famous for providing a big surprise at the end of the story. But this time, you will get a surprise, and you think it is, but it turns out that there is * another * surprise awaits. I also like that so much that it's probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other deeper, more message-oriented one).
