I finally got myself set up in the mail-order DVD rental, so that I could find movies that are not available in my stores. I chose Souler On the contrary, because I love Meloni, as well as small, often overlooked movies. <br /> <br /> This is such a pleasure! Meloni has such a charm in this part. It's easy to pigeon hole it you only ever saw it as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, it's a step Meloni loose mid Lifer striker drifts in many ways, only to find the way to happiness from someone unexpected. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the drawn Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield character is realistic and not over done. I have not seen so Busfield 30something, and it is fun to watch. But it was the film of Chris. I again became such a fan girl. <br /> <br /> This is a little slow in the beginning, I admit. I thought that some of the "flashbacks" can be edited down. But in general, this film will please you - man or woman - as it is honest, refreshing kind of relationship today.
