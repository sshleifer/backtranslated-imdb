Great movie, quite challenging than actually interesting. Unfortunately, no memorable quotes here, but this one is my favorite: Alexander: If you leave someone you loved, you have to say that I now say to you: "Good-bye, I'm going," But disappear, to hide like a criminal It is shameful. (Do not watch with subtitles in English) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it expresses all this. There are so many tactics, which is involved in the relationship between Alexander and others, and yet everyone wants a little more of the truth. However, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as the experience of Alexander. The general interpretation is that the film criticizes only the possibility of "liberated love," drawing adverse consequences for the people involved. It is, in fact, show this in a convincing manner, but I would appreciate it if the reasons have been treated a little more : it is not what love is liberated itself is doomed to failure, but people (especially men, I think) is to work on yourself and try to overcome the prevailing mores and to the practice of releasing love <br /> <br /> yet. less realistic, although really worth watching movie.
