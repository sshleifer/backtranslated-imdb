I just watched this movie on Showtime. Quite by accident really. If I had not only 6:00 of sleep for the last two days, I would not come home early from work. If I had not come home early from work, I would not have seen this movie. I would not know what I'm missing, but I would have missed a lot. <br /> <br /> So this film. It is almost playing on the effect of Kevin Bacon. This causal relationship (hence my verbiage above). Someday character intertwined in some way or another. Action, reaction, interaction, no interaction. This film is excellent. I'm going to have to find a copy to purchase.
