Parade flooded with light rail is one of the best in the 1930 musical comedy extravaganza. Sinister script and only the stars, including Jimmy Cagney, excellent Joan Blondell, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler make this film a cut above the rest. The director and choreographer Busby Berkeley's creative genius, this film will have you grinning from ear to ear, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Busby, of course, is the undisputed master of the Hollywood musical with "gold diggers 1933" year and "42nd Street" in its asset (as a dance director). Parade ramp decorated with light-flooded hundreds of poorly dressed chorus girls, a trademark of Berkeley. Complicated dance numbers were filmed with only one camera and Busby was the first director to shoot a close-up dancers. His obsession with shapely legs and "rear-view" shots clearly demonstrated here. The overall effect is very sexy and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Our boy Jimmy Cagney plays Chester Kent, producer of "introductory" or short musical stage productions that have been performed in theaters to entertain the audience before the talkies were shown. It is surrounded by crooked partners, corporate spy, and gold digging girlfriend. Though Cagney had considerable experience in the variety show, it was the first film in which he showed off his dancing skills. Joan Blondel unforgettable, as a wise cracking, lovestruck secretary Cagney. And Ruby Keeler adorable as always. <br /> <br /> The film ends with the three outstanding production numbers, "Honeymoon Hotel", "Waterfalls" and "Shanghai Liv", each one a masterpiece and can not be duplicated in modern Hollywood, where so-called "special effects" have replaced creativity cinema <br /> <br /> Bottom Line Claudia :. Smart and sexy, with some of the best musical production numbers ever put on film. Thoroughly enjoyable romp Depression era.
