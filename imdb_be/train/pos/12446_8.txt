Sun modesty Blaise heard before, but never reading a novel or a comic book, my wife and I liked this movie a lot. It comes in an exciting way, a good introduction into the character and its background. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there are some elements of the action flick, much more intimate game, well written. Unfortunately, this is also where the main drawback of the film is shown. Intimate game lives on the capability of its actors and, unfortunately, only half of the actors delivered. While Alexander stage did an excellent job as Modesty Blaise, her colleague Nikolai Coaster-Valdano - as a villain Miklos - did not. Smiling your way through the story, as if it is a stretch of toothpaste commercial, he was not able to create an atmosphere of anxiety, which would have made the film a masterpiece. The supporting cast is somehow similar, some stereotypical gangsters and whores in decent performances with Fred Pearson, Professor forehead and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
