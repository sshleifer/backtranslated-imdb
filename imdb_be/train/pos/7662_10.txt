As B movies go, it was well above average (I warn the reader now that I can identify some of the key elements of the plot or the other part of the movie, even though I try to minimize any such tendencies). As a sequel usually go, it was absolutely fantastic (despite the "cookie cutter" approach to try to copy some elements from the original film verbatum. Despite this sometimes tedious trend seemed to work in this film, as long as viewer could divorce his attention away from comparisons with the original "Scanners"). <br /> <br /> film was similar to the way a series of "Superman", from the point of view of describing the protagonist of his early childhood relationships with their parents (who seemed to be modeled along the same lines as the Kents in the stories "Superman ") and the subject is morally pure hero possessed extraordinary powers from an early age, etc. image deep feelings of alienation monstrous or otherwise non-compliance in children, adolescents and / or adults, was a theme that reminded me of films like «Real Genius", and (in a more superficial level), "Dr. Mordrid» and hit particularly a strong chord. <br /> <br /> film was positive let e, and it was fun to watch. I found some of the ideas and the precision (in terms of the description of some aspects of the paranormal experiences) exciting, and even deeply touching at times. These moments sometimes appear out of all large initiatives formula schlock and gratuitous sex (uality, in this case, as the sexual elements have been tastefully done) and violence, making B movies (or Shakespeare's plays, for that matter! ) So much fun to watch! <br /> <br /> It is necessary to look at all the comic books, Sci-fi, "Remote Viewing" enthusiasts and horror fans! With the right impact in the right circles, the film can be developed quite a cult, along with the original "Scanners."
