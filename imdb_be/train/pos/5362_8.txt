Running Man, with TOTAL RECALL, this is my favorite film of Schwarzenegger. No, this is not 2001, but it should not be. And actions and the script is not even up to par with other Arnie films as PREDATOR or terminator. But I submit that the idea of ​​this film is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen. State sponsor of the game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes, to compete with the "heroic" stalker armed with all kinds of weapons (no runners equipped) to satisfy the thirst of the public for the sport and the blood. The main prize for the winning runner: freedom. Or so that the rules require. <br /> <br /> For a film with such over-the-top bloody scenes of death and cheesy jokes, she does have a lot to say. Someone showed all the comments of Culture / Government, represented in this film, so I will not go into details here. Suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly silly feel to the cinema, you'll enjoy it a lot (especially if you're a big fan SF imaginative). As I said, it's not trying to be a serious art film, but it's strange layered for 80th shoot-em-up clicks. The premise is borrowed from Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), a short novel, but diverges quite different from its source material, especially towards the end. (The book ends with a rather nihilistic, it goes without saying that this film does not.) I enjoyed both, but I like the movie better <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "Guess this is caused by steroids.".
