We're talking about a low budget movie, and it's clear that there are some drawbacks (no spoilers: one sudden explosive expert and one meaningless alcoholic); but, in general, the story keeps you interested, most of the characters nice and has some of the original situation. <br /> <br /> I love the films that will surprise you with some people who are not who they want you to believe, and then twist and turn the story ... I welcome it on that. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try to see also «NUEVE Reinas» (Nine Queens) film from Argentina.
