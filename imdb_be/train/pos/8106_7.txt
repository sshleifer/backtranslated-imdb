This film is difficult to watch in our fast-paced culture of the 21st century, but it's worth it for the messages that it sends, mainly the consequences and implications of technology on society, in particular, when this technology is used for warfare. <, Br /> <br /> This film is a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the emergence of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and, therefore, serves as a warning against the misuse of technology, but as a circle completes itself, familiar themes and moods float resubmit selfish rather than self-destructive ways that mankind can use the technology. <br /> <br /> A brilliant for its time, the image and sound quality can be a problem for some, but as a guide to the history, development and evolution of the science fiction genre, it is mandatory. After all, freedom of will and freedom of choice once posed for humanity as a means to control their own destiny, instead, it served us someone else, in fact, the state <br /> <br /> of the society, in the form of world events. <br /> <br /> Those who trampled on what life throws your way sometimes tend to remain so, but there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity, that is, as the film posits. <, Br /> <br /> as qualifying as a fiction, one of the largest general demoninators this genre is speculative. He asks us questions, that, when these events happened exactly and what effect has it had on society or individuals within it? How would we react? <br /> <br /> As for the effect, the film projects these abstract sciences, which make science fiction as unique as it holds us to ask these important questions.
