It's a fun movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signs a contract of sponsorship with restaurants Chicken Pete Ned Beatty. The contract has all kinds of offensive articles in it, for example, forcing Burt to wear a chicken costume during the race! Jim Nabors it (not very convincingly) the chief mechanic. Loni Anderson (oh yes!) Is appointed Beatty to Reynolds honestly and strictly adhere to the contract. This is a fun film in which Burt argues that he was not too proud. I like it!
