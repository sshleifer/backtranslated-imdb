Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a drag on the internet just watching films, made entirely out of love for the series, and shall ensure supporter Trek. Product quality is extremely high for watching films, although sometimes you can say that they are green-screenin 'it. This does not take away from the overall experience though. The CGI fantastic ships and the space battle scenes ... On the negative side, I could have said in previous episodes (and sometimes newer), that some of the actors / actresses, not quite comfortable in their roles, but again, it does not take away from the overall experience of the new Star Trek interpretations. Throwing and crew really come up with something special here, and, in general, I highly recommend this series for fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
