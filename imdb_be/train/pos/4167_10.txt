Devil Dog: Hound of Hell really good movie. It has good acting on the composition, including tilt and R.G. Armstrong.The music ghosts and gives that devilish cold! I liked the effect on the dog, and I think that the very being looked really cool horns, frills as part of his neck, and acted very sticky! If you love horror movies, and did not see the Devil Dog: Hound of Hell and to be able to find and buy the rare film, then do it because it's a good movie, and I do not think you will be disappointed!
