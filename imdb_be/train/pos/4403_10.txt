Ride with the Devil was later Brokeback Mountain Ang Lee, the film aesthetic and historical significance. the fans should see it at least twice his artistic touch worthy of being more met. <br /> <br /> The ideal work of art, the hinterland of mankind. I do not remember another war movie, so will inspire you to change your existing concept of history and politics, will restore your faith in humanity. After watching so many murders, so much suffering, you do not feel numb, instead you appreciate the connection between people. performances by actors stirs your heart, your mind drives the music. Some escape, not just a few photos, they come out for himself, becoming a vision of the soul. This real meaning of the film, which is a genre of art. <br /> <br /> The film, as it does not need long comments or feedback, all this speaks in itself. Ovation to the cast, which includes Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, cinematographer and composer of beautiful and lyrical music, what an achievement!
