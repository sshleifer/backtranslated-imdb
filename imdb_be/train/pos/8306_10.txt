In fact they could not have picked a more diverse actor to portray Little Richard than Leon. It captures Little Richard to the most plausible being. Outfits, which is beautiful and anyone watching this movie definitely will keep a smile on your face throughout the film.

The ending should be accepted direction of movement of Little Richard still currently, where you could see him, how he had aged in the new millennium. He will always be the king of rock 'n' roll as far as I'm concerned, no matter what others say information.
