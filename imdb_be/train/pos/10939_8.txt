Five Deadly poisons is a big kung fu thriller wrapped in mystery whodunnit. There are all the usual telltale signs of kung fu film excellent choreography, horrible dubbing, different "styles" of hostilities, as well as a wide range of highly exaggerated, often cheesey human emotions. However, the plot is certainly better than average. It's fun and keeps your attention for at-fights. Sometimes it is even able to run audience, for example, if X is the character receives a terrible injustice. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about five poisonous is the beautiful simplicity of manners, and the film's theme. Almost everyone gets what's coming to them. Cowardly, greedy, and corrupt to lose. Bad guys consumed selfish avidity ultimately destroyed their own betrayal and varied. Good guys use teamwork, planning and integrity to overcome their differences and come out on top. <br /> <br /> rock Poison Clan!
