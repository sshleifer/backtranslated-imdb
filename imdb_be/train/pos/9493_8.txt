White Fire is so much going for it. With Larry Bird, Robert Ginty is a double charge of flaming off with his fabulous hair and super-Mimi mustache, the film soars above other low-budget actioners. Charisma he does look like Tom Selleck Putz. With Ginty knocking all, the film rises only in awe, when the history of the diamond intrigue comes into play. Then add Fred Williamson, some frontal bush chainsaw attacks, and some surprising themes of incest .... this film ends with delivery on all cylinders. If you are looking for some strange B-action, this is where it is. Now, when I can just get my hands on this soundtrack.
