It was a great film with a good cast, they are all hitting on all cylinders. And if Diane Keaton in her best, well, it just does not get any better than this. But Tom Everett Scott, always underrated, was even better. He should be the star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with one aspect of the script. None of the characters never admits that dead daughter has not always been a good person. And neither was her mother, played by Keaton. At some point, she breaks the promise she made to one character, not to show that he was sleeping around. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators have said that the film was "a political order of the day." It's embarrassing thing to say. There was no policy at all in this film.
