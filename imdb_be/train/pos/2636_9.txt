Lion King series easily wreath Disney animation. The original Lion King is the greatest masterpiece of cel animation. Lion King II: Simba's Pride is by far the best continuation of the straight to video, Disney, or any other studio, made for an animated film. He deserves a theatrical release. The same can be said for this film. It has an original color, Elton John, hilarious storyline, thrilling action and touching moments of character. Everything you've come to expect from the series. Not so much a new story, but also a filler extended background on Timon and Pumbaa, and their place in the story. What struck me most of all was taken care in the animation. All often, Disney shorts on the quality of their animation video and television efforts. But here, they are easy to match with the new animation footage from the original film. Scenes never seem out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella in full swing as Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillaume, and Moira Kelly reprise their roles as Simba, Rafiki and Nala, respectively. We even get a return visit Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as hyenas.There lot of big laughs in this film. So if you love the Lion King, you need this film. History is not only completed without him.
