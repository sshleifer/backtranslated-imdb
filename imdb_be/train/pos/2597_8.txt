Odysseus as a film in any case can not be compared with the novel, because they are two completely different entities. However, as they say, the film still manages to retain many of the elements that made the book work, but since it is a visual medium, it is more difficult to remove from the stream-of-consciousness. I think this is the best film they could do with the material ... and that's from someone who normally rant about not being films, like their literary counterparts. I recommend this book, but the movie is still interesting.
