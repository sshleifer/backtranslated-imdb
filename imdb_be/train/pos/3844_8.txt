If you read the summary of the movie, you might think that this is something of an odd film and in a sense this is the case, the primary nature of the film, Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé) pursues visions and hallucinations. Visions of Gerard view all (more or less) subtle hints on what will happen to him, as the story goes on, and it's great fun for the audience to try to figure out the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of symbols and a few hints at the end of the film, the film maintains a very high level of excitement around and not get bored for a minute. This is mainly due to large projections Jeroen Krabbé and Reni Sautendizhk (Christine) and a large area as a whole by Paul Verhoeven. His style of direction is clearly visible, and you can tell by looking at it from different points of view that «De Vierde Man» is a typical Verhoeven film. This not only seems to be common for people who are familiar with his American films because of nudity and graphic violence, but it will also appear typical of the people familiar with his Dutch films, due to the same things, and his talent, to tell a great story, when people smotryut Verhoevens American films, short-sighted people might say that he has no talent to tell a good story, and only focus on blood and sex. This is what some people think, while I think he's a very talented filmmaker who is trying to convey the deep meaning of each with each film. Although it is not a good film, Hollow Man (his last American film) is an example of what Verhoeven can do more than science fiction movies splatter and perhaps companies should trust him more and more to offer him a variety of films on the steering wheel. He needs it. Just watch his Dutch films. Not only do they show that he needed a certain amount of freedom, but they also show that it has a wonderful talent. «De Vierde Man» brought him one step closer to Hollywood and is definitely one of his best. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
