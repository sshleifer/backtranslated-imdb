Of course, I've seen some «Speed ​​Racer», but I never looked at it, and I have also seen other shows have some of these characters, dressed as a bird, flying ships called Phoenix, and the other revolves around a spaceship, which looked like a giant ocean vessel and flew back from time to time, for whatever reason, and it was very dark and difficult to understand for someone who was, maybe five. This one, though, I watched almost every episode and surprising for me at the time was that the show was a resolution to it. It really ended, the bad guys do, unlike almost every American cartoon, which actually does not end anything such as the latest episode of Transformers Generation One, which ended with Galvatron and this new bad guy vowing to get Autobots Dungeon Dragon and children never makes it home from the GI Joe with the Cobra still there ready to try again and so on and so forth. This one-way done and did feature quite steep robot gets a new weapon as show progressed, it was a bit bland to begin with, because it could not fly and there were only a few really cool weapons. As this went on, he got a cool shooting fist, like the one used against Android 16, Cell in Dragonball Z, this weapon has evolved to include razors, which are removed. Then the big robot even got wings, so that he can fly and even more weapons were included in the wings. He also wanted to get a couple of allies female robot and a pretty funny one called Bobo in America. Evildoers not only consisted of Dr. Hell, but very strange man who was half man half woman and a guy with a flying head. Interesting show, and it was kind of nice to see the output.
