Spoiler !!! This film is based on the concept of What If? Of course, Mr. Destiny could answer this question. The main character goes through a bad day, like many of us, and asks this question. Chaos theory says a butterfly in China can affect someone over here from the chain reaction. In the center of this film is based on one event during a baseball game. This event sets in motion his own destiny; Just like Ashton in "The Butterfly Effect", with the exception of Mr. Destiny uses comedy over drama. The results make a new, more original film. If one philosophically in tune with the "Butterfly Effect" is one, probably like Mr. Destiny. I give it a 7 out of 10. It is strange, I have seen in the first half of the film 3 times, and finally saw the end on TBS.
