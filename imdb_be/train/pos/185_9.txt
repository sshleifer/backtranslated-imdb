I finally bought, and added to his collection a copy of "Show PeopleÂ». I can not comment more than the previous viewers said and characters, the plot and the overall quality of the film, Sun repeating his words. Seeing cameo appearances out of character of many M-G-M silent star worth watching in and of itself. I really like the scene where Marion Davies plays himself and met himself played the protagonist of the film, Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read her lips, yet the map name with an indication of what she says when she sees Marion Davies, but it is something to the effect of "I do not think I like it!" Pop corn, pop in the tape and prepare back more than three quarters of a century in the history of cinema. Enjoy!
