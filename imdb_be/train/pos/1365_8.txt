He-he-hello !! This is a really fun movie. Basically, in a party girl, you have a cool-Lovin ', independent, early 90 residents of New York chicken. Together with his friends party, she meets a mature Turkish supplier. This story came to the age of new adults who are looking for what they want to do. Nice to see a female loafer develop into mature woman. I hope all of us are slackers who might feel like their only skills to be able to sustain while clogged and NACK for throwing good parties. <br /> <br /> On a side note, Posey makes this movie great. I've never been a big fan of it, but this movie makes me just want to see all of her films. There is a thin manerisms, who improved her character. If you want a good laugh and a good time, be sure to watch this movie fun. Repeated views are required.
