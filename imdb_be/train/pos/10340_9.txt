Despite the fact that this film was released a year before I was born, this is definitely one of my favorite comedies. This Redd Foxx stars as a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he does not know what it means to be gay and has all these stereotypes that homosexuals like. His son, Norman, is now grown and living on their own. When his father, Ben learns that his son is gay, he pays a visit to his son, in the hope of change. The name comes from one of the funniest lines in the film - when Ben gets an apartment of Norman, he works in a female prostitute and thinks his son in clothes ( "Norman ... Is that you?"). The film made me laugh from beginning to end. Redd Foxx big. Although many of the stereotypical content, I found nothing offensive about how the material has been processed, and even has a good ending. Highly recommended.
