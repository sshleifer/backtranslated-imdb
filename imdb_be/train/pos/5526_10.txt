I love movies, so I'm going to admit embarrasses me deeply. I gave a thumbs down to "Che Parts 1 and 2", without seeing the film. Awful, I know. But I felt trapped, carried out by ... who? I do not know, but there was a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire, and no matter how smart I think I am, I fell into it. But, fortunately, I came across Argeninean director Martin Donovan, the man I love and admire. When I told him that I was not going to see it, because I knew that the film was a failure, he looked at me as if he was ready to hit me right in the face and Donovan pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved this film and why. I went to see both sides at once, and "Che, Part 1 and 2" is the best film I've seen in 2008 has such a purity that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past. Respect their audiences is that we are not used anymore. I do not know if we've ever had. Riveting, moving, without concessions and Benicio del Toro, just unusual. We can see his soul, we can really take it. Mankind has enormous human. Yes, thank you, Martin Donovan once again for teaching me so sincerely. Bravo bravo Del Toro and Soderbergh all participate in this landmark film. Do not make the mistake that I was going to do. Immediately evident is now on the big screen
