Spanish movies, if not gold, of course, the Silver Age. Piedras is another example of a film that takes people and their conflicts seriously. Although feeling strong or almost life or death level, they still do not really melodramatic. It can happen. <br /> <br /> There are stories here that are related. One of the late girl who does not dare to go on the street to the next block. One of the middle-aged woman who is the lover of his life in fetischist feet. Even about a girl with drug problems, lover leaves her. Another one is a brothel madam who (almost) finds true love. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look. This in Spain filmmakers take women seriously.
