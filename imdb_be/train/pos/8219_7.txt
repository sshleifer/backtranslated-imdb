Dirty Harry series began with a very rough actions of the police, and was almost immediately relief for the «Magnum Force». By the time that «Enforcer» skate, Dirty Harry was a little more than television police shows (saved only Tyne Daly). After a break of seven years, Dirty Harry finally returned to their roots. Maybe he was away too long this time. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood makes the first film, Harry focused as Don Siegel made the first, which greatly helps. Harry darker character again, not a good cop he was. He can once again say something like, "Go ahead, make my day" and really mean it. "Sudden Impact" is a true sequel to Dirty Harry. "Enforcer" should never have been. <br /> <br /> 7,2 10
