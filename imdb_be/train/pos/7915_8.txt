This Â«odysessy during" via computer animation, and presumably the work of over 300 artists. Made in the late '80s and launched in 1990, it was the leading edge of the material during the day. I thought it was good and very interesting in spots. <br /> <br /> The majority of short scenes does not make sense, simply forms evolve into other forms, but it was fun to watch. It's all about the visual, it is not really about any stories. There were some strange sequence in which odd-looking men-creatures will dance around with birds overheard. All of this is a computer animation, which was new at that time. Even the term "computer animation" was not well known. <br /> <br /> It's just a chance to show this new technology in short bits cartoon events with beautiful flowers and imaginative scenes. There are no words, simply photos with electronic music. Stoners must have really loved it. <br /> <br /> This is a good, intriguing 40 minutes of "eye candy" and "head candy." By today's CG effect it may have lost influence, but I think you still have a good time of it.
