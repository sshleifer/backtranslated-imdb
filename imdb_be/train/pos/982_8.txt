This is one of those westerns that are well worth almost one in hopeless as his dialogue. Few of them can hold up to it for a long time. However, everything else is very bad. Nevertheless, I give it eight, because no other western with such consistently good dialogue with the possible exception of The Wild Bunch, Jr. Bonner, and perhaps a few more. <br /> <br /> She soaked weakness, John Drew Barrimore most striking. However, it has one really memorable scenes. Nothing like it. He was immediately after the Wichita Kid kills the sheriff and goes to Jack Elams place trying to goad him into a fight. Excellent material. Already with the best in any Western.
