Thus, Fox opened it halfway through Drama / Mystery ... <br /> <br /> How lame is that? They expect us to invest time in their new show, when there is a real danger never know what's going on? Why were not the others, has filmed an episode broadcast in the United States? They have been transferred elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Lisa! Are you listening? It was a great show, but you left us hanging. If you are going to enter a new drama / mystery, at least, the air is concluded before abruptly ends in the middle of the theme. Every time there is something like this (and it seems to happen a lot with you - that is, Fox), there are more than those who will "wait and see" before you invest your time. This means that you will see the share of artificially low interest rates, and, most likely before the end of the series. You see? It's a vicious circle. Do not give back ...
