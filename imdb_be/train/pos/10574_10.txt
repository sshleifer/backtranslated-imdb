This is a great movie. Non-stop patter takes a few sleepless nights to fully appreciate. Musical performances Busby Berkeley would never be duplicated. I think this film is easily overtaking all his other efforts. Joan Blondel and James Cagney incredible together. Some of the humor is almost push the boundaries of contemporary films. It puts a rational explanation of how they made it to the side and enjoy it a spectacle that it is.
