Far richer texture and character than even the classics from the 30s and 50s. George C. Scott was born to be a Scrooge, just like he was born to be Patton. Mr. Scott is known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. Scrooge character as played by Mr. Scott seemed to jump off the screen. Scott as Scrooge bring richer, more robust, but more deeply moving Scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the despicable man in the eighteenth century in London. Mr. Scott seemed to bring Scrooge to a more personal, clear, but very inconsistent levels; its role is acted with great authority, Scott is always displayed on the screen: as long as his usual combative voice sometimes bring to a whisper, almost like a monologue, as he traded a Christmas holiday in the same breath, but to open his own human weakness in the next line. He could portray Scrooge's sour and hard, and misunderstood, pretty Scrooge all in the same scene. <br /> <br /> A really great performance giant of his generation.
