Sirko director once said, 'there is very little distance between high art and trash, and debris containing madness is this very quality closer to art. " This statement defines his cinema excellent, very unique body of work that includes classical performances, adventure and war films, westerns and of course the famous melodrama. <br /> <br /> Sirk melodramas were, as the word itself implies a drama with the music. Music sets the tone for his masterful style, and every stroke of his brush (Sirk was also a painter) leaves a powerful image on the screen, which has become the canvas. But this is not life, but her idea, imitation of life. Sirk never tried to show the reality, on the contrary. None of the directors of his generation did not do the best use of all the technical means provided for in Hollywood (in particular Technicolor), to distinguish the artificial from the real thing. Let us remember that his golden period coincides with the time when Hollywood films have turned their attention to the social drama (Blackboard Jungle, Rebel Without a Cause). Sirk always knew that the movie had to be something else <br /> <br /> One of the statements Sirk summarizes this :. 'You can not reach or touch the real. You just see a reflection. If you are trying to understand the very good fortune of fingers only meet the glass. I challenge anyone who saw written on the wind, to calculate the amount of reflected mirrors and images that appear on the screen. One eventually surrenders. <br /> <br /> So, we're in a room full of mirrors, where there was no difference between the real and its false copy. No one can say that Headley real people. This town is not really any with those loathsome oil pumps everywhere. Thus, in this area acting glow, fake decor, the focus is visible. Everything is pushed a little bit from the border (sexual connotations Dorothy Malone with a tower, for example, oil). Sirk was criticizing and theorizing while <br /> <br /> `Angles thought director. coverage of his philosophy. In Written on the wind we go drop the traditional way of life in a geometric way and in terms of light and shadow. House Hadleys, with its different levels connected by a spiral staircase acts in a strictly metaphorical. The house, which resembles a mausoleum that neither party can not lift the mood. Tragedy progresses from a luminous daylight dark night Photo Cirque becomes an extension of the internal state of his characters, and therefore the color of clothes they wear. Drama thus included in each element in the service of the ship's officer. <br /> <br /> Sirk considered himself `history Bender", because it is folded standard material, which he was appointed to his style and purpose. Written in the wind is a good example. This will not work in other hands. <br /> <br /> On the other director who used a similar strategy was Frank Tashlin, who was in the 50's comedy is the same as that Sirk was for melodrama. Their films are full of cars of American life -Advertising, televisions, music machines, washing machines, sports machines, vacuum-cleaners- reflect their emptiness and decay. I tend to think that their films were considered otherwise their modern audience. The game was played on both sides, so it was a camp. Now we see them as a 'cult' ili` bizarre "because we are not the audience more. Therefore homage to Todd Haynes' Far from Heaven "turns into a forgery, since it reproduces the work of Cirque now, as if nothing had happened between them. Then Sirk turns it into the picture hanging in an art gallery that Julianne Moore and gardener discussed in the aforementioned film. <br /> <br /> Sirk well understood elements of melodrama. We were always fixed characters (Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall here), against which he could collect a series split them. His balance through the antithesis of a distinctive and not surprisingly, we cheer for split characters, because they are the ones, Sirk interested in too. When Robert Stack flies an airplane and `entices Lauren Bacall any worldly goods of the world beneath them (a clear echo of the Faustian) we strangely fascinated with it as well as we do when the devil's nymphomaniac sister painfully reminiscent of its past alone on the river. <br /> <br /> in the Cirque universe Mitch studios often levied `happy ending do not have any negative impact. In fact, they worked just fine. Sirk was fond of Greek tragedy, and is considered to be a happy ending, in Deux ex machine√¢ his day. Thus, the final scene of the hall is well suited meetings and should also be remembered that the whole movie is told in flashback, as we know from the outset that the tragedy will fall, yet over Headley hostility. <br /> <br /> He noted many similarities between Written in the wind with the saga of the Godfather. I totally agree, and I'm sure that in parallel is not accidental. Both share the theme of the old powerful father's head is trying to save his empire going, protecting his family. Temperamental son portrayed by Robert Stack has an amazing physical resemblance to Jimmy Caan Sonny Corleone. Action to combat male one sister symmetrically. , I do not son, in which the old trust is also common in both films is the fact that both families bear the names of their city. Even details like the gate that gives access to the property and the neighborhood of the house is covered with sheets, suggests that Coppola Written by wind in the form of setting it blockbusters. Since both films deal with the subject of power: purchasing power, its manipulation and heritage (even sterility Kyle Hadley, in the case of hurry bustle, this question can easily be attached to the central theme of power, in this case, weakness in the sexual force). Another great movie that has to do with power and uses American life as it is a representation of Citizen Kane. I do not think, in the first similarities between Welles and Sirk-second films, but there is quite a lot, starting with the petrol business as the origin of the family wealth and ending with the fact that Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson), Charles Foster Kane was adopted by a teacher, having his own father was alive. Surprisingly, the same actor (Harry Shannon) to perform both parents Wayne and Kane. This item can not be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Written by wind masterpiece in every respect, and by a vision, style and technology, the highlight in the career of this great director. Some say that this is his best film. In my opinion, 'Magnificent Obsession' 'All that heaven allows, `There's always tomorrow" and` Imitation of Life "as well. And for those who bet on the Dallas Sirko or Dinasty level I wish them a happy ending.
