As stated in the summary of one line, two film left a comment on me when I came out of the theater. One was "Mix Echo" with Kevin Bacon, and the second was "Vanilla Sky." <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you sit deep in the theater seat and stop thinking about those around you, stop wondering what the end of the movie will just leave the film Swift you where he wants .. . Coming out of the movie was a bit strange, like that feeling you get when you are sick and can not think of anything. One of those movies that you become one with the guy, and I do not feel that anything else moves around you than the things in the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain. strange actors, great soundtrack, and everything in 9+ film. <br /> <br /> Of course, one of the best films I've ever seen, and the film that made the best and most shocking awakening of my life and my purpose in this world.
