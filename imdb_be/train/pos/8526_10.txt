I loved this movie! Chris Showerman has done an amazing job! Not only is he an incredible actor, but he's great with an amazing physique! He did a great job of delivering his lines, plus George turns better than Fraser made. Big performance for his first major roll! This film is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love. My kids watched this film several times, as we purchased a DVD on the next day he went out. In addition to the film, the extras on the DVD are just as fun. Two thumbs up on this one! I highly recommend it to everyone!
