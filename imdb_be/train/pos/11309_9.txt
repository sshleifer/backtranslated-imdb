Masterful treatment of James Kane "The Postman Always Rings Twice", the first film by Luchino Visconti shot in the first round of Ferrara in the dead of the war-torn Italy. The original negative thought to kill, but Visconti retained the imprint and, fortunately, we can see it early neorealist work today. Roughly beautiful Zhirotti and Clara Calamai (who recently showed his chest in La Ce della beffe Â»(1941), stars as the sensually charged and the ill-fated lovers, plotted to kill her husband. The unusual finale, which, although a crime does not pay, one pays thus not directly related to the crime. Excellent direction, screenplay, acting, and cinematography. reportedly not as good as the French "Last turn" (1939), but probably better than the US version (1946) with Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead roles. Highly recommend.
