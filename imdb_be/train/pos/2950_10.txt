If you were ever bored, not being able to get the movie on DVD, it is likely to "Mad" you were looking for. How often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routine? I was too young to see Richard Pryor in his greatest time, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy «Delirious» and «Raw» (not so funny), I never knew where Eddie got much of his inspiration. Now that I'm older, and I saw how Pryor and many of the comedians after Murphy, I know two things: Everybody steals from Eddie, and Eddie lovingly borrowed from Richard. This is a huge difference: Eddie was an original, funny, provocative, thoughtful ?? and more. It was something never seen before. He's all we ever need. These days, Eddie Murphy is boring and old ?? but once he was king, and "Crazy" was the largest castle ever built. Indeed one of the funniest of all time procedures.
