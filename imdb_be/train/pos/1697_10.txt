Basically, this film is one of those rare movies that you either hate and think that borders on suicide as the next best thing to do is, instead of having to sit through it for two hours. Or, as in my case, you see it as KULT hit one of those movies where humor, story, acting is really very hidden, but for those of us willing to go for it, trusting the director is good, the reward: U your laughter with a .. !! The fact that U have to find the things mentioned above, in fact, makes the film even more funny, because I get the impression the director does not even know how ridiculous his film, which does not seem likely, and intelligence is it in steering this magical project called: separated Invaders !!
