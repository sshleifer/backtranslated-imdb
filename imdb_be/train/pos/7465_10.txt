Warning :. Does spoilers <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, and plan for it, just stop reading here and take my word for it. You should see this film. I saw it four times so far, and I still have not made up my mind what happened in the movie. That's all I'm going to say, because if you have not seen this movie, stop reading right now. <br /> <br /> If you are still reading, I'm going to ask a few questions for you, and perhaps, if anyone has any answers that you can email me and let me know what you you think. <br /> <br /> I remember my grade 11 English teacher good enough. His name was Mr. Krisak. To me, he was wise beyond his years, and he was always the detour teaches you things that maybe you were not too keen on. If we do not like Shakespeare, he turned the story into modern romantic to the contemporary language of the day, so that we can understand. Our class room was never room, it was a house, and we were on the lake, read a book in our time of rest. It was his own indelible way of branding is something in our minds sponge. <br /> <br /> I begin this review Vanilla Sky with the description of this brilliant man, because he once gave us a task that is firmly in my memory, like a phone number long lost best friend, and he finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix. Now, when I did not know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak. But giving them the benefit of the doubt, we believe that it was not him. But it was the first time that the job was more than palpable. <br /> <br /> He asked us to prove to him and myself that were real. Show me how you can say that you are real. It got a class beating all conventional ideas, which I'm sure you can imagine. Everything from the pain, the sense of touch to the sense of loss of hunger was rushed off to our teacher, to prove to him that we were real. After each scenario, which we gave him, he would return with a response that would leave us speechless. <br /> <br /> «What to do if you're not that other, as a stranger sleep?» <br /> <br /> What if you had dreams of someone else? That messed up the question of what to eat. It was a question / scenario put us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid development of computers. How can this may seem then? But if you look at the modern technology, now ask yourself what you were a part of someone else's dream. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant but surreal film this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive studied similar area. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could have hoped. In short, this is one film that literally (if you allow) to blow your mind from all the opportunities that surround you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise plays David Aames, young, hot shot, righteous, full of the publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited it from his father, and although he has the talent and business savvy, his advice Governers, the Seven Dwarfs, I think that it is rich in Dinka born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel that he has done nothing to deserve the top of the success that each of them believes should go to them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film we meet one of the wonderful toys David named Julie Gianni, played with disastrous but pretentious perfection Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game, and claiming that they are only there to make use of each other and not the least interested in a monogamous, committed relationship. This type of relationship is commensurate with other throw David, he had sexual prime of his life. And although both speak a good game, we can say that only one is really telling the truth. <br /> <br /> Next, we meet Brian Shelby, played brilliantly by good friend Kevin Smith, Jason Lee. Brian wrote the book that David is going to release, but they are also very good friends. This is what David has very little in my life, and you can feel the real care for each other early in the film. Brian has one famous line that he continues to talk to David again and again. This "sweet is not as sweet, not bitter." He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love, and not only the status of a lover of the time, it seems, made with all floozies, which inhabit his bed for the night or two. <br /> <br /> in a huge Bache birth of David (so huge that loves Steven Spielberg to wish him a happy birthday) Brian comes in with his date, Sofia Sorrano, playing Penelope Cruz knows that to be the best result in This year, the actress, This bash is by invitation only and at first David and Sophie seem intrigued with each other. In typical fashion, David, in spite of his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with Sophia. To complicate things, Julie is an uninvited and starts to spy on David. David spends the night with Sophia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of each other. There's no hanky panky. The next day, David leaves the apartment Sofia, he meets Julia, who offers him a ride and there ....... Well, I think we've all seen the commercials. <br /> <br /> this is all that I'm really talking about the story, because here the film teases us with the fact that the reality and the perception of that blurry. We get to know the character played by Kurt Russell and a few other shady characters, all of which play a role in this maze, like a mist. There is a subtext of death and a possible panacea, as a panacea Alls, which may or may not be able to create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the intriguing film offers us opportunities, but it does not end there. <br /> <br /> As with many films seem to thrive today, this film has a secret. Sixth sense may have started this hobby, but look further and you can probably thank Angel Heart for the beginning of the craze. Regardless of how it came about, Vanilla Sky has one of his own secret bowel Busters. And what makes this so much fun that the movie gives a lot of obvious clues along the way, but not enough to give you a conclusive decision of truth and lies gloves you just put yourself through. I saw this film four times, and each time it was, because I want to see if there is anything else I can pick up something else I can understand. In order to be able to work your mind into the theater to give her the opportunity to open new opportunities for something rare in the film. All substitute so-called "best pictures of the year" was good, but nothing special. They lack substance. Beautiful mind was intriguing, but the apartment, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting, but unevenly. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you with the desire for a more even guarantee your satisfaction, because the film and those who did so take care of it. I know that this film received mixed reviews, but I just think that those who do not like it, do not quite understand. <br /> <br /> This is what film-making should be. That's what the film should do for you. It is supposed to make you feel something. Most of the other films in this year, there were just empty space. This one is not. <br /> <br /> 10 of the 10 best films of the year. I would like to see this get nominated for best picture, and I would like to see Cruz for Best Actress, Diaz for the best cruise for best actor Jason Mewes and footwear should be in for best supporting actor. Cameron Crowe is there. None of this can happen, and that's a shame. This is one movie that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> And on a final note, I am quite sure that Mr Krisak would like this film, and perhaps this is one film that can answer his question. Can you prove that you really need? Or are we just a figment of the imagination? Should we artificially transplanted to shock someone else? This is a film that raises more questions than it does answers. And I'm sure that's just fine with him. <br /> <br /> Open Your Eyes
