I can not agree with any of the comments. The first time I saw a movie on TV channel UK, it was presented as an indie film, and if you take the film from this point, I think it all is another matter. I could not believe what I saw and hooked instantly. The site could be so bad, as shown by JS (ie there is no plot), but acting angry, it's fun, and it's all around incredible film waste. <br /> <br /> He says so much about America than the Bully and Ken Park with no prospect of a drama, but it gives an idea of ​​the American society, and more precisely on what day of the viewers in America (and I think a lot of them!) interested. in the end, it's neighbors, we're talking about, is not it? <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
