Year 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, the Cuban citizen visiting announce that he probably died, when in fact, he left the cube to move to the alleged identity in Bolivia over the past five years, will disappear from the face of the earth, leaving a grimly Fidel Castro . While living in the city of La Paz, Guevara takes the idea of ​​overthrowing the corrupt bourgeois government there. Once again, Steven Soderbergh takes where "Che: Part One" ends (only better this time). Go more on the goal of the work is very fine acting (including, in turn, on a painful looking Benicio Del Toro as Che Guevara). Suffice it to say that it's probably best if you see both films to get the true story of Guevara and what type of man he was (I had a rare open a window of opportunity to see both films at the same screening ---- conversation In the long run!). As with "Che Part 1: The Argentine", this film has no MPAA rating, but contains enough salty language & violence easily stump him «R».
