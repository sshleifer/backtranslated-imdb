Yes, this is another big movie magic The Muppet, and I love them all; characters, movies, TV show episodes (this is the best comedy or musical TV show ever), and all the artists who are behind it. But here they have made such a rare fatal mistake, and I, of course, talking about the strange finale !! <br /> <br /> I think it is very dangerous to believe that much in the American drama, and finish the novel marriage !! We, like all the poor spectators, feel so free, or can be, happy for the absence of his annoyance, irritability and pain! Thus, we all love these stories, which are collected 2 cute characters, like a couple in love, without due regard as Mickey Mouse and Mini, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. So with all the previous pair and loves them, I bet that you feel safe, calm and peace. Therefore, when you look at the fact that the creators of this film has been done, you will be as crazy as I am! <br /> <br /> They are weak miserable creature (Kerman) to marry his daily nightmare, the most annoying woman ever (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change in the American entertainment industry measures in! And it was quite normal to have a negative impact on the audience, which simply refused to bless or to believe or be happy with this sudden marriage (even pathetic frogs have neither the time nor the proper opportunity to think or solve anything!), So it is not surprising that in all, if you know that this film is the one failure in their cinema seriously, grossing only 25 million vis 65 million earned by the first (the Muppet movie ?? 1979) five years ago !! <br /> <br /> Just in this film they took Manhattan, and my vacation too!
