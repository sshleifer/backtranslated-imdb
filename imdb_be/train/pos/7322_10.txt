Halloween is one of those movies that gets your skin deep! This, in my opinion, the worst movie of all time. Michael Myers is the Boogeyman best ever! He was just so scary! What makes Halloween so special, that there were no special effects, where you can say, as a computer-animated it, it was on a low budget and had by one note, but managed to scare the hell out of people. 25 years and this film still has the same effect as it did in 78. <br /> <br /> It's about a boy Michael Myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 years and so many years later escapes the psychiatric institution, Dr. Sam Loomis after him and would do anything to get it back, because he Michael describes as "... pure evil. Black eyes, the eyes of the devil. " Michael is on a mission, though, to kill his other sister, Laurie, who plays the new Jamie Lee Curtis. She should nurse for Halloween, while her friends in the party and, of course, we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie can stand a chance, because she is a virgin. ; D <br /> <br /> Halloween pay a lot to Psycho honors, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, daughter Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolute stunning film that destroys boundaries and makes you lock the doors, bolt your window and turn off the lights! "They catch you! They catch you! ". Halloween, the final horror film! <br /> <br /> 10/10
