I admit, creating great expectations before watching, because some members of the mentioned (and they do not Pervs!), As a must see. And it must be seen! Just do not expect to see something outbreaking. <br /> <br /> Freudian psychoanalyzes interest in many parts of the film, but there are too many distortions and does not stick in the end. <br /> <br /> Some of the good things is the analysis of Kieslowski's Blue, most of David Lynch, some of Hitchcock, and maybe a few more I missed (I just remembered ... Dogville), and I do not usually miss things, unless they are too obvious, or freely in the air. <br /> <br /> In addition, the repetition that makes it too long, enjoyable documentary in the sense to notice some distortion, feeding our unconscious, so that the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as the basis for this theory. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narrative, and the efforts of Mr. Zizek revive Freud's theory, which has been numb for too long, especially in North America. Again, this is the way the top, and I believe to be entirely a waste of time, I believe that most people have a dark appreciation of death and blood.
