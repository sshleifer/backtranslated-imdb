"Imagine if you could bring to life with just one touch of a button," When I first heard that my account was closed on a trailer, and after the first episode I found myself in love with this show. A modern day fairy tale that brings the spirits and keeps my attention throughout the show. I think that the actions and Casting wonderful, each character brings something unique to the show, which adds to the perfection. Even once villains manages to cram a unique feeling of Bi Man with Guy, who can swallow the kittens, they never seem to let me down. And death, which usually lead to oppress Moment often end up purely ridiculous (such as exploding zero and Sniff Books) <br /> <br /> Even a large number of crimes shows that we have now a days, is one of the Daisies the few that truly stands out from the rest, being not only the Mystery, but a love story, a fairy tale of comedy and drama with a hint of all baked one cake ..... er show. <, Br /> <br /> what really struck me was that he was on ABC, for many years I have never had occasion to refer to the ABC, but it brought me back every week, with a smile on his face. It was as if Daisies ABC Brought push back to life for me. But just like that, after two seasons, a number of awards, a large fan base and positive reviews from critics of the show was released. It seems that Ned again ABC touch and for all kill it for me. I'll always be a fan of the show, though, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a lot of talk and a lot of love from the shows they watch.
