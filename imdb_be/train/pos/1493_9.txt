I thought that Muhsin was perfectly written. It's not just entertainment. There's a ton of subtle messages that I think Jasmine is trying to bring across. And yes, it can be confusing to some of you (especially if you have not watched Sepet and / or Gubra 76 times). <br /> <br /> I bet to notice how they use the symbols of the two films before right? It's really ironic, as the characters are connected. As overbearing neighbor that prostitute from Gubra. And the chicken in the snooker area is religious and pious man and his wife in the future. <br /> <br /> And I absolutely love the voice-over. His raw awakeningly still fresh. Like, if they took the shot signs Rumah Tumpangan Gamin, suddenly Muhsin voice says «Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim ..» (the scene when he climbed the tree). <br /> <br /> He captured the attitude of Malaysian (and in some gentle way, giggling as it is pathetic) is represented in the character. For example, even children can be very sharp on the tongue (complete with annoying squeaky voice) and just bad public procurement mouth all movie long. And how can you be so intrusive and talk about ppl if ur own lives not understand. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that this film is quite reached my expectations if not exceeded it. <br /> <br /> He kept me glued to the screen, I even could not take his eyes off him. Do not even do in the movies. Haha.
