I've never seen this film until I bought a tape last year. I was thrilled and entertained. It has all the elements of what I like to see in the history of Sci-Fi, in a book or on a screen. There's a social commentary, speculation, and a good story. <br /> <br /> there's something terrible and funny, watching one thousand nine hundred thirty-six idea of ​​the "distant future" the 60s and 70s. <br /> <br /> I think that it must be seen, not only for the Sci-Fiers.
