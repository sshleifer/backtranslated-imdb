Silverlake Life, the view from here is absolutely stunning film about AIDS, as well as a gay love relationship. Some images are really very hard to accept, especially if one is gay or concerns about AIDS, and probably for any sensitive person, watching him. It is not so easy to make a film about this terrible disease and its consequences, not only one, but the lives of two people. This film teaches you how to care for each other in these difficult times, but it never gets too painful, he still shows life at any time to remind you that outside the theater, or your room, life goes on, regardless of the fate of some people can be. The characters are incredibly appealing, while we watch their proximity to the footage that never go beyond the very strict limit, never revealing anything too personal or offensive. Children should, of course, do not watch this movie, but adults, whether they are dealing with such situations, or not have to do it, and will not spare the tears they shed.
