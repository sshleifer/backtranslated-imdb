This film shows a band one wants to work for every film. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play husband and wife) positive terrible, discussing the "family business", as if it were a grocery store or dry cleaning. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter also excellent. They play each other as members of the first-rate theater troupe, who understand that the quality of the product requires each actor to support others unselfishly. And finally, there is Sammy (David Dorfman). What a strange performance by a child ... and what a terrible likeness he should Ullmann, whose son he is playing! <br /> <br /> We were treated to a unique story in "Panic", and it is a rarity these days the weary generic crap. Sharp and clever dialogue, and it is a relatively short film, however, has the right to bring a full range of emotions from the viewer. There are places to laugh, to be shocked, horrified, to be upset, to be excited, angry, and love. This is not a film that leaves you jump for joy, but when it's over you more than satisfied knowing that you have spent the last ninety minutes going through a darn good piece of work. <br /> <br /> Also, we would go to the theater, if we treat the quality of the fare as it is. If the powers that be in Hollywood wake up? It's a real shame when something is good exposure can be obtained outside of festivals and households lucky enough to have cable.
