While reading the comments left for this show, I could not help but notice that a large percentage of the reviewers were either not actually watched any episodes of the show, or all the way through, or of their own accord. The fact is, Kerching! It is that these are children's shows for children, so obviously, if your older, it would seem cheesy, forced, and probably stupid. I even found one person who spoke sets were stupid, but I remember being eight years wondering why Taj was Ikea Icecube mold on the wall, and I wonder if my parents would allow me to stick some on mine (they did not). Yes, it can be annoying, acting could be better, and some of the characters are doing really strange things with her hair, but, as shown by the children, I appreciate it 10/10. Compared with them the air in its place the material today, well, let's just say that I wish it would have been back on the air. release DVD, any?
