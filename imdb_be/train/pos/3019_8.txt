To begin with, I loved Gath Kanal 1, it was a lot of classic jokes in the number of that unfortunate man in the boat, which always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, he still acts the same guy in Goethe Kanal 2 movie, but in my opinion the performance of HES is not as funny as it was in the first film, in fact, you do not notice it at all. The thing that made me think bad about this film is the choice of boats in this film there are only racing boats, they are confident that it is fast, but they do not make waves as large floating houses, used in the first film, I liked the old one is the best, and these new boats makes one of the last scenes look ridiculous when a person in a boat suddenly jumps out of it, to avoid the "big wave" of these small high-speed boats. Indeed minus. You have to admit that we do not live in Sweden, the same as in 1974 more. This film also contains a little more violent than the first. Although the film was a great overall. I concentrated on some of the cons that I was disappointed in Russia, but the rest of the film were my expectations, so watch it! It's worth the money.
