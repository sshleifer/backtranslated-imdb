I was thirteen when this movie came out on television. It is much better than in most action movies since. Martin Sheen is fine, and although Nick Nolte is a small part, it also provides excellent support. Vic Morrow as the villain beautiful. <br /> <br /> If Sheen Â«testing the water" in his 34 Ford (COOL) it is exciting mountain road! <br /> <br /> The ending is great. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed in the low vote is received. I believe that the younger generations have a strong interest in most of the debris that comes out these days. <br /> <br /> A good taste of the mass escapes!
