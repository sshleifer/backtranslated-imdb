Who said that terror was not educational film genre, is not it? Thanks to this amazing Hammer short film, now I at least do not know, will never offer a stranger to the visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own home, because he might just be a hypnotist, and this combination will give him the ability to control my thoughts and mind forever! Thank you Hammer! The tenth episode in the house of horrors, there is another series I'm looking forward to seeing, mainly because the guy in the chair of director was Don Sharp; one of the best directors of Great Britain, but so far, unfortunately, underestimated. Sharp has been responsible for some very cool Hammer films as "Kiss of the Vampire" and «Rasputin: The Mad Monk», as well as some forgotten independent productions as "dark places" and «Psychomania». His contribution to the House of Horrors is easily one of the best in the series with a complex yet fascinating story convoy and rotating at great occult themes. The plot focuses on two of antique that run across a strange object like a mirror, but in fact is an ancient Voronoi device which can be used to call Choronzhon; demonic guardian of the abyss. Mirror highly desirable from a satanic cult, because they need it for their ceremonies, but Michael does not want to sell it before you know the real cost of the device. If he raises clearly the girl turned to stone, which runs from the cult to avoid being killed, Michael is drawn even deeper into the occult conspiracy. Satanic cults and carnal sacrifice young women typical British horror themes, but the script by David Fischer never boring, and offers a variety of neat story reproach, among which are very inventive in menopause. There's also a lot of tension, to admire, dialogs are witty and effective performance great (especially John Carson as the cult leader is really terrible). Recommended!
