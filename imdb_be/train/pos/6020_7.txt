Beautiful new stamp "Zabriskie Point" is playing in Paris, and seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full assessment of the film. Let's hope that the new printing means that a DVD with some astute "extras" will be in the near future. <br /> <br /> I remember watching the SP when it came out and thought it was a failure of the hole. At this time, I was completely in awe and classify it as a "near miss" masterpiece. The first part of the film is a time capsule of the late '60s Los Angeles, where I was then living, and Antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of this place. Kudos to director Dean Tavularis who found incredible places and did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> seal, I saw runs 1 hour 50 minutes. It is forbidden to those under 16 years old (or 18, I do not remember). I suspect that this is quite a bit of fresh personnel in this print. Spoiler - I wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut. What seems today seem fairly tame by modern standards. <br /> <br /> There's no music soundtrack to nearly 1:00 in the film. Before we hear the background noise, such as radio, etc. Antonioni was very brave to do it. I remember how much has been done at the time, due to lack of acting individuals, not subjects FRECHETTE Mark and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette does not bother me. Halprin weak but gradually improved as the film continues. <br /> <br /> Most of the student revolt footage looks footage to me. One shot in different proportion and distorted wide screen. Of course, there is an actual set footage, but not too much. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni made some shots Frechette flying aircraft. It seems that he really made some of the flight. - no blue screen or twice in some of the shots <br /> <br /> I hope to return to see the film a second time. Highly recommended for all fans of Antonioni.
