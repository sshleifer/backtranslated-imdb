OK, so I do not watch too many horror movies - and the reason for such films as «Dark Remains». I caught it surprisingly (feature-filled) DVD and it scared me silly. In fact, only additional I think that the DVD did not have a new pair of trousers. <br /> <br /> However, the next day, when I was talking to someone about it when I realized that I just did not see about 10% of this. Rest of the time I watched the pizza on my coffee table - nervous that my friend will catch me when I actually closed my eyes. Several times I really brave looks at the screen, I was jumping so much that I decided not to look back. <br /> <br /> The film-making is a solid and the position of the characters was really convincing. The simplicity of the film that really captured my jump button - it's just a forest, an abandoned cabin and a prison - and a lot of darkness. The most surprising thing for me was that while it was clearly not a few million dollars of production, make-up effects actually looked like it was! In addition, it is obvious that this is a film made by someone with a lot of love for the cinema. Sound design and music really used my surround sound system, as well as many Hollywood movies have never done. I saw online that this film won the LA Shriekfest - really a great achievement, and I think that the festival has seen a clear talent of filmmakers. - and probably a lot more of the film than I could <br /> <br /> Turn up the sound, turn off the light, and if you want to save his girlfriend - to order a pizza.
