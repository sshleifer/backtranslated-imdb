From what I've read a lot of people were disappointed with this film, as compared with the part 1. At first, I could understand it, but after a bit of thought, I think they are wrong to be. Soderbergh continues fact-based telling about the life of Che, that he began in Part 1. Part 1 is told the story of a revolution that is moving away from an unpromising start to a successful conclusion, in the long run. Part 2 tells the story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. This is not the fault of Soderbergh, that these two parts of the life of Che completely different results. He bravely chooses to say, and in a fairly simple manner. The viewer can feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part 1, part 2 what, but it's the reality of life of Che and I think any fault director. The film is far from perfect. It is probably too long. At least in part 1 we saw different aspects of the war, the guerrillas have been successes. In Part 2, they can not catch a break, and we see their number is constantly decreasing death and capture. the capture and death of Che considered good. The film is significantly enhanced dialogue, which in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again perfect as the charismatic Argentinian. So, if you've seen Part 1, you will see a very similar speaking a completely different story in Part 2.
