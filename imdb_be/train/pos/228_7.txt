"Convicted" very act of a third kind of film. All communication Dialogue and character of what is happening inside him comes out of a long clotting late southern day. And, as a consequence, the life of the protagonist, Soll (Robert Duvall). <br /> <br /> This is the first joint work of director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years ago, then we worked together on "Trip to Bountiful", a film that seems almost futuristic compared to this. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he barely this side of adequate. The slow pace leaves plenty of room for filmmakers Toyomichey smoke that fills the film with the right sense of gentle light and heat. <br /> <br /> Because it is essentially removed the game, with little in the way of editing or directing prowess, it all comes to acting. As I understand it, no no drawbacks here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both were born in January 1931), to create characters that are real, are not interested in anything other than the living. Lukas Haas, a young actor, I was familiar with from the "Testament" and "Witness" plays a character very much like his other early roles. He's a quiet, introverted, a little scary and sad, anyway. This quality, which seem natural from him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the name as "condemnation" is bearish for this film. This title, along with the first stage seems to create an image of a much more elevated type of Western images. If a slow stage does not interest you badly, you want to jump on this as well. Otherwise, this may be exactly the movie you want them to do more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
