National Gallery of Art has shown long-thought-lost original director's cut of the film on July 10, 2005, he restores life scenes censored upon its release. The character of the cobbler, sweet moral people in the original issue of censorship in 1933 are presented here as a follower of the philosopher Nietsze and convinces her to use men to claw his way to the top. In addition, the banal end of the original, which I believe that in the current version of VHS eradicated, and the ending is restored to its original form. Great movie about seduction and power. Hopefully, there will be a re-release of the film on DVD for all to appreciate its great qualities. Look at him.
