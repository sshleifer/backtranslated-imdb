Jay Chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school, but was expelled corrupt school principal after the fight with a bunch of thugs in the service of the infamous villain. He stumbles down-on-his-luck trickster Eric Tsang, who immediately see the potential cash teen skills. Basketball chosen path to wealth, and Tsang bids to get his spot on the team of the University and its promotion in the media. . General success leads the championship on basketball and really unpleasant rival team running the same vile villain before <br /> <br /> It's all a little Shaolin Soccer, I think, but not as quirky or funny - story sticks fairly close to the convention sports movie, and delivers all the elements of the crowd waiting for the installation. You've seen it all before, but this kind of thing, it never hurts to see again, if it's done well. Fortunately, it's really well done here (some might say "strange" Chu Yen-Ping in the director's chair ... I expect he had a good "helpers") - the script and provides a representation of a smooth and stylish. Jay Chou is pretty much indifferent throughout, but a style of his, and when he let emotions flicker through it can be a pretty good comic effect. Eric Tsang compensate with a larger than life character, he played many times before (in real life, for example) that receives many of the films most emotional moments. <br /> <br /> As the film revolves around basketball, it is good that the basketball games scene suitably exciting. The cast show some real skills, while those Chou, and some well done wirework and CGI to add this item to the hyper-real kung fu skill, which makes the scene even more interesting (assuming you like that sort of thing) and justify a movie plot / availability . <br /> <br /> There's only one significant battle scenes in the film, but it is in Doozy "one against many" style. Jay Chou seems to be doing a lot of his own footsteps, and very impressive - it is clearly a very strong and fast for real, and Chen Xiaodong choreography makes him look like a real martial artist. I wish that there were more, but at least it is a long battle. <br /> <br /> It is a kind of Chinese New Year blockbuster I had hoped it would be with a trailer, and recommended viewing!
