I've been waiting to see this movie for a long time, and finally I was able to see the Istanbul Film Festival. Maybe because I was expecting too much from this movie, and that's why I was a little disappointed. I was not the best film from Korea, but still it is really worth watching. <br /> <br /> The theme was good, and the film makes you continue to watch without getting bored, even though it is long. But there are gaps in the film, and you jump from one point to another. However, acting on Chon Until He's incredibly beautiful. He was one of the best performances in the history of early cinema, and I think that this film will not be as good if it was not in the lead role.
