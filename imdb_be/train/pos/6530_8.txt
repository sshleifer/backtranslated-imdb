The last time I read a Nancy Drew book about 20 years ago, so much of my memory a fictional character, the problem may be. From what I gathered, the books were introduced to me at that time, when detectives teenagers were popular for children growing up in that time (in my case, 80 th and early 90's), with the Hardy Boys, Famous Five, and, of course, "Carolyn Keene" 's Nancy Drew among the most famous of them. I still remember these hardcover books with very dated cover illustrations tend to be quite heavy (for a child), to carry, and the thickness of the book, perhaps explained by the fact that the words printed in large font. <br /> <br /> Well, the character was given some updates along the way, as I remember these books my sister Nancy Drew becomes less dense, with cover, with updated and more chic Nancy is illustrated on the cover. I can not remember when these stories were the same as the old cover of them, but I believe that these books are being ghostwritten by, have their fair share of renewing itself over time. <br /> <br /> In this release, Warner Brothers, Nancy Drew character, of course, gets updated to suit the times, but for some reason the authors Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen supported her 50s- ish small town feeling, thereby maintaining a certain charm and flavor, uh, people like me would be greatly appreciated. Her fashion sense, her prim and proper, even some little quirky behavior traits that make it well, Nancy Drew. <br /> <br /> her family background is more or less the same, living with her parents one parent Carson Drew (Tate Donovan), who moves his daughter and himself in the big city for better job opportunities, and wean her daughter from surveillance in River Heights. Mom, but a distant memory, and the housekeeper makes a cameo. But what made the work of Nancy Drew, is casting Emma Roberts in the title role. Niece of his famous aunt Julia, she also has that cheerful behavior that unmistakable red hair and smile megawatts. Her Nancy Drew, while at the beginning it seems to rub you the wrong way, in fact, will grow on you. And almost exactly what I thought he could be discarded scene from Pretty Woman, it was the characters go to a classy store with almost opposite reaction. <br /> <br /> While dad, Carson Drew tries his best to bring Nancy with its environmental monitoring of the environment and to assimilate into normal life of a teenager, trust Nancy to find themselves living in the house, whose owner, Hollywood was kind, was found dead under suspicious circumstances. Solving the mystery of her comfort food when she finds herself an outcast of the local fraternity and not by the time we whisked together with her on her great adventure on the screen. <br /> <br /> There's nothing too Black Dahlia about crime and mystery, and instead it is a fairly simple piece of Nancy, to decide between friends Corky (Josh Flitter) round-one of the schools, and quite jealous boyfriend week (Max Thieriot), hiding the truth about her extra curricular activities with her father. Story tightened with cheese fun and Oldie sentimentality which amulets, and together, he becomes more like Scooby-Doo. With minimal violence and no big bag gunfights or explosions, serious genre, which is clearly labeled "chick flick" warning. <br /> <br /> I think that the film will generate a new generation of fans, revive memories from the old, and probably, just probably, can provoke a new fashion trend sport penalties loafers.
