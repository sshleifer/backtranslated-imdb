We all loved Star Wars, but we always come back to this because of the great songs and adventures. We all loved Camel and will sing at the top of our lungs with him during his lyrics. There are some slow moments (time spent with King Koi-Koi in his backyard), and we all miss after the song The Knight ( Â«The reason that I {sound effect} because I loooooove you"), but we loved travel Babbette to save and end, and all were a little shocked by the pictures of King Koo-Koo floating out there dominating the horizon, laughing maniacally at the end. I still and sing "Hooray me to this day! ! Babbette gay Paris "Around my friends (I'm 33 now), who just looked at me as if I was crazy; However, when I sing it, I remember 10 years back great year Star Wars.
