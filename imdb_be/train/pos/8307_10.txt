Tressa vocal performance was great !! Tressa played the female lead singer, while Richard was at the club. When she first step on the stage, and began a reef and firmly her stuff, it did have a concussion soul. Her voice is platinum. She needed to make a CD. It has more supporters, she understands. I loved her show to stop working in five beats of the heart, which she also co-starred with Levon, when she was younger. As a little girl to have such a great voice. She really amazing.Good voice Good Good Good Good voice voice voice voice wonderful voice a fantastic voice trembling again, crying tears, cheers up, take you back to the days of the voice. Tressa if you're reading this commitment, please take my advice and start writing the CD. If not only for the love of singing, but also for your fans. I believe that you really can do it. Look at the other one hit single studio singers, lol.
