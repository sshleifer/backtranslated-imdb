She's so unusual singer, who cares about anything else !!!! This final scene is one of the best moments in all of show business - bar none !! I am glad that she held the camera over a period of ten minutes - she deserves that iconic status - such a power to vote. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this film when I was five, and it has had a tremendous impact on me. I see today, and so I can see some of the disadvantages (as Esther wants to leave her right Grammy award is announced). <br /> <br /> But some other users' comments are simply a lie - I mean, where gratuitous nudity - maybe, we have seen different movies ??? <br /> <br /> singing ability Streisand monumental, and if it has a big ego - perfect! <br /> <br /> She deserved it.
