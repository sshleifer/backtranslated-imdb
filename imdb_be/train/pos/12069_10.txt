Yes, it's drawbacks - especially when you are in Hollywood movies, which require a lot of effects, purely entertainment or fantasy stories or story, and you can not really think of myself <br /> <br /> Roeg movies there. . for intellectual cinema-goer, and Insignificance is a perfect example <br /> <br /> in the characterization of genius, a great story, but, like all movies Nic Roeg - did you think at every level on the aspects of reality that would never it hit you before. His films always make you think, and I personally like that in the movie. <br /> <br /> So do not wait away from watching this movie and felt all happy happy, because most likely you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I think it's great.
