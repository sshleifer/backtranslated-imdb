I wonder how this show is played in the UK and rest of Europe. This is so self-loathing about being an American (especially whites). This can be a big reason for some of the venom and sarcasm evident here on this board. I love the show, but it is with some reservations, and I feel like I took the easy way out by Spoiler Spoiler: <br /> <br /> crashes and burning everything at the end of the second season. Julie closed the door on any hopes for a revival of the show when her character lands on a haystack in the middle of some farms. Who knows? It was funny, raunchy and over, kind of scary show.
