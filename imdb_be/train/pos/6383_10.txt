I thought that this movie was very enjoyable. I watched this movie with my wife, I've been to my first child. Therefore, I did not look at it as just entertainment for the whole family, and I still loved it. It seems that many of the reviews indicate that this film not to shock, there were no unexpected changes in the plot and the film was predictable and boring. If these people watched this film expecting to have a religious experience to do so, they are likely to be disappointed. It's just an animated film; nothing more. If you want to see this movie just sit back and let yourself be entertained, you will not be disappointed. In conclusion, it is certainly not the best Disney movie made, but it is interesting, and I do not understand the bad reputation it has received.
