I was a young student film in 1979, when the Union of Soviet filmmakers came to Sofia and Bulgarian Prime Minister Konchalovsky "Sibiriada"; Tarkosvky in "Stalker" and Danelia'a Â«Autumn Marathon". I was struck by the cosmopolitan dimension art form. Then and only then, I saw "Sibiriada" 4 and 1/2 hour epic and speechless. Way better then Bertolucci's "1900". Until now! <br /> <br /> Hope Andron will somehow get to the negatives and make a "restored version directed by a full-length" ever! The DVD course! Also, I struggled in the defense of this movie against the majority of my colleagues, who were equating the Soviet film with a bad taste! Time is on my side.
