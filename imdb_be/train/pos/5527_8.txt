There you may have a special reason, Fox and child struck focus in my heart. Just I said goodbye to my new friend - oh ... one day - for an indefinite period of time, I was a little overwhelmed with different emotions and suffered fallout from putting on a brave face she wanted to see <br. /> <br /> I watched a few movies and TV shows, but my interest jumped from the fact that I'm going because somewhere out there, and I have not seen. To this end, I have this movie to thank. <br /> <br /> A lover of nature and heard about the film in advance, I was sure I was going to love it anyway. But I did not just like it, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Technical skills strange. How do they do it? As they capture the animal as they do ?? It's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is good, and while the end of the oh so French and ambiguous, this is a happy / sad. Again, he caught me a little off guard. As a person who usually keeps his emotions to himself, the ending was difficult to go while on a plane full of people, I would see in the next 15 hours or so! Maybe it's because the ending made me remember that I left. <br /> <br /> But for those few hours on the plane, I was happy to see something new and original. And that's life. Of course, there are those things that you like and feel comfortable around ... but in the open air holds many mysteries. So the next time I see something out of the ordinary, but in the open; I'm going to study it, to observe it and take it. This is exactly what happens in this film, and that's exactly what you should do with this damn movie / nature of the document as well. 8-10 <br /> <br /> P.S. It's two months of traveling by plane. We still do not know when we'll see each other again, but we will.
