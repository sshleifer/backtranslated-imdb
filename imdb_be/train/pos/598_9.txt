Heres a fun fact that I was a kid in the movie, one in bed. :) I'm 19 years old now. my parents took me to try on a part, we lived in Texas in time.I think I only made 80 bucks for it, but I was not in it for very long. My parents said that I cried when I had to be happy, and would have been happy if I had to cry. I messed up. Surprising and funny fact I believe .. and no, I'm not a child actress. I live in San Antonio, work for Walgreens. I ended up here in Texas, but I lived in Maryland most of life. This movie is a great movie, though, a good concept. I saw him a few times in my short 19 years.
