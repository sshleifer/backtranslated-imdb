I remember the film shown a few years ago on the Lifetime television network and thought it was an interesting story. A few years later, I see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie. The story behind the film is fascinating in itself. The cast only makes it even more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture. She nails manner of Mrs. Chamberlain, accent, and even appearance. It shows the pain, pain, surprise, and anger that Linda had to endure, and in the process, it is difficult to remember that it's not Linda. In my opinion, this is Meryl performance was better than its Oscar-winning turn in "Sophie's Choice", and should have won her her third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for some strange reason, has not been recognized by the Academy, at least a nomination. Overall, this movie just got one Oscar nod, however, he will get several Australian Oscars and nominations <br /> <br /> Definitely a first-rate film (for Best Actress Streep.) :. He tells a great story, and you get great performances from the entire cast.
