This is a very good film, not only for fans of comics Lady Death, but also for those who love animated films / series of adventures and fantasy. <br /> <br /> The film is about an innocent girl who is about killed for what she had done, but to be who she is the daughter of the head of hell, Lucifer himself. <br /> <br /> Then she takes revenge ... and the rest you better see it from the film. <br /> <br /> The film I liked a lot, as the original comic characters, form a Chaos. I never had a chance to read the first part of the story in the comics, only the last of them, after passage in the film, so I can not tell you if the events as well as comics, but ... one way or another is the story of the death of the lady!
