Two films back to back, which are discussed with the Indian prisoners of war; Veer-Zaara and Deewaar. While Veer Zara was a love story about a guy who gives everything for someone, Deewaar focuses on the most important topic. He does not hide that many Indian prisoners rotting in Pakistani jails for many years - for whom none of the Indian Govt. have the time or sympathy or the other. I'm sure that some of the Pakistani prisoners in India as well, but let's focus on the movie. Full cast. Some of them were stage actors like Raguber Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of a major, well acted. Akshay Khanna well done my part. There was nothing to do Amrita Rao than a few laughs and a couple of songs. I think that the role of Sanjay Dutt was the toughest, even if it was not too long. He acted very well here, and his dialogue delivery was impressive too. If we compare it with the LOC, there was nothing but a movie day with the story takes place in all directions (if it was a story) - Deewaar well directed film that keeps a good pace and do justice to all the participants. 7.5 / 10
