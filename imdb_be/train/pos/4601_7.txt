Police Story is a stunning series of set pieces for Jackie Chan to show off their unique talents and courage. Some of the tricks are among the best and Jackie is the most dangerous fight all complex final, probably the most significant sequence Jackie fight, tougher and less comedy then say Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the battle, you can almost feel the effects of pain. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, the rest of the film falls short of this quality, it's pretty formulaic cop thriller with some comedic elements. I always prefer to JC in films such as a project, where his natural comic talent shine through. In severe within some police elements of the story, he just does not work for me. Having said that, though it is still up there with the best films from Jackies of incredible stunts and just a spectacle. <br /> <br /> As usual with Hong Kong films to avoid the English dub DVD version, as it's really awful regiment subtitles. <br /> <br /> The big tricks, good movies fine starting point if you have not seen the movie before JC and well worth seeing any fan 7/10 film
