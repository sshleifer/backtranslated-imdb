On the surface, "Written by the wind" is a lurid, glossy soap opera about sexual dysfunction Texas oil family. But underneath all this scary, social commentary on life in 1950. Director Sirko kills again with another Univeral sudser. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that the best stack friend, Rock Hudson, loved her too. If Stack finds out he is sterile and Bacall ends pregnant, fireworks fly. And, all too well, Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for portrayl largest nympho Texas, which avoided the Hudson. Good epic soap opera.
