I just love documentaries Malle. They are so simple and easy, but it is so interesting. I have no idea why this movie works. We are talking about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there, and nothing happens, really. Still Malle manages to make it fun and interesting. His love for humanity, even racist, or homophobic people is so great that you just can not help but fall in love with them too. <br /> <br /> Malle filmed most of them in 1979, he came back after 6 years to see what has changed. It would be a good movie without material 6 years later, but this little app makes it great. This may sound like Mal was just doing what was done in a series Up, but in fact it is not. Up Series about people. Mullen emphasis not so much on what happened to each person, but what happened in this community. And the change is large. 1985 Reagan era and farmers suffer. Once a proud community, now no one sees a lot of the future at all, and parents hope that their children will teach their own and do something else than agriculture. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very relevant today. Our financial crisis has started because of what happened then. Just look at these last words in the movie, uttered a senior lawyer of the city (in 1985): <br /> <br /> "Well, I have high hopes for this country because things go business today can only be described in my mind as an obsession with greed and the people does not live long with this obsession, and particularly democracy, which is ... well there - .. there is good - a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people, and they are not going to - they're not going to subscribe to this philosophy of greed, what is happening now is awful "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, spatre beat more than 20 years, and hell .. headache before it happened.
