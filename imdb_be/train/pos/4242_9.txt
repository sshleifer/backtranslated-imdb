I read the book and saw the movie. And perfectly. The film is a diamond among the coal during this period. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and to communicate the intensity of their characters without blemish. This film was supposed to make them stars. Shame on the studio not putting all that was behind this film. He could easily deductible. Release on DVD is a must, and a worthy remake to revive the film. Look for it in your TV Guide, and if you see that there is no list, no matter how late, watch. You will not be disappointed. Do yourself another favor - read the book (the same name). It will blow you away. Times have changed a lot since then, at least we like to think that they have.
