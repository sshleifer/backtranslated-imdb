This Night Listener better than people usually say. He has a weak hand, and it seems to be having a personal crisis of the genre, no doubt, but I think it's a terrible atmosphere and intriguing characteristics make for this. It all feels like one of those fireplace "it happened to a friend of mine a" ghost. One big complaint about Shagan film: but slowly, and sometimes uncomfortable to walk deliberate. Everything that takes place in the film is kept within the realm of possibility, and in real life, just as it stretches along ?? no? Therefore, there are no endings scream or strange revelation, no "dismantling" of the scene. Thank God. You have to get in the zone when viewing this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes the (relatively) good movie. Williams is not spectacular, but it easily meets the needs of history and its character should be more generic ( «No One»), because it is the man in the street, avatar, by which we are to make history. Toni Collette performance should be nominated for an Oscar (even if it may not win). Give him a chance. For quality and only the content, The Night Listener, certainly in the top twenty percent of the movies that come out these days.
