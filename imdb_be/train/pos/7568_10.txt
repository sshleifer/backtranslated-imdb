I saw it was my last day at the festival, and was glad that I stuck around that extra couple of days. Poetic, moving, and most surprising, funny, in his own strange way. It is so seldom sees the director working in this style, are able to find the real strangeness and humor in a hyper-realistic world, without sounding valuable or imbalance. It manages to seem like the improvised, but completely controlled. This I hesitate to make a comparison, because these filmmakers really digest the impact (Cassavetes, Malik, char, Altman ... Suspicious) and have found their own unique style, but if you like modern filmmakers in this tradition (Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Green ), you're for a real treat. This is a great movie and I hope more people to see it. If this film is played at a festival in your town, go! go! go!
