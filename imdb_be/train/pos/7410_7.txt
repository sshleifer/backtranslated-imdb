I happened to "shower" in the foreign film section of my local video store and gave it a few times, since it covers it looked like a farce or comedy. I then drove to copy, to buy at an economical price, and I'm happy for his success. "Shower" is the story of three (3) men, father and two (2) adult sons, one comes to terms with the changes of life, as the world around them also continues to change in today's China. Like many "foreign" films, itself Chinese culture is one of the most interesting aspects of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the exciting features of the local, the Chinese color, giving the installation of this history, is heavy, but the touching relationship between men and one woman who is involved in this story, all set on a rustic background bath. <br /> <br /> story moves from family estrangement to understanding and made me glad that I found these people. In addition to the main story are numerous small characters, baths clients and their individual conflicts and friendships. "Shower" film one goes from a smile and touched by his warmth and humanity.
