"Dangerous Offender" is the story of a seemingly anti-social girl, and how she got that way. It is based on a true story, and even though I was annoyed by one remark description, ie, when the frown, the main character, and hard-to-find, dedication to her lawyer, I have to admit that life does not imitate art, and that there are people out there like this. <br /> <br /> successful film, for me, because even though there is little to soften the behavior of the title character almost to the end, one is gradually moving in sympathy for her as the film shows how she got in its current state - which proves to be self-destruction rather than antisocial <br /> <br /> in fact the moving film that will bring a lump to my throat when. you think about it - that is often <br /> <br /> Despite the many flaws (including, it is difficult to see, sometimes, due to the functions of the body, and suicide attempts) is another production that i. proud to call Canadian.
