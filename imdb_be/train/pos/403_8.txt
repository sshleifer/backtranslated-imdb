I remember the trailer for The Legend of Zu was very impressive, and being a supporter of A Man Called Hero (my all time favorite), Storm Riders, I decided that I have to watch it too. I know that there is a way to significantly critcism acting abilities EKIN Chen everywhere, but he is my favorite Hong Kong movie star is still (way better than Nieesya Tse yet), and it is one of the factors that I enjoyed this film. Without a doubt, this film is a work of art from start to finish. I even thought that only the actors were real, and everything else was a computer at the end of this film. They have to put a lot of work in it, and they deserve a good credit for this. The storyline of the film was a fairy tale of good and evil, with a love story thrown in (I think Ekin Cheng pulls girl easily) .The story is not very intelligent and deep, but it's not what you expect when watcing militants. I wish there was more martial arts action with their fists and with his fist instead of battles with magical powers, but it is good that the life and never goes the way you want. And why do they sound like a supersonic aircraft in combat across the sky in the end? This is too funny. Legend C can not be a man by the name of the hero in my eyes, but it flows like a video game, and it's not bad at all. If the company decides to publish games on this film I will not get surprised, it bears all the elements of a video game. Good work. Please, more fantasy movies like this
