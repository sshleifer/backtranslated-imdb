This film is really special. This is a very beautiful film. Starting with three orphans, Sho, his brother and their friend Shinji Toshio, they are poor children living in the streets, but one day they were able to steal a bag of money, and then they are able to live, to buy a house, and life seems to be getting much better. They make new friends, life-friends. But something went wrong and they become enemies, and it all ends up the fact that they kill each other <br /> <br /> I was negative about this film in the beginning, because when singers (Gackt -. Solo, ex-singer in Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo singer in L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, and very well known in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese singer) tries to become actors, but it is not like other singers-actors gather , -movies. They do a great job, and no prior experience in film (for Lee-Hom, which was in two films before the exception). <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe it's a little bit because I'm really a big fan of Hayden, but - this is the movie that made me open it <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (playing the main character - an orphan Sho). It was part of the group, who wrote the script, and it was he who insisted that Hyde has to play one Sho vampire Kei. At that time they did not know each other, at least not as friends. But after the film, they have become very good friends, and it also shows us that they really worked hard on this film, and that they have good cooperation. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of different feelings, working trough history, love, hate, sorrow, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think that the first hour of the best, but it's so beautiful. After that, people are dying, Kei leaves, and changes so much. But it's still a great movie, it's the only movie that ever made me cry, it ends so sad, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> So if you have not seen this film, you really should. Because it is very good, but boring. You will not regret it. ^^
