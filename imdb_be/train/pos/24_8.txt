Despite the fact that this is obviously a low-budget production, speech and song in this film worth seeing. One of the few musical roles Walken to date. (He is a great dancer and singer, and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills, and - watch out for the wheel) also starring Jason Connery. Most children's story and a very charming characters.
