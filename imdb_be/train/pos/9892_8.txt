This movie is so cheesy goodness. <br /> <br /> heaps of people trapped in an abandoned school. They are starting to get cut off, they know that they pursue, so that they do? One girl decided to take a bath, the other decides to cheat her husband (who was also there) with an old friend, that they somehow find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) And go for it. <br /> <br /> and it comes through with baked blood and <br /> <br /> T & A., and it is also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. Where conventional 80-shredder is a reflection of how we see ourselves, and how adults see young people, or how Hollywood treats the rest of the country it has a unique perspective. This Brit film made to be an American slasher. It's fun to see how often the British actors who try to speak "American" accidentally slip back into their accents in the UK. <br /> <br /> If you want cheese 80-shredders (eg, play), then you'll like this,
