I really liked this movie! Despite the fact that there was nothing like any of them, and so far, that the classic Nancy Drew style. I've been seeing a lot of hype for this movie, and since then I was really in the book Nancy Drew I'm really high hopes for this film, and they are most definitely meet these expectations. Almost all the characters were exactly how I imagined it from reading books. I am very glad that I have seen this film. All the actors and actresses really have acted as they did, in a series of books. Ever since I saw this film, I wanted to read every Nancy Drew books are there. All the actors and actresses really got into their characters, and it definitely showed when broadcast the film on the big screen. It certainly seemed that all the actors and actresses were really in the positions that the characters were I would definitely give this movie 10 out of 10.
