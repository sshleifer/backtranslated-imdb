It's a real eye candy. Peace with floating islands and volatile ancient cities. Huge monsters, whose preferred method of attack on the cathedral hurling their opponents ... Who can resist that? An ancient prophecy, a lot of UNDERDOG heroes and cute princess in search of a hero ... ... sound familiar? Yes, we've heard this song before. But you forget that, looking at the spectacular scenery. <br /> <br /> This film is fun to watch as it goes on. But after leaving the cinema you longing for a little more history. <br /> <br /> What the 30-year-old range? What made the knight with the mind? Who built all these fabulous monuments, castles and towns ... and why they fall apart? And besides one bunch of farmers, where the people? In fact, this picture looks so intriguing, but it's not Lord of the Rings.
