I love this movie like no other. Another time, I will try to explain his dignity to the uninitiated, but for now, let me quote a few pieces of wonderful dialogue that, please remember that all ironic. Aussies and Poms understand everyone else, right? <br /> <br /> (name of the song lyric) "he can drown beer, he can choose the country in his latest double-breasted Bondi gear." <, br /> <br /> (another lyrical song) "All pommies bastards bastards, or worse, and England have a ** f-hole of the universe. " <br /> <br /> (during a television interview, "arts program"): Mr. MacKenzie, that the most impressive artists you since you were in England? (Answer Barry) Flamin 'bull-artists <br /> <br /> (while chatting naive young girl Pom): Mr. MacKenzie, I suppose, you have hordes of Aboriginal slaves back in Australia? (Answer Barry) PPA? I've never seen or my life. Mom does most of the hard yacca (ie sweat) round our place. <br /> <br /> This is just a taste of this hilarious farce Bonser Aussie flick. If you can get a copy of this, watch and enjoy.
