Â«Lion King 1 1/2" is the funniest, not the theatrical release of Disney. I recently saw the film again after not seeing him for many years. I remember the first time I saw it, I had no expectations at all and were pleasantly surprised by this highly watchable and entertaining film. <br /> <br /> Is it better than "Simba's Pride"? In many ways, yes. Although "Simba's Pride" is not bad, it does suffer from some problems: the lack of a good script and bad characteristics, which influenced which otherwise good movie <br /> <br /> Anyway :. Nice to see, Timon and Pumbaa in the face again flourish as we (or, of course, me) liked about them in this film; in "Simba's Pride", they were completely annoying, and I did not like "Timon and Pumbaa" series is also no. <br /> <br /> This film could easily be stupid one, but fortunately, the filmmakers did not take a wrong turn and focus to make this film sometimes very funny. There are a few jokes that adults can enjoy themselves. the price is pretty good. There are two new songs that are catchy and two new characters, mother in Timon (voiced by Julie known Marge Simpsons Kavner) and Uncle Max, are pleasing. The friendship between Timon and Pumbaa yavl yayutstsa touching painted. Emotional scenes are well integrated in the comic story, and does not feel to the place, which he could easily do so (especially comedies). <br /> <br /> But there is something that detracts from getting the picture 10 ? Yes vote from me, there is spite of the fact that they, fortunately, does not affect too much, but I will mention them:. 1. many of the scenes from the first film are used in this personally, it was strange to see the old scene. integrated with the new. <br /> <br /> 2. During menopause, some of the jokes becomes inaccurate. <br /> <br /> 3. Storywise, is the story of Timon and although the filmmakers are trying to integrate their history with Simba, this script does feel a little rushed at times. <br /> <br /> But hey, these details do not affect this otherwise fun movie, It's the only really acceptable Disney sequel, which should be in every movie collection.
