Larry Fessenden was broken most of the comments on this forum. Well, the biggest mistake, apparently, is the marketing of the film and the way the DVD, you may have been targeted. Obviously, this is not really a horror movie, at least not for people who expect nothing, that would be bloody and immediately satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Â«Wendigo" basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of young Miles. Things that can not be easily understood by children tend to remain in their young minds and eventually dominate our fears and threatening the world that they can not understand. It is clear that Kim's mother, a psychologist, but she has no idea to what happens in the mind of her son. It is also a story of alienation. It is clear that his father, George, is a distant figure, it may be a workaholic, who seems to be living in another world. <br /> <br /> fears Miles reach crisis point during the week end in the country, that part of the State of New York, with its winter landscape, barren trees, play havoc on the submission of a little boy. It does not help that he meets a strange figure in the city, it creates even more doubts in his young mind. Eventually, Miles the world comes crashing down on him, and he can not do anything, even causing Wendigo spirit. <br /> <br /> The film is well-paced and acted. Patricia Clarkson perfectly, regardless of where the movie is located. Jake Weber is ideal as a remote father, who has the opportunity to move closer to his son, he does not understand. Per Sullivan Erik, Milli transmits internal confusion therein. I thought he was very efficient, as the entire film Miles own view of what is happening around him. Finally, John Spredakos ideal as threatening Otis, a man who resents the world for the way he turned out. <br /> <br /> Instead of this film down, future viewers should approach it with an open heart.
