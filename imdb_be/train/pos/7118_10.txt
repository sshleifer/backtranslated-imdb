If Al Schmid was able to go home after being wounded with a terrible injury, his problems have just begun to start with my family and girlfriend to engage in. Dane Clark gave an outstanding supporting role as Lee Diamond, who did his best to help his friend Al get his life back together. There's never a complete victory in the war, and let tse will not forget all the Brave soldiers wounded veterans in hospitals of all wars and our current Iraqi vets!
