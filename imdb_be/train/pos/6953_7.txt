This is one of those movies that make the best trailers than feature films. The concept was really cool and different, humor was unique, I just felt that there were missed opportunities to put the "impact" in this movie. So many lines and jokes were left hanging for too long without a definite ending, and in fact did not leave me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris and Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes underutilized in this film, and we need more exposure, and more opportunities to twirl her character in more time on the screen. 7 out of 10 for me, a DVD rental. Also, I was looking for a good state of health of the clip during the end credits, something that has become its native brand of romantic comedy films, a la What's something about Mary, meet my parents, but then again, I was left feeling a little cheated the that it might be a much better film with a little more music and punchy kick line. He felt like it was rushed to the cinema.
