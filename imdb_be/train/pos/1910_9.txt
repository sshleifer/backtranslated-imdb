Ya. That's what I think. Of course, it was still a great show with John in it, but I personally believe that it is much better off without them. <br /> <br /> I love, the CJ and the grandfather lives in the house, because they are so funny together. <, Br /> <br /> When John was still around, I did not laugh as I am now. <br /> <br /> it's too bad that no longer produced. (I do not think that ...) because I like to see new stuff. <br /> <br /> My favorite character has to be Rory. poor Rory almost always omitted. It's always about Bridget or Carrie. WHAT ABOUT Rory !!! ??? Frankly, it's a great show, and anyone who has never seen it, you should go and see it. I can almost guarantee you will laugh. Well even chuckle.
