The film took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is nice to see, and it shows how a man he was. His relationship with Harilal is that Gandhi was concerned and mentioned it several times, as his failure as a father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big gripe is that I thought that Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the film. It would be better to act the man who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too self-righteous, and seemed as if he was deliberately portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> film really is not all-round, but focused only on narrowly father-son relationship. The rest is blurry and only used to indicate the time frame and the general settings of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie, if you keep in mind that this is not a complete picture.
