dramatizations are often a big mistake. They often go like a film camera was just placed on the stage (for example, as "Night Mother"). Direction Sidney Lumet film keeps alive, it is particularly difficult, because the picture is not offered him any real problems. However, it's nice to look at what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is very brilliant. The dynamics of their strange relationship. Caine is fantastic, as always, and Reeve gets one of his few chances to actually operate. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I have never seen a play by Ira Levin, but I heard that the adaptation of Jay Presson Elena correct. The script is incredibly confusing, and keeps you guessing. «Deathtrap» is a very interesting film, and is recommended for almost all lovers of stage and screen. <br /> <br /> 7.4 10
