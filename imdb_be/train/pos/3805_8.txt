I was not surprised after watching the trailer that the film did not do it in theaters, so I ordered a BluRay. I had a great time watching it, and I must say that this film is better than some of the big animated films there. Of course, it does have its flaws, but I can still recommend it for sure. The animation is well done, very interesting and unique, and the story kept me watching the whole way through. Some of the magnificent backdrop is simply stunning, and you can see the French talent behind it. I thought that the performance of Forest Whitaker feels a bit lifeless, but this is a character Lian-Chu is depicted in this film. So all in all, thumbs up, I liked it a lot and I hope it is successful enough for all the studios involved to continue to do more films like this. I would recommend to give it a chance and be surprised at how big the film can be with such a small budget. Hector is one worth watching the film, as some of its moments trails as funny.
