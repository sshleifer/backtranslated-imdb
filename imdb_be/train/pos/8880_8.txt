From life (certain) colleges. Of course, there were artistic license taken, but some of what you've seen in this film continues in some colleges. <br /> <br /> I went to college in Southern California, where the race pretty much stuck with their own. It's funny, because it is a school that want racial unity, equality, etc., and I can honestly say that it is there. But the fact is, when the class is released, or when they are just hanging out in anticipation of the class, they (students) seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity. Is that bad? Not really. Everyone needs a sense of belonging. But, as in the school work of one of the schools that I visited once he wrote that "we should all try to stick with the students of other nationalities and try to learn them." Otherwise, you create your own segregation. <br /> <br /> Racism, of course, exist in one of these schools that I have visited. One day someone put a flyer around campus spoke of the greatness of the Aryan race and had some of these symbols of racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened, the incident in the film where a young Caucasian man went away and began to shoot in the collection of multiculturalism. <br /> <br /> I can only hope and pray that nothing like this will never happen. <, Br /> <br /> Yes, "higher education" is too dramatic? Exaggerated? Maybe. Is there a way to "eliminate the sign?" It depends on where you go or go to school. The race thing, where ethnic groups just stick out from their own case. Less exaggeration of Hollywood, the race thing got pretty close to home for me.
