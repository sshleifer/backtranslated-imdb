Robert Duvall is a direct descendant of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, according to imdb.com films based data. After watching this movie, you may think, the appearance of Duval is the reincarnation of it better. One of my favorite movies. I wanted a composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick was a CD or soundtrack was available. Beautiful scenery and music and "all too true to life", especially for those of us who live, or have moved to the south. This "real time." Life goes on, slowly, but "we are still not a stranger."
