I was very young when it happened in the US, but I wrote it down on the TV and watched it over and over again, until I did not have it all memorized. Until now, I still find myself to quote him. The show was fun and had a lot of well-known characters, from Frank Sinatra, Sylvester Stallone, to Mr. T. voices were great and sounded just like the characters they show. Puppets were also well done, although a little creepy. I was surprised to learn recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor Red Dwarf, a show that I also enjoy very much. As another person wrote in the comments before, I, too, had been robbed of this great show at the "friend" who borrowed it and never returned it. I'm sure he wanted was enough demand for the show to ensure the DVD release, but I do not think enough people have heard of it. Well, maybe I'll try to E-Bay ...
