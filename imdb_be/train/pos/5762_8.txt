I must admit, to enjoy a bad movie. I love them, I watch them all. Horror especially. My friends and I are going after the hard week at school and at work, pull off some crazy bands, pizza and explosion. This one had a big box, so I was expecting less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story of the housing project, which is built over the nuclear facility, which had elevated layers bulldozer and other underground layers just closed. Residents of this neighborrhood find a covered object when some children fall into the hole inside the cave. It wakes up a few zombies. <br /> <br /> From this point on, it's a piece-city. Gore effects and action will never stop until the end credits roll. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not great art, but this one, with his dialogue in earnest and over-the-top disgusting stuff was our favorite evening. In fact, it was one of the best "party bands" I have ever had the pleasure of watching. And you could say that it was done without money, with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks Brendan Fraser (he has a cameo), and it's just a wild ride.
