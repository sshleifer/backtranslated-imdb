All who are desperate looks at the void and weaknesses of the latest productions Disney Studios', here's what you need to heal your wounds ... once and for all, Flick life brings evidence that cleaner synthetic paintings spend a good scenario is more interesting than the fake "manual-old-Disneys-like" image (see the Lion King, Pocahontas, and all the latest shows, where you unfortunately regret that magical background and atmosphere of Bembo are gone forever). <br /> <br /> A Bug's Life (! 1001 Pattes to my fellow French cinemaniaks) manages to avoid all the disadvantages that make you wake up in the middle of the movie and say, "Hey, this business PC!". No weak parts, a huge effort, showing its effectiveness in the backgrounds and general appearance sets, amazing 3D bird (close to perfection in their imitation of reality) ... and that's just not mention the technical aspects. <, Br /> <br /> scenario, my friends, is the real basis of the movie has a certain thickness! It is interesting that, obviously, thanks to Lasseter's team, there is virtually no musical sequence in the life of a beetle. This means that the history of a long and rich enough to get rid of these 3 or 4 minutes, that some children appreciate, but most others do not like (the same for parents or anime fans, like me). This movie reminded me of a very old film starring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase in the 3 Amigos; it was basically the same background story (the whole Mexican village lives in fear of a few bad guys hired gunmen (who eventually become to be actors), to protect them, etc ...). Simple, but effective, and brilliantly adapted to the ant colony terrified faces the wrath of the evil insects. <br /> <br /> As a microcosm of many of the films talk about insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I think that life is a funny bug and best director of all. humanization process was fine there ... And the whole audience captivated Flick (aka Tilt in France) adventure. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much for the team Lasseter, especially in the last 30 seconds. .. so strange and great at the same time to see the whole theater got into laughter while the error / actors forget their lines or hit the camera ... <br /> <br /> And finally, especially for those of you who have seen the French version, other greetings with dubbing actors who have made a great synchronous work on this film. Life beetle is a really good piece of entertainment, and I think that will soon become a part of my video collection (privileges granted to very few films, and it's not a problem of storage space :). Go and see it, it's an order.
