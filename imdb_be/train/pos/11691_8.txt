Great movie when I saw it. I must say, one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen 8 times in theater and received a DVD. When I got older and saw it again, I realized that the film in the middle. Compared with the films, which are known advertising good comedys, it's nothing. I mean Rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching racial material breaks barriers a little, and it's great. In addition, the idea of ​​how the film is a good way of thinking. It is, like most of the thought of the movie, but also a little twist, which is a very nice touch. I like the film as a whole, so I give him ... <br /> <br /> still a good 7/10 for me.
