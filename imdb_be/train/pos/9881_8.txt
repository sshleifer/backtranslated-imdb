In West Hollywood, this goes hand rough bunch who, when they came into the city, celebrated quite hardy. After all, the following controls were lonely thing back in the day, before the railways have received all of the United States. NO <br /> <br /> drovers, who worked on the trail boss Gil Favor, both played by Eric Fleming did not differ. But Fleming was the man of the business, he had a job to do and hired a top team to do it. <br /> <br /> On the long term, rawhide, and the fact that the regulars stayed with her for the most part, we need to know all the mushers at some point. And some point storylines focused around all of them, although most were with Fleming and Clint Eastwood's character Yates Road, No. 2 guy in the herd. <br /> <br /> Western way Clint Eastwood was cast on hides and skins, it is a shame that they have not shown more often. Probably because they were made in black and white. If this was the show NBC, it would be done in color as Bonanza and work as often as these shows. We got to see so much more the man who became a legend move. <br /> <br /> Ironically, it was Eric Fleming, who left the show before it closes to make films. He made a couple of them, and hoped that the show would give him a Bankable movie title. Unfortunately, he was killed on the spot film does gunman, drowned in the river. If he had lived, he might have become a name like Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Clint took over as the next boss in the last season, and then the show finished its run. And he, of course, he became an icon today, not only in the Western genre. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was cruel Western, which had some tough guys in it. this one without frills, they were not working cowboys simply doing the work and struggle of the elements, and regardless of the situation, they were thrown in every year. <br /> <br /> They do not make TV shows like this anymore. What a pity.
