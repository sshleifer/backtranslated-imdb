Zentropa has much in common with the third person, another noir-like film is set amid the rubble of postwar Europe. As TTM, there are many inventive camera work. There is an innocent American who gets emotionally with a woman that he really does not understand, and whose innocence all the more striking in comparison with the locals. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that the third person has a well thought out storyline. Zentropa little way in this regard. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream / nightmare and makes it too coherent spoil the effect. <br /> <br /> This film is relentlessly grim - "noir" in more than one sense; one never sees the sun shines. Dark, but intriguing and frightening.
