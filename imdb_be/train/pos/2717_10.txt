I can not remember the details of the show, but I remember how hot I was about it, and I was determined not to miss a single episode. Unfortunately, at that time we did not have a VCR, so I never saw the series. But I remember how much I felt, watching and how excited I was every time it came on. Sam Waterstone's was my favorite actor these days (I think I was almost in love), and it remains one of my favorite actors of the day, mainly because of its appearance in the series. I would love to buy / steal / upload this series, I think I would go to great lengths to see it again and revise childhood long gone ... Any ideas? Does anyone know of a website dedicated to the series, or has episodes on tape from their first airing?
