This film is a documentary by half ... and it's very interesting .... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie ... is based on the true story of how a bunch of Norwegian saboturs failed to stop the production of heavy water Rukjan, Norway and getting rid of the rest of the heavy water to Germany. <br /> <br /> This film is not perfect, and it could be a little better ... the best part of the movie, some of saboturs themselves play !!! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the history of the Second World War and the film is a film that is worth seeing !!
