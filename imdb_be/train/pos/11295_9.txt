This film has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a 12-year-old child in 1962 when he was featured on the "Late Show" television station in Los Angeles. Symbols are very involved from the beginning of the picture, and it's too bad that the film has never been released on videotape, and not always shown on television (apparently because of the ban on the estate Moss Hart, playwright / producer / director who I wrote the story for the first time and presented it on stage in New York during the second world war - the reason for the refusal of his show is difficult to see more than 50 years after it was made). I have not seen this film once again for more than 30 years, if someone who actually was the main member of the cast of the film I was able to "bootleg" copy to VHS (poor video quality, but good sound). My memory of him was right: it was still interesting and fun movie to watch. A surprising aspect of this film, how many of their stars, is just starting his career at the time in 1944) continued to become a major movie star, or at least well known and are fully engaged actors (such as Judy Holliday Edmond About 'Braen, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman") Reeves, red buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill). Scenes from B-24 Liberators terrible, especially close-up shot, where the giant parts (at the time) 4-bomber (18,000+ then made, now almost disappeared) can be seen. A good understanding of the different levels of training that the student pilot of the past on their way to be assigned to a bomber crew (of course, is very biased, as has been the trend of the day: once people become pilots, women are just supporting them in their role - hardly acceptable in the modern world). I hope that someday he will be released on video for a new generation to enjoy.
