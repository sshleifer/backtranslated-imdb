I was so surprised when I saw this film so badly underestimated ... I can understand why some of you do not like this movie. His pace is slow, the characteristic of Japanese films. However, if you are absorbed in the film, like me, you find it's not a problem at all. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is the best comedy I have ever seen. "Shall We Dansu?" often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedy. It is very different from the Hollywood of them, such as Austin Powers, or the horrors in which the gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes. Most likely, this lighthearted film that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, because it makes me feel "real". The plot is simple yet pleasant. I was so glad to see that Sugiyama (leading role) has found the meaning of life in dance. Before I watched the movie, I was a bit depressed due to heavy schoolwork. I felt lost. However, this movie made me think about the bright side of life. I felt that I was in the same boat Sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why can not I? It reminded me of "exploring my own future" and discovers happiness in my daily life. <br /> <br /> It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may find the dance scenes, not as perfect as you would expect, I kind of like it, how it makes me feel that the characters really "live", learn to dance, as the film goes on. <br /> <br /> as a whole, this film is encouraging and heart warming. In the comedy, it does its job perfectly. It certainly deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br /> And let Aoki funny :-D
