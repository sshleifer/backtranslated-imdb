I must admit that when I read the description of the genre on Netflix, as "evaporate RomanceÂ» I was a bit skeptical. "Steamy"? In the film, since 1968 ?? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized that it was shot entirely in black and white, I knew that my erotic expectations were not met. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! Not only that, this film has all the elements evaporate romantic - opening of the first love, the fear of the mystery of the future revealed, suddenly unexpected end - but sometimes this film was very erotic. You soon forget that it is shot in black and white. Cinema deserves every honor he has received over the years. And the performances of the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) intense and memorable. Okay, so they are both in their mid-twenties, who are trying to play schoolgirls. It's 1968. Do you really expect teenagers from the 60s to be able to effectively explore lesbian love story like this? Many adult women are still struggling to get to grips with their sexuality then. Anyone looking for a real teenager is expecting too much. <br /> <br /> I think that this film was far ahead of its time. eroticism level was unexpected pleasure; but it still managed to leave a lot of imagination, preferring instead to give us a poetic description to add to what we were shown. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt, lesbians do not identify themselves with the characters here. As for you straight guys who like to watch a lesbian in action: Despite the fact that there will be all that you would expect, I do not think you will be too, too disappointed.
