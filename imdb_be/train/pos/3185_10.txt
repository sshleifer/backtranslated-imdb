endearing tale ........ ten voted against all high for my age and sex ... not so much comedy (in comparison with I nearly wet the film itself), though quite funny. Sun supporter musicals exactly, probably a little too much for me, but they give you time to grab a drink or a soda without missing anything important. maybe the fiftieth version when Harry met sally? Ahab Niya is not much, but if it's in your top ten as my you do not like this movie. in fact, he just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling, reminding you that the novel can and should be like a shoot for. my resume describes it best in a few words ..... very charming
