It's Black History Month, and I look at the achievements of many African-Americans in the film in chronological order, I got this film on VHS from the library because Duke Ellington and his orchestra were in it. Their version of jazz Franz «Rhapsody» Liszt was the highlight of this largely mysterious murder too long-musical comedy mix. Many of the other rooms, which I liked, was Kitty Carlisle especially "Sweet Marijuana" Carl Brisson in "Cocktails for Two" and his duet with Carlisle on that before, and those of Gertrude Michael, well, as a woman, you You love to hate. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen, is likely to go a bit too long their banter love / hate as a producer and a detective, but they grow on you. And Toby Wing sexy tease dumb as Nancy, who is always trying to say something but gets Oakie "Not now" from him every time. While many of the characters have a motive for murder that happen, I was not surprised by the discovery of who did it. And get a load as naked women here (although, of course, covered their breasts or their hands or some flimsy top). It was very obvious, previously code. Worth a look for any movie buff interested in this sort. PS As a longtime resident of Louisiana, I like it when someone noted who was born here, as Carlyle was a native of New Orleans.
