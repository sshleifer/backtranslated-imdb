Twelve Monkeys is an insane time travel, action film star Bruce Willis, who plays James Cole, a man who travels back in time to gather information about a devastating plague that comes in November 1996. Unfortunately, it goes back too far 1990, where everyone thinks he's crazy. <br /> <br /> This film is exciting and has great acting performances from Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve Monkeys is one of the largest travel time, films that I believe everyone can enjoy. Terry Gilliam has created a true masterpiece <br /> <br /> 10/10
