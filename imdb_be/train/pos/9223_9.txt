Ashanti is very 70s kind of film (1979, to be exact). It reminded me of the Wild goose on the road (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa). This is a very good movie, too, and I enjoyed it a lot. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caine) is a doctor working in Africa and was married to a beautiful woman named Ashanti Anansa (Beverley Johnson), who taught medicine in America, as well as a doctor. While they are treated, one day she was snatched by slave traders, working in Arabic slaver called Suleiman (playing great Peter Ustinov, all people). The rest of the movie, David is trying to get her back. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is a brilliant actor, of course, plays a character who is very determined and willing to do anything to get his wife back, and hopeless with the gun and action thing. He helped the first Englishman to campaign against the slave trade, no one recognizes what is happening (Rex Harrison!), Then for a short time, a helicopter pilot (William Holden), and then the Arabic name of Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has a bone to pick with Suleiman (he is very intense throughout, very lovable character), and so rides off with David to find it and get Anansa ago - this includes the wonderful scene in which David fails miserably to get on a camel . <br /> <br /> Then there's a lot of adventures. There's also a lot of morale survey. The course of history a little predictable with this item, and there are some liberties taken with conspiracy to move things along faster, but it's quite forgivable. The question is whether David will reach Anansa, before Peter Ustinov sells it to Omar Sharif (yes, Omar Sharif is in it!)?
