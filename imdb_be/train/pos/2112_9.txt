In Budapest Sallavano (Clara Novak) gets a job as a clerk in the gift shop; There she Bickers with my partner James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). The two do not apply to work because everyone fell in love with an invisible pen pal. Watching Ernst Lubitsch to direct these stars through the inevitable predictable satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> Even better sub-plot involving the store owner Frank Morgan (as Hugo their spouses) who suspects his wife of having an affair. Hiring a private detective, Mr. Morgan acknowledges his wife of 22 years who have sex with one of his young employees. Morgan, painfully aware "She just did not want to grow old with me", and the secondary characters is what keeps this film from aging. <br /> <br /> ********* Shop Around the Corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Sallavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
