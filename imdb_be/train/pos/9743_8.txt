At first we saw this film at the festival of new Argentine films in 2000, Walter Reed. Although we liked it, we thought it was unusual. Watching it a second time, we found a different meaning in this view of life in Buenos Aires. <br /> <br /> The film is set in one of the darkest days in Argentina, as the administration DeLaRua ended. The country was in despair after the economy that flourished in the early 1990s, under the climate-President Menen created. It was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen, and people got themselves a living nightmare. <br /> <br /> The story begins the same way as Santamarina, a bank employee, was dismissed because of the collapse of the economy. Instead of getting sympathy from his wife, she locks him out of the apartment, and it is for all practical purposes, become homeless. He takes to the streets, trying to make ends meet. <br /> <br /> Another story introduces us to Ariel, a young Jew, a job interview in the Spanish company. It's almost a miracle that it gets the job done. His father, Simon, has a small restaurant in the Jewish quarter "El-Once» in the city center. Things are going from bad to worse when her mother suddenly dies Ariel. Only Estel, a young woman who is in love with Ariel, comes to the aid of the father and son. <br /> <br /> Santamarina, who is a pure man should seek to take a shower where he can. He chooses the women's room in one of the metro stations. If the minister, Elsa finds him naked, she flies into a rage, but it comes to life when she realizes that the unfortunate circumstances of this man who has seen better days. They began a romantic relationship, and Santamarina in one of his trips to the garbage outside, finds a baby. Elsa, while surprised, wants to do the right thing. But Santamarina convinces her sense of innocent life in their lives will be cemented their love. <br /> <br /> Ariel, who met a beautiful Laura at work, begins the rapid and severe sexual affair with his beautiful co-worker, he does not know is involved in a lesbian is. Ariel, which is free lance photographing weddings and other occasions, feels passion for Laura, but he realizes that Estelle donated to help his father and still loves him. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman, whose "El Abrazo Partido» we thought it was great, has done wonders with this film. Things are put in proper perspective after the second show in the recent past and we have to apologize, that did not see it the first time. Anyway, this is the second time, the screen nuances play Mr. Burman and Emiliano Torres wrote more sense, because they reflect the turmoil that the country lives in those dark times. <br /> <br /> Daniel Handler, who plays Ariel, collaborated with Mr. Burman, before unexpected results. He did not "movie star pretty", but it was beautiful. This actor projects a great sincerity in his work. Enrique Payniro another wonderful surprise. Santamarina it disarms. Despite all the bad things that have fallen on it, it keeps the pink attitude to everyone he meets. Sandrelli, an interesting Italian actress, is making a great contribution to film with her Elsa. Alter, one of the best Argentinean actor plays a small role of Simon. Magnificent Chiara Coselli regarded as Laura and Melina Petrielli is both noble Estel. <br /> <br /> «Esperando al Mesias» proves Daniel Burman, the vote will be considered in the Argentine cinema.
