Continuation of the popular ever Cinderella story reminded me more of what they have done with one of the Beauty and the Beast movie. It is basically three novels rolled into 1. <br /> <br /> Well, adorable mouse (I love Gus! He is sooo cute!), And Lucifer country (as usual). I loved some of the new characters, as well as, (Pom Pom was beautiful, and I did as Prudence.). However, the plot was somewhat limited, but still very cute. Therefore, I am voting 7/10.
