As many know, the Mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called Golden Age of Mexican cinema, fortunately, in the end of 90s and at the beginning of the 21st century, big films like La Ley de Herodes, Baja California, Amores Perros, Y Tu Mamá también and, of course, El Coronel many Tiene Quien le Escriba, appeared. El Coronel ... it's a great film that retells the classic story of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, removing the magical elements of realism, and replacing them with the raw reality of living in Mexico, not only people, as a colonel, who is waiting for their pensions, but more than half of the Mexican people who live in absolute poverty. The film characters, satirically represent classic symbols found in Mexican society, such as the nationalist colonel, cold, and even the ambitious priest, hypocrites, but at the same time loyal compadre, tolerant and patient wife, latent homosexual, etc. This movie is a must-see if you want to learn more about Mexican society, and especially if you want to see a great movie, one of the best Mexican film directors
