After Chicago, I began to lose all respect for Richard Gere, and then along came the flock. There's just still a nice smile and a few facial expressions stock you can get, but it proved to me that he finally got into the hands of the business and can act with the best of them. Danes are also great, as his "intern / replacement." Some have suggested that there was too much unnecessary violence, but I do not see it that way. I saw nothing detracts from the strength of the film. I was really shocked, I never heard of it were published in the theater and stumbled upon it in Blockbuster instead. Truly exceptional film with the right combination of action, suspense, thrill and the public consciousness. As well as 7even? Well, maybe. And you'll see better acting with Gere, than anyone ever received from Pete.
