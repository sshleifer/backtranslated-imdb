Well, I am from Bulgaria, where it is almost impossible to have a tornado, but my imagination tells me to be "very, very afraid" !!! This guy (Devon Sawa) has done a great job with this film! I do not 'know exactly how old he was, but he did not act like a child (WELL DONE) Now about the tornado that was not very realistic, but it frightens you if you want to spend your time watching TV! - it's a movie!
