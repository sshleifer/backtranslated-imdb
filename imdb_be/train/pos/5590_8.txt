(There is no need to summarize the plot, as others have already done it.) <br /> <br /> It is clear that many spectators find fault with the film raised, as we have with today's frenetic sensurround Cineplex experience. Against this backdrop, the film, as ecstasy seems to have lost his way in from another planet. I think there are a few good reasons. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, the film unfolds poetically, as the camera pans slowly surrounding hills, trees, clouds, etc., providing a tranquil and lyrical sense of the natural world, which unites a man and a woman in her bosom. Together they show the style and size is almost completely absent from modern technology-driven movie, where a hasty editing of works to divert the attention of the audience, rather than concentrating it. Moreover, history is transmitted to the eye, not the ear, almost without dialogue, to explain what is happening. This is equivalent to another extreme departure from the present tariff is very literal, where visual effects, it seems only count if they excite the spectators. But perhaps the most unsettling-- sometimes scary movie quietly, not in the sense that silent films are quiet, so we expect that they will. But in the sense that the characters rarely talk, if we wait for them. Thus, the burden of history is divided between the director and the audience. The former has to choose his visual cunning way to convey the story, while the latter need to think about the visual, since they will not be explained. <br /> <br /> All this is not intended to humiliate -Making a film today. It is simply to point out that the film is Machaty comes from a completely different aesthetics from the one we have today. I do not claim to be any better or worse. Nevertheless, I would argue that ecstasy is a perspective completely absent from the current movie continues to experience, where such "abstract values ​​are usually released as a slow and sad. <br /> <br /> The film is not a masterpiece, but sometimes it reaches artistic heights as in the beautifully drawn beer garden scene with his ultimate camera crane lifts to reveal a beautiful Tableau below. Slow pan countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life, of nature and regeneration also perfectly expressed. This kind of scene, not overwhelm you, but instead-- considering gender-chance-- accumulate quietly in the experience as memorable in its own way, like a spine tingling diversity in "Jaws." <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film sometimes heavy-handed, as in the fields Machaty images, particularly in the final work-to-ode sequence. It's hard to know what to make of this very destructive presence. Perhaps the symbolism associated with the heroic size that hard work has a place for love Lorn hero and people general-- theme then moves influential Soviet cinema. Nevertheless, its presence here is quite tedious overly done. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I must admit that I initially set up to see a beautiful naked Hedy Lamarr. But now I must admit that in the process I also got a lot more than just a cover-ku romp in the woods.
