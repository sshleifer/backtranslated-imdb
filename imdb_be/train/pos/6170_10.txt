I saw this movie at the Film Festival in Taos movie last year and was amazed by this. It is a rich, warm novel brought to the screen, perfectly acted and directed. Most of all it reminded me of David Lean films, both in its ability to handle complex history, and his knack for creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels. The best movie I've seen in years.
