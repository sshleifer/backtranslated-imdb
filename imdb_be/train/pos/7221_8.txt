Every time you think you have a handle on the trap, another plot twist comes. It's best to just sit back and enjoy the ride on this. Most known for his on-screen kiss between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (who, unfortunately, cut from the TV version I've seen), this film has much more to recommend it. <br /> <br /> Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a very unhappy man. After a successful playwright, his last several plays on Broadway have flopped. And while his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) is nothing but as support, both in monetary and emotional sense, it does little to make Sydney feel better. To add insult to injury, the young playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), just sent Sidney game to watch. This Anderson first, and Sydney can see that the young man is a gifted writer. He joked to his wife that he should invite Anderson again, kill him and to play as your own. She was laughing at him at first, but when Sidney actually invited Anderson to dinner, she was worried that it might be really put his scheme into effect. And her fears may be justified simply ... <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant script. There are twists and turns throughout the story, and they are coming faster and harder as you get closer to the end. It's kind of a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat from the beginning and keeps you there all the time. An absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb. Caine gives his usual outstanding performance, and he has shown a knack for the game are cultured, refined and intelligent people. Reeve also provides excellent visualization of the human, which is not so wide-eyed and innocent as it seems. franticness Cannon works well for the World. And Irene Worth gives a good idea as the nosy neighbor who is also a psychic. <br /> <br /> This is a film with the ending you never expected, and repeated the vigil will pick up on the things missing in the earlier views. Unsung classic, unfortunately, only be remembered for the scene, which ruffled some feelings at the time - and it's a real shame.
