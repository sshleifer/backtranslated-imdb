Blonde and Blonder have Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene, and if you want more from a film you need to be completely unreasonable. It feels like a late Carry On, when the series is not blazing the trail, but it was more funny than not, think back or England, and you will not be too far from the truth. Pamela and Denise are bubbly, charming and clearly understood it is not a masterpiece, they do, but you can give it to me for a lot of things that I could tell. The supporting cast are energetic, even if some of them are not particularly good; I can not see a couple of turns Duff in the film, which is already almost forgotten makes a big difference to anything, so just smile. I really think that the Blonde and Blonder ace, and I hope that you hate me for it.
