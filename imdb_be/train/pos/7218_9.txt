Deathtrap works like playing in a movie about who did what to whom, as it mostly occurs on the same set. A prerequisite is that an experienced playwright, whose star falls, gets a great manuscript from a former student, so he plans to leave his protégé and assign it to play to (loud) protests of his wife. Or so you think, in the first half of the film. Past the halfway mark on, Deathtrap starts throwing in turns and surprises that make putting it on his head, and then right around and then mad at your back, all the while keeping its name is appropriate. This is a great mystery of the film is steeped in wit. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine as a senior playwright, plays himself in the film - a bit crazy and very dramatic Brit. No surprises here - it does not make their usual good job. He gets the best line of traps, which he performs perfectly: "What is your definition of success, as a group strikes in state prison?» <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve, on the other hand, juggles comedy and drama in a surprising performance plays an ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. He also gets to show off his very toned body, which he must have retained catch a movie Superman. <br /> <br /> Kane and Reeve collaborated in another film, which is one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. It also revolves around the game as well, although this time Caine is a director and an actor Reeve. They were joined by veteran comic Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu HENNER (taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together, they demonstrate that the calamity will fall on the bed-hopping cast and crew play. On the surface, the film looks mostly a farce, but when watching, you will find that they are a lot of subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch. Wish this was an underrated film is available on DVD.
