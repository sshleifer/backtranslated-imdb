Will all of you please lay hell exclude Todd letters!?! Let's give you $ 30,000 to make the film and see what you come up with! The guy was a zombie and 735 regular cast work for free! Of course, acting funny at times. Yes, make Sun the greatest you'll ever see. But this is not the worst either, if you want to see that go to watch Nation zombie zombies with his raccoon. <br /> <br /> It's clean, good old fashioned Guerilla shooting! Todd is a professional and all-around nice guy. There are holes in the plot, yes. The plot seems contrived. But what the hell, I still love this movie. I would like to Todd Sheets come out of hiding and make a remake of this, he's going to. If anyone ever tried to make a film, they know that it ended, an achievement in itself.
