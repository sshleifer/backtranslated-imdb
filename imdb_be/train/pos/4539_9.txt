Act pretty bad, but for the people in this area to in the '80s and now Detroit area automotive engineers, this is a great movie. I even work with the Japanese supplier, so that makes this film even more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Jay Leno show its age last night on The Tonight Show! He looks quite young here ... 17 years ago. The first scene, a drag race that seems, Woodward Ave was great. <br /> <br /> Lena also has some bad ** cars now, it would be cool to see e remake this with its modern collection. I'm sure the Corvette exploded in the first stage was his own car. <br /> <br /> A typical 80s film. Watch and enjoy. No computer generated crap!
