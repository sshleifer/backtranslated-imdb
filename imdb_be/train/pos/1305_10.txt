This movie took me by surprise when he started in the cafe, located in Arizona and Richard Creek, (Rex), Â«Dead Easy", "04, decides that something is, and gets all hot and bothered over a very hot, sexy waitress. In while Rex comes out of the coffee shop, he sees a patrol and asked him, "you will quickly?" and then all hell loose in more ways than one. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Dressed to Kill," "80, is TV journalist and is always looking for the scoop news broadcast. Maggie completed in the hot tub and Rex comes calling her to tell her that he wants to show down, western style, with local top cop in the city. This is another film, however, Nancy Allen and Richard Creek are the only actors who are helping this picture together!
