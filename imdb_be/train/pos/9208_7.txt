"Shooter" was a different type of film for Michael Dudikoff. Although usually associated with a click action, which include martial arts, this film, because it was the West, allowed him to show that he is far more capable actor than some formula storylines allowed. <br /> <br /> The main problem, of course, is that the film does not allow the development of good character. Fleshing really left up to the viewer. We can only guess, in sadness, which made Shooter, whose real name is Michael Atherton, the murderer that he is a murderer this- note that a small town, terrorizing the local bully, welcomed as a hero who can liberate it from its suffering.
