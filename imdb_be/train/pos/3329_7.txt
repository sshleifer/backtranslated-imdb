The only reason I saw this film was for Jimmy Fallon, who I had a crush on since 9th grade, which was his first year on SNL. I am a diehard fan of the Yankees, and I did not find the movie painful to the last 15 minutes, when they begin to show clips of the ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make little noise, so I do not want to hear that should not be heard, but otherwise he was quite tolerable. <br /> <br /> I thought that Jimmy was a very well played a role, because the character was supposed to be nervous and shifty, and he nervous and agile guy. I know that it can not be stretched Academy awards, but the movie is just a light, fun, romantic comedy, which is really suitable for women and men to see. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had much better chemistry on camera than any other actor in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in this stupid movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career before him, and thank God, because the taxi could have killed him. I think, Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting abilities, because he is just starting out in the movies. I believe that it must be difficult, and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you will see that they have started in some failures. Busom Friends? Australian soap operas? Here's wishing Jimmy successful career on the screen. I never wanted to go away from the SNL, but what can you do?
