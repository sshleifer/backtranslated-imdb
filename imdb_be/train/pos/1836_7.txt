Time For A Hit! <br /> <br /> Waqt DIR- Vipul Shah Amrutlel buildings of welded Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Razhpal Yadav and Bohm Iran. Written each specific Aatish Kapadia *** Reyting- <br /> <br /> Eureka! We got it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen ?? in Vipul Shah's "Station", we are likely to find this year's first bona fide hit. Crammed with all the necessary ingredients of the commercial tariff Bollywood, «Waqt» is all that is necessary for the film to click with the Indian audience. This kind of film that makes the distributor to feel happy and to contemplate his next visit phoren! In this "epic of Indian emotions," we have a happy family (not always?) Of the three. Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), the postman-turned-millionaire (do not ask how! ... have something to sell toys in the delivery of letters and all that ?? seriously-, who gives a damn!), Married to the SUMI (Shefali Shah) He is a caring father Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar has to take a serious decision about the careless attitude of his son to a life of responsibility. His love for Aditya, though, leads to a tightening of its major problems. However, faced with a situation that will test their race against time, Ishwar has no alternative but to give Aditya a house in the hope that a new difficult situation could make it more diligent life of its own. But this alleged decision becomes a problem in itself, as the gap between those who love increases Father-Son and the fence continues to grow. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a rocket-scientist to understand that this story gives ample opportunity to infuse comedy and drama, yes. Thus, the previous interval you have initially funny, annoying later comedy trail Bohm Iran and Razhpal Yadav; and after an interval has to OX handkerchief moments between Aby and acca! Writer Aatish Kapadia (he also wrote the original play guzharatskoy «Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu», on which the film is based) does a good job of keeping the narrative liquids. Conversations tend to get inconsistent at times. It does not help that the songs appear as acne on the face and spoiled teenager production. The pair of numbers may have been completed. On the directing front, Vipul shows that he has a natural instinct of the story. "Station", as well as his earlier debut effort "Aankhen", manages to keep you interested until the last reel. On a personal NOTE swing of emotions were a bit choppy for me. But gauging the audience reaction, he worked on the handle. <br /> <br /> Finally, the "Station," all of his performances were one point in the overall ranking! Amitabh Bachchan reliable as always. His energy is visible and so its age! Operations resin in finely nuanced performance and corresponds superstar at every step. Bohm and Razhpal bring the house down with their theatricality. Priyanka has little general, you perform the role of the heroine casually. If it all comes down, though, "Station" is in the car Akshay. I have always maintained that Akki as well as the role suits him. Put him in "Marry me", and it is fantastic, but «Bewafaa» he frustratingly bad. Here, acca, probably at its best. Whether it is his time comic or emotional visualization, it is almost perfect. There's also a scene of action for their fans! Ironically, his previous best attempt was «Aankhen'- with the same director and Big B on his side! <br /> <br /> "Station" in no way does not remember the movie. It's not one that will be featured in the best films of our industry. But it is one for the masses. ! And at a time when the industry is desperately waiting for a universal hit "Train Station" just might do the trick <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Trivia- This is the second consecutive Akshay Kumar film after «Bewafaa», in which he performs on stage during a climax! <br /> <br /> *** <br Reyting-/> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** *** Good * Very Good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> April 22, 2005
