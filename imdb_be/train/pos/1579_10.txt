I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation! This film tells the story of how, as far as I know, has never been said before - namely Rosenstrasse married (the street in Berlin) German uprising gentile women with the Jews at the end of the Second World War. Thus, it is a unique story, and what's more, it's the only film about the Holocaust that I have ever seen, which indicates that there were good Germans (which helps the family in the "Anne Frank", for example, were the Dutch) that does not support the Nazis, and, in fact, had the courage to speak out against the immorality and cruelty of their country during the Nazi regime, risking their very lives. Great acting across the board, framing the story in New York, an interesting and intricate, the direction of von Trotta workshops in each scene, and the production values, including beautiful cinematography, outstanding. Of course, the family in New York, could speak German. Many immigrants in this country prefer to speak in their native language with their family - a common phenomenon. So that criticism is unfounded. To say more will spoil the experience. The film is long, but I do not look at my watch once. I hope this film gets a spread in North America, not just this film a masterpiece, but it can really help to cure any hostility people have in relation to the Germans because of their support of Hitler. If the movie is playing in your area, I encourage you to see it! You'll be glad you did!
