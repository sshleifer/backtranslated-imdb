Future Things really a classic work of speculative fiction; as an essay on the destructive nature of war and the horrors of progress. This makes some amazing detailed images of the war, which was followed a few years later, but it is very naive in his utopian ideals. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson make a great throw, while the drama played a stage piece than the product of a movie. There are grandiose, when a few stilted speeches often delivered as when an actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. However, there are some profound words there. Is the rescue of humanity or destroying weapon technology? The film is a visual feast when you can separate yourself from the effects of age. Of course, Hollywood is more difficult today, but rarely as inventive. For the imaginary, the third act of a treat: the world with underground cities, massive Deck bombers, space gun, gyroscopic helicopters and secret organizations of scientists rescuers. It has all the makings of a sci-fi pulp-adventure, but instead uses the attributes for a philosophical exercise. <br /> <br /> The Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of the Neolithic Hollywood sci-fi movie. They operatic in scope, and visually inspiring. The technology has long left them behind, but their ideas are still broke. There is artistry there, one with a big heart and emotions than computer-generated mass production of cinema today. These films are products of craftsmen, and not industrialists.
