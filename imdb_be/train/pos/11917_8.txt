Thus, the archetype of a simple but inspiring film. At the very end, when the entire crowd at the stadium stands and the people raising their hands gives me a shiver when I see it. It's just great. Joseph well as lonely and sad child who was still disappointed with everything and anything in my life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in miracles and angels funny and exciting. Very good family film with - I admit - rather banal happy ending. But hey, it does not matter, the film maintains its fundamental quality of good acting and inspiring themes.
