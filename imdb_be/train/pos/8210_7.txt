Clint Eastwood reprise his role as Dirty Harry, which this time of vigilance case (Sondra Locke), which kills people who raped her and her sister at the carnival many years ago. Eastwood makes his role and the film generally more action, then say, not that I'm complaining. Ambush really enjoyable entertainment.
