Good continuation of Murder in a small town. This one cache and his sidekick Lieutenant police unravel sticky plot involving Nazi war criminal, philanthropic witch, and a family of screw ups and wierdo assistants. Like the original, the viewer is treated to a nice little secret of the distinctive sights and sounds of the pre-war America. Go it.
