Meryl Streep as beautiful as ever, and still manages to keep our interest, though she plays a character who is not particularly pretty. <br /> <br /> media frenzy that around this case in Australia recalls Sam Sheppard murder case in Ohio during the 50s. These are real situations show that the media actually can affect how processed the criminal case. I remember well, Cleveland Plain Dealer runs a huge headline saying "Why did not Sam Sheppard in prison?".

Only after years, he was released in jail responsibility. <br /> <br /> I love movies that tell the real story, do it in an interesting way, and to make an important point in the process. this is one of those films. the other good films about the innocent people, accused of crimes include "Hurricane", "Tone Single blue line ", andÂ« Breaker Moran. "In particular, the latter has an Australian film, which is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
