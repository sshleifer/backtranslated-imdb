I like to watch people doing dance, especially if they do it the same way and in the best scenes of the film, which takes you to the disco club called «Roxy». Especially during Christmas because as a «MC Santa Claus." <br /> <br /> Even if it's an old movie, and even if I videotaped it from the TV when the State Film Archives of Finland has shown this summer 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to check it out. It is much more enjoyable on the big screen than on television. <br /> <br /> Even if many people here think that watching it on the big screen is a waste of money for the ticket price, I do not agree with this, and I think that if I paid my ticket, I was worth the money seeing it as a big screen, especially sitting on the front row of the cinema, memorable experience, and much better than just a video.
