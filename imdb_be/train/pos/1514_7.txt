Thanks to a few Hammer all-stars, is a very effective section of the British horror revolves around the fate of the house and it is pre-residents whose stories all said Scotland Yard detective, searching for the missing actor. <br /> <br /> The history of the number one, which is probably the least impressive of the four, has to deal with the writer and his wife who had just moved into the house and plans to stay only for a short time, so that he can write one his horror novels. It creates a crazy character named Dominic, who looks very badly Strangler, and soon discovers that goes crazy when he begins to see the ugly man looking everywhere he goes. After his wife urges him to seek psychiatric help, a sub-plot is introduced, which, frankly, does not really work for me. I will not spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> The following story (the best in my opinion) a great Cushing stars as Philip Grayson, a person who moved into the house for his retirement, and soon makes his way to the nearby Wax Museum (which is the case in terrible), where he was very surprised to find a wax figure, which looks exactly like the woman from his past. Shortly after that, an old friend (who also has a history with this woman) is in town for business and falls, to see it. Two people are in bitter disappointment, as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye. <br /> <br /> The history of the three stars one of my favorite ... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid. After moving into the house with his peculiar daughter Jane, a nurse, he hires becomes very suspicious as to how Reed suppress his daughter. Well come to find out ... if she knew that Lee did, it would, of course, understood. <br /> <br /> The final story is pretty light-hearted vampire tale that stars Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt. After buying a raincoat from a mysterious merchant, actor Paul Henderson finds herself transformed into the very creature he painted several times in his career. <br /> <br /> In general, the pitch and the direction was very good, as was most of the performances. Were beautiful gothic touches here and there, and effective assessment to complement the atmosphere. This one is a keeper, and is highly recommended.
