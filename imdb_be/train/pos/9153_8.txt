I finally got around to see it after hearing a lot about it. It really surpassed my expectations. Given the budget involved it was surprisingly competent and well-made film. Lack of finance actually helped the movie in several ways, especially considering the plot. Just as The Blair Witch Project, the film was better to be shot on video instead of film. Another bonus: While most of the horror films of low budget (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre to unintentionally hysterical action, this movie was actually talented cast (with the exception of one or two characters), in particular, the two wires. The only thing missing from the film was an original story. He borrows from the more well-known films as "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn", but if you're like me, this kind of films never ceases to be scary. In addition, the director keeps things interesting throughout. I would be very interested to see what the director would do with a big budget and I have a feeling that it will be only a matter of time before we know ...
