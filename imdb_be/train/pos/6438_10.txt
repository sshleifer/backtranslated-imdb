«Så som i himmelen» .. as above, so below .. this is a very special place where the divine and the human competition. I love this movie! Gem. By a strange grace! <br /> <br /> I was so deeply touched by his very human quality. I laughed and cried through the whole register is actually several acts of emotions. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist ingeniously, Daniel, a first hot speed performance, charismatic and powerful. His inner light and an exceptional talent shines through in every scene, every interaction, every meeting. I was completely mesmerized, enchanted and picked up the story, which is our collective history, the history of life itself. <br /> <br /> The film was also so including many archetypes of the Messiah, the wounded child, the divine child, artist, teacher, priest abuser, abused, victim, bully, magic fool - all the characters are so real and valid to life - all awakened a great love and compassion for me. <br /> <br /> It's a real pleasure to see such a thought that provokes another thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining film. About ..mustn't forget the heavenly choir of angels and amazingly beautiful sound. <br /> <br /> Thanks to everyone - This Swedish film certainly fascinate people around the world. BRILLIANT!
