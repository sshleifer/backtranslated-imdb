Excellent pre-code an amoral tale with Barbara Stanwyck as the inspiration again (the work of Nietzsche!) To expel her sense and exploit yourself, use people to their own advantage. Not entirely true for the German philosopher, but I wonder what it was the year Hitler came to power. Stanwyck, even at this young version does not do much for me, but it certainly works well here, ever behind the wheel itself and the film forward. Not much meat on display here, as one might expect, but a lot of risky situations and surprising taunts and insinuations. A lot of fun, if not particularly attractive presentation of men, and I believe in all honesty is not very attractive on a gold digging woman. However, this is life!
