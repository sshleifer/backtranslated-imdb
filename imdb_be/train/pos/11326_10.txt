I watched the first 17 episodes, and this series is simply amazing! I was not so interested in anime, as Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on the H-game, which I'm not sure if this has been done before or not, I have not played the game, but from what I heard, that it is very good. <br /> <br /> I give this series 10/10. It has a great story, interesting characters, and some of the best animation I've ever seen. He also has a lot of Japanese music in it too! <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the series yet, check it out. You can find podkrovat episodes on some anime sites out there, it's straight from Japan.
