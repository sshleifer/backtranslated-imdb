This film will not sit well with some, but it should look. I'm glad that someone has finally tabled the reality As an African American couple worked hard to make a name for themselves in the community and how many of them thought, trying to stay there, as the "other" African Americans were approaching. <br /> <br /> (Minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> This little Showtime movie almost like a Spike Lee Joint ... you have an African-American man (Danny Glover), who has worked hard his way through traditionally white positions of the law profession in the 1970s. Like any American, he moved his family to be compatible with its status rising mobility, but I forgot, there is still a lot of problems going on. The only blacks in the area at the time were the maids. One possession of the house? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then, mixing in the beginning. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is said to "get involved", so she does what all the other women in the surrounding area are doing. And only then, when a person thinks that he and his family "in the" right next door comes another African American, who received, because they won the "LottoÂ» (Mo'nique), and in his eyes, and he did not He wants nothing to do with them because he does not want the neighborhood to think that they are similar to each other. He, of course, is the best gauge of his new neighbor "ghetto" is not should not be there! Who has a problem now? <br /> <br /> What this film shows you the great pains he takes to this family, to fit in, and how they lose themselves in the process. It makes you question, where is the racism begins and ends ... and with whom. It shows how no matter what color you are or how much money you have, you can shut out the real world and help others. It also shows how the African American children as "mixing in" areas, such as they fall into the trap of changing itself in accordance with the culture (complete with blond hair and blue eyes, mind you!) Around them. They laugh with jokes, not knowing that they are a joke and not knowing..why. <br /> <br /> But on the whole, the film is about "people". No matter to what race you are, this film does not get how badly you can be against his neighbor, and respect each other ... all for the sake in..all fitting, because you feel you have more money than the other, so that automatically makes you better - and you forgot you had a fight, and those coming up behind you <br /> <br /> Again, not for everyone .. But look and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />
