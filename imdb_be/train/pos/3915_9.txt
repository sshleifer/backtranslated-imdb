I saw this movie at least 4 times since 84 and it's still great every time I see him. This is a very convincing version of the opera Carmen, with amazing flamenco dancing, bare bones kits, and of course, great music. <br /> <br /> This retelling of the story of Carmen in history with each other parallelization until doubled tragic outcome. Obviously, a low budget production and the Spanish, the film includes dancing on some of the leading flamenco dancers in Spain. The combination of soaring operatic music and the sound of the dancers' boots on the wooden stage, making the history of speaking even more powerful. <br /> <br /> This independent film-making at its best, and probably my favorite foreign film constantly.
