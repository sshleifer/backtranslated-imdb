It was an interesting experience twice. For some reason, the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century, has never been a central figure in the film *. The closest I can think of, like movies with Einstein in their CHAMPAIGN Caesar, where (as Â«Deus Ex ma-China"), the great man had heard the explanation point on the quiz radio show, so that Ronald Colman proved that gave the correct answer in the end, and BULLSHOT, where a large Albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis villain, intending to steal some cars are. It should be noted that in these two cases, and the IQ, we are dealing with comedies. Until now, no one has tried to do a serious film about Einstein's life, like John Huston attempt to make one of Freud with Montgomery Cliff. I believe that it is too difficult to get a world of mathematical equations or the secrets of the electromagnetic field theory in an exciting dialogue. But then, just three years ago, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer did mind. Maybe, in fact, no one has tried. <br /> <br /> (* Later, after writing this I remembered a successful comedy YOUNG Einstein from Yahoo Serious about ten years ago. But this is an exception, and it was a hoax.) <br /> <br /> another surprise was an actor who plays a big Albert. It was Matthau, it is found from time to film series, which he did with Jack Lemmon in the last decade of his career. Matthau was a very capable and talented character actor, both in comedy and drama, but usually his comic persona were variations of his "Knut Willie" Gingrich with Biscuits. They were Connivers and gonifs. Later, they shed their criminal tendencies, because we have grown to love them, but they remained grumpy types. But Albert Einstein happens, really sweet. More like his Kotch, than as Willie Clark. <br /> <br /> He plays old Albert as a good uncle Albert. It seems that Einstein Matthau is lives in Princeton with his niece Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), and she sees laid professor named James Morland (Stephen Fry). But Fry's car needs to be repaired, and they take it to the auto shop where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) is working. Robbins falls to Ryan, who is attracted to him - and finds out that he does not have the mental equipment that she is interested. Good old Uncle Albert, aided by his three friends (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, and Gene Saks) decided to give its assistance to Robbins and make it appear to unrecognized genius of physics. This will open the door of romance between him and Ryan provided Ryan impressed and Fry does not spoil things (as he hopes to do). <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is sweet as and when Matthau and his homies rig up a super quiz physics, they help deceive Robbins (by switching the position of their body). The site eventually leads to the outright lies that genius Robbins built a nuclear-powered ship food -., Which brings in the interests of the nation in the image of President Eisenhower (Keene Curtis) <br /> <br /> It was a magical comedy, and interesting stretch for the Matthau is that he was not hyper as usual, but it is much more subdued.
