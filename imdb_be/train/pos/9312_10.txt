I love watching this film a lot because of all the terrible scenes of dinosaurs. Like lizards, because they are afraid. My favorite parts are the ones where the raptor watching behind a pillar, because it reminds me of the scene from Friday the 13th movie with a girl who eats a banana. <br /> <br /> I love to watch a lot of this film, as computer graphics, it seems a bit fake, but that's okay, because as soon as you get in the movie you are unlikely to notice what was going on, and I think that he has a good end, although I do not understand what's going on my first couple of views, I have understood this for a long time, and is an important part. Another important part of how scary dinosaurs can be when you look at it for the first time. <br /> <br /> IT'S BEST FILM.
