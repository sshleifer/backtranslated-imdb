This is one of those films that I've seen so many times that I can quote most of them. Some of the lines in this film simply unbeatable. I especially like to watch as he stumbled and fell down drunk, get drunk at a fancy restaurant, and some moose. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I've seen this sequence, but it's funny every time. Since then, Arthur gets into place Masha dad bits with a deer, you have a lot to laugh all the time. I remember watching out-takes relatively little moose. It went down just like I thought it would be like. They all laughed so hard that it was difficult for them to take it off. <br /> <br /> The late Sir John Gielgud was the perfect complement to it. His behavior, its severity and how he handled Arthur were all equally fun. It's always fun when it hits him on the head with a hat or tells him that he is spoiled slightly ____. I laugh every time I hear "I'm going to take a bath", and lines that follow.
