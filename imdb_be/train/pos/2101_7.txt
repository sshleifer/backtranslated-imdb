Forget Neo and Borne, and all of these newly minted made to modern heroes. They only watch an old '12 to please a wide audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Since they can not be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood has allowed a bunch of fakes who have no beards, and even perform a teenager want to see something that looks very much like an action movie. <br /> <br /> However, their "action Set-pieces" are simply painful to watch any girl can challenge their courage without question. This explains belching old people on our screens silver over the past few years. For the best (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane, Stay .... had no beard !!) <br /> <br /> I say this with a high time a new hero came up and put their rule until the end. The film "Largo Winch" is far from perfect, and perhaps too predictable at times, but at least, Tomer Sisley set very challenging work as action-hero. And once, when he was weakened when Mélanie Thierry shaved his beard! I rest my case. <br /> <br /> I do not know, when I entered the theater room, but it could be a movie that I've been waiting for ten years. For the first time in France with Belmondo, the film can be both well developed and rooted in the B-genre, without blushing for his execution. At the same time, all we had to chew on was a huge pile of manure, or something too limited to reach a wider audience ... In other words, it was the «Le Pacte de Loups" or "Doberman" (I like Doberman, mind you). .. I believe that the "Largo Winch" has what it takes to be both popular and quality filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I came out of the cinema hall is very pleased, and hungry anymore.
