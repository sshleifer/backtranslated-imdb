Family two families after each other's blood. <br /> <br /> Viren Saha (Amitabh Bachchan) is nether dong, running from Bangkok. He has family in India. After he mistakenly kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). As Viren Sahay, he also has a family (brother, wife and parents). Aryan (Aryaman), brother Shekhar is to avenge the death of his brother. He kidnaps Viren Sahay family for the same reason. <br /> <br /> The film was one turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film belongs to him entirely, where, instead of its dialogue, the expression is more important. negligible role Akshay has also put him on a par with Amitabh. . I do not understand what bhumika Chawala makes this movie <br /> <br /> There were a few loose points in the script; like; Amitabh was listed as the most wanted criminal of the city so far it goes unpunished in the city. The abduction of his family, too, seemed vague. As a family so big dong has no protective cover?
