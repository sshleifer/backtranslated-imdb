Greetings again from the darkness. How rare it is for the film to explore the lost soul of people in pain. Adam Sandler stars as Charlie, a man who lost his family in the 9/11 tragedy, and has since lost his career, his sense of life, and perhaps the state of his consciousness. Don Cheadle co-stars as a former roommate Dental School Sandler, who seems to have the perfect life (which, apparently Sandler was before 9/11). <br /> <br /> Of course, the parallels in the lives of these men are obvious, but it's really nice to see the men's feelings on the screen in a movie ... except the desire for revenge and a sense of what it is. Observing how they actually help each other, just as there is a painful and heart. Writer / director Mike Binder ( "The Upside of Anger," and accountant Sandler in the film) really bring a different look and feel to the film. Some scenes do not work as well as others, but in general it is well written and well directed. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle and beautiful. Sandler's character reminds a little of his fine performance in «Punch Drunk Love», but here it brings much more depth. Cheadle is always good and does a good job of expression of gravity he is ... just watching him work the puzzle. <br /> <br /> Support excellent, Jada Pinkett Smith (as wife in Cheadle), Liv Tyler (as a psychiatrist is very patient), Saffron Burrows (in a surprisingly attractive role), Donald Sutherland as angry judges and Melinda Dillon Robert Klein as Sandler laws. <br /> <br /> film really affect how the tragic events of that day hit a man so deeply that it is mostly destroyed. In addition to the interesting stories and some great pictures of New York, you have to love any movie that features vocals from Chris Hinde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... and Eddie Vedder impersonating Daltrey. Not exactly a cheerful upbeat movie, but it's the quality of the film with an unusual story.
