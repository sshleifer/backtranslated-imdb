Ghost Train is a treat for those who appreciate a typical 1940s humor. It includes the Second World War in the plot, but not as much as I originally thought it would be, and a unique combination of characters that play a role quite well. Asuka, playing the role of Tommy Gander that brightens up the story for those parts that could have portrayed with as sad or "drag and drop". <br /> <br /> The story about the ghost stations are actually scary even for the present day standards. It is unique and the way the characters interact with each fantastic to revive the mystery that is the Ghost Train. Gus mainly a nuisance for all the other members, and the rest to get along pretty well. He is always in the spotlight and can be overwritten as "annoying", but those who do not appreciate the humor of the 1940s. His humor is an innocent and child-like, making it a sweet look. <br /> <br /> If it were not for Asuka / Gander, what this film would have been shorter in action, pleasure, and the result will not be as effective in my opinion.
