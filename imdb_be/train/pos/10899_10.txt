I laughed so hard during this film my face hurt. Ben Affleck was cheerful and reminded me of the handsome Jack Black in the role. Gandolfini gives it typical performance A. All the actors are funny, the story is pretty good comic moments and strange. I went into this movie not expecting much, so maybe that's why I was so surprised to get out of the click thoroughly satisfied and vestibular exhausted. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, I can identify with loneliness during the holidays and / or who are investing with relatives. The best part of this movie (for me anyway) are thin slices of humor that caught me completely off guard and made me laugh for a long time after the rest of the audience was discontinued. Namely, the scene with the lighting of the Christmas tree. Descend it and laugh!
