Of course, any normal level of film criticism, the soldiers are very bad film really. Kurt Russell futuristic super soldier raised from birth to kill, but then become obsolete after a bunch of really improved a super soldier in the dangly hoop, which looks a bit like a river to the contest Gladiators no crash mats. <br /> <br /> Abandoned junk on the planet, he made friends with the community to mosey space hippies who taught him about gardening, family life, and, um, chest. Kurt did not say much. Finally, really super soldiers turn up and kill hippies, shooting them in the back when they run. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. The planet gets made. End. <br /> <br /> If the Academy does not start a new category of "Best Bang", the soldiers are not going to win any awards. However, as silly as it is, it is an enjoyable experience. Military equipment is steep because Aliens (ARS identity) and, after 90 minutes, it does not outstay its reception. Please note that the below is just a guide. Knock five points, if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you do not like miniguns. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
