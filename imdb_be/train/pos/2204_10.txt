I think that the film is a strange way. In the first stage, people die for no reason. It does not get mentioned again. Special effects may also have to be better, but I enjoyed watching the older horror movie. This is not the best example of the classic horror film, but it was still a good film. I give him about 5 out of 10 scales.
