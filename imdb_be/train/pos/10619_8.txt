Los Angeles TV news reporter Jennifer (beautiful Barbara Bach from "The Spy Who Loved Me" fame) and her two assistants Karen (invitingly Karen Lamm sticks) and Vicky (pretty Lois Young, who not only kill the first, but also exposes her yummy BOC in delicious gratuitous nude scene bath) are in Solvang, California, to cover the annual festival of Danish. After all, local hotels are booked solid, three lovely ladies are forced to seek shelter and food in an elegant, but distant foreboding mansion belonged bizarre Ernest Keller (played magically geeky perfection late, great Sydney Lassik) and his gentle sister Virginia (solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has one very unpleasant and deadly dark family secret, who lives in the basement of his shrill: portly, pathetic, diapered, incest spawned man-child Mongoloid named Junior (in alternately touching and horrifying image of Stephen Furst, in "Flounder animal house "), which, naturally, become free and deal some lethal chaos. A skilled director Danny Steinmann, a uniformly thin current of durable molded with compelling twisted plot beautiful makeup Craig Reardon, beautifully eerie atmosphere odd wild menopause, a slow but steady rate, pretty well-drawn characters and surprisingly heartbreaking final still picture (incest story packs an unexpectedly strong and poignant punch), it is unfair to forget in the early 80's psycho sleepers should be checked.
