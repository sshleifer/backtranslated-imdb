This is perhaps the best Rockumentary Forever British, rather This Is Spinal Tap. Characters believable story high, and you can truly empathize with some of the specials, such as a problem with Ray fitting in the group. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent. The actual period of the material, even if it is in the same vein, you will sing some songs for a few days. What I liked almost all British cast, with some of the most popular household names. Ray's wife is priceless ... <br /> <br /> The film never drags, he's just going at the right pace, and has some really fun sections in it. Generator some really good phrases! <br /> <br /> This is a hidden diamond.
