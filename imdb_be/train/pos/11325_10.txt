When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I must say that of all the shows I've seen, this one tops it all. I had to see this show, and that's what I really did. When I received the first volume of this show, he was the best. I really liked the animation and all the fight scenes were strange. I have to say my favorite characters in the show were the sword, and Archer, and, of course, I also like Ilya. And, of course, it was all the episodes in terms of interesting and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series Michael McConnohie (known transformers and others) plays the voice of Berserk. It has a cool character. And I even watched the whole series again before a final volume of view. So if you see something good, then see this show, it's the best.
