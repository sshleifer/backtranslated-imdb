I agree with the previous comment in the names of the content of the movie "everyday madness", but would like to clarify that:. «Dog Days" of how women dealt with in (men's) society episodes, we get to see here show some changes in the everyday discrimination against women, in general, classified by age group. There is an older man, who is making his new partner look and act like his late wife was treating her like a doll, which will act "worthy of wearing" dress on behalf pershag a. There is the average age of couples whose relationship is almost a slave, but he (violent) master. Then we find some young man who does not communicate with his friend / wife, and instead of being really jealous of her case even makes friendship . with its competitor (s) Young adult man clears his friend - a girl who is really bothered by being pretty enough for him - that it should be jewels on his side and stick it to a narrow look over the rules of etiquette. Finally, there is a man in his late fifties, which his own calculation of benefits provides a simple Hitchhiking woman mad customer - taking her to blame for the scratched car - natural strikes her. To run the examples we find Pal men in the "master-slave» -couple - after collectively abusing her - threatening and insulting the former "in it for the sake of", as it should be to get rid of your partner and accept myself as her new "master ". In all this, the inhabitants of the newly built city in which the action takes place lies under the blazing summer sun - (! SIC) absolutely still. Unfortunately, I have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic paint archaic model, which still prevail in the relations between women and men, but what I've seen, convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. Probably a useful tool in teaching even less sensitive viewer, that is not the case - thanks to a good visualization.
