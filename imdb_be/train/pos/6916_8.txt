Winchester 73 was a film that moved Mans with bi-movies in the big leagues, saving hang postwar career of James Stewart in casting him as a hero of conflict (though, as he has inherited a draft by Fritz Lang, Lang may deserve credit for this). Both went to a much darker place - the Mann with a surprisingly dark doorway of the Devil, who did not stay at the MGM postponed to the success of Broken Arrow convinced them to release it ?? but the film is about a man hunting down his own brother, as the names of the rifle is handed from person to person on a track before it ends up in one of my favorite mountainside director bullet even more meat than you would expect from a studio system. Great dialogue, an impressive supporting cast ?? Dan the Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them ?? and outstanding visual sense Mann raise the bar with this.
