Although I have long been a fan of Peter Weir, I have not watched any of his Australian film until I watched the last wave. And it was nice, unpredictable surprise. <br /> <br /> Richard Chamberlain plays David, a lawyer invited to defend five Aborigines accused of the murder of another native. For colleagues David is a clear case of a drunken disorder, and they think that they have to admit their guilt and punishment is fast. But David believes that the secret of a murder related to tribal rituals. As his investigation continues, he knows not only things about their customers, but also about themselves. <br /> <br /> In order to reveal more would spoil one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. I can only say that this film is going in directions that no one would expect that <br /> <br /> There are many elements that make this an exciting movie :. Active Chamberlain, for example; but also the performance of David Gulpilil, who plays a young aborigine, which introduces David tribal secrets; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, who plays an old aborigine who is spiritual guidance. The relationship between these three characters to make the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> But there is also a way of Weir suggests the supernatural in the film. David dreams that warn him about the future. Australia is experiencing a terrible weather, storms, hail fall, and even a mysterious black rain, which may be nothing more than pollution. But it also applies to the case, David defender. As it is associated with one of the greatest discoveries of the film. From small events Weir manages to create an atmosphere of fear and oppression, offering future horrors really shows nothing. <br /> <br /> Charles WAIN score is fantastic, especially the use of the didgeridoo. Photos are also pretty good. Russell Boyd, a longtime Weir the DP, which won an Oscar in 2004 for Master and Commander, reflects the dark, horrible world full of secrets. <br /> <br /> I also think that it is very good that for a film centered on the natives, he doesn "t turn into an indictment against a white or cultural juicy celebrating their traditions, like Dances with Wolves and The Last Samurai . This film is too smart to be that simplistic <br /> <br /> Sometimes it can be frustrating, and it may frustrate viewers who are waiting to complete the film with all comprehension. but for those who do not mind some strangeness or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch.
