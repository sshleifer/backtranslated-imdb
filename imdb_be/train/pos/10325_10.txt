I was brought up on Doc Savage, and stunned the green death, as a child, but even then, as now, I found it thoroughly entertaining.I made countless friends and colleagues to watch this movie and were most carried out a variety of reactions, it is provided mainly they think I'm weird, but there you are. "I do not know what we are talking about Doc, but he always gets the girl" should be the final line, when you look at his sad group of men. This film is a classic parody of all the super hero genre, and was a way to go before this time, not to be taken lightly, to move Austin Powers. Ron Ely is God.It Unfortunately, this film has not been released on DVD in the UK. I do not think it needs to be redone and bastardised, as I said, it's a classic, it can not be done without Ron. (For example, the Italian work without MINI and Michael Caine). I give 10/10.
