Despite the fact that this movie is filled with some cheese eighties I have a place for it in my DVD stand and I do not know why. I think I like it, because the moral of the story is "trash TV so turn it off and go and get a life." For those of you who have decided to listen to the message, then you should try to read the book, it's nothing like the movie at all. In order to break it to you at the end of history mortally wounded Richards finishes the plane crash into the building network, killing himself, and everything inside except the network simultaneously. I read many years ago, but today it would be hard not to compare it to 9/11.
