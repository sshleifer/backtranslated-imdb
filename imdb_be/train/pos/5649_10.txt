I watch the show again now that on DVD (yay!) That strikes me as fresh, so relevant and intriguing, as when it first aired. <br /> <br /> In the central performances clamped script superimposed. <br /> <br /> I'm going to stick my neck and put it up there with the prisoners as a show that will be winning new fans and continue to see come 2035. <br /> <br /> I was asked to write some more lines (it seems to be, like IMDb user unfriendly and anal retentively coded as ever! substantial and point is clearly not as IMDb.) <br /> <br /> well, in contrast to the arguments IMDB editors, American Gothic understands that simplicity has it all. <br /> <br /> 22 episodes of the show covers more character development than do many shows in seven seasons. On top of which he casts doubt on the personal ethics and strength of character thus challenges the viewer at every turn, to ask themselves what they would choose, and what they think in a given situation. <br /> <br /> When the show first aired, I'm still mourning the Twin Peaks and I thought it would be a cheap knock off. Personally, I'm starting to appreciate it more highly and I suspect that will be the best for many years. Expect it does not get more controversial than this!
