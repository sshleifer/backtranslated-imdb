I can not say that this film is a disappointment, because I read some reviews before watching and not doing as much as I thought it would be. There have not been found to be high, so the fact that my expectations are not saying a lot <br /> <br /> Well :. The City of New York. If you live in the city, like me, you will recognize certain place and understand that the city should be more than just an option, and one of the main characters. There are really tender moments, humorous talk and plot twists left and right that all keep things interesting <br /> <br /> The bad :. The first thing I thought after leaving the theater that I wanted more, but not in a positive "leave them wanting more" fashion. Of course, a good parody / scene outweigh the bad, but there are many parodies that fall into the " intermediate "category, too much in fact, that is what ultimately brings the film down. in addition, a variety of New York, although the hint, though many long pan of the city and is mentioned in the conversation throughout the film, really I never understood, analyzed from the point of doing city business dlivastsi. For example, many of the sketches are linked wealthy middle-aged white. I mean, I know that the city is home to many of these demographics, but come on, the plot and character diversity makes Je'taime Paris New York like Lancaster, Pennsylvania, or anywhere in fact white. it's just disappointing to see the city cheated on his legacy, as it is. <br /> <br /> However, even after being told this, I would recommend to give New York, I love you view. Who knows, maybe you do not agree with my opinion and maybe you will not. You never know until you see it for yourself. This review is entirely designed to deter any of watching this film, as the opinion of each of the different art. I'm just giving you a very vague head on what to expect.
