End of an Era was released in the US in spring 2002. "The Rookie» Disney live action film, seemed to be "the best in the past !!!!!" It happened right here in Texas! In fact, the story begins in West Texas on indicating that the area code is found in the sign there. it was about high school coach who was so convinced of the high-end baseball team, he decided to go professional !!!!! <br /> <br /> I liked about this film: It was sooo beautiful !!! !! It was a very good sports movie, ala «The Mighty Ducks» trilogy I do. It also took cinephile across Texas, somewhere between the Panhandle and El Paso, all the way to the Metroplex (where I live). I can say, because I recognize that the stadium (was "Stadium in Arlington," now it is "Ameriquest field"), it was nice to see Disney's "Golden age" comes to an end in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> The Golden age of Disney <br /> <br /> 1920 2002 hardness <br /> <br /> «all started with a mouse ... and it ended with baseball." (sob) <br /> <br /> 10/10
