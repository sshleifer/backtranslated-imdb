Let's straight to the point: it's a movie, I would be with me on a desert island (with DVD-player). It's just wonderful. If the reason for you to watch a movie that you love the actor, would you like to see them complete freedom of space and feeling, this film is for you. Watch the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) will be on stage drunk and Maurice (Cassavetes) I have to improvise, because she did not follow the script anymore. If you're sensitive to the movements of the camera, you will be captivated as the camera moves around the scene, a particular thread, which give you the impression the camera follows the actors as if he directed the theatrical principle of "personal space" ... strange. And the story is just a brilliant mixture of fairy tale and realistic drama. Cassavetes again arguing with Hollywood majors and politics, but this time, it does so through Broadway, making it one of the most exciting films about the theater. Well, this film is a delight.
