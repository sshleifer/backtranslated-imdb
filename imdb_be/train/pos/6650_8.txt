I would not like to comment on how well the film was there were shortcomings, I am not a professional film critic and I do not have enough knowledge about making movies. I know that makes this kind of a movie in the first frame is a great achievement and I would like to congratulate the director for this. However, in some reviews that I read, critics complained that Hiralal relationship with his brothers was not allocated, and his brothers have been completely erased from the history. Now I would really like to raise the issue here is that, as the title of the film says it's not a film about the brothers Hiralal, this is a film about the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi, and nothing more less. If we start to complain about some of the characters kept out of action in the film, it would be a bit unfair, because these characters are not fit into the picture, no matter how they are in real life. So I think it would be best if we stick to the basic ideas and no longer meet the criticism itself. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!
