My friend and I both enjoyed this film very much. The viewer is swept away by modern life in old Japan, at the same time exposed to very current topics. Symbols are realistic and detailed; it has an unpredictable ending and the story, which is very refreshing. History is made up of mini-scenes in the lives of several geisha live together in a poor neighborhood of the city. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old Japan. <br /> <br />
