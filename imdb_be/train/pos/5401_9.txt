This demonstrates the incredible film-making prowess Gosha, he was able to complete both hitokiri and stunning masterpiece, Goyokin, in the same year, 1969. And it's a testament to how criminally underrated it is for the general public (in comparison with the media. Sweethearts how great Akira Kurosawa), and that both hitokiri Goyokin received less than 500 votes between the two of them <br /> <br /> Katsu is Okada Izo: mad dog killer, loyal clan Toshio and their boss Takechi plays another genre grew, Tatsuo Nakadai. Toshio clan was part of a large alliance that supported the emperor against the rotation of the shogunate. The historical background is accurate enough - with the growth of political instability in Japan between the imperialists and the Tokugawa and pressure from the West to an end in the year 300 social and political isolation. It helps a lot to know a thing or two about Japanese history and what ultimately led to the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the Tokugawa shogunate, but it does not matter by any means. The film was made primarily for the Japanese audience, so some things are taken for granted, but it flows very well to the uninitiated as well. <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a film of Hideo Gosha in their golden years (late 60s) visual palette is breathtaking, the use of external and internal symbolism hidden behind picturesque beauty. The style, however, never decorative for Goshi - it is always used in the service history. <br /> <br /> And speaking of stories, hitokiri dominates literally and figuratively on the tormented protagonist Izo Okada. Most chambara protagonists Iso finds himself in a moral double bind, caught between weights (liabilities) and ninjo (natural impulse) - although it takes a while for him to understand what his weight is. In the first half of the film Of trying to promote the public authorities. Lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with the daughter of an aristocrat - a lot of progress for someone approaching from the farmer's background in hard social caste system of the nineteenth century Japan. <br /> <br /> The turning point for the fine arts, when he realizes what price comes to self-promotion, loss of identity, and on the occasion of loss of self. It was at that point that he has a very symbolic transformation of a famous swordsman with Tosha clan "nameless" tramp with no past and future, Torazo hobo. While not technically anonymous, and not a genre tramp in the mold Yojimbo, it is the loss of its former and Drop the ego, ambition and confidence in dillusion, which allows Of seeing things as they really are, and to make amends. <br /> <br /> hitokiri end (which I will not reveal here) well any story can end with both positive and negative with deep irony that gives Of the last laugh last remark sardonic in the face of death.
