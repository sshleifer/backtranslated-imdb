Like the characters in this show, I too was a teenager during the 70s. Manufacturers really nailed the whole spirit of the times, to be a suburban teenager in the 70s. 70s fashion, cars, home furnishings, food, and strangely, all very authentic to the show. <br /> <br /> The show boasts of a very talented ensemble cast, which all together a network of very well on camera. I really like the unique sequences of the film psychedelic style. No other show does not make the camera tricks like this. This sequence of cutting edge films, do help convey mannered hipness that characterized the era of the 70s. <br /> <br /> In general, it's very funny Cibitoke. The only thing that bothers me about this show is its excessive dependence on the ill-humor to produce laughter. So I think that this show is trying to be too much like Married with children. While Married and with children is a great sitcom in its own right, it is sticky, that the creators of That '70s Show, try to imitate him. <br /> <br /> I recommend this 70s Show, mainly because of its nostalgia factor. It may be even better show, though, if the authors relied more on witty dialogue, and not obscene, tasteless jokes and pranks.
