This film takes place in the 1950s. In accordance with the dead (called zombies) have emerged alive. However, the company has developed a collar which, when put around the neck of zombies, making them obedient and committed servants. Robinsons mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), his father Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Temi (Kn Rey) hire zombies, because everyone on the block is already there. Names Tim zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes friends with him. But his father hates him and those losing control of Fido and things do not go <br /> <br /> As you can see, it is -. Among many other things - a takeoff on "Lassie" series with Fido be standing for fate. By was named that for a reason! Each of the well-known episodes of Lassie twist here. My favorite is when Timea sends Fido from getting help before the zombies eat it! In addition, it is a satire of the 1950s Douglas Sirk movies where all the bright and colorful - but dark secrets are tearing people apart. Symbols are very bright clothes (1950 Moss is always dress) - from furniture, setting cars and especially all 1950 hyper bright colors. Even if the script becomes a repetition there is always something to see. a good script - but there is only so much the fate of jokes you can do. In melodramatics it is kind of silly, but the cast pulls it off. Everything here is perfect and right on target. Even Connolly as a soulless zombie doing a good job. Moss is better - to play each line for the whole of its value --- but without going overboard <br /> <br /> It is not for everyone (of course) .. Satire can be lost on most people, and gore quite tame. Blood is so careless and happy music playing over it is difficult to take it seriously. So, for some people, this will really work. I give it an 8.
