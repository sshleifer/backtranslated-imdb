In celebration of Earth Day, Disney released the film "Earth". Stop away from any piercing posts gloom and doom, we were treated to some gorgeous shots of animals in their habitat, not feeling too bad about yourself. <br /> <br /> The star of the show is a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and whale and her calf. The narrative begins at the North Pole and continues to the south, until we reach the tropics, are constantly being introduced inhabitants of different climatic zones traversed. <br /> <br /> Global warming is mentioned while we consider the soaring polar bear; Note consists of reduced sea ice island in recent years. We never see a bear catch any seals, but a desperate search for her father in food leads him into a dangerous decision. <br /> <br /> Caribbean aerial shots of migrating across the tundra is one of the most exciting wildlife shots I have ever seen; He and other migration Wildfowl enough to compensate the price of admission to see them on the big screen. <br /> <br /> One of the frustrations I felt otherwise stunning pictures of great white sharks, which receive seals were shot in slow motion. Never do you get a sense of the characteristics of a wild animal; their incredible speed. The idea of ​​slowing down the film to convey a great speed, I think, began with (or, at least, that's the first thing I remember seeing) television show "Kung Fu" in the early seventies. <br /> <br /> An interesting sidelights is that since the end of the credits during some demonstrations cinematic techniques used are found. There are quite dramatic, humorous and instructive moments in this film to make it a solid choice for nature lovers. Perhaps because of some selective editing (depriving us, as it were, from the terrible end of the prey-predator moment), and the fact that these pictures were released in 2007 and is available on DVD is a solid film in its own right And you can take your child! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
