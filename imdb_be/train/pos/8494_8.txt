I saw this movie again as a reference for my management class. They were mainly to comment on the different management styles and ideas of quality (product). I did rent one back in the eighties, and I remember that it was good (but not great) movie. I've always loved the style and delivery of Michael Keaton. He was perfect for the film. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see some of the low ratings for this film. I give to you, that this is not the Oscar winner, but it does have a decent comedy value. This is a more subtle comedy and slapstick comedy is not total. I also think some of those who believe that it is inaccurate film about cultural and business differences. I beg to differ. I give you one more time that there are many communities and dramatizations, but again this is a Hollywood movie is not a documentary. From what I've read about the difference between Automobile Manufacturers on both sides of the Pacific at the time, many of the basic ideas were accurate at the time. <br /> <br /> Some of the main differences was that Japanese workers are made to feel as part of the company as a whole. Teamwork has been emphasized. They may have made the company first and foremost. Where American workers have more control poetry works such relations. The man was more important than the company. I will probably get hate e-mails on this commentary, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Another difference in how to deal with quality and whose responsibility it is to fix. In many Japanese plants defects or problems are addressed and fixed at the time he discovered. Most likely, as one character in the movie put it, "it is dealers (meaning car) problem." <br /> <br /> Many of these things are probably dated but I'm sure that some of them are still around so many US car manufacturers are still trying to keep up with the Japanese. If one is more interested in the subject of US, European and Japanese automakers, I can recommend a book that examines this topic in more detail and was done in about the same time period. The book is called "The machine that changed the world" by James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Russo. It is about the study of automakers during and before the period of time that the film covers. Part a little dry, but I think you will find that it supports a lot of movies too.
