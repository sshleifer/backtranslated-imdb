Very interesting and intriguing film. The similarity with David Lynch (who quotes even just the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of Franz Kafka (custodian of the house in the film called Mrs. rough, as it is one in Der Prozess ...) is clearly present, but in this case is accompanied by clear references to Belgium's colonial past in Africa. The exact contents of the movie, I can not accurately describe: it is colonialism is an important part, as an inability to cope with the past, but the personal memories of the protagonist is a central issue, as well, and his desire for social contact and love. This symbolic theme, I deduced from the movie, but in fact they are not more impressions. <br /> <br /> Even if you just try to follow the story line without these symbolic backgrounds, you find enormously fascinating film filled with great shooting (pretty big Beatles plans, larvae and other nasty insects alternated with big dream sequences, as well as dark atmosphere provides additional film style). Maybe you can say that I do not quite "get" the movie, but I watched as hypnothised for 1.5 hours, deeply impressed with the image quality and fun mysteriosity.
