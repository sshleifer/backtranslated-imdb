I remember seeing this movie on TV a few years ago, and not paying attention, maybe even not enough in the first half, so I came to the conclusion that it was boring and over rated. I decided to go back to him last night to see if I missed something the first time. Of course, I did. This is one of the most disturbing and bizarre films of all time, and he clearly had a great influence on the movies today and probably will be forever. I can not believe that I thought that this movie was boring! <br /> <br /> The young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds give performances of his career, and is supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you with a feeling of disgust and fear for a long time after you look at it, it's really awful. Oh, and did I mention that the song is great, huh? Well, this film should be seen by movie lovers all over the world. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this film for the experience. Just do not expect a picnic.
