One of the best movies ever made! Why is it only received a 7.6 rating is a mystery. This film is a window into the world of the black experience in America. Should be mandatory viewing for all white people, and all children over the age of 10. I recommend watching it with «The Long Walk Home» as a companion piece. If you think the work of Whoopi Goldberg on "Homer and Eddie" or «Hollywood Squares," think again. Do not miss this film, which was to win the Oscar. (I read the book, too!)
