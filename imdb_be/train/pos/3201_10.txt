This is an early film "Pilot" for a hit Canadian TV show Trailer Park Boys. He played on the heads of several networks before Showcase decided to sign them up for TV series. Great performances and very funny cast makes this one of the best cult comedy films. The plot of the film is the fact that these two small time criminals go around the "extermination" of the peoples pets for money. If you have a dog whose barking in the neighborhood all night, these guys you're going to! But they get in trouble when they come across the work is too much for them to deal with and end up in the crossfire. See this film if you want to understand the beginning of the television series. I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> Rated R for foul language, violence and use. <br /> <br /> Drug Its not too offensive, or (in fact, they do not show the killing of animals)
