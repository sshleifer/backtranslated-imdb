"Against all" Flags every bit the classic Daredevil. It has all the elements of adventure fan could hope for and more for the girl is in trouble, well, it is not really in trouble. How to Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara in her athletic best, running through enemies in violation of social norms period. Anthony Quinn paid in the top three actors as unrelenting Captain Roc Brasiliano and is insidious and can nemesis for Brian Hawk (Flynn). For a classic adventure fan, "Against All Flags" is a must see. Although it may not be quite in the same league as some of the early works of Errol Flynn (Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, for example), it is still very entertaining romp.
