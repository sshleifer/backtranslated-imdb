I've seen almost all of Miyazaki's films, and they are all beautiful and captivating. But this one rises above the rest. This film is completely hit me! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with the groove and Sita and their sweet caring friendship. They were what made the film for me. Of course, also a great animation and music captures the feeling of the film is remarkable. But the characters are a point of light in the film :. They are so well developed and full face <br /> <br /> Now, let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the film (with English subs). While the English dub is good (mostly), it simply pales in comparison with the original version of the language. Voices of better dialogue, everything. Therefore, I suggest to see (and hear) the movie as it was originally.
