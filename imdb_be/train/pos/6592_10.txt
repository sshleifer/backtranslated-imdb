I have not seen this film, but I have to. After reading all three books Thor Heyerdahl (Kon Tiki, Ra and AKA AKA) I am actively looking for a copy of this film. <br /> <br /> thesis that Peruvians migrated to Polynesia alive and well. Given that this crew had, GPS, and only the old-fashioned valve (tube) radio with access to 6 watts, their journey was the heroic, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Please reply to this email if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in purchasing.
