When I saw this film in 1950, I wanted to be a scientist too. There was something magical and useful in science. I took the girl - a member along to see it a second time. I do not think she was as impressed as I was! This film was a comical yet serious at the time, when synthetic fibers were fairly new. Lessons learned from this film could be applied to issues related to GM experimentation today.
