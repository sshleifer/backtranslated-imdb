I love this movie very much I watched it over and over again. I do not understand why anyone would think that this movie was not good. Maybe you've seen the best, or something I personally love it. This is one of my favorite movies, and I do not Hindi at all, but I love it. It can be a bit like "Pretty Woman", but I did not see that and I do not think it's any better than this. I do not know why you smash it, but maybe you have a good reason, but I think I would say that this is enough, but I really love this movie, and those who say that this not good at all well, I'm wondering why you looked and what movies you feel well. As for the rest, that I was watching it, they enjoyed it too, so I am surprised that this is many people do not like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think that's how you write her name) she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever!
