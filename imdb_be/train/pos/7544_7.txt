Japanese animators have a unique freedom of animation, so they tend to be able to come up with a movie like this, the films that ultimately end up in the anime lovers hard drives and floors college student, but to get completely ignored by a lot someone outside of their country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those films that, by Western eyes, presumably to be tested for drugs or deeply analyzed. In fact, it's just a great detailed surrealistic journey. <br /> <br /> There's no real dialogue, which makes it easy to pass other interested parties, entirely interested in such things as subtitles. Cat and his half-dead (brain dead?) Sister journey through different landscapes of imagination and association. There's also a common theme of water, or lack of them (perhaps because of a cat drowning in the beginning? Perhaps because of the name?). There is an interesting view of Genesis takes. There's a pig who gets to eat themselves. Elephant from the water. And it is beautiful, compelling, exciting, and fun - if you do not look around addicts who can not do anything visually unique, entirely by comparing it with an acid trip experience. In the end, the film is eliminated, adding another compelling self-reflexive level for the proceedings. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
