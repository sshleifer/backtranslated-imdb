I saw the shadow of Brother at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen as big as father and son. Scott Cohen film with parole in Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn. It appears there because his brother died, and he embarks on a journey to slowly rebuild their alienation relationship with his wife and child of his brother and his father, who never forgave him for that lousy sheep family. History takes us deep into the heart and minds of this family and allows you to better understand the complexity of their lives. In addition, building a woodworking business, and on the background of Brooklyn set the tone for this rich and outdoor family portrait.
