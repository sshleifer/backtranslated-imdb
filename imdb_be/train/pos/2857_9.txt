As part of our end of the 1950s, the dictionary, we knew Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc .. on this big show "Bonanza." <br /> <br /> He came on a Saturday night, and everyone was glued to the TV. It was a real show, that show family values. There may have been a weekly crisis, but it was a strong family atmosphere, all pulled together. <br /> <br /> Lorne Greene was the dominant patriarch of the family. His words reflect wisdom. We are often left to wonder what Ben Cartwright, a widower, has to be the best of the men of the poor of his wife, who died. He brought wonderful sons. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all wondered why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine and Roberts surrendered a lot of money when he left. His career never took off, he was associated as the son of Cartwright. He should have tried to return to the series. He, of course, lost the gold mine by dropping out.
