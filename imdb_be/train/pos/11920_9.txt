Christopher Lloyd funny and very believable as "Al-head angel." This film is much better than the first, but has great special effects that are not the first, as well as much better plot and writing <br /> <br /> OK. - it was written for children, but adults as much fun as the kids do. Donets makes a very realistic job in their roles. - But it's not a reunion taxi <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is really good, and even seems to be very people in their emotions, as well as showing some real acting talent. for a change, a pleasant change <br /> <br /> Look at least once - it's worth the effort to catch him.
