According to another reviewer war Hannah outstanding film about the outstanding personality, Hanna «Anniko» Szenes, who would become the Jewish Joan of Arc. Unfortunately, I differ in opinion, disagreeing that Miss Detmers as lead too handsome to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. In fact, for me, her performance did not deter her beauty, but it makes it all the more important in the sadistic cruelty of terror as it faces resistance. Maruschka Detmers brave performance, acute cardiac or understood, and quite plausible. "In the zone" in other words, for me. from the opening credits. If you would like to learn about the suffering of someone for what they believe in and be well entertained to war with Khan Maruschka Detmers try. May his hat off and Ellen Burstyn as Hana's mother is much well known and famous actress, which could make an effort to get away from the film. The fact that it is a team effort, perhaps the two actresses, but not all, of the Eve of the situation.
