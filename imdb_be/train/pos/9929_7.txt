I doubt that much of this film based on a true story. In the beginning, he says, based on the true story of a kind. I bet that the only truth in this was was an ex-model turned bounty hunter, possibly with a Domino name. <br /> <br /> In any case, it begins with Domino talking with Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino questioned about what she knows about the theft of $ 10 million. Through flashbacks, we see, the Domino, as a child, as a model, and how it is interested to be a bounty hunter. It basically says two other bounty hunters away, Ed and Choco. They allow her to join the group. It is hard, it can use any type of weapon, and will use its good looks when it is needed. <br /> <br /> They are linked to the scam that Clarmont, the guarantor, is already happening. Along the way, the group begins a reality show, and this is where Ziering and Brian Austin Green to participate. They are kind of like home and were really desperate to appear in it. <br /> <br /> I thought that the story was entertaining and it was a few laughs. Editing does not bother me. There's also a lot of violence, mostly using devices and blood. It might be a little shorter <br /> <br /> The verdict :. Good enough to watch.
