It's definitely not an intellectual film with deep mission, so I really do not think it's too much to understand, if you are not a Czech. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy. Humor just pretty funny, and sometimes can be a little painful. Some of the actors and the characters are very similar to Samotári (2000) (Jiří Macháček Ivan Trojan, Vladimir district Dlouhý) so the authors. But it does not matter the genre is really different, and the two films should not be compared in this way. Jedna Ruka netleská will not attempt to give you a lesson, it will try to make you laugh and there is some chance that it will turn out. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, not a brilliant one, but I liked it, some scenes are really worth seeing.
