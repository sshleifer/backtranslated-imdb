I had no idea about the facts, this film is. As I recall this situation, I take note of the then media: entangled happening around dubious personalities: Mr. Chavez. The film is the discovery of many realities, I wonder if something of this caliber has ever been done. I was a hero Mr.Chavez, but it is the picture <br /> <br /> it is important and in the end the reality of this entelechy: people, was overwhelming. Thank you, Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
