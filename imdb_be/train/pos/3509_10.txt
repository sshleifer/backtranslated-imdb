I've seen this movie a while ago and it's still at the top of my list of "favorite movies. It's amazing, taken together, and what really makes the film detailed TID bits (eg, coffee crates in" Cafe Bustelo 're use as a bowl for washing her hair grandchildren) that people do not see, because I do not understand this film if you are not Hispanic. It's just one of those movies that are very cultural specificity and particularity. please do not beat this movie, if you have no prior knowledge of what the foundation would duetstsa on. I totally see what writer / director is going for, and he perfectly hit the mark! This film is very worthy of the best rated.
