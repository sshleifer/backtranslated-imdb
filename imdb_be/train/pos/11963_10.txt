«Scoop» easily the funniest movie of Woody Allen's 2000's to the present. Allen, although finally looking his age, is at the top of his game as a low-grade magician Sidney Waterman. His one-liners and cheerful demeanor. Do not let criticism sway your opinion. "Scoop" is at the highest level «Woody-Lite» picture. <br /> <br /> evaluation of classical music is a great addition to the action on the screen. Scarlett Johansson looks gorgeous in this swimsuit. Jackman evil. Cinematography burns. "Scoop" great escapist fare from start to finish. The last shot only film worth the price of admission.
