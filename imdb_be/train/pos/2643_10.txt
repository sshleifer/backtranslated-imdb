I really can not say too much more about the plot of the film, which has not yet been said. I have not seen this film for about 25 years, and his memory will never leave me. I found so everywhere. I did a clean search for him in the past, but came up empty. Last night I thought about the film again and tried to remember who was in it, but I was only about 10 or 12 when I last saw him, and I was not even sure if I have the correct title of the film, so I decided to do another search, I finally found the spectacle. I was right. If any one know where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with family Could you, please, let me now I would be very grateful to tawnyteel@yahoo.com. And for those who have not seen this film and have a chance at it well worth it.
