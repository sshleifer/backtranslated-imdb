"Days" is a typical family drama with a small catch - you have to relate to the emotions of the character in every way, in order to appreciate the show <br /> <br /> [Possible spoilers for those who have. unfamiliar with the show] <br /> <br /> the story, obviously, for all the people who watched the show, Cooper is the world day, the middle child in the family. He writes his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of their observations. His family consists of a mother, father, sister, excellent, and the genius little brother. The first episode, which may sound a bit silly, as John Scott Shepard created this situation - as a mother and a sister to become pregnant. This is the first situation affects writer. Then the father stops working at a law firm. The youngest son gets a panic attack. The average child gets to fight with her boyfriend's sister. It's all <br /> <br /> one day of work. [/ Spoiler] <br /> <br /> I admire this show. I do not know. It's a little cheesy, but I like it. At first I thought that the camera-work was robbery, but then I got used to it and started to like it. I liked the quiet conversations under a dark light. I liked the intimate feel of the show. I liked the style of a low-budget. I liked the action. I'm interested in history. Then I think I want a second season days. Slowly I became a fan of him as a 6-episode airing on ABC came to an end. This is a really good show, and there's nothing like The OC. The two have nothing in common. So I hope that the fans will stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you can relate to any Abby, Jack Natalie Cooper, or even of Nate, you will enjoy this show. Lot.
