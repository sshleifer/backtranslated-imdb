This fan-made short film that claims to be a preview of a new film that pairs Batman and Superman! It's kind of a movie that fans love and look at places like ComicCon was done by the same person who made Batman: dead end, Collor <br /> <br /> As far as this film goes, I could easily pick . it apart. Of course CGI effects are not perfect and suits are far from perfect. BUT, it was done on a shoestring budget and for moviegoers this is incredible. I was particularly impressed with the very buff Superman - he was not a cowardly little guy! If only it was a preview of the real movie - they'd have supporters lined up here in Omaha to see it. Excellent work.
