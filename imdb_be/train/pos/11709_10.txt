Now, for all cinematographical lovers out there, this movie can not rank high in the list of things to see. But if you know anything about the development of the plot, the deep truth, and intentions, this film (series) has been, you would understand my POV <br /> <br /> Of course, the specifics of the film are arranged writer who can not wait to know what will happen in the end. But the film is biblically accurate and justified "scares" the viewer thinking about what might be. I am a Christian, and not because of the film, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as their Savior. Film and potential, something similar to the circumstances depicted in it can greatly frighten someone, thinking about their actions and decisions. This is not some cheap attempt to scare the people to believe in God, but rather a means to get your attention. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I know I'm not back, and thanks to films like this, I can look for superficialities of entertainment, activities, and budget film in order to assess the depth of the film has to offer. This is a film that you should not only see but also feel the heart and soul.
