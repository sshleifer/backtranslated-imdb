Frisbee controlled (literally) a crew of about 20 men space travels hundreds of millions of light years from Earth, to be noted on the colony, founded about 25 years ago in "Forbidden Planet. That they are more advanced robot than anything imaginable on earth, beautiful and completely socially inept young woman and her father, a hermit scholar persecuted more than demons of ancient civilization, he immersed himself. <br /> <br /> on the surface, this story is a mystery pulp SciFi murder. Some compare it to Shakespeare's Tempest, but this stretch, and, in some ways, an insult SCIFI genre. Stripped, making it SciFi movie, of course, his storm, but how many hundreds of movies you can say something like this about? <br /> <br /> Under this cautionary tale of progress and technology and social evolution, necessary for its proper and safe use. But the film still continues with hope for our future, we have come to expect from the show like Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. Special effects, and even the aesthetics of the background are strong enough to make the uninspired direction and uneven acting almost invisible. If it were not for the infinite retro art deco Ness 1950s sci-fi props, you might think that you are looking at a part of 1960. <br /> <br /> This is a classic that particular subgenre with Sci Fi I like to call the 1950s sci-fi, and although, in my opinion, the best thing is, of course, have to see anyone who is interested in science fiction film and special effects. Clever plot, now it appears banal to reuse in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space, and even Farscape, should pay attention to, and will keep the interest of the majority of supporters SCIFI. Trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film, which seems to be inspired by the theme of the original Star Trek series aired in about 12 years later, even though they may be disappointed (relatively mild) 1950 sexism and a lack of any racial integration. While I do not want to find fault, the lack of social progress are shown in this film was one major problem I had with him. <br /> <br /> Some are likely to see this movie just catch a glimpse of the young, pretty Leslie Nielsen in one of his first starring roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only an average, and sometimes down right poor (especially in the climax of the film). Dude, although quite great in other films, too acts a role. Ms. Francis, Earl Holliman and amazing Robby the robot is standing out in the crowd of actors, although in general the iconic actors that fill in the ensemble do a good job. The problems associated with performance traits, I think it's so much wine director and editors, as well as all. Although they are, of course, we got most of the film entirely true.
