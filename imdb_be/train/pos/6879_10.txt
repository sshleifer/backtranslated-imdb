«The Tube Groove» was one of two Ken Shapiro movies, the other being as funny "Modern Problems" This is one of only a full-scale spoof of television Besides Shapiro -.. That does not seem to do anything after the "Modern Problems" - the movie also stars Chevy Chase and his cousin Henry Winkler Richard Belzer. Three actors (plus a few other people in small roles) appear in various sketches. One of the funniest of them there is the Chase Geritol-spoof commercial in which he describes the drugs as his the wife of the band, and ends it pushes it. There's also a pornographic news program, which irritates the cooking show, and an epic tale about some drug dealer. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all this is just a real hoot. In my opinion, the top three TV movies spoofing is another plus «TunnelVision» and «Kentucky Fried Movie» (although I would also include «The Truman Show»). Really funny. <br /> <br /> I wonder what ever and did not Ken Shapiro.
