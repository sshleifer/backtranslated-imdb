If you do not get this movie, or your death, or you hate Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast, all gave good performances. This film proved that a good actor Adam Sandler, despite what critics say. Adam Sandler becomes a very respected actor. It all started with his performance in the Big Daddy, he made a couple of bad movies, he broke through with a stunning performance in 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard, and then click, and now Reign Over Me. <br /> <br /> Back to the movies. Adam Sandler plays a man who lost everything. The closest thing to a family he has a mother-in-and-in-law. After his old college roommate (Cheadle) run into him, he seems to turn his life around. I will not say because I do not want to spoil the movie, but I highly recommend this film. One of the best 2007 movies.
