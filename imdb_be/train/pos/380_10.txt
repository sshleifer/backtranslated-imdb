Taking a break from his escapist perspective in the early '80s, Steven Spielberg directed by Whoopi Goldberg in the film adaptation of Alice Walker's "The Color Purple", about a desperate existence of African-American women in the 1930s. Looking Goldberg played Celia, it's incredible, it's the same woman, who starred in such films as "Sister Act." This kind of film that can be easily - no, make it should be - part of the curriculum in the Black Sea Studies and Women's Studies. There's one scene that can be the most beautiful work of editing, which is ever on the screen (you'll know it when you see it). I can not believe that it did not win any Oscars; it may be the second best film of Spielberg's "Schindler's List" (maybe even attached to it). Also starring Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Basiya and Laurence Fishburne.
