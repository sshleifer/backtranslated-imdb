Having to have someone to hold your hand, if you go up or down stairs? After another to try the food before you eat it? Facing Excessive bearing mother? These are just some of the obstacles that young Victoria has to deal with in this film (there are also various power struggle going on, as well as the attempt on her life). Needless to say, it makes for a very interesting and informative viewing. <br /> <br /> I just saw before Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada (and little else). When she was in this film, she once again outstanding here. I was very impressed with its image of a young Victoria, and she thought the role handled very well. It makes the transition from a young Victoria we meet at the beginning of the movie up to Queen Victoria, she later becomes quite plausible. Blunt perfectly cast in the roles, showing all the different sides (of the vulnerable, to strong, from the young Victoria, who makes mistakes at the Queen, who takes over the management). Not enough can be said about Emily Blunt in the role. It is - quite simply - exclusive, commander of attention every second she is on screen. It keeps you freeze up to and including the last shot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rupert Friend is also well cast as the love interest Victoria (and possible husband) Prince Albert. The actors have good chemistry and you are absolutely sure they develop a relationship. They have their differences, but you can tell that they love each other. Dumb and one in every scene they share and keep you interested in what's happening between the Victoria and Albert. Other actors in the film is also very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William. There is not one bad performance in this film. Less focused on people, good at drawing as well, given that little screen time they have. Even the dog Victoria (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Dash) is remembered and influences in the film <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film has a tendency to miss more than a few aspects of Victorian life. - especially at the end - and instead of * * tells us what happened (with her and Albert) on the screen, what matters most is that we actually * see *. It is, after all, a film about 'The Young Victoria' (not 'The Middle-Aged Victoria' or 'The Old Victoria'). Although there are some ornaments made of history with this film, it is still centered on what he intends to do - to tell us the story of how the young princess rose to power <br /> <br /> The film looks amazing . , Video Games Emily Blunt is visually stunning and the music is not only adds to the film, never detract from it. This is an extremely shot and, unlike many films these days, this film is actually a good length, since it does not work for so long that you lose interest or feel it is too stretched. <br /> <br /> Of course, what makes this film so great, Emily Blunt. She is in great form here, turning in another excellent performance and raising the film above, it might be if another actress was cast in a very important / historical role. This is one finely crafted film, with excellent performance that must be seen. If you have an appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who was very important in the history, this is a must see.
