I love this movie, but the music on all alumni gatherings just stupid. <br /> <br /> The fateful game took place in 1972. This means that the main characters ended in 1972. But almost all of the music played in dance, etc. from the 1950s and early 1960s, very much. <br /> <br /> just attended my 30-th high school reunion, I can assure you that the last music will play a reunion or former high school dance music people their parents <br /> <br /> I understand the difficulty to find appropriate 1970th music. - we all know that it was a lonely time musically. But this is not entirely devoid of, and the producers of the film should have taken more care. I found the dance scene is very drastic my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> It was a bad director and / or the decision maker.
