I first rented this film many years ago, and was completely captivated by it. More recently, a strange feeling the need to review some ways too few films that I really enjoyed in my life, I decided to give «Erendira» another look. And I'm glad I did, as I soon discovered that even with the passage of time does not in the least dull the luster of this film. <br /> <br /> The story about a teenage girl (Erendira, played perfectly O'hana Claudia - in some ways it resembles Winona Ryder), who accidentally burns down her grandmother's house, then the grandmother, played quite hypnotic Irene Papas, makes Woman on the road life of prostitution to pay off the damages. <br /> <br /> view is both fascinating and compelling - even though, in spite of the basic premise that prostitution, tasteful devoid of gratuitous sexual content evaporates. The story revolves around a greater interaction between the girl and her grandmother and various other colorful characters with whom they come in contact with their guests -., Which, incidentally, is in the rough and tumble of the rural areas of Mexico <br /> <br /> very atmospheric film , arrestingly mystery of fairy decided to quality. Sometimes borders on the bizarre, but not to the point of, say, a film by David Lynch. It should also be noted that the film is very allegorical character, read comments from previous spectators below ... <br /> <br /> Often in the background you can hear the sounds of a lone accordion, quiet and melancholy, adding just the right musical accents to highlight Mexican setting. Cinematography in the countryside, many of which are in the desert, is quite superb. <br /> <br /> The film moves at a good pace, not too fast and not too slow, and after each scene, I felt that in order to rewind the tape and play it again, just because it makes you want to do it. For me, in any case, it really is convincing. <br /> <br /> I hope you will see the film in Spanish with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school and in college, and I was happy to be able to understand most of the dialogue. Time EJEMPLO: "El Mundo nya nya es tan Grand Co pensaba." ( "The world is not as big as I thought." - that is, it's a small world) <br /> <br /> This film somehow reminds me of stumble upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine that is drinking, is very satisfactory, however, you are left with some sadness realizing that not many bottles as well as this one.
