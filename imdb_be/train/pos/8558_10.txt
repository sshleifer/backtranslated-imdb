Always in great acting Drew Barrymore and her great performance in this film, where she plays a very, very complicated young gal (Hall Gooding), "Missing part", 2000, who is leaving New York to California, and shares an apartment with and soon the writer George Newbern, (Patrick Highsmith), "Far Harbor", "96. Many strange things start to happen with the Hall, and it seeks to find his brother in a mental hospital after he killed her father. If you look close enough you actually see Drew Barrymore's mother in real life is like her mother in that picture. If it was not a good actor Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this film should be seen only on Halloween night! However, it sure has its surprises END !!!!
