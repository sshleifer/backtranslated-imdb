The actors play wonderfully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It is good that Robin Williams got comedic role Osiric, otherwise it can be a little strange to see him in such a production. It's really cool that Kenneth has decided to use the full version of the text, this is certainly not too often ... Due to the fact that the audience can see the whole, not selected - Director - part. Too - thank God, that the film in the classical form; NOT surreal fanfaberies! Although Â«Tytus Andronicus" was impressive nonetheless, but nevertheless Hamlet a different story, at least, is my point of view.
