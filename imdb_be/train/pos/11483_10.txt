The fact that makes this movie so scary it so that it reflects Andre and Calvin, as a (relatively) normal guys. This is certainly not the people who want to become professional filmmakers as they goof around in front of the camera, forget scripted lines, etc. They make only the video as a diary to show "survivors" as their normal life. Their parents just think guys shoot family home movies. The study of other children attack on their school, Andre and Calvin know what not to do, and they report (usually stupid "This Old House" kind of way) any potential "Andres and Calvins", who could watch this video how to make a bomb, get some guns, and not caught before the Zero day (day of the attack).
