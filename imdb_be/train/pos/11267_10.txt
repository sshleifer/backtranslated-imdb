Robert Uul class teaches film students at the University of New York in Manhattan, New York. <br /> <br /> It covers the fallacy of stories and truths that are no longer known. I would like to see much more of this show. This is very interesting. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "show and tell" to get their points across. He explained that the person who actually was driving north Ride of Paul Revere was not Paul Revere! REVERE Longfellow used the name because it sounds better. <br /> <br /> I watched Robert Uul for many years, since he was doing stand-up comedy, and all the way through "Arli $$" for HBO. He's a good actor and a good comedian, but he's a great teacher! I highly recommend you watch an episode of the show. It's worth your time.
