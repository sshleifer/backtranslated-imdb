Hey, I can not claim to have seen all the films Jesse (Jesus) Franco, and sure, it seems, a lot of them, but it is one of the best (and surprising), the party that I have seen. I would say that probably he was in his prime in the late sixties / early seventies and anything lately was too weird for me, and it takes a lot for me to say that. Anyway, it's like one big bad dream in which his part, seems to have come true in different locations. This woman is an actress or something, appears in some theater in Berlin, where acts of "false" torture performed for an appreciative audience (?!), And she seems to be the problem with dreams. The catch is, what is real and what is not in this movie seem real stuff is in focus and the material is not a dream. It seems to exist in a state of deja vu. I will not say it makes a lot of sense, but it's pretty wild and strange and interesting. Stills from Berlin make it seem like a lonely and terrible place, so that adds to the atmosphere. The ending is very steep, though, the film finishes and the tape went dark, I do not think there is no need to let you know that it was over at that moment. My copy was from the Euro-Trash Anchor Bay Collection, and I say, give me another Euro-Trash, I can not get enough of this crap. But it's good shit.
