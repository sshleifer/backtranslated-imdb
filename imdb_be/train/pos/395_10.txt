Visually stunning and full of oriental philosophy, it's an amazing martial arts fantasy brought to you by master director Tsui Hark, the man who is behind some of the best films in the Hong Kong movie production. The special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The plot is a bit on the cerebral side, but it's a refreshing change from the films that treat your audience as if they were idiots. If thinking is not your strong point, however, this may not be your movie. Maybe you should go see the latest news from Hollywood studios do not have a brain of the club, but if you are looking for something more, it is where you find it.
