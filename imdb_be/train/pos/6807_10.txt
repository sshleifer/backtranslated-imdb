I have copies of both of these classic films where Robert Blake powerful great actor, where most of the film 1967 Blake more shown standing at the window of the prison told his children's life in which he does so, why he killed the Clutter family did not show during classics that actually went on to tell us what really committed the murder, but it is a great eye catcher in fact, when you watch a movie in 1996 restrained classic makes much more sense.
