May abiding love of the Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, which helped jump-start their puberty with its performance in 1965 "Fireball" has led me to some rather unusual places. Case in point, this British curiosity since 1959, "Carlton-Browne in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs", which shows Lucianna in one of his earliest roles. She plays a princess in it, although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, both of which the stars were definitely on the rise at this point. In this sweet, often very funny movie, we learn about the Madeira-like Gaillardia island state, which was not a British colony until 1916, and then universally forgotten. Forty-three years later, however, he becomes the center of attention and international espionage, where valuable deposits of cobalt were found there, and Her Majesty sends clumsy Carlton-Browne from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take responsibility. Terry-Thomas to downplay this part well, as does the seller in as prime minister Amphibulos in a small country. (It was the second film in 1959 with respect to the Seller a tiny country according wits with the world, other "mouse that roared", of course.) Ayano bath almost outshines here suave Gaillardia King, and my girlfriend Lucianna is as attractive as it may be in its secondary role. The film shows a lot in the way of a very dry sense of humor, although there are some belly laughs to be had (Gaillardian reception in the airport, for example, and especially Pervomaiskii style advice Gaillardian force). And battered Prime Vendor, with its cracked in English and seemingly eternal sweat stains, another memorable character in the pantheon of the great actor. Despite the occasional example or two unscrupulous, cruel upper lip British delirium, I found the picture to be a charmingly modest entertainment, as well as presented on this crisp that looks Anchor Bay DVD.
