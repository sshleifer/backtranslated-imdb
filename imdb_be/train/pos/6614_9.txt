I have read that it is not good that the story is not solid, that Volckman feels that he has failed in some way. <br /> <br /> I do not agree. Firstly, it is well executed. Volckman do well, not only to try a new technique, but also have a focus that should be thinking about: immortality will reduce the cost of living? The big question is ... <br /> <br /> I can see that he was struggling to build a sense of, and he is not compromising. This can only be welcomed. I'm sure it was an interesting exercise to create characters in a form. I saw the artist to reduce the form to bare minimum to build the intensity of the moment. I distinguish this film from it. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is much more interesting than the roto-scoping, Richard Linklater, and history Volckman makes more sense than the later stories Linklater about wasted life on drugs. Old news. Everyone knows it, but nobody does anything about it. Renaissance has more to offer something new to think about. And there are many stories out there with loads of holes in them, which make much better. <br /> <br /> Well done, Volckman. Really good job.
