To my surprise, I really enjoyed the last batch of Disney animation. The film had its lows, but overall I felt that the story was strong and the characters are easy to relate. Well, the movie Animated Disney, which was not a musical. I pushed on to the borders with Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave the music thing a rest. Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la Hercules), and thin, so it still made the children laugh and adults do not feel dizzy or just stupid. <br /> <br /> One disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated films takes place outside of Disney, you think that they will move forward and catch up a little bit. There is something to be said for tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the story of Atlantis! In general, the film was interesting and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex. <br /> <br />
