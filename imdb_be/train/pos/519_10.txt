I first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it. It is beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time. Hard to believe that this was done in 1946, as a fairy tale is still fresh today, and really makes you wonder. I'm not very knowledgeable about the technique of the film, but stunning, given the special effects in this film when it was done. In addition, a great acting, and the use of English and American actors pretty incredible. I recently bought a DVD, so now I can watch whenever I want. I highly recommend to anyone interested in postwar British films to see this.
