this film is a moving, strange piece of work. I saw it in the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 and really not quite "get" ... I saw him once, when I was 20 (in the video, of course, and I am now the owner) and I was just blown away. Steven Spielberg has created a great movie that keeps you wrapped in it from beginning to end. I read the book as well, but there is just something about the film that really brings it to life. casting, acting, music, costumes, scenery, everything is just wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you cheer ... it brings every emotion imaginable. this is one of his best pieces of work, and should not be missed!
