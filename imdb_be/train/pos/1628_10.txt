This is not a bar or the funniest movie I've ever seen. Starting with four criminals sending their parents Wienberg Military Academy tonnes set that steadily continues throughout this fool movie, and it does not allow for a second. <br /> <br /> It's tough trying to describe this film; humor elements so spot on and brilliantly concieved, that at first glance it looks like nothing more than a silly 80 teenage lust comedy. But it's about so much more than that! Fresh in the minds of the people, more in MAD Magazine, Up Academy provides a formula and a style that I have never seen as duplicated ANY of the "ridiculous" suggestions that come out of Hollywood in recent years. Basically the film is so full of infantile cornball material that you could guess that the authors themselves were a few 14-year-olds. See this film if you love to act "immature." A classic. *****
