Henry Hathaway was a brave and enthusiasm, for his love for the people in the first days in US history. However, a critical analysis of the historical inaccuracies of his movie about Brigham Young and the Mormon people are not necessary or useful commentary for this film. In my opinion, Hathaway made an excellent direction, which reports that the Mormons were people in the early history of the Latter-day Saints The Church of Jesus Christ during the period of time since the martyrdom of Joseph Smith in the movie release date. The often fine shooting and delivering dialogue, he covered the Mormon philosophy and doctrine in many segments and scenes. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this movie on many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950s. It was just over 10 years after the release of the film and to the Los Angeles Temple was finished, I watched being built and planted more curious wonder that Mormons. I recently bought this film and I will use the following messages that Hathaway interpreted in his film. <br /> <br /> 1. Love to all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, 2. charitable needy or NO 3. The family is the high significance, 4. Listen respectfully and carefully, because even contradictory messages are important points for consideration and adoption, 5. work, both individually and in society, 6. Prepare and store for future needs of the days, 7. Hope link with the supreme being, and for our daily lives, 8 . and that there is a unique quality for all groups, and evaluate those that are identified as useful.
