What can I say about this movie? I've seen it quite a few times since the first time I was at 6, I have seen the English version, and it is done very well. This is a great movie for all ages, but it is aimed more for children. I love the childish humor and appreciate it. If you have not seen it, you should try to make a copy, you will not be disappointed!
