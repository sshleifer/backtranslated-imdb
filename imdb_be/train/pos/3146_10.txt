If the TV League Baseball, this show will have a perfect record! With a great cast and a great story, this show gave amazing 8 seasons and a lot of joy to the TV after dinner. With the constant changes in the relationship and find out who the real daddy Hyde is, this show was a hit when it began in August 98, although it was established in 1976 and hang out in the masters basement has always been what to do then, and it is still today, along with circles.This show gave a big laugh in the premiere, and it still does during restarts. When you watch a few episodes of the show, you will get everything and want more. Now only this show one of the best ever created, and it is reasonable to ridiculous.
