This was my first introduction to the world of Bollywood and now I'm hooked! Okay, so it requires a different mindset to watch US films, but as soon as you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying it for what it is, you will not be disappointed. Lyrics perfectly, melodic and very catchy. Actors visually appealing, especially Karisma Kapoor, who is certainly one of the most beautiful actresses in the movie anywhere in the world. Space, color mesmerizing. If you want something different, and watch tower, cheered and stimulated I recommend you catch this movie.
