Warm, sweet and surprisingly charming film about two antagonistic working in the same shop (James Stewart and Sallavany) exercising at romance through the mailbox without any of them knowing it. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch holds any sentimental syrupy missing and calls his actor to give a low-key, unpretentious performance. As a result, you will fall in love with almost all of them. <br /> <br /> There's a strong undercurrent melancholy runs through the film, which I appreciated. Loneliness is the main theme, most obviously represented in the character of the shop owner and manager, played superbly by Frank Morgan. He discovers that he is being cuckold by his wife, and understands that a successful life, which he created for himself is not enough to keep him from feeling lonely, if he does not have a partner to share it. This makes timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more acute because they both enter this invisible other, each of which thinks like grooms before they even met. Of course, we all know what happens at the very end, and the film does not let you forget the gloomy feeling any of them would feel when they discovered that the reality did not live up to the fantasy. <br /> <br /> Lubich fills his film is a CrackerJack cast that has chemistry Full boat. A small group of store employees refers to himself throughout the film like a little family, and that's exactly how it feels to us. <br /> <br /> This is a great, unsung novel. <br /> <br /> class: A +
