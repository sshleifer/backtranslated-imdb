Made in the same year, "Vertigo" is equally fascinating film, although in a much lighter vein. It is set in an enchanted New York during the winter: Kim Novak witch who casts a spell over James Stewart, but gets into it instead. Interesting sidelights that rival plays Janice Novak rules created part of Madge in "Picnic" on Broadway (the part that Novak would praise on the film).
