I've seen this film three times, and every time I see it, it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch. <br /> <br /> Proceed surprisingly, not hard to believe, since it is Daniel Day Lewis, who is an amazing actor. Brenda Fricker is a surprise in this strange, though. It captures your heart, as a mother is physically disabled boy who is unable to walk or talk until he was in his late teens. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough good things about the film, but I'll stop here. I recommend it to anyone who likes movies based on real events, or just love a good drama in general.
