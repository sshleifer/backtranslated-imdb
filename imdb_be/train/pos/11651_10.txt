If the friendship is killed, in my opinion, it is very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of anorexia or bulimia. At any time, Lexi (Katie Wright) and Jennifer (Marley Shelton) dropped, I wanted to tear myself. It's kind of hard to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative about things. However, I enjoy the fact that they are doing something together, and get a lecture of their parents. Before we wrap this up, I would say: "If you ask me, if the friendship KILLS really show you how to be anorexic or bulimic can affect the human body." Now, in conclusion, I recommend this film to anyone who does not I saw him. You are in for some tears and a good time, so the next time on the TV, kick back with a friend and watch it.
