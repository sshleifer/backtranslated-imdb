The community theater actor, who is working hard at it, but do not take action too seriously, I always entertained those who treat it as great art. This film skewers "craft of the actor" mercilessly and Dishing up many good laughs. <br /> <br /> ham actor on location for the film has similarities with the dictator. If the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much food and beverage the actor is kidnapped and forced to play "part of life" led by the neo-Nazi secret service. He plays his handle, gets a girlfriend dictator to fall in love with it, and vice versa, and turns the tables on their captors beautiful. <br /> <br /> Many large chip on the findings, a lot to Braille unknown supporting actors, the staff especially the housekeeping and two members of the palace guard, and fun little cameo enough. Sammy Davis Jr. makes light of himself, Jonathan Winters plays a semi-retired American businessman with something else is going on, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga and, above all, Richard Dreyfuss are exceptional. <br /> <br /> This is a silent film, but it has many beautiful places (Brazil), a humorous script and good actors do their thing, and looking, they are actually fun and not going through usually existential angst that only a sham!
