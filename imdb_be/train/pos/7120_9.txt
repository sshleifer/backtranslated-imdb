Most war films made in the United States during World War II were very fun to watch, but suffered from serious gaps in realism, because they have been made more for propaganda value to lighten the mood in the house than anything else. I'm not knocking these films, many of them are still very watchable. However, since they are so often lacking in realism, they can not be truly great movies. A perfect example of the film was John Garfield Air Force - in which the B-17, almost single-handedly takes out half of the Japanese air force! However, the pride of the Marine Corps is a welcome departure - scoring high marks for drawing a genuine story in a fairly accurate manner. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was not the real story, as it seemed too incredible to be true. However, after further research, I discovered that it was actually pretty accurate amazing story of two men who have done so much to earn the Medal of Honor. This is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!
