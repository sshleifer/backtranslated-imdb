Name of onomatopoeia, the sound of a knock on the tram rails. This metaphor for all that people who live in the dump can not be. The suffering of these people are illustrated passing tram, which is a relatively unattainable rich middle class life. The pathos of a young boy and his favorite, unfortunately, crazy father is the most touching. It was the first film of Kurosawa in color, and it uses a beautiful shocking shades, colors seen only in dreams. The film is a surreal and surpassing beauty. Compassion for humanity is to fry the power, but, as always, Kurosawa is focused on capturing the beauty of the film. This masterpiece of the genius of the movie.
