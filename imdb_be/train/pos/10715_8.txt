Teresa Pavlaynk was a popular member of the cast of Toronto Second City. She made a lot of places to sit and advertising here in Canada. Finally someone has the sense to create a show for her. Supporting the case seems to be quite good. Now I watched the pilot several times, and I still find it refreshing. Although, I do not know why the show in The Jane Show 2004 list (I could be wrong) But as far as I know, the exhibition was conceived in 2005 and has appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006 in a fresh idea, and we hope it's good. It is a pity that it can not be paired with Corner Gas. Now I know, Corner Gas on the CTV, but the two shows would be a big part of the companion.
