Great movie, enough laughs and action for all audiences. <br /> <br /> Since the last person located on this film took the Woody Allen called incestuous and not to comment on the movie, I'm here. <, Br /> <br /> film is unlikely duo, Johansson and Allen, they go for the tip, given to them by the ghost of the recently deceased British reporter. Their search takes them to the killers house, and eventually to a few tragic end. But do not let the plot fool you, the film is really fun and a great acting. <br /> <br /> It seems that as the Director reach a certain age, they really get it right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack all seems to make some of the most imaginary work of their careers. In addition, from the movie theater in the pact, you can simply say that people really like Woody Allen and ready for him to really make a comeback. The second he stepped on the audience lit up the screen. There's just something about the man, and he really shines in Scoop. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's worth the trip.
