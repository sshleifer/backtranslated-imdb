Mardi Gras: Made in China is a great film that shows how the two cultures have much in common, but do not even know about the impact of every society has at each other. David Redmon open your eyes and allows you to see how workers in China produce granules which are virtually nothing and sold in the United States up to $ 20. If Redmon asks Americans about where these balls come from they did not have a clue, and seemed to be dumb-founded. When he told them that they are made in China, less than nothing with terrible pay and poor working conditions, Americans seemed to be boring, painful, and some remorse, but do not really think that they will stop buying balls after finding out the truth, If Redmon questioned workers in China they did not know that the Americans were wearing them at the neck and paid so much for these balls. Workers laughing at what purpose was for beads and could not believe it. This movie is a great movie that gives us something to think about in countries other than our own. <br /> <br /> M. Pitts
