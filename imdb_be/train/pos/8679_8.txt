If you're a fan, then you will probably enjoy it. If you do not know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema is, it is not a film to begin with. This is a very cute, foolishly, girls hot, and it's fun to watch. There is no sex at all until the very end of the 45 minute film, but the price of cheese-trippy and the plot is not the same conduit. Misty Mundae makeup is bad in this movie, and her hair in braids uncomfortable, so it is not so hot, in this case, as it was for others. But her panties is quite nice (you just have to watch a movie that does not sound very strange). If you like this, you'll probably enjoy "70-Girl," "Vampire fox" or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a bit more sexually graphic). If you prefer to watch Misty Esmerelda or less sexual and more horror / exploitation based on (but lower budget) films, check out the 2000 factory vebov site.
