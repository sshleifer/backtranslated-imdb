This film strikes me as one of the most successful attempts ever to come up with plausible answers to some of the thorny issues that have arisen in recent years the science of «Passion» (of suffering and death of Christ) accounts in the New Testament. (What prompted Judas, if money is not a problem that can cause the Sanhedrin to meet the high holy day Pilate wafer Why?) It is a film for the serious thinking Christian: fans of "The Passion of the Christ" will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of bloody spectacle and an arch characteristics. As for me, I believe, a portrait painted here - about the readiness of ordinary people, so carelessly sacrificed common decency, if their own self-interest at stake - much more realistic and deeply troubling. (Selfless, "just doing his job" view of the human person, which turns the first nail in the wrist Christ as cooling at any point in the film.) The film is not intended to be "genuine", but the settings and costumes always feel more "right" than many of the more highly appreciated efforts. It's a slow film, but if you accept its voluntary limits (this is, after all, "Death" - not life - "Christ"), in the final analysis, it is very helpful to each.
