Arthur Bach decidedly unhappy in his life as a billionaire and is drawn to people "under him" in a social situation - he pays for the prostitute in the opening scene, and then very attracted to the store <br /> <br. /> He drinks a lot, too, and sometimes he drives, drinking and that, of course, is not funny, ever. <br /> <br /> In the film great, but for some comedy, reality, too. John Gielgud wipes the floor with all the screen and created a character for the ages. It's about Oscar worthy. Moore and Minnelli has its moments, but its Gielgud as "Hobson," do you remember the most.
