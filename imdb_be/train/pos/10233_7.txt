I have always been interested in watching movies in Hong Kong, but they could not meet my expectations ... until now! Burning Paradise does not contain flat humor of most Hong Kong movies have, nor the second speed of the storyline that was involved in the film. History is not complicated, but it is never the scenes that are only there to fill in some "smart" space (the only truly intelligent martial arts film that I have seen in Crouching Tiger, but as part of Hollywood that's not true HK film for me). There are some incredible fight scenes in this film, from the first (which is one of the coolest I've ever seen, but it is short) to the last main stage! But the mind, there are also a lot of blood flowing (people cut in half, beheaded, and so on). Production is pretty good and special effects show that the imagination of the writer can be made, even if some of the shots have to be pretty technical (notice: a sheet of paper, which he throws and got pinned to the wall). Yes, this is not Tsui Hark and John Woo, who has made my favorite Hong Kong film, is Ringo Lam! And I'm sure as hell going to check out more of this director! Ace.
