I saw it on the SBS TV here in Australia last week, where he was named "Laputa: Castle in the Sky." I let the subtitles, I think, the SBS provided their own to ensure that, as usual, was very good quality. <br /> <br /> Just looked "Laputa" in Wikipedia, and it confirms what I suspected ... the floating island of the story is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift's novel "Gulliver's Travels", which was published in the early and mid 1700 -x years. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is an attractive Japanese fairy tale, which includes English speaking voice cast. It is suitable for small children, I think, but it works for a little over two hours in length, so that it may be too long for some, but not for an adult like me. <br /> <br /> The story of two children who are trying to find a legendary floating island, which has a lock on it. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have the pirates, the army and spies looking for the island too, and is looking to capture children (Sieve, girl, voiced by Anna Paquin and groove, boy, voiced James Van Der Beek), to help them find it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are great ... like a photo-realistic at times, especially masonry scene lit torch light, or beautiful scenes of bright, sunny days, with white clouds, or fog. <br /> <br /> recommended.
