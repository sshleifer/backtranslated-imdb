Eight simple rules began as a very interesting series. I love John Ritter, and his character Paul Hennessy and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> I have always preferred Kerry Bridget, Bridget has been done before, Cary pretty unique and I can relate to it in many ways, although I'm not sure I like the direction her character went in later series. <br /> <br /> Early episodes were fun, good simple teenage stories about Paul and Cate discipline children, but I think that the show lost it's spark when John Ritter died. I admired the cast and crew for those who want to continue the series, but when he died, I felt that the program made. For me, the whole point of the show was based around leadership and "8 Simple Rules dating my teenage daughter," it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and relevance and angle display changed without Hennessey father. <br /> <br /> Bridget seemed to get more annoying, Rory remains the same and Kate always gave lessons in her offspring life, which before seemed funnier if he left Paul. I think Granddad funny (especially if he was watching The Great Escape), but I feel C.J unnecessary show. He was funny in parts, but I felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedy series. For all later is not bad just not enough excitement and anyone else find it annoying that Kate works in the school and C.J and Granddad always there, too? I always recommend it to show a friend, as it was very strong at the beginning and should look at Paul and Kerry, but later were about average at best.
