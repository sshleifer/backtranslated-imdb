Not only that, this film is a great film for the core of Cinematography (script, acting, settings, etc.), but also for his realism. This film can take place in any farm or rural area. It does not matter if the film takes place in Louisiana or if this will take place in Kansas. History and posts it includes will remain the same. This film shows the family values ​​and a connection for an older audience, while at the same time it shows the behavior of the young for the young audience. Anyone who looks can get away with something by touching them personally, I know what I did. Ending hits too close to home for me not to cry every time I watch it. Ending emphasizes the importance of security of the farm, and anyone who has ever worked on a farm should see this film. Not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations. <br /> <br />
