Amazing, fantastic, probably the best musical adventure of Disney. I liked this movie more than 35 years because it is a creative, intelligent and fun. Even though the stupid "flying bed" scene, other scenes and dialogue are magical and funny. They could have chosen anyone better than Angela Lansbury played briar? I can not think of anyone better suited for this role. Alteration of this classic will be so stupid as remake Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, though he had several roles in film quality, absolutely shines in this adventure. He was a comic genius that is often forgotten in our time. Raging, prim Englishman - nobody could really make a farce and remove it as gracefully as he does. It would be tragic to remake this film, because Tomlinson was dead for several years, and no one can take his place and make his character justice. <br /> <br /> Dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just do not catch. I especially like the part where the Germans invade the house Brier, and it should protect it in any way she can. <br /> <br /> bouncing along, staggering along the bottom of the beautiful briny sea. Richard and Robert Sherman outdid themselves on musical numbers. All of them are fantastic and it should be remembered, Portobello Road is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> great film, which still holds today !!
