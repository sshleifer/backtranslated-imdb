Joan Fontaine stars as the villain in the film of the Victorian era. She convincingly played a married woman who has a lover on the side, and sets his sights on a rich man, Miles Rushworth, who plays Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is quite good as Miles. Miss Fontaine acted her part to perfection - it was at the same time cunning, calculating, innocent looking, frightened and charming. It takes an actress with an unusual talent to pull it off. Joan Fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in an elegant dress Travis Banton. In addition, in the film the mother of Joan Lilian Fontaine, Lady Flora. I highly recommend this film.
