The film is good, it has it's moments, the music scene is best! The soundtrack is a real classic. It's the perfect album, it starts with Let's Go crazy (for a start, because it's a great party song and a very fast pace), Take Me With U (fun pop songs ...), The Beautiful Ones (cheerful ballad, probably closer just to the R & B throughout the album), the Blue Computer (some angry anthem towards Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs ever, it is very vague Appolonia pokes fun at), if Doves Cry (the climax of this masterpiece) I would Die 4 the U, baby, I'm the star, and of course, Purple Rain (true classic, a very appropriate ending to this classic album) film and the album are both very good. I highly recommend them!
