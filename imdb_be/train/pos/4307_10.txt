Well, maybe not directly to the Rodney King riots, but even a few months before it was quite timely. My parents said that they had seen it and the next thing you know, the police received LA innocent and burned to the ground. It just goes to show the state of race relations in America. The site has a white Mack (Kevin Kline) and an African-American, Simon (Danny Glover) become friends after Simon rescues Mac life in the black ghetto. Meanwhile, the film's producer Davis (Steve Martin in a minor role) believes that groundless violence really cool ... until he gets shot. There are also some existentialism in the film :. Mack and his family come to understand that they are not living the way they really want <br /> <br /> It seems that «Crash» has slightly increased people's interest in race relations, but this one came much before. Maybe we will never have a stable relationship in this country races. But anyway, the "Grand Canyon" is a great film. He argues Kevin Kline as my favorite actor. Also starring Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
