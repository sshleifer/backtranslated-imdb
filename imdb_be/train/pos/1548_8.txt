Fortunately, not knowing anything about this movie I was interesting enough to write to his film from the TV. And then the tape ran out five minutes before the end! <br /> <br /> But I'm glad that I managed to get most of them, because it really is a great spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and slightly hazy areas, but also a very frightening and even daring moments. Taking into account the production in 1969, some slight lesbian overtones should be raised a few eyebrows. Of course, now it is no surprise, but those scenes, in fact, seems to be pretty nicely done. And it's not only because of the two actresses George. <br /> <br /> gas attack does not seem to hit every viewer very much, it is not surprising, and it certainly hit me. Very effective. In addition, the viewpoints on both sides of rivals gives the whole story more shallow along the usual suspense and action. This is not just a heroic war story one hand winners, but shows what lies behind victory in the good and bad. Well, being the case of war, mostly bad. <br /> <br /> For fans of the composer Ennio Morricone is also a must. His work is always excellent, touching, but never over the top. And I think I have to try and catch more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about the young lady! Hopefully, they will get it on DVD soon, so that I can have the whole movie in my collection and more people become familiar with this little-known gem.
