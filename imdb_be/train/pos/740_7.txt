"Fox" a serious look at the consequences grow too quickly in the 1980s. And unlike teen sex comedies that keep him (Bold do fast times at Ridgement High), the film holds up well against time. <br /> <br /> The theme of teenage angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago, Jodie Foster and Scott Baio sk8er Boi (remember him?) lead a fine young actor's well worth watching. <br /> <br /> film four southern girls in California, as they move through the rootless existence of sex and drugs and deprived parents. Teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties, concerts, or on the street. They rarely home because of instant gratification is a tablet, the party, or the boy away. <br /> <br /> But instead of condemning them, the film is responsive, accusing the absent, indifferent adult for forcing teenagers to grow alone. And charismatic cast is impossible not to love. <br /> <br /> opening film ?? long and likes to lord - sets the tone for what is worth. We see that the girls are asleep at dawn among the objects that define adolescent virginity, from Twinkies to picture the young John Travola, while Donna Summer's "On the Radio" was killed under him. <br /> <br /> From there, the film picks up speed as the girls head to school and for life. Annie (Runaway rocker Cherry Curry) is the wild child who lives in the next game, or tablet. Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is boy crazy drama queen. Madge (Marlilyn Straw) is a shy girl over her head. And Foster is the one with the plan. It's her job to keep this team together long enough to finish high school, and holding her divorced and a mother desperate man hunting in line (Sally Kellerman). <br /> <br /> it is almost an impossible task, and one that Foster ultimately fails in. <br /> <br /> Despite his age, the "Foxes" is a pleasure to watch. Dated hair, clothing, as well as links to the Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill will not hurt the film. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply stunning, with a spectacular swimming pool filter arrows LA at dawn, dusk and at night. Giorgio Moroder soundtrack adds 80s with similar Donna Summer and Janis Ian. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the film is that young stars around Foster never broke as casts "St. Elmo Fire" (1985) and "Empire Records" (1995). "The Fox" shows why they should have. But it may be as Bowling for Soup song "1985," they just hit the wall.
