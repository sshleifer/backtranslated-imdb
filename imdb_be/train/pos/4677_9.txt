I understand that this film will be his debut and, as such, it is very impressive. It has the feel and Shagan "real indie", but director Todd Yellin clearly has the photographic and editorial vision, the team and the opinion of an adult and a seasoned professional. Shots are well designed and thought out and serve to move the story forward. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomon put a story that has far more depth and lyricism than the typical "paint by numbers" type scenario. This is a story that needs Judd Hirsch character caliber talent to have a chance to work. Judd is fantastic as usual; like Scott Cohen and beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise, though Elliot Korte, who plays Adam Gr√∂den. Elin was able to persuade the nuance of a young actor in roles that could be easily devalue stereotypes or drag. Anyway, I found the film a refreshing and interesting.
