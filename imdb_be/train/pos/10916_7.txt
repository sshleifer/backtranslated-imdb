Comic banter between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery, which has one of the most surprising and unexpected stories ever. Powell is probably the most helpful detective with 30s, and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds as a sequence of small tinkly bells. They are very interesting to watch, so bring a brazen plot with a grain of salt and just a pleasure to see it unfold. Eric Blore also has some comic turns as the butler. <br /> <br /> Powell Powell contract with MGM included a provision that allowed it to refuse to be loaned out to another studio, but he wanted to work again with Arthur, and he liked the script, so he willingly accepted the assignment. They worked together in two films, one thousand nine hundred twenty-nine the Paramount, Canary Murder case and Greene murder case, as in the series of Philo Vance.
