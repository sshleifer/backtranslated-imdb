Love Rosario Dawson, she thinks she's one of the best actresses of our time. <br /> <br /> Descent, seems to be more about self-empowerment, than anything else. This is a consistent undertone throughout the film. Dialogue is flat characters, seemingly deliberately bland and one-sided. Only the consistency of presentation of self in the characters and travel to Rosario itself empowering for loss of office and back. <br /> <br /> pitching it as a classic of rape is not appropriate, and that's probably why so many people do not enjoy the film. Standard "rape" the audience would not particularly like this movie, and perhaps this is the case? The film asks more questions than answers, and he does it resist the target audience, whether they like it or not. There is a strong relationship between the characters and the audience and while the film does not slap the audience in the face smug arrogance is to attract viewers to what may or may not be all the wrong reasons. <, Br /> <br /> Descent good movie, IMHO greatly underestimated.
