The next two seasons of the original series was less dim. Recent campaigns disastrous reshuffle contributed to its short life duration of three seasons. Maybe, if the plug was pulled after the first season, it would have gained a cult. <br /> <br /> In addition, the first season was really fun! Witty, clever with excellent written form it was promising. great brew the first season had the right ingredients - the characters / actor, the story, and so on. Plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original in the bargain. Nora and her colleagues "photographers" stealthily, night after night, day after day for exclusives. <br /> <br /> A lot of things does not make sense to me. For example, as this show, and my second favorite - Grosse Pointe never "made it." If only the first seasons of the bare truth, and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, please, who is there?
