The original name means "birth of an octopus." I must admit that I do not quite understand the name. The English name "Water Lilies." But after the author, I read a comment on another user: "The name of the French language is also suggestive:" prieuve ", or octopus, requires an individual has to juggle a lot of pressure at the same time." Thank you for your explanation. <br /> <br /> The main theme is the first sexual emotions of girls, if it is not clear when they are directed to the same or opposite sex. It is no different for boys. I think that both Floriane and Marie will eventually heterosexual feelings without any impurities. <br /> <br /> Most of the water ballet film. Sometimes, the girls will have their heads down, and nothing above the water, except for their feet and legs down, by means of which they will fly and kick in the air. For people like me, who have never seen such a thing before, it was very interesting. - Florian is the leader of a team of "lily". <br /> <br /> Marie tells her that she wanted to see if Floriane is training. It seems to be their first contact, which is not just the usual. Soon they will go together. Floriane takes Marie to the garage, where the boy was waiting for her, and then leaves him for an hour, while Marie is waiting for her return. I took it for granted that it is time to sleep with each other. But we later learned from the movie that they do less. <br /> <br /> I can give you some information that many users will find elsewhere. There is a scene in which Marie secretly steals bag Floriane debris. In it, she finds an apple, mainly eaten. And Marie continues to eat anything else. ?? There is a parallel scene in another movie, «Kazetachi NO Gogo» (Afternoon Breezes) by Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980). We are talking about adults young women and explicitly lesbian woman recklessly in love with a heterosexual woman. It also steals a bag for a loved one waste and is more or less eaten apple and eat the rest. <br /> <br /> Floriane Later Marie says that she would like to have her first orgasm from it. Mary says that she can not do it. <br /> <br /> But even later Marie says she really wants to do it. And she masturbates on Floriane. There's no nudity in this scene. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only female director could make such a subtle psychological research show or ?? I would like to quote Baudelaire, «Les Amours enfantines». <br /> <br /> Floriane plays Adèle Haenel, who did an excellent job as an autistic girl in the "devils" Christophe Ruggia (2002)? ? very underrated film.
