I just finished listening to director's commentary for this film, and I think that one big thing I got from him that I agree with the fact that this film, like Mann's The Insider, completely subjective. This is from the POV of Howard. Thus, any attempt to review or contemplating a lot of comments about this, like Ebert, in fact about the nature of Nolte really. If you feel as he did, that the film "is not working", then you say, I think Howard is not working. And, frankly, you may be right. reasoning and personality Howard really will not stand up to professional mental processes and analysis. <br /> <br /> But, hey, it's the nature of people. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
