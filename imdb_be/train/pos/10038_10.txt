Titanic to be one of my favorite movies. It has its problems (what movies do), but still, it's nice. <br /> <br /> When I come across someone asks me why I love Titanic I guess my first reaction, "wait a minute, are not you? "I know a lot of people who do not like this movie, and I'm not saying that I do not understand why. "The love story too cheesy" Well, yes, but it is not so pleasant and move? Good, a love story between Jack and Rose are very unrealistic, everyone knows that love, as it does not actually exist. But this movie is not all enjoy watching a beautiful story that allows us to slip a little imagination for a while? Next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet terrible actors. Well, in this movie, I agree that they do not fulfill their full potential. However, I believe that it is unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately very famous film, they are not surprising. But the role they are given simple, and the characters seem very real, that you can take care of them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they are not doing as well as could be expected. <br /> <br /> And finally, if one will complain that they do not like this film, because they hate affair, or because they hate the story, tragic movies, I'm sorry, but why they go and see a film that is so clear, all these things. It's like people who complain about the Dark Knight a bad movie, because they hate the militants. Just to be a movie, not because you do not like the genre, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> Well deserves its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I have ever seen in a movie to save, perhaps, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br /> <br /> I know that some of the letters can not, for example, the constant cry of the names of each other throughout the film. Retrospection of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it's an amazing achievement in the creation of the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feeling so epic. <br /> <br /> I can see why many people do not like this film, but for the most part reduced to their basic idea of ​​love, for example, it will be a love story, but not their thinking, the film itself is poorly constructed. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memory forms the day it happened, and this film is very historically accurate to keep only a few drawbacks. Only the main ones I can find is that the pipeline should be threaded copper instead of steel, and the iceberg looks pretty unrealistic, like the scene where they hit him. <br /> <br /> I give this film 10/10, not because I love romantic movies, but simply because it is an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling terrified realistic adaptation events.
