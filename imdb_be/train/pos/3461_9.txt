This episode of Columbo, probably noted more for director Steven Spielberg as one of his early films. This should be seen in the role of Jack Cassidy as a murderer who kills his partner in writing, to preserve their way of life. Jack Cassidy will appear later in Columbia. In the end, Columbo meets his match in the character of Jack Cassidy. It is a mystery writer who builds execute a perfect murder. After the first killing his next victim will annoy the general store owner / widow who will blackmail him for money. Rather than lose more money, he kills her. It is very interesting to see Cassidy and Falk, as always. familiarity Falk as Columbo makes it watchable after watching this episode several times over the years. The fact that today television forgets about the success of years is that people will want to watch the show again and again that they like the characters. It's not about who does it, how and why it familiarness with Columbia and his likability, which kills a high in the audience, as I do.
