I just managed to get the Celestial Region 3 DVD from five Venom, and what a super job they made of it. Fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any fan of kung fu. <br /> <br /> stories are pretty straight forward, and mentioned above, so I will not go into it again. Needless to say that this fight scenes that many people buy the film for, and they do not disappoint. Only problem is that they are a bit few and far from each other and seem to be more rehearsed. Bruce Lee could take a lot of these, and a cup of tea at the same time! All kicks and punches come with all important "type writer" clicks and air "Unreal", which is a cool effect, but quite funny! <br /> <br /> I give this film B +. Good, but not great. In a sense, I feel that it might be a little better. Golden Swallow, the same director of ten years ago, there was a good story, and the best action.
