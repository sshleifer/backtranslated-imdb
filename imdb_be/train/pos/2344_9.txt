I am one of those people who tend to watch the program and keep their feelings about the show ordinary. Nevertheless, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program of the commercials that were broadcast that gave glimpses of the background of the show. I was skeptical at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under is still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought, that it took the death of the subject and presented in a way that was acceptable without painful. Characters had to deal with and I like the idea of ​​the protagonist Ned is not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without consequences of her death. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters are striving for the things that they can not have. In addition, Ned and Chuck, Olive is eager to Ned. Lily and Vivian yearn for his niece, Chuck and Emerson always eager to cash consideration of mysterious deaths, which they decide. I think the characters and believable picture perfect. I like Emerson, who plays the black from the other characters, as an African-American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. <br /> <br /> In general, a visual tale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that I saw with the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for romantics and only one made it to the mystical-buff. I just want to be the authors would get back to work, so that the show can continue to develop.
