This is not the comedy of Robin Williams, and not nimble / mad Robin Williams recently glory thriller. It is a hybrid of classical drama without excessive dramatization, mixed with new love Robin thriller. But this is not a thriller in itself. This is more of a mystery / suspense vehicle through which Williams is trying to find a sick boy and his guardian. <br /> <br /> Also starring Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin, this exciting drama plays pretty much like a report to William's character is close to achieving its goal. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was very entertained, but this film can teach, guide, review, or be entertained. It felt like I was watching a guy (Williams), as it was actually performs actions in terms of the third party. In other words, it felt real, and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story. <br /> <br /> In general, it is worth a look, although it is definitely not a Friday / Saturday night fare. <, Br /> <br /> This rate is 7.7 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> enemy's :.
