I recently saw the film and liked it very much. This gives an idea to make indie films and how much work is really involved, if you have a low budget still need a name actor / actress to get people, all people come to see him and give exposure film. Bobby Myeres played Modin and his partner Sol - Paul Linder makes a great combination to find eccentric Miachel Bates, «NAME» actor played by Alan Bates was ideal casting for the film and for the film. My favorite actor member Sandy Ryan again playing the wonderful and underrated Debra Kara Unger with its own special performance in the movie in the movie. If you like to think when watching comedy, then this one is for you. Low budget corresponds to a low budget with high laughter.
