A good story and great animation. Influence Frazetta and Bakshi obvious, and it's a good thing. Anyone who loves Conan the Barbarian or the game Dungeons and Dragons have to enjoy it. The struggle between good and evil is clear, though it might seem that from time to time our hero is neutral. Most often in fantasy movies Elves are usually depicted as having white skin and blond hair, and goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair. Anyone who is familiar with Frazetta years, Bakshi, or even the work of Tolkien know that they are not racist. Anyone who loves fantasy films should enjoy this film. It is not for small children due to violence and sexual innuendo. The casting was well done and the music scene and the first speed. I hope someone puts the stone on DVD soon. I consider myself fortunate to have a VHS copy in good condition.
