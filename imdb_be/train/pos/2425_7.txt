I caught this film on IFC, and I liked it, although I felt that the work of the editing was a bit rough, though it may have been deliberate. I had a little hard time to figure out what's going on in the first, because they seemed to be going for a little Pulp Fiction style linear plot presentation. It seemed a bit forced, though. Of course, I think the movie is worth watching, but I think he could use a little cleaning up. Some scenes just do not seem to make sense after the other. <br /> <br /> I am surprised to see the low rating here like this. It is not outstanding, but it does not have any really serious problems. I gave it a 7/10. The film did show at least Laurence Fishburne can act if he wants to. They must have just said he was not in the matrix movies.
