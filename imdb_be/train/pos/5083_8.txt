In the hands of less actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this film could be a stupid and vulgar. But with these two experienced thespians leading the way, I found «Silent Fury», to be the most exciting and enjoyable bit of an enigma. If their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert was already married, and that he was the best man at the wedding, you can feel that there is some kind of conspiracy against her at work. As Colbert, Ryan and her lawyer set out to challenge other people say, prior marriage, they meet at every turn over evidence that seems to strengthen the claim that she really has Wed. Despite the fact that it is not very difficult to find out who the main "villain", it is still a lot of fun, as the intensity of the scene and the pace increases. In general, a good, solid mystery film with excellent performances of the two leading actors and a great supporting cast, which includes often underestimated Paul Kelly.
