This film is funny and suitable for all ages. This is definitely a family-style entertainment. The cast does an excellent job playing the man in the middle of the western city of Great Bean, Illinois. Where we should not assume that nothing is happening, as the excitation (pre-war) decade is a new (and only) exit ramp from Interstate. Place calls as appropriate boring and very unlikely to invade the Earth Martians. But the Martians were completely unsuitable, in spite of the well-equipped arsenal of suitable horrible death and weapons ... including one set to eradicate the Martians too! Martians dead pan and throw their lines in just the right accents to make us spectators and local residents want to help them to ... leave the land. J. J. Anderson plays a very young Halloween carnivorous duck only has great lines. See this movie for laughs and entertainment; that make us think that it is not. But it is subtle and pleasant.
