This is a very good film crackles with tension. The wheels, of course, high - will the police and Widmark, a doctor of public health, the capture of criminals who are unaware that they are carriers of the plague, before a full-scale epidemic breaks out? But the smaller elements of the plot to introduce tension in every scene - between Widmark and the police captain, between the bad guys play Palance and Mostel between Palance and dying Plagued man whom Palance mistakenly believes is the subject wanted, because he has smuggled in some valuable goods between Widmark and his wife, and the basic question of whether the public is better served by their hazard communication or hide the situation, to avoid a full-blown panic. The film is beautifully shot Kazan, in a very well choreographed long takes were shot on location in New Orleans, and ends in a stunning climax where Palance runs like a rat with his pursuers through the city docks and warehouses. Commentary is excellent, probably the best I've heard, covering cinematography, framing and lighting shots, product design, casting non-professional actors in small roles, and paradoxes, and concurrency in the plot, as the astute workshop on the 1950 film techniques and film noir in whole. Watch it once to enjoy the film on its own, and if you are interested in the film industry, the second time with the comment to see.
