Gray Gardens were captured and mind, and you just could not look away. It was so strange, and funny and sad, and sick and ?????? .. really no words to describe. Going Gray Gardens goes strange. I learned about this film reads a great reading my Uncle John's room, bathroom Institute of Reader, and it was well worth the rent and crash into the upper part of my viewing of the film line. This film is about nuttiest most eccentric people who might ever have been removed. We must look for their favorite outfits Eddie, who, I am sure, include curtains. When I get old, I almost want to be like Big Eddie, flipping my nose in the normal and the society.
