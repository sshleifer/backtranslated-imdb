First of all, I would like to say that Edison Chen are very hot, and that Sam Lee looks much better than before XD! This is probably one of the most original movies I've seen so far; It shows the way of life of the Cambodian poverty background. Cambodian (aka Edison Pang) goes around killing people in order to survive themselves; I did this throughout his life. (Wai) Sam Lee duty is to seize Cambodian forever. There are tons of violence, but it has a good story to it. The film shows the struggle between these two characters; they both hit each as evil dogs. Blogs PPL ... STRONGLY SUGGESSTED !!! (GO HK FILMS)
