This is a very good movie. Do you want to know the real reason why so many knocks this film here? I'll tell you. In this film, you have a black criminal, outwits white professor. Black cop who says white professor, he is wrong for the protection of black criminals and black cop is right this way. ?? making white professor look ridiculous. It always comes down to race. This is a great movie. Do not pay attention to the racist. If you can get over that there are characters who play blacks in this film, which is to outwit the white characters, then you should not have any problems to enjoy this film. I recommend to everyone to go see this movie.
