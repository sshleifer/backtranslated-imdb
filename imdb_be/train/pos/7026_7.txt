When I was 17, my high school set Bye Bye Birdie. - which is not a big surprise, since it is an ideal high school material, and which is considered the most staged musical in the world <br /> <br /> I was a music student and retained strong memories of the products and their songs, as well as stored disregard for the movie version of Dick Van Dyke, who had (deliberately) obscured link Elvis and his audience slept shimmering 60th. <br /> <br /> So, if the version of one thousand nine hundred ninety-five Jason Alexander hit screen cable TV, I was delighted with what I saw. Alexander turns in an exceptional performance as Albert, speaking in a strong contrast with his more famous person of a particular series. The rest of the cast is captivating and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips, perhaps the only one who does not look her part, it is supposed to be naive and innocent schoolgirl). <br /> <br /> But best of all, a musical number, familiar with the stage show all preserved in this film, and acted as a stage musical songs have to be (in the absence of the stage). <br /> <br /> So, if you know the music (and the few who does not), then check out this telemovie. This makes the stage show of justice can thus be likely to improve, that's good enough for me. What's better than the visualization of the writer accurately and with color and style?
