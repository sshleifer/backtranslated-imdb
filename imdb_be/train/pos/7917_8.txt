After reading other reviews and comments cool, I felt I had to come to bat for this film. <br /> <br /> Roeg movies usually has little to do with each other, and wait for this to be one of his you like probably the sign. <br /> <br /> What this film is a thoughtful and calm view of religious faith. The only film like this in terms of its religious message must be in Tolkien `The Rapture". <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that someone could say that the story of a complicated or supernatural. It's just a movie about the Catholic faith miracles and redemption -.. although you never guess it till the end it is also the only film I can think of that resolution is, quite literally, on the pun <br /> <br /> as the (fortunately) fell Catholic himself I know that the film is about, and I find that a bit of tenderness in his ultimate innocence of the relationship between God and man m. But if you are not familiar with the theology on which the film is based, then it will go right over your head. <br /> <br /> As a film, as opposed to the story `Cold Heaven» it is not innovative. The while `the Rapture« heaviest of iconic significance and cinematic imagery, `Cold Heaven» reduces its cinematic quality. There's no bright shots, Sun dramatic effect, any attempt to adapt content to form. This skillful shooting, but suppressed. He also has no dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama. This is a simple story that unfolds simply. It may seem strange; but in the end the mystery is revealed. It is a mixed picture; but with one line ambiguity disappears in a puff of Catholic dogma. <br /> <br /> In this regard, `Cold Heaven» has at its heart is just the kind of thing that drives the film as `The Sting,« or 'Sixth Sense' ili` Final Descent ", Polanski or 'purely formal All these films trick sleeves They can stop you on the way, but they have a point to the obvious one, actually -... but fun, at least in part, taken <br /> < br /> However, even if it seems that a little more than a shaggy dog ​​story with a twist, it is necessary to look at how it operates, and misdirects-you. Try it, especially to the Are you, or have ever been, a Catholic.
