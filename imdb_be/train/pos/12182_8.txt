I have not done any research on the film before my first show, because it was part of a set of boxes Wells I recently bought. Set box I basically got because I wanted to have A Man For All Seasons and also overestimate Waterloo. So I stick to Orson and Rita in the player, and I refers to a class and confusion in equal measure. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the story seemed simple, a man meets a gorgeous woman and save her from a couple of thugs, they click immediately, and the person gets a job offer on the cruise with the woman and her husband, the famous lawyer, and then ... .......... <br /> <br /> ..well it becomes a murder mystery built leprosy and many machinations. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles} does not know what is happening, he is confused, as a spectator, and it's great to see how he is drawn around the place pretty much everything in the film. Obviously, to pull the strings of the heart, a fatal woman such beauty as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth} has its moments, but you just know that everything will go pear shaped. <br /> <br /> So many beautiful things in the movie, he has a Wells visual style in all this , to see the scene in the aquarium, which is amazing and ending sequences in a fun house majestically on the eye. narrative and Dr. O'Hara is the very gleefully mocking, and we get a good relief of light through a court case with Everett Sloane significantly illuminating case. <br /> <br /> However, the strangeness of the film, but in fact it is the changeable impressions view, {because I had to find out, after} studio bosses cut the film to quite a lot for an hour, and it's just not only care about our audience, but unfair to the vision of Wells. I am sure that the full original cut of the film would be praised and honored wholesale, as it tho, we have a very good and intriguing movie, one that suggests, unfortunately, only greatness but still devilishly exciting movie that I'm glad I've got to go back on. 8.5 / 10
