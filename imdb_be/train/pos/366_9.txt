This film is so great that it is difficult to find words to describe it. This is the only time when I can not decide which is better, the book or the film. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is awesome, and Oprah Winfrey is such a good actress, it could be a fun, happy and unhappy all at the same time. All together, the film was a good film director Steven Spielberg, and should not be passed up. 9/10
