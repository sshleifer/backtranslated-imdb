I have read most of the comments on this film. I saw this film (and a number of prophecy) many times with family members of all ages, we all enjoyed, and it just made us think about what we already knew from reading and studying the Bible about the fascination and the end of time . No one injured or frightened, as I read on some posts. The film is only on the basis of biblical facts. I've seen a lot since the end of "Sadness" films, "Armageddon" and so on, and so far this one is among the best in the presentation of biblical truth. He may not have a lot of good special effects, like today's movies, but I think this is a good indication of the instrument. This film and his prophecies series can be seen on this site higherpraise.com, and judge for yourself freely. Blessings to all.
