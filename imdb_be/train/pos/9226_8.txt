I read about FLAVIA heretic for many years, but I only got to see it at the beginning of last year, when I went on a crazy movie-buying binge, and, for some reason, it was on my mind lately, although it was a few months, as I watched it. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing film set in Italy somewhere around the 15th century. Definitely Medieval era (although I do not think any particular year ever given). Since that time, the Christian domination, age is a time of complete madness, and the film captures that very well. <br /> <br /> Flavius, our main character, a young lady who meets a Muslim fallen on the battlefield, he appears to have a warm and intriguing man, and she immediately took her. Her father, a soldier of the family of any provision, comes almost immediately, and the wounded man murder right before her eyes. But it will continue to see him in my dreams <br /> <br /> Her father ships her in a convent, which is more like the outdoors a psychiatric hospital -. Residents who so brutally suppressed unyielding medieval Christianity, was slowly going crazy. Flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns. But in a mad world, only the normal, really mad, and it's clearly a sociopath sister recognizes the madness around her. Her take on the time in which they live strikes a chord with Josephus, who, as a young and apparently sheltered, begins to question everything about the world in which she finds herself trapped. <br /> <br /> The film is adamant in its portrayal of the world, showing a lot of trouble. We see the horse castrated, insole rape one of the wives of his land in a pigsty, torture pious young nun. Despite all this, Josephus notes and questions, not taking, in the end, the Christian dogma that creates the horror hits in terms that would benefit the film some criticism over the years for seeming anachronism. I do not agree with this criticism. Flavia views, though sometimes appear in such a way that the mirror is not clear, for example, then the modern feminist comments (the film was made in 1974), revolves around what is actually fairly obvious questions. It may be hard to believe that she could be so many fish out of water in its own time, but it is a kind of small change does not peel. Flavia is written in such a way that those of our era or any era, to empathize with her plight. Bogged down in such a case will be missing the forest for the trees. <br /> <br /> Flavia inspired when Muslims come intruding into the countryside, and it is in their leader, a new version of the beautiful Islamist who still visits her dream. Smitten with her almost immediately, he allows her to almost lead his army, becoming a Joan of Arc figure in full battle garb, and directing the invader to ruin Christian society, and takes revenge on all those she saw to commit evil. <, Br /> <br /> she announced a new and better world? She may think so, but the Muslims of that era were not big feminist, and as she soon finds out the hard way. As they say, meet the new boss ... <br /> <br /> It's really just a miniature some of the things that happen in FLAVIA heretic. The film is quite dark, and very dark, quite upset end. Not a film to a mass audience at all, to be sure. It's pretty good, though not to rely on «nunsploitation» stack on which it is often carelessly thrown. I think there is a lot of value in the last film, and I'm glad that I've seen.
