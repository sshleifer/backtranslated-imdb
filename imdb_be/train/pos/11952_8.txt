Scoop *** **** with Woody Allen is certainly not my favorite director, but I enjoyed the «Match Point». It was a great dark romantic thriller, which, fortunately, is not the star of Woody Allen. It really was a beautiful Scarlett Johansson in this. <br /> <br /> «scoop" is the latest film by Woody Allen, and though he seems to be in it, that's fine. It also features Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfectly together. <br /> <br /> Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, young college journalist who gets the scoop of life time from the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane). Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the death and a bunch of other souls took the reaper. One of this soul is secretary Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She tells Joe that Peter might be a serial killer roaming the streets of England. Joe with a scoop of lifetime, travels to life and provides that information to Sondra, during a magical act. Sondra is in some magical show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen). She became a volunteer to go into the field and disappearing until it is in the box, she receives a visit from Joe. Not knowing what to do, she enlists Sid Waterman, to help her crack the case. <br /> <br /> This film has a nice carefree feel to it compared with "Match Point" and yet it all works, Johansson and Allen work well together. Elena humor fits perfect for the story and the role. X 'S Jackman is terrific, Peter Lyman in "suspected" serial killer. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to see if your ever looked for one to watch. ensemble cast works well together and the story flows, and you sometimes forget that your watch Woody Allen to be themselves. I say, let him w Heff, because you just might like it.
