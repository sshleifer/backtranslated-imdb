Alain Resnais films terrible that they do not actually edited patency, but instead shot seems to end where memory is edited. Love to death sometimes quiet existential drama and rounded creative magic realist film, and somehow relates to the audience a completely new aspect of relations Eros / Thanatos ... or possibly create new relationships that agape / Thanatos. <br /> <br /> in the beginning as a bizarre horror film of the surrealists. The woman desperately running around the house, while a man lies dying in her bed - she had killed him, or what happened? Soon this tension dissolve as a doctor comes and says he was dead, but there begins a new, unfamiliar drama: a man wakes up, and after a dead woman and a man falls in love is actually very tragic consequences. At the same time, their friends, both priests, look at and submit their own debates about the nature of love, faith and devotion. <br /> <br /> Resnais always seem to have some tools to make these kinds of narrative works and what is so strange about his films, these devices always work. In this case, Resnais intercuts scenes with visual snow falling on a rousing score, which goes off and bleed in the following frames, which continue the story. Stuck in this elegiac aside periodically, the film develops the rhythm is not too unlike the epic, and I got a strange memories to Dante's Divine Comedy from this, despite the lack of direct reference to the film. Resnais is known as a very poetic film-maker, but it passes only cinepoem structure to something that makes a degree of introspection in the viewer, which is able to bring to the surface of the amazing memories. Memory-story, Resnais creates. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
