This is a great Canadian comedy series. The film is about how a star Jean Paul Tremblay- (Julian) and senior author of the show and his pals Rickie and bubbles to play on top of that is real life satirical look at the trailer parks and residents said trashy hoods, the film will tell you, why Rickie and Julian are starting to make their more advanced forays into the world of crime. Why all the reasons to be a spoiler, so I will not give the real reasons for their more colorful antics. Their friend and often time partner (Bubbles) brilliant character. The entire show is brilliant and there is no film will not affect the way you see the SIT-COM one bit. It's a comedy with a capital C and a brilliant satire on the trailer park life and small time crooks with small ideas of the time, but big time dreams. If you have ever had the opportunity to observe - buy - steal this program to capture him. You'll be glad you did. And my American friend --- It will break you, too. From 9 to 10 Brilliant. TV, as it should be television.
