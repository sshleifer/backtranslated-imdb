The premise of this anime series about the bread, of all things, to be based on the storyline! I really laughed. The main character has a special power of baking, that he was born with, and he goes to school baking. I wish it was available on DVD, and it does not matter if it is subtitled or dubbed - is that good. Even the theme of a song funny. At some point in the song theme, there are African-Japanese with Afro on horseback, wielding French baguette, as if it was a samurai sword. These images will not make sense if you do not see anime. You will laugh until your sides are not affected. This is definitely the most unique anime I've seen so far.
