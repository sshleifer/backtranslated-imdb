Hardcastle and McCormick is a great TV show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable just like the Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, The A-Team, etc. etc. etc. <br /> <br /> This show is just good clean rooms. Relations between Hardcastle and McCormick's pretty funny. They often take jabs at each other several times in the episode, which adds a lot of humor show. It contains several chases cars in almost every episode, but who does not love a good car chase? Especially with the Coyote! <br /> <br /> I just want them to do clean the TV, as it is today, I highly recommend it!
