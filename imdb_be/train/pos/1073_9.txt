It took a few episodes of "get in" Dark Angel, as the story and the series, as we were passing by Soprano, a very different character mentality. But as soon as we got to the essence of the series, we were quickly twisted. It's a shame that the series ended only when he was just starting to past benefits in excellent category: Dark Angelwas much larger than the average TV series. He rages and cliffs, as far as action goes, but the interaction of the characters and the social reaction to the "mutants" remind us of the persistent prejudices that we face (and do) every day. The fact that the story is set in the future, keeps the mood surreal and prevents anti-discrimination message is rubbed in the face (and thus without destroying "fun" for those who do not like to be lectures during entertainment), but each event and / social interaction of people still relevant today. We all do believe that face our own prejudices, but in the end, the question of who you are lie in: you sit and close your mind to it, or you get up and do something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight for survival and justice, this series allows them. For those who've never had to deal with the issue, this series of "sneaking in" of the message disguised as pure action entertainment This is a much more well-done and well written than most series;. I am very disappointed, it was over before it can really kick into high gear.
