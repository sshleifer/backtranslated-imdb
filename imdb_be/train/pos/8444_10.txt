After about 7 years old rocky road on NBC, it was decided to make just one last super installments. The series has been on the bubble a few times due to not having the numbers that qualify it as a block-buster television hours. It has always been important, the hard core of the hard body of followers. <br /> <br /> It was almost as if a series with the full name of "Homicide: Life on the Street" (1993-99) was a kind of "Mr. B-C" series. It was too big to just cancel, but too little to get a case of "mad Ratings delirium" more. <br /> <br /> During the unstable residence on Friday evening, they presented some of the best and boldly artistic hourly Drama. There, I said it is an art, an art !! But please remember, we are referring to art, but not only Phony, Pretentious, Pedantic politically correct ads. <br /> <br /> When, finally, he was sure that this was the end of the line for «Homicide»; This episode was super prepared like this 2:00 made for TV movie. <br /> <br /> Looking at the events and characters of all regular hits of last season, the production team came out and gave us what turned out to be a super send. <br /> <br /> Our story? ?????. As we join the story, we find that the Baltimore Homicide Unit Commander, Lieutenant Al Giardello was "pulled the pin", went to work, that is. But «G» is not exactly ready to pensions, yet. Thus, instead of rocking rods OA, we find that Al running for mayor, "Charm City." <br /> <br /> While in the city, which makes some companies stop and question a former detective lieutenant takes an assassin's bullet. Alive but in a coma, he was taken to the hospital. <br /> <br /> News spreads rapidly and, as it is officially called, we find all Baltimore Detective Unit, we've seen at the show, showing, to offer their services and assistance. There is a large collection of all the former and current sneakers as they step in and follow every lead and possibility of advancing. <br /> <br /> The producer found a way to deal with those who have died before bringing their memory in history. They managed to answer some long-standing questions and even brought some here to unsolved them. The whole history of a series of reels in the most satisfying and original way. But, at least for now, we'll leave it as "classified." <br /> <br /> In summing up everything in a neat, little package, this TV film certainly gets our approval. With regard to the classification of "Murder MOVIE», we should give it a AA +, even. But, regardless of the class here, he was not killed as high as a typical weekly episode.
