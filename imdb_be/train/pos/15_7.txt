I think if a movie is magic, I do not need it to be fluid or seamless. He may miss the introductory information, go too fast in some places, too slow and in others, etc. The magic in this film: the scene in the library. There are many small defects in Stanley & Iris, as they do not detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem to be the most confusing, difficult to correct. Both characters are smart. But Stanley could not see enough to work, because he can not read; he can not read, because he had too many adventures in his childhood. Iris, though well educated, was not enough adventure, and therefore can not figure out how to move past the turn her life has taken. In both their strengths and weaknesses, the characters are complementary. It can be a bit of a stretch to assume that Iris will wind up working every year in the factory, or that Stanley never concealed his ignorance enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while this "secret" explained in the course of history, their deployment seems a little far-fetched. I believe that no one took the time to rethink the script. Nevertheless, it is a good movie ?? Just imagine that De Niro, and the Fonda Plimpton would do on the screen when someone!
