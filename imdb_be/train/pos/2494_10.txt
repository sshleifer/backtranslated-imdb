These are the first two seasons of the comedy series were very strange, and they were not very funny and had a dramatic element, where Bill (the mother) was struggling with all the usual challenges of life but this element was a bit upset and do not mix well with th elements of comedy, which is probably why he was dropped. After that he soon became one of the funniest comedy series of the BBC ever made! The chemistry between Bill and Ben were very funny character, and there was always so much vivid and memorable sketches in each series. Christmas discounts were funny and a real treat for Christmas. <br /> <br /> show came to a halt when the main actor Gary Olsen plays Bill died, which was very sad, because he was a brilliant actor in films such as Up «N» Under very funny man RIP <br /> <br /> This is an underrated show, unfortunately, disappeared from TV screens and not repeat that often - Although he is on UKTV Gold once in a while, but it has to be repeated on the BBC, one or two, to show this brilliant comedy to new audiences
