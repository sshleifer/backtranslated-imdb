If any of the style of the film could be called my "guilty pleasure", it would be a universal type of fantasy. Guilty is the wrong word for it, though, as I am very pleased that a fugitive from time to time. "Stardust" is a good supply of fantasy, like of which you would expect from Neil Gaiman (or adaptation of Gaiman, as it were). This is not a visual dream-tail of the mirror, it's not harassment adult Pan's Labyrinth, and it's not fun classic The Princess Bride, but it contains only what the fantasy lover is familiar with enough to be quite comfortable during the whole show. Fantasy lovers should rejoice - special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that the material is in constant production now <br /> <br /> The history of Stardust includes a young man named Tristan, who, in order to get. love and approval of the most beautiful girls in their little town walls, goes on an adventure to get the fallen star. In order to make things difficult, however, that the fallen star Tristan actually a woman named Yvaine, and he's not the only one looking for her ... some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality of the heart of a star can give, and disagreement one brother over the magic kingdom gives murderous prince in this direction. <br /> <br /> from there all pretty predictable, but it includes some attractive elements of fantasy, some nice comments about the nature of love, and the best part, Robert De Niro as a gay pirate. On that note, Deniro performance is spot -... is not excessive lisp that most actors use to display gay, but surprisingly effective one from someone used to be seen as a rough and tough nature of printed material (thus that goes a joke about his character corresponding own discovery Deniro once again in alternative forms of action). DeNiro was not so unique to their own image, as Brazil, and that's saying something. <br /> <br /> Stardust type of film, it is possible that there will be a baby and fantasy lover shelves for a long time, I can not say that offers something new, but it's not really there. It is in fact the ones most familiar with its paths that enjoy the most. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
