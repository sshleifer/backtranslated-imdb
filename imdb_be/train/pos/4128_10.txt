With all the violence on television and in the local news, it is refreshing to have a show that has no violence or adult language, but still interesting. My kids look forward to playing with us every week. Each of us have a favorite chef and favorite judge. We all like Alton Brown. We like to know the background of the main ingredient, unique vegetables and seasonings. We are playing together at home, to guess who the winner will be. <br /> <br /> This is a great hour of entertainment and information. The best thing in our Hussle, bussle of life, this is the hour the family spends together.
