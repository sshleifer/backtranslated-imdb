Neither total disaster UK criticism is not claimed or wrongly masterpiece of its few fans insist Revolver is at least a great effort to Guy Ritchie add some substance to his swindler capers. But then, there is nothing more exactly tolerated than an ambitious film that eats more than he can chew, especially one using a film frame gangster / cheater. As you might expect from the name of Luc Besson on loans, as a manufacturer, there is a certain element of "Cinema de opinion" of him, set some realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, it looks great, has a number of beautifully edited and conceived action sequences and exudes style, all of which indicate it as a one-time entertainment. But Richie clearly wants to do more than simply recount their own films for a quick buck, and he spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If something is his problem is that he's trying to throw too many influences (some of Machiavelli, shooting Godard, many of the principles of chess), motive and method, clogging up the screen with quotations: the film was originally intended to end three minutes epigrams of photos of corpses crowd of victims, and sometimes it feels as if he had never read a fortune cookie he did not want to include in your movie. Instead of advertising for the Kabbalah, it's really more a mixture of overlapping trade principles, chess and deception confidence that for the most part takes a difficult trick to make Theosophy available, hiding a central (a few metaphysical) CON film. <, Br /> <br /> The last third, where most of the problems can be found Jason Statham takes on an opponent (literally) in a large number of ambitious but not always entirely successful in cutting the frame to oppose external bravado people with their internal fear and anger, but it does have a lot going for it anyway. Do not start a new religion over, but I'm surprised they did not receive US distributor. Maybe they found obviously false tan Ray Liotta just too damn scared?
