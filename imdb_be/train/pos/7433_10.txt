My mom took me to see this movie when it was released for Christmas 1976. I loved it then and I love it now. I know that everyone makes fun hair Barbra in this, but I think it looks and sounds great! ... And I seem to remember a few women who copied this perm look at the time! In addition, the bath scene between Streisand and Kristoferson just so sexy! Music is great, as well. This groovy part 70 Babs at their best!
