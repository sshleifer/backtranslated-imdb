The only reason I did not give this 10 stars was NO format DVD menus, extras, etc. However, if you ever had a dream to do something in your life, this film is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dreams, do not let anyone or anything stop you. This is one of the most life-affirming films I've ever seen. And magic. Wonderful acting, the plot serves the purpose, and the opening sequence is fantastic. This is one of those films that "cult" status used to be about. I recommend this movie to all my friends. Some like it, some can not finish. Every time I think or feel that something is impossible, I think about the role of Alan Arkin in this film. Of course, it is a pity that he would make more films.
