This is one of the first movies I can remember, or maybe the first one. It was a beautiful view of the film, you enter the child sweetly, in a world of violence and drug addiction were we live. A little Babe, casino and Constantine, all well mixed in a box, and we get it. I do not know if it's really designed for children, but I think it was very cool, very funny and interesting. I hate it when a film (spescially cardboard) can have a good end, and it destroys, because each character must have a happy ending, even if it sounds strange (Im not bitter people) .But it was all right, he just goes and sky they allow it this way. <br /> <br /> All of this just criticism, Its a good movie is something new. very touching, and I have to go
