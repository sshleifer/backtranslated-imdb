As it does not become a cult film, I do not know. I think it was unfortunately overlooked as a really brilliant comedy! <br /> <br /> «Runaway Car» is trying to pass himself off as a fast-paced thriller, but considering the quality of the action (good God is bad), the storyline, the practicality of the demonic possession of the car and the child evacuation scene in the account, there is nothing that you can really do but laugh. And laugh you will. Movies are made to entertain us, and the extent to which they do so may be an indication of the value of the film. This film is the pinnacle in entertainment, I laughed from beginning to end. At some point I got short of breath and almost choked, it is really funny at some points. If the child was taken out of the hatch in the glove on the helicopter with the pilot of the robot, which is able to maintain a constant speed, identical car and completely flat plain flight, which meant that the grapple hook will not break the roof of the car to pieces, I was laughing hysterically. But if the child begins to swing in the air, almost hit the bridge and almost caught in a tree, tears streaming down my face. <br /> <br /> In addition, it occurred to me that a black police officer was the guy who played Jesus in «Like A Prayer» Madonna's video. He seems to get everywhere.
