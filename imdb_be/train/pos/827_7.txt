The prospect of a good thing. Since the release of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace", claims and counter-claims only as II and III episode will then take account of the "original» Star Wars films, making them a part in a single unit, rather than segregation of old and new films in some of the trilogy. What new films have made it allows new prospects for placement on old movies. This new view enables us to appreciate more, which is often seen as the weakest of the original trilogy, "Return of the Jedi." Often mocked for it too "cute" factor, ROTJ in a sense, as strong as the original, and only slightly less impressive than nearly perfect "The Empire Strikes Back." Indeed, the "cute» ROTJ element, namely, the Ewoks, remains the weak link in the entire series. Maybe George Lucas placed fluffy dwarf in the film only for the possibility of merchandising? Only he can answer that question. <br /> <br /> This cute factor aside, the film is brilliant full circle and the evolution of the saga. Based on the conclusion of "The Empire Strikes Back," Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his Rebel Alliance friends on Tatooine, his home planet to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a space pirate turned Rebel hero who was captured by Jabba the Hutt arrears. <br /> <br /> Skywalker another man after leaving Tatooine with Ben "Obi Wan Kenobi" (Alec Guinness), to fight the evil empire. Who is swathed in black, the opening of Luke about his origins left him confused and torn. His psychological make-up is not as strong as its appearance would suggest. Despite the fact that he can always seek help my Rebel friend, he suffers one more chance to again confront the evil Darth Vader, despite his unassuredness, whether he will destroy it or in the end turn to the dark side and join Vader on the side of the Emperor. <, Br /> <br /> Early Tatooine scene is impressive, from Jabba's den, to his floating palace and the "almighty Sarlac» - in intenstine, who lives in the sand. CGI improvement Lucas for the film in 1997, actually worsened the overall effect of Sarlac, that makes it look fake and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> In the scene of the Battle of Tatooine is outstanding, and are one of the most memorable of sago. Luke almost single-handedly anihiliates Jabba and his minions, proving his skills as a Jedi is now almost complete. <br /> <br /> If the door is returned to visit his sick Degobah system Yoda one more time, the viewer is let down by a distinct lack of Yoda's screen time. Undoubtably star of "The Empire Strikes Back», Yoda, but it is removed from the history as a progression of the fate of Luke played on the screen. <br /> <br /> ROTJ Luke really film, perhaps even to a greater degree than the original. His journey carries the film as it moves closer to its confrontation with Darth Vader and his destiny. Rebel rest of the characters, of course, working in his shadow. The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo, but it is non-existent, unlike the "Empire." In fact, only develops the character of Leah in ROTJ, Solo character seems to disappear as aspects of his personality become all too familiar in the first two films. <br /> <br /> Their roles are condemned to work together with the rebels to destroy the new Death Star, which is nearing completion. At this time, the emperor himself watching over the final stages of construction. Empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor scheme to bring the currently powerful Skywalker to his side, to work side by side (or replaced?) Darth Vader. all sorts of evil Emperor for this film, less cunning than the Governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) from "Star Wars", more deeply psychologically dark than anything else. Played brilliantly Ian McDiarmid Emperor just one of those characters you love to hate. <br /> <br /> All the other actors are well-entrenched in their roles. Hamill surprises like a wisened Luke, making the progression of his character from a whiny teenager, eager student of the enlightened warrior is one of the few events of the real nature of this series. Ford's role is Waring's fine because all his charm and charisma has been spent in the first two movies - he was a real star of the first film in the end. Leah Fisher longer props, at least unti the end of the film, where she learns about herself that she was never sure ... Add to favorites Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan, Yoda and attractive Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and a series of recalls family over plaster <br /> <br /> Despite the template forest battle film with Ewoks and empire, it ends well, and includes a series of three-way battle :. on Endor, in space and on the Death Star, each with a very impressive special effects. Music, as always, is brilliant and perfectly captures the mood in each case. Just as the "Blue Danube" worked fine for "2001: A Space Odyssey", John Williams' score is as much a part of "Star Wars" folklore as light sabers and Force <br /> <br /> Lucas left. the ending is open to interpretation, which means that you can have more episodes made. In fact, science fiction fans have created their own versions of Episodes VII, VIII and IX in their heads again and again. ROTJ works, if given the opportunity, and fluffy cute animals on the side is a good ending of the series. <br /> <br /> When all six episodes of receipt should be considered together, the saga may be the best ever made. Is this already? Adding Episode I changed the landscape of the series. That is why the "Return of the Jedi" can now be seen in a different light and give a whole new appreciation of almost 20 years after its release.
