James Michener book taking the reader to faraway places with wonderful names were probably at their most popular during the 1940s and 1950s. His Tale of the South Pacific has become a major blockbuster Broadway hit for Rodgers & Hammerstein. South Pacific was directed by Joshua Logan, and it was natural to make a film adaptation of another success Michener, Sayonara. <br /> <br /> It was only ten years before that American films during the Second World War did not display Japanese affectionately. I'm sure it was not easy for the people who fought the war of the Pacific, to change the attitude of the night. This policy does not fraternize with the occupied peoples as a whole essence of this story about interracial romance. <br /> <br /> Sayonara film is relevant today. The military has always interfered in the personal lives of their employees in ways not a civilian employer can not legally leave. In America, while Sayonara was done there still miscegenation laws on the books in many states. Today, gays in the military is a big problem. Someone might one day make Sayonara as a film on the subject. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was on familiar ground. South Pacific was also racism as its component portion. With a sure hand, Logan assembled a large cast and crafts beautiful stories. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith, some of the players Occidental does an excellent job. But the picture is stolen Orientals here. Miko Taka hits the mark beautiful as the love interest of Brando. But the real stars are the two that one and support the players Oscars, red buttons and Miyoshi Umki. <br /> <br /> Buttons your man in the street an ordinary member of the Air Force. He served hot in love with Katz played Miyoshi Umki. They marry and military brutally doing everything possible to break them down. They are suppose to know what is best for the buttons and Umeki. Buttons are a TV comedian and just talent, but he never got the role as well as the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> And Oscar Miyoshi Umki was the first who gave the East. He received a lot of attention, because during the Academy Awards, Miyoshi was starring on Broadway in Flower Drum Song. I had the honor to see him on Broadway, it was the first Broadway show I've ever seen. I still carry the memory of it. <br /> <br /> This Oscar symbolize something else, too. Our war with Japan was really over, and we have seen in Sayonara great nation with a proud tradition and culture. <br /> <br /> Montalbano plays Nakamura Kabuki theater actor. If Sayonara were made today, Logan will never be with him. But Montalban fine. <br /> <br /> Good Photos and wonderful story. This film should be regenerated more frequently it has a great moral.
