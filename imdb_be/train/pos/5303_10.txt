John water ( "Flamingo" ...) "Pecker" is the best film I've seen in a while. This gives the audience a surreal life in Baltimore (I live in neighboring Washington, DC), with Warhol as the use of colors, exaggerated movements and emotions. Pecker becomes more than its city can work, and it is separated from their loved-ones (including sexual Richie) he person who loves the art of management. Painting left refreshing taste in the mouth - kind of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and although the taste was pretty flat and simplistic, it just made it all the more profound and important. This is a celebration of life, liberty, and the right to bear arms ... and everything this country stands. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
