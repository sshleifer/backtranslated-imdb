Great movie deals with the life of the old man as he looks back over the years. Starting around 1910, he reminisces about his boy and adolescence; his family, friends, romances, etc. Very nostalgic piece with a bitter ending .... "everything in life come together as one, and a river runs through it. And this river gives me life. "It is worth a look.
