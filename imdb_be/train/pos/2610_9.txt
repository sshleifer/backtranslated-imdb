In the ten years since Wildside disappears, nothing really come close to the quality of its local production. It includes two series of nice but overpriced Underbelly, which led to the events of life in the modern criminal history as Sydney and Melbourne. Miniseries Blue Murder (who also starred Tony Martin, but, as someone on the other side of the law) may be an exception. <br /> <br /> Wildside now repeated late at night on ABC. After not watched the show for a long time, I am still impressed by his uncompromising storylines and very human characters. Throw wonderful: Tony Martin, as a detective haunted the disappearance of his son, Rachel Blake (who later hooked up with Martin in real life), as a social worker struggling with alcoholism, and Alex Dimitriades as a young police officer, whose vice of gambling, as well the role of support provided by Aaron Pedersen, Jessica Napier, Mary Kustas (yes, the very Effie) young Abbie Cornish. <br /> <br /> ABC and inexplicably released only the first three episodes on DVD for a couple of years ago. The logic of this kind of marketing for me, but I believe it may have something to do with licensing disagreements with the original producers. <br /> <br /> large series which aged remarkably well. Here's hoping DVD ABC department to act. <br /> <br /> (According to the message board moderator ABC, a future DVD release is expected in December 2009)
