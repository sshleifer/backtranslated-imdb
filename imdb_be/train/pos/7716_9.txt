There's a good reason why the Dude warns of Leslie Nielsen and his crew from the ship relief, things he did not dare to dream. <br /> <br /> As Dr. Edward Morbius, Pidgeon last survivor of the expedition, who came to this planet 20 years ago. Since then, he married another member of the expedition, and had a daughter, Anne Francis. They are the only people left on the planet that was once the home world of the ancient civilization known as the Krell. <br /> <br /> records as transcribed Pizhenom show Krell came to a catastrophic finale of unknown origin. The equipment they left behind is still functioning. <br /> <br /> It can function very well as members of the relief party begin to die and in some nefarious way. <br /> <br /> I can see all kinds of speculation about the remake, and this is one film not to change, because it is unusual, as it was in 1956 changed the terms, we would say today the rate of deformation instead of the hyper drive, courtesy of the enduring popularity Star Trek. <br /> <br /> We could not see the men in the relief expedition to the flying saucer, like a spaceship. It may look much more Starship Enterprise or a ship from 2001 A Space Odyssey. It is interesting to see the sci-fi films from different generations and see how this vision of the future of this change. <br /> <br /> The story behind the Forbidden Planet a timeless one, a mortal beings, who are trying to play God. <, Br /> <br /> You can not write on a forbidden planet entirely commenting Robby the robot. This mechanical marvel Pizhen combined with the knowledge he got from the study of Krell was quite a hit back in the day. He got a new life in the sixties with the robot character from Lost In Space. His scene with Earl Holliman, who plays a chef in a spaceship and its execution Count request for some domestic perfume very funny. <br /> <br /> Robby and other special effects were nominated for an Oscar, but lost to the Ten Commandments and the parting of the Red Sea. Forbidden Planet bad luck to run against the founder of Hollywood as DeMille. <br /> <br /> The classics among you recognize the forbidden planet as futuristic alteration Storm, which if you think about what could have been a Shakespearean enterprise in science fiction. <br /> <br /> My favorite among actors is Warren Stevens, who is the victim gives Leslie Nielsen, to find out what he has to do. <br /> <br /> Never miss it every time they passed.
