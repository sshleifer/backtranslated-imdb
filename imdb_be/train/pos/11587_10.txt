I love this movie and would like very much to it ever. It's just a fascinating legend of the eagle, which is a turquoise necklace, I loved it, and wanted to see it again! I do not remember too much about it, but that Indian boy lives in a nice village with his family, and I do not remember what was going on, but he has to go out into the wilderness alone. His sister pack him some food, and he goes. While he was there, some other Indian boys come running and put feathers on it, and it turns into an eagle. Legend has it that if you ever see an eagle wearing a necklace of turquoise, it's a boy. I've always been fascinated by legends, especially the Indian legends, and I would like this to ever be released on DVD, please, let him go, who cares!
