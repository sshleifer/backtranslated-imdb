I love this movie. It is well written and acted and has a good cinema. History blends action, humor, mysticism and tenderness, with big sets and beautiful location shots. Look, buy it, show it to your friends. <br /> <br /> To act well and especially Murphy does an excellent job portraying reluctant / unlikely hero. I enjoyed all the symbols and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> I cared what happened to these people and, while the result was fairly predictable (the good guys win, the hero gets surprisingly attractive girl and holy child saves lives - who do not see that coming) he still made me happy when everything worked fine in the end. Thank God, the dignity of this film never destroyed a lousy sequel. Grab the popcorn, cuddle on the couch and watching is fun, happy and entertaining film.
