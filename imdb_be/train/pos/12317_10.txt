A masterpiece of comedy, horror masterpiece, masterpiece of romance, if there is anything negative to say about Chinese Ghost Story, it may be that the special effects look dated compared to modern technology. The film has a simple premise: poor debt collector must remain in a secluded place, trying to collect the debt. Of course, this happens with ghosts, as well as <br /> <br /> What I did not expect the first time I saw this movie, it is one of the most touching love stories I've ever seen. that is, without loss of slapstick comedy that will have you in stitches. Unlike some movies of Asian cinema, Chinese Ghost Story is not hard to swallow for those who do not understand Chinese culture. In fact, he plays forever, cultureless paranormal themes and romance. <br /> <br /> Think Evil Dead 2, if they threw a beautiful love story in the mix. This film is really, despite the fact overlooked by many. It is absolutely among the best I have ever seen. This ability to combine the best aspects of several genres, as well as cross cultural boundaries to reach out to humanity in the world, is not nothing but a fantasy. It is strongly recommended, 10/10.
