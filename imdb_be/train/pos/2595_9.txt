Brilliant adaptation largely internal monologues of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Bloom Molly Joseph Strick in restoring endearing portrait of Dublin June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday - the day that will be celebrated - the ambiguity is intended! Bravo director Strick, screenwriter Haines, as well as casting director and cinematographer in the creation of this masterpiece. Günter Grass novel, The Tin Drum removed Schlöndorff (1979) is another fine adaptation of interior monologue, which I have to compare favorably with the film in Strichen. <br /> <br /> While Dublin attractions clearly recognized in the original novel and the film, there are also well-known characters, albeit with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan, which lives DEDAL proves to be visible then the surgeon Dublin. <br /> <br /> This film is for all of its advantages become even richer with additional screenings. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
