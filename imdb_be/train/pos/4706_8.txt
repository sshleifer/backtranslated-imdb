Of course, this may not be a classic, but this one is full of classic lines. One of the few films, my friends and I quote all the time, and it is fifteen years later (Maybe it was on Cinemax one too many times!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in the movie - he can not seem to figure out how play it--, but he is surrounded by a myriad of actors who know how to play this travesty. Looking at the film, to cheer up? This is it, but rent it out with your friends - it'll make it even better.
