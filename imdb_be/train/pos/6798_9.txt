(No spoilers, just plot details) I can not understand this hatred of this episode. You want to watch a bad episode of Smallville? Hours Subterranean - now there's a bag of shit. Meanwhile Welling gives a good idea (I do not say that very often), and Michael Rosenbaum great, but it most of the time. Scenario alternate universe seems frighteningly realistic. The Martian who had previously appeared in the «Static», comes back and tells Clark that the doctor, who is the head of crazy where they are carried out is actually a phantom of the phantom zone, and if Clark wants to return to his universe, he to kill him. Overall a great episode, with good acting and decent pace.
