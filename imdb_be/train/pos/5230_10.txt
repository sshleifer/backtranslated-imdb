In fact, I liked this movie very, very much. Not because of the story, so the interior action, jokes, no. I liked it because it 's one of the worst films ever made. It`s so lame, so bad that it becomes very funny. Some jokes are really cool, but everything else makes me pray for unemployment for the screenwriter. "Men in White" is so dull and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn the TV off or roll on the floor laughing (beer helps a lot :). I chose the second option.
