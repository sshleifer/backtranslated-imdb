I appreciated the photos, textures, colors and often, unlike comments, lighting. That is not enough for me to find a coherent storyline.I is often inconsistent, poorly edited and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, one at IMDb shows 12 .. Maybe cuts and subtitles have not helped. I welcome any films which escape from the Hollywood mold, but it left me disappointed. Miss Gillain was glowing and performances have been all right, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If someone would like to see another movie, which has some similarities with that, try Â«Hideous Kinky'with Kate Winslet.
