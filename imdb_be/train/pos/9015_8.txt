In the beginning, it is one of England, so of course I had a 98% probability that it will be reasonable and a very good movie. I've never heard of this movie before. From the moment I saw Bonham Carter, I said to myself: Oh! Here comes the female version of my left leg. I was right, but I was wrong. Wrong, because the two films are very differentiation. My left leg was so John Ford film, and this one is so Chaplin film (not because it's funny, but Chaplin in this great sense of melodrama, which brings tears to the eyes.) I was right, because in 1990 Daniel Lewis beautiful day- to turn a little ugly, playing a lame man, and he did it with a great sense of reality. It is very beautiful Bonham Carter did the same, but with a very feminine emotions. The story is well written, and it is very clever. For me, Miss Bonham Carter gives one of the greatest women of the 1990s, with Emily Lloyd in Breaking the Waves. Gee! And look at her! She had the most beautiful eyes film with Zhobina Rolston, Louise Brooks, Michelle Morgan and Ava Gardner! It is also true talent, as seen in many other films. See this, you will not regret it! It is very delicate work of Bran, too!
