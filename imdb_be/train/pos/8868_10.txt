I have to say that higher education is one of the best 3 movies I have ever watched. He has a brilliant cast, and just a brilliant director. Singleton shows how the university life can be. There are 3 storylines, skinheads, African-Americans, and homosexuals. I was intrigued by all the stories, but the one that got me most of all, a story about Kristen, fighting her feelings for another girl. The end was great. After watching the film 25 times, plus, I'm still crying. I would give this film 11, but I have to settlefor 10/10.
