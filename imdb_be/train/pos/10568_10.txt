I loved this film, seen in the evening on the big screen in a movie theater! The audience laughed loudly at some very interesting things, and fast pace was the most enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I like the singer and musical director, the question is one section Roby Keeler vocals in "waterfall. "The key is modulated, and she suddenly sings far below, in a very soft voice, which bore no resemblance to the more tin is higher chirping voice she used in all her other singing. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know if it has added another singer? it sounds to me. I wanted to know. <br /> <br /> Thank you so much.
