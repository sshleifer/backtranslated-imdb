Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the best, smooth animation and masterfully written dialogue of any Disney film I've seen. And I was convinced that in the first 15 minutes. I especially love the voice work on the novel Don Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris, Joshua Strongbear Sweet. It is a pity that the whole film seems to move about twice the pace that it would be appropriate - at least in the first act. One of the important aspects of any Disney film is a treat antagonist - that Atlantis does not. He averaged at best. In the middle of the film there is an ordinary turn. That's all. This is a great film nonetheless. Everyone should check it out.
