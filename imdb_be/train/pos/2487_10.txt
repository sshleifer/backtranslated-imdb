I must say that, looking at the Hamlet from the point of view of the student's version of Hamlet Brannagh is by far the best. His dedication to remain faithful to the original text to be welcomed. It helps to play come to life on the screen, and makes it easier for people involved in the text, seeing as we did, studying it, to track and analyze the text. <br /> <br /> One of the things that I have heard many times criticized the casting is the major Hollywood name game. I believe that it helps the audience to recognize the signs easier, in contrast to the fact that all the actors look and sound the same, that aid in the bustle usually associated with Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> In addition, his memories help explain the many ambiguities in the text. Such as how the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia actually went and why Fortinbras just was in the castle at the end. In general, not only this version contains some brilliant performances by actors and familiar and not familiar with Shakespeare. It is presented in such a way that one does not need to be a Ph.D in English literature, to understand and enjoy it.
