My first child was born in the year of this program came out, and I played on the album for the boys every Christmas thereafter. If the disc came out, I bought a dozen copies and still give them to friends and family as they start a family ... it always gets their favorite Christmas album. I recently found some DVD-ROM drive (made on DVD-R from the videotapes, I guess) for sale on eBay. The one I bought was a great specimen, and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years. There are a few songs on the show, which was not on the album, and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show. But as the CD and DVD will be in our library as the best Christmas fun ever.
