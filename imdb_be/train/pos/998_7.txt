This is a really interesting film. This action film with comedy mixed. Fox teams up with comedian Epps in the film to give it a comedic spin. It will keep you wondering what happened to the Fox series. It was a good shot film, the director has used the right colors in the film (dark blue) to give it the right kind of feel. Kimberly Elise also starred in this film, and it's always nice to see it on the big screen. It also plays a role. Even Jamie Kennedy in the film. It is worth seeing it you did not see it. It is definitely worth it if you are a fan of Jamie Foxx. She deserves more credit than it actually is given.
