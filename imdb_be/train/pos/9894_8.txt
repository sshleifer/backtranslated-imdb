«Slaughter High» is absolutely ridiculous slasher film about high school botany Marty, who gets to pick up all the time, for some pranksters.The prank goes wrong and he ends up getting angry burned.Five years later, his executioners all visit reunion- only ten of them, of course, and low and behold Marty killing them one after another.British actress Caroline Munro ( "Maniac") leads the cast as the heroine (who dies anyway!). Act very badly, there is also no suspense in all.Plenty grotesque death scenes to meet the Gore-freak: Man blows up the stomach, another woman victim literally gets an acid bath, couple sex in bed to get the electric chair, boy crushed by a tractor, a girl drowned and the doctor gets hyperdermic needle in eye.The killer wears a mask decent and quite creepy clown and the setting (a beautiful old English castle) really nice.However dream final pathetic.All quite often it is true that the «Slaughter High» piece of junk, but I polzovat etsya it.Only for lovers of really bad chopper clicks.
