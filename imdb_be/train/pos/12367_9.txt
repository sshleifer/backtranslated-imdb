Well, after a long wait after watching a few clips on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie moments I have been waiting to see this movie. The plot was simple, beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves into an apartment building, which is the gateway to hell. Caretaker down right awful film, even if it is a little slow. It is a mixture of Omen and Rosemary's Baby. It works perfectly, and there are some really disturbing bits, such as uncomfortable orgy scene with a dead father and a plump woman in the middle of an orgy of eating cake and laughing ending an amazing mixture of deformed people and cannibals. It is very strange mannerisms, but in the end, I really feel a great movie! One of my favorites from the 70s, even if there is nothing very original. It's stupid and very terrible! Probably one of my favorites. 9/10
