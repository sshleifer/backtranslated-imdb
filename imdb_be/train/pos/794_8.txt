I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this film. I thought it was interesting, sexy, painful, and warm. performance Andie MacDowell was nuanced and vulnerable. At this time, the film's director McDowell sun make its beauty is another character in the film. The romance between Kate and her boyfriend, it's nice to look at, and it plays very well. Her relationships with her friends, like a thorn, and the balm of her life. Imelda Stalinson, who was the MVP in many British films, does a great job of that. There is a certain tragedy in this, but I think the movie will be saved at the end of a brilliant actor, clear direction and witty film quality writing.The great and the music is good, too, although there is no soundtrack.
