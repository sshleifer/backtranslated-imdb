This film is a great war film. This may not be a great Hollywood movie, but it does not matter. Hollywood has a loss of accuracy reputation for good entertainment, but it is not so with this film. Other reviewers have found this film to be too slow for their taste, but ?? as a retired soldier ?? I appreciate the pace of the film crew deliberately took to tell your story as fully as possible given for two hours and nine minutes, set aside. The story itself has been told and retold several times, but it remains for the professional soldier ?? and African-American, what ?? report the stories presented the film crew, and it is the US Navy in the world. History Brashear works to become a Navy Diver, and his life as a Navy Diver for its termination, it is not the only history that is represented. There I was, too, the story of how Master Chief Petty Officer Sunday challenged the illegal order of his commander that the sergeant second class Brashear will not be accepted in its immersion test no matter how well he did, and paid for the loss of one strip and re-tasking . He also told a true story as Brashear found a third bomb hydrogen lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another sailor, who was in the line snapped running line, which would have been snapped it in two, if Brashear not pushed him aside and took the shot himself. It was a complicated story that is worth to say, and I admit that in two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the whole story, and I can say from distant scenes to DVD, the crew tried to tell the story as much as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a big story in such a comprehensive manner, and to see the tradition and honor of the Navy remained in a natural and complete way.
