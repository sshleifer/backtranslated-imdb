A ship may be flooded, but the film is not !!! Director James Cameron with "Terminator" has done it again with this amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes scene "dining table", in which the family and friends of Rose to meet Jack after he rescues her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have, when you meet «THE ONE» ... I hope that I have something to look at when I'm in a room with my future husband. <br /> <br /> Jack and Rose have a compound that is «MOVIE STUFF», but it is a good movie material. We have a greedy mother and all her elite sticking assistant living for their husband's wealth. Rose almost committed suicide, but Gilbert Grape star saves her. I really enjoyed hanging out on the boat scene. It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The film is long, but it's fantastic !!! Good story, good flow, good actors !!! Go it twice if you want, it should be !!!
