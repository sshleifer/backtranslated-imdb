I feel very sorry for the people who go to the movies with a notebook and pencil to record the shortcomings and keep notes about how bad film. I feel equally contempt for people who go to the cinema and not to suspend reality and / or afford to enjoy the 90-minute Business cards from his boring or busy life! Grab people. ECGTB very entertaining movie. If you take the movies seriously, this is not for you. If you wait for the movie to be like a book, in any case, this is not for you. But if you enjoy the full fun of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, or "what the hell, I watch" Moulin Rouge. Or gross out comedy "Milk" Then let yourself go to the Cowgirls. He has some really funny parts. Hilarious actually. He also has some really good music, kudos to kd.lang. I also mentioned that there are 90 minutes Uma Thurman ..... need I say more?
