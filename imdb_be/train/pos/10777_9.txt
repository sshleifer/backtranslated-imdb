Radiofreccia the film is about all of us, our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our passions, our fears. This brilliant film, where a group of friends as we all have life through the difficulty of growing up in a small town in one of the most important decades of the last century. The film does not take a happy or sad approach to things, he just tells us the story, one that we could all have gone through. One happiness and excitement, sadness and grief. The strength of the story lies in the fact that we grow to love the characters, this is one of those movies that you watch over and over again, feeling closer to a place in the Emilia-Romagna region, where it takes place. Hoping one day to be able to finally walk the streets near FRECCIA and his friends, listen to music that changed the world through the crackle of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International, playing their dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia make you laugh, it will make you cry from time to time, it will shock you and comfort you, it will give you, and take from you. Personally, I believe that it has played an important role in my life, and my friends, and I invite you all to look, and let it become part of you.
