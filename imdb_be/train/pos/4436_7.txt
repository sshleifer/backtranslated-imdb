Tattooed man was one of the few B-movies that BBC2 screening on Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also: They live at night and on Brighton Strangler. <br /> <br /> In this, a man walking his dog in Central Park comes across an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside. She was wounded and the police then try to identify it only with a tattoo as a primary key. Once identified, the murderer is found and shot dead in a shootout at the end. <br /> <br /> Most of the film was shot on location in and around New York, so we get to see some areas of the city, we do not normally see, especially crannies. <br /> <br /> largely unknown in the cast, with John Miles receive top billing. <br /> <br /> Tattooed Stranger should be sought. . Excellent, but rather obscure <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
