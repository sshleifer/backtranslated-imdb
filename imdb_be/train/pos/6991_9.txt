This is a great movie. Throw the perfect combination of characters and the story well. The film is mostly about the good doctor performed the dead body stolen brides and take them to his home. After the body in his house, he takes things (I do not want to use a generic term, but I forgot what it was he deleted) and puts it in his wife to keep his youth. Subsequently, the reporter, Patricia Hunter, investigates the situation and begins to find answers to why the bride die. She takes a trip to the doctors house and interesting things start to happen. Definitely watch this oldie but goodie if you can.
