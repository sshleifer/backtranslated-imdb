This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. My parents come from rural India and to some extent I saw village life. People are really poor and have the financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The film simply reflects the same way. Full credit director and actor. They did an excellent job. I just wonder how can films like Lagaan and Paheli can go to Oscar and Doghi. I do not understand the criteria by which selected films. There is money that makes a difference or have some big names in the film makes a difference. <br /> <br /> Hope to see more films like this in the future.
