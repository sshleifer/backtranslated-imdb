Nicely done. A lot of angst. Friendship can not stand everything, but in the end that's all that matters, whether a group of friends to study the case. I watched it over and over again. Music is also strange. If Kei loses a friend he is, he refuses, until he meets Shaw, an orphan who is not repelled by his true nature. In lawless streets Mallepa they are fighting for a place among the Asian melting pot of races and know that sometimes being at the top may cost you more than you will ever be willing to pay. Surprise ending that captures as much as the entire movie making. I could not get enough. Gackt and Hyde do an excellent job of acting, proving that they are more than pretty boys who sing.
