MAJOR SPOILERS !! This is for those who have seen the movie !! <br /> <br /> Commenters touched on the basic theme of "honor" in the film, and too many comparisons with the "Braveheart". I'll show you something about this movie that I have not seen other comments affect: <br /> <br /> This film is clearly a different view on abortion. The first sign of getting pregnant there (Roth) girlfriend of the villain, and when he offers cold abortion, she says, it's too late for that. Shame her situation ( "I have to bitch bastard in.") Causes her to commit suicide in a much later stage. The second character, to find yourself pregnant, Mary, the wife of Rob, after the rape, the character's mouth (and at least one sex scene with her husband, Rob). At the end of the film, when Rob left for the final confrontation with Roth, Mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of dubious origin, a tone implying abortion. Rob responds to the noble tone, "this is not the fault of the child", and then stated that he thought that the name must be a girl or a boy. I think this is about "life" attitude on the part of the hero to be very Sun Hollywood. Rob comes out of the darkness to the bright house from the outside, to make this comment -. It is no accident symbols <br /> <br /> Another related topic is the character Rota freak, someone apparently did not know who his father and has a few good words for his mother, although he has a picture of her in case hung from his neck. Is it a coincidence that Roth (deprived of family stability) is the walking definition of a psychopath, while Rob strong husband / father figure, and, of course, the hero. In the final swords between Rob and the villain (Roth), the former last slices deep into the chest - on the left side of his chest, over his heart. His employer and the pseudo-father (John Hurt character) holding a photograph of his mother in his hand and looks at him, before snatching it from the neck of a dead Roth. <br /> <br /> In addition, I find it interesting trend has been the scene of rape, which was not very graphic, but neither was it from the camera and understood. I found it strange, that a few actually drawing, Mary clearly show the characteristics of someone who passed through the ordeal, and the subsequent post-traumatic stress (as we call it now). . The bottom line is that rape was not a sensation, nor simply meant that I find interesting middle way for Hollywood to take <br /> <br /> In the final fight scene, I have to correct earlier commentator: Roth weapon chosen was rapier (or, perhaps, a short sword), weapon Rob chose was Claymore. Someone really does his homework on the whole scene. to the top of the mouth in such a situation, but, of course, it is precisely Scottish Claymore-arms. What's even more amazing to me (as a fencer and someone who has read a little on the subject) that the last sword fight is one of the most compelling of any film ever made: the actors seem to be really trying to kill each other - - not the usual skew to opponents blade we see in most movie fights (including the opening film of combat). Even more true story, Roth saw a few times, using a rapier as a thrusting weapon, which is the aim of the design! (Rapier were edged, but primarily by pushing the edges of the arms, which are used mainly to counter opponents traction.) Rob Claymore uses a wide slashes, as is the design intent. The fight is going down, as I would expect it to - Roth effectively wins. Although Rob wins the day, seizing weapons (more symbolism) mouth and hit him dead with a powerful chop cut. <br /> <br /> Folks, it's rare to see such a level of historical accuracy in movies swords. <, Br /> <br /> I will also note that, for some reason, I remember in 1995 (the year) is clearly just distrust the US government. Hollywood was clearly set in that, with the release as "Rob Roy" and "Braveheart", and I think that the anti-government tendency to why the two films are produced as a comparison. <br /> <br /> I think that different points of view, this film gives a refreshing, which is a movie lovers who are tired of the same old and not so hidden messages from Hollywood.
