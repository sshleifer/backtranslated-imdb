I would say that this time, the film was strange ... and so, if you have no desire to become a Christian, why watch it. I saw this film after I was saved and found it very moving. Now I see that they have taken these movies to the next level and created the Left Behind series ... they run a close comparison and are certainly more modern, to get to the people. I think that in order to really judge this movie, you should see it ,,, there are 3 or 4 of them in a series, if I'm not mistaken ... not use the comments to judge, to see the movie for yourself! ! God bless you, if that's why you see them.
