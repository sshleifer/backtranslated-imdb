Mmm, yes, this episode is very underrated. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there is a lot wrong with the letter i act on the part. I think a good win over the bad. <br /> <br /> I love origami and a large part of the "turn" at the end. I love the scene when Tony confronts Michelle. It's actually one of my favorite scenes of Season 1. <br /> <br /> For some reason, people have always hated Reincarnation episodes, but I have always loved them. They are not better, in terms of writing. but the theme is really interesting to me, <br /> <br /> I'm going to give it three stars, but if the record was a little more consistent, I would give it a four.
