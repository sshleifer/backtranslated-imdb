Let me bad out of the way first, James Hanlon absolutely horrible trying to act in his description of what happens to the recruit training, and events of the day. In fact, it is a stunning deal with other firefighters, Sun acting aspirations, which are natural in their delivery. <br /> <br /> It is said that this is a wonderful film that is impossible to watch without tears in his eyes. I'm an English guy from London, but I love New York and visited many many times before and after the 11th of September. This is a second home for me, and I can not help but feel devastated about the loss of life but the destruction of part of this wonderful city. This is the real deal, with the use of fire to everything collapses around them. I'm so glad that the staff is there to show people how it was that day. It's a shame that they did not use footage of people jumping from buildings, because the friends who were there to tell me that this is such a big part of their memory, it should be included to show future generations how terrible it really was. <br /> <br /> conspiracy can go to hell, by the way.
