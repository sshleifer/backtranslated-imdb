I am a fan of Hal Hartley films, especially in 1997 in "Henry Fool." «Fay Grim» is a continuation of the film, and has a similar style and sense of humor. The plot, however, is quite different. Fay Grim (brilliantly played the iconic Parker Posey) is trying to find her missing husband's notebooks, and finds himself among the conspiracy and espionage. The supporting cast (most of the people from the first film, as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows, and so welcomed the return of the '90s indie-darling Elina Lowensohn) is excellent, and the film has a lot of surprises. Requirements director is part of the "Star Wars" -like trilogy, which acts as the "Empire Strikes Back" from the series if it's true, I can not wait to see the third installment! I just hope I do not have to wait another 10 years for it.
