I saw this film when I was almost just a child, and, of course, was moved to tears by the story of the fox family. Fantastic landscape in HOKKAIDO, great story, and last not least the excellent soundtrack give a rare intimacy with the main characters. I'm still looking for some copies of the magnificent soundtrack. it would be beneficial for the German audience know that DEFA-dubbing the only one worth listening to. I taped both (DEFA and BR), but I still see only the first.
