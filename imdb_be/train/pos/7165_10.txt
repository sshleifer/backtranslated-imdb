I wrote a long time ago, but avoided to see this today. I got so sick things look exhausted! I'm so glad that I have seen, and that I could erase my memory and I look again for the first time. This movie is so cool! It reminded me a lot of Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistlestop Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story goes back in time and at the end of the film we see that these compounds. Some people say that this is a film children. I disagree - it can be done by Disney characters and many of the children, but I'm 23 and I loved it! There were moments when my spine tingle. History unlike any other movie these days, full of adventure. I just ordered the book from Amazon, I can not wait!
