The reason why I say this because I wrote the script and knew very little about it is, until asked to see the film. I wrote this for some manufacturers who sell it without telling me. As Alan Dobie was my friend, I hear about it. I only wrote the first draft, so I was understandably excited when I heard that he was on the field. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, if he could have to do another project. I also asked if I could I see your original script, because I lost it. I was told too late. So I did the only thing I could do in the circumstances and took my name. I had no idea what they might do to my script. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so impressed that I quickly asked what my name put back. It is beautifully done piece, with a hastily written the first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; Maybe if I was not so good. I would like to see his original script again when somebody knows where he is? I would also like to see the film again, I've only seen him once at a small theater show in Soho.
