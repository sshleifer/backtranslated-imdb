"The album of songs so old, everyone thinks that they are new." This film is a subtle combination of pace and mood, which set several films except opening moments. And why not? Rising talent by Dame Judith Dench as a widow, who plays saxaphone with street musicians to help him get the lyrics straight to Olympia Dukakis as merry widow, who lives in a Scottish castle on child support from his many marriages, Ian Holm as a drummer who loved all members of the second world war, all the girl (more or less) of a swing band. But wait, there's more. Add Leslie Caron on bass guitar, and incomparable Clio Laine on lead vocals, finally, Blonde Bombshells and the hottest group in England with the Beatles. Well, okay, not really, but this film is the winner. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) spends the entire film trying to unite the Blonde Bombshells granddaughter play at school dances. And, before you roll your eyes, imagine how difficult and courageous would be a bunch sexegenarian women enter the scene before generating Britney Spears after the act, entitled «Open Wound». <br /> <br /> In an age when a career as an actress by the time they are 30, most of the bands second album is a greatest hits album, and the music is more than a month ago it has virtually no chance of rotation, which is great, to see real talent, real music and a really good movie come from, where else, the BBC. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, and I know what I'm going to watch it many times and enjoy it more each time.
