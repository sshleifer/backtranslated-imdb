I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was the dam's funny! When I first time I saw it playing on ETV (Estonian Television) and I started to like it. It is a pity that this show at a bad time for me. Hyde as a tough guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And he comes to the foolish idea. He got those glasses that h brown. I like it. And there Thess. Group pervert. We all know what he is doing, unless it ..... He wants to fuck bad. He even had it with your boss in one episode.His from India. And Michael, The stupid guy across the group, probably stupid in the city and its police! He is so stupid that I can remember, as follows: Hyde says: And the cops called? - No, Michael comes up and says. Does anyone know how to disable the siren? It is a city playboy. Then comes Jackie, who is the ex-girlfriend of Michael, and then she Guides girlfriend. Then the son of Eric Who is grumpy war veteran and the son of Kitty housewife. His one big pussy. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend with whom they plan for it marriage. Donna is one hot girl. Hmm, what have I forgotten? ah Hyde lived in a basement.
