I watched, fascinated and hypnotized, vocal and physical action. The role each character plays were made of excellence.The text, word, every gesture, sunrise, said it all.The film spoke to me. He enlightened me to a different perception of the human who believes in humanity. Who believe in peace and cautious behavior. I was also held in believed to the victims and human dignity drawing. Power without affection, is insane and senseless. Wanting power prices humanity, so incredible. This film made me so afraid of people who are no longer in this world. And, sadly, I think about them. I like this movie for conversations and facial expressions at all. Let this film be blessed.
