I will never forget when I saw the name in the video store way back when. I've always been a big fan of Weird Al, and when I saw this video I shot and watched it. I was too young to appreciate all the subtle humor and satire Ella at the time, but I remember it much later, when I was old enough to understand what I was watching. If you are a «Al» fan, especially of his early work, you will fully enjoy this film. This is done in-esque MTV style «Rockumentary» and tells the true (but sometimes exaggerated) story about how Al should be where it was in 1985. You will love it, if you want his brand of humor and, more importantly his music.
