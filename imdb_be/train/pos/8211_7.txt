Never seen the original Dirty Harry, I judged this film on a clean sheet. And I have to say I really enjoyed it. Of course, some of the actions of Sondre Locke made me a little squeemish - but hey, it was the '80s. But even if you can not pass it (and I almost could not) or a revenge killing (which seemed to be a little exaggerated ..; P), it is worth only for Dirty Harry. Or, at least, bull dog affectionately Names «Meathead»: P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
