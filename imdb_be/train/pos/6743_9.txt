Dana Andrews is one of those actors that I've probably seen in dozens of films, but who never really registered to me. Often stolid, silent, playing the same kinds of roles and looks somewhat like the same underestimated Glenn Ford, he's an actor that takes some effort to accurately estimate; but once you're in the right movie .... <br /> <br /> And that's it. sullen look Preminzher at the underbelly of New York as a dirty and shabby just as every 50s noir, and Andrews is in his element as too tough cop Mark Dixon, who simply does not know how to play this game to get ahead: it He hates criminals too much to always play by the rules. Earlier in the film, he accidentally kills a witness to the murder involved in illegal crap game created by a gangster who hates Dixon for personal reasons, and he spends the rest of the movie trying to conceal their involvement in and lead a gangster in his kind of "justice." Along the way he gets involved with his ex-wife of a man he killed (Gene Tierney), as well as to try to get her father off the hook for murder. <br /> <br /> It's great LaShellom photographed with a hard and sparkling dialogue Ben Hecht and really powerful finale with elements of tragedy and grace in just a minute or two of time, this is another noir for ages and maybe my favorite movie Preminzher so far - it is every bit as good as the more-heralded Laura.
