I LOVE Doodlebops. My son watched them for a year. We went to the Doodlebops concert last year, as well as a concert yesterday (Connecticut). He loves them. In doodlebops not teach the alphabet or numbers, but who cares? You serious? TV does not assume to teach your children about numbers or the alphabet. parents should. Get over it. In fact Doodlebops can sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice, and in a concert, you can say, all three of them have a good singing voice and not lip singing. Imagine, they dance, jump and still sing. they have the talent, the children love them, I even enjoy watching the show. This show is by far the best show on TV for children. And the rock band for children. How strange is that? Why do people say Chad (Rooney) gay? where did you hear that from? Whether it is or not, it is awesome! Leave him alone. It's not like he or someone promoting homosexuality to our children!
