I found «Still Crazy», to be surprisingly interesting, and not just for those of us who lived through the era raucous late '60s, early' 70s rock. May 15-year-old daughter looks to me every time I pull the DVD (do not worry, it's just three times), and she loves it too. <br /> <br /> This is a really loving, bitter and funny nods at a time and each actor hits his / her account with perfection. It was my first acquaintance with Bill Nighy and I am glad that it is somewhat reminiscent of a turn in "Love Actually" brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was incredible, like Brian, resulting in real life to what could have been a caricature shaky stereotype drug is damaged. It was interesting to see that Robinson has made a name for himself as a writer. <br /> <br /> I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the film I came across Billy Connolly at the local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him that it was one of my five favorite films of all time. He invited me to sit in the food court with him, and we talked about this movie for some time. We even talked about the idea of ​​a US-centric remake before dismissing it wisely. Why mess with the original? <br /> <br /> My only problem with the «Still Crazy» is the fact that he was not very popular in theaters, and too many people have missed a wonderful experience.
