In 1958 Clarksberg was known radars city. A lot of revenue was generated by the department of catching speeders sheriff. Those who tried to outrun the sheriff? Well, the sheriff gave the opportunity to push them from Clarksberg Curve with its Plymouth cruiser. For example, early in the film, a few soldiers who are on vacation, trying to return to the base at the time pushed away to their death, if I remember correctly. Then one day, the stranger went to the city. Perhaps the coolest Hot Rodder in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is the name of the car, both in the McCord gaskets. The possible final hot rod. Black burned 34 Ford coupe. The color of death, evil and hell. He gets picked up for exceeding the sheriff rate on target. It checks the land relief. He is the brother of one of the victims of the Sheriff. He knows how his brother died. Government Clarksberg all in favor of Sheriff. There's only one way to get justice served in the murder of his brother and fix things so "it does not ever happen again to anyone": to recreate the chase and settle the contest style Hot Rodder to death. He goes to the curve and practice. Sheriff knows McCord knows. The race begins ... This is a film that will be remembered for all those who have ever tried to master the maneuvers on a certain stretch of road.
