Going to see this movie, I was a bit skeptical because of fantasy films is not always May a cup of tea. Especially romantic imagination. <br /> <br /> Little did I know that I was in for the ride of cinematic magic. Everything in the film from the story to the dialogue with the effect is very close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes shines like a star, it is in this film. From start to finish you are providing more and more in love with this character. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer as the evil witch threatening bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is an attractive character, which gives the viewer the greatest bit of the comic, as the film is gaining impetus to a climax. <br /> <br /> as a whole, it was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a fan of the movie. If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable film, which will be fun for children and adults, Stardust is a way.
