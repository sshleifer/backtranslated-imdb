I have seen a series of Thin Man - Powell and Loy, of course, great, but there is something very sweet about Arthur Powell and chemistry in this film. Jean Arthur shines when she looked at Powell. There is an unmistakable undercurrent hums between them. This movie may not have the wit Series Thin Man, but it certainly does in ecstasy for him. As I watched, I was sure that Powell kept off-screen affair with Arthur. My friends thought the same thing. This is one film where I would like to step back in time (and all the guests stopped the mouths of Powell!) There seems to be no end to it attractive playful grins! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest to "perfect man." Well, it sounds too rich, but I can not help it.
