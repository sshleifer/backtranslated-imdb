In many of his films (Citizen Kane, particular report, Touching Evil) Orson Welles gave him the role of rich men. In "The Lady from Shanghai" is the only time I can see how he holds the role of victim. The role of the perpetrator, he gave to Rita Hayworth, I believe that it's because he was in love with her. Thus, it is an entertaining film. But I think the story is also excellent. Direction is a genius, as usual, Wells: two scenes particularly brilliant one in the tank and the end mirrors. This film is brilliant. (10/10)
