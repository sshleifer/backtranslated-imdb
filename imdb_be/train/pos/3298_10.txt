This is definitely one of the best films I've ever seen-- has everything-- really touching script, great actors, who do a wonderful subtlety of art to see, in fact, an elegant affair (it's a shame that this kind of romance just does not seem to exist anymore), great songs and lyrics (especially the final song), the artistic value and the costumes and sets that make you want to live in them. Ending only disappointment is that I was expecting an exciting film to have a brilliant end--, but it was even more surprising that the vast majority of movies there. Definitely check this out-- the film over and over again. There are a lot of details you miss the first time that deserves a second look.
