This movie was recommended to me by a friend. I have never seen an ad or trailer, so I do not know, Clooney was in it and not bothered by the fact that his role was so small. I thought all the cast was the best, and found the film quite enjoyable in the end. The first scene, with a small crew of thugs standing on the roadside, looking beaten and exhausted, caught my attention immediately. It was a way to tell you, "Do not go, it will not be boring", and it really was not. It turned out to be interesting, light-hearted comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in the chair until the end, but if the end came, I felt a little cheated .... just a little bit. Events continued to build so you would expect them to continue the construction, but at the point that I can not determine a kind of levels, causing a slight disappointment ending. I think I was expecting more explosions menopause, but it was kind of low-key. If you watch a movie with this in mind, and you can live without high doses of George Clooney, you should find this film very interesting and well worth watching. Now I would like to see the original source (Big deal on Madonna Street), but it is probably a rare find in the United States.
