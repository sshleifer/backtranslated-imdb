History tramp, his sheep ranch boss and the boss's daughter Sun for everyone, but it is still very intriguing. It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand, among the decorations, we have come to know so well the other films from the region. <br /> <br /> This film was the first time I've ever seen other than Mary Regan, and I was a fan of it so far. The cast also includes Bruno Lawrence, who is probably best remembered American audiences from the movie Â«Smash Palace." Terence Cooper takes a turn as a ranch owner who pays too much of the wrong kind of attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /> <br /> Very made a memorable speech by crushing all of his conclusions. I first saw this film in a very edited form on the late night TV here in America, but believe me, that version will be missed without cuts.
