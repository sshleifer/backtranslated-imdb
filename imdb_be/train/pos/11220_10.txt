The goal for the Top! Gunbuster is one of those anime that classic written all over it. I thoroughly enjoyed the series, and to this day it remains my favorite anime. And although it was not the first animated product GAINAX, it was their first OVA series. <br /> <br /> In general, I started out as a parody of the 1970 sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama towards the end of the 2nd series, such as Noricum forced survive the death of his father, who was killed in the first meeting of humanity with racing insect humanity is at war with. It is because of his father's death that Norik wants to become a combat pilot. But her lack of confidence is get in the way at times, and it varies. Her friend, Kazuo Aman, even Norik question selects, as a pilot. However, Norik coach, Koichiro of Ota, believe in it. And he made it his personal mission to see that it is a success to become a pilot because he had survived the battle in which his father was killed by Norik. <br /> <br /> Other characters include the Jung-Freud, Russian combat pilot assigned to serve with a squadron of Noricum and Kadumim belong Smith laid, a love interest for Norik, who died in their first outing together, and Kimiko Higuchi, a childhood friend Norik . Kimiko participation is also of interest since while Norik removed in space, Kimiko is left behind on earth to live a normal life. And because of the time dilation acts Kimiko age usually on Earth while Norik relatively the same year, and when she left school. By the end of the series, Noricum is about 18 years, and Kimiko in her mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great anime to watch, if you're a fan of a giant robot and fur Gainax animation. If you're like other shows Hideaki Anno, or art lover Haruhiko Mikimoto, and then give this show a chance. It will grow on you.
