It's really strange film - and it's not bad. This combination of neo-realistic film about the homeless and fairy tales. I am sure that some of them may find this film a little too weird, but I loved it. Once again, the director combines great save ordinary people (not actors), and gets a big band-type performance. Although it is not as boring as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point to make - this is one time makes it very absurdist way. Ignore the cheese special effects - in the end, it was done in the early 1950s and the special effects are not very important anyway (or at least they should not be in the movies). Instead, just sit back and enjoy a very strange and stupid to go. If you're not a total cheapskate, you'll have a ball. <br /> <br /> By the way, since I first reviewed this film, I saw another DeSica director of the film, which is an absolute must see and the kids are watching us. While not fancy or light in spirit, as the Miracle in Milan, a great film nonetheless.
