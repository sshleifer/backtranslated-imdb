(Contains minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> I wonder how Anthony Mann James Stewart uses here. Stewart, of course, remembered by many as George Bailey from Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life", so it's easy to find parallels between the two films. In "It's a Wonderful Life," Bailey gets to see the world as it would be if he had never been born. The "far country," Jeff Stuart Webster, without getting involved to help someone else (besides yourself), gets to see essentially the same :. A world in which it is (for all practical matters) does not exist <br /> <br /> not get involved (and trying not to care about anyone), Webster forced to see those for which he can not help but still hurt, pushed around, and even killed, when he stands by and does nothing. It reminds the viewer of George Bailey looks at the world, which is turned upside-down, because he, too, decided not to get involved, not to have ever been born. <br /> <br /> Both films end up the same way - with a close-up of a bell ringing. Stewart, turning around his philosophy of non-participation, has seemingly earned his "wings."
