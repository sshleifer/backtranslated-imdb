Antonioni sought Heep another masterpiece, this time on the other side of the Atlantic than the "Blow up". It was not a success with the critics and young people, as the former though. Why? Maybe because it was the European's view of America are filled with clich√©s, it did not work, and it is not aged well. (Revolutionary students at the beginning of shame.) <br /> <br /> Maybe, when he was released on the big blockbusters, and those aimed at the youth market is seemed outdated. When he was released a year ago, maybe, hippes in the deserts would have seemed fresh ... epidermal very interesting tho film very beautifully filmed with some shiny and Antonionian scenes between them, as love-making in the desert, desert property mansion and an explosive finale. .. that leads were two lovers did not care. They were beautiful, but inexperienced. Mark Freshette slightly better than Daria Halprin. It would be much better with the right actors! Maybe Michelle Phillips or young Jessica Lange ... Conversation is actually quite funny and sometimes bitter tho you would not know how to line come ... <br /> <br /> It is very intersting document at the end of the sixties, of course worth a look at the pictures and soundtrack ....
