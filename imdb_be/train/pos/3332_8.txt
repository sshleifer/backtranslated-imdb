Thus, attachment. For example, «Fever Pitch» can make you believe that it's baseball movie. <br /> <br /> But no, you do not have to be a baseball fan to actually enjoy this picture of the Farrelly brothers. But, of course, if you are one, you will enjoy it even more; with all links (fairly accurate one, I would say) in the Boston Red Sox and its bitter history; Curse of the Bambino, and all attributed to him, including the two words you can not say in front of Boston fan :. Bill Buckner <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon reflect two people who, as a rule, can have another idea to go into a relationship: successful workaholic, which is also deepest meeting of school teachers? The fact is, the nature of Fallon won the Barrymore heart, being funny, restless, cute and just perfect. But her friends ask her logical question: if he is the keeper of why he is still on the market? Enter the Boston Red Sox. He was so devoted to his team is still his uncle handed him Sox tickets; He never missed a home game Red Sox at Fenway Park in a long time <br /> <br /> And the delicate balance of how much a workaholic willing to give up his obsession with her boyfriend. and how much that baseball-crazed teacher willing to compromise in order to keep the other love of his life, that's what this film is all. <br /> <br /> First of all, you might think that sports obsession bits of the film are exaggerated for comic. Well, I'm sad to admit that they are not. I myself, as a die-hard fan of Houston, one can say that they are all true. I would like to try every way available, to see all the "games Strauss; listen to them on the radio, or follow them on the Internet. I read the sports section chronicles the everyday. And so, my room looks like The Shed, Minute Maid Park in the gift shop; with a closet full of Astros gear, including 5 knitted products, 20 t-shirts and you know the rest. Fallon's character even has a Red Sox MBNA MasterCard. <br /> <br /> Fallon was reliable enough as a fanatical Red Sox faithful, despite the fact that he could pull it out, without becoming a cartoon (Thank God, Adam Sandler was not in it); and plot revolves around how this pair attempted to control each other's desires. <br /> <br /> I would say that this is a classic romantic comedy. Not enough to be one of the best films in the history; but, of course, breaks the mold in the genre and quite attractive for both men and women.
