Note: These comments are for people who have seen the film <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complex and fascinating film, which explores existential exactly what the tag line says :. LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Maybe the plot of the film can come into the spotlight for the tangled moviegoers, if you look at it from a different angle <br /> <br /> Given the following :. <br /> <br /> At the moment, I did not go painstakingly through the movie scene by scene, so it is necessary to further explore my statements, (and I welcome your opinions) but give it a try and see if the film does not stand on the place where it makes the controversial "coalescence" occur? <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not talking about merging, as explained LE Â«Technician", so that the sequence can actually be interpreted as rationalization within the mind / sleep / coma state David Aames, but currently merging between reality and dream. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that in reality from a car accident, so he will not be removed (not an explosion, for example) is probably the "splicing" the point, and that any specific sequence containing an existential / sleep / coma / unreal feeling to it - let it be shown on the screen before or after the accident. - is actually a part of a personal journey Aames' in the direction of self-actualization in his own mind <br /> <br /> In this respect, then, we are left with two questions in the very end (if you know more, let me know ): Aames is actually disfigured, and where he wakes up <br /> <br /> If you do not get completely wrapped up in the exact sequence in detail? section, or in a particular moment of his dream are scattered throughout, the film becomes a fascinating study of a man on a journey to find himself and WHA tons, which means that in today's pop culture society. <br /> <br />
