With movies such as "Wallace and Gromit" and "Chicken the Run" under their belt, the good people on the other side of the pond, Aardman Animation, Now bring us a bit of twisted humor in the form of "Zhetson". <br /> <br /> derived from short made at the beginning of his career, "Zhetson" is a naturalistic show where the conversation fragments are removed from the context and give an animal of some kind. <, Br /> <br /> Aardman Animation went around the country interviewing people harmless questions such as, "You are a liar?" And then accelerate slightly to ask about their sex lives. <br /> <br /> answers, while seemingly boring and prosaic, is actually quite funny when you see the dialog boxes come first, and the animals will be added later. <br /> <br /> How many of these animals are similar to the person making the application? One of the characters who discuss what he is looking for in a woman, "I love these kind of thin." This insect, walking stick. <br /> <br /> There are two dogs discussing the smells and odors, while sniffing the rear poodle, how they talk about different smells women. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in a cage. As the "wife" says the litany, that is, her health, her long-suffering husband stood above it, saying nothing. <br /> <br /> While it may take some time "Zhetsony" to find it "legs", it must find its place on TV for those who are tired of the ordinary. While there is more reality shows than Carter liver, "Zhetsony" pill is the only one of its kind and is definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> Some of the humor may seem a bit racy, it's claymation, that catches the attention of children (as the old Batman series of 60s, jokes thin enough children do not have them) and it is a joke that exist for adults.
