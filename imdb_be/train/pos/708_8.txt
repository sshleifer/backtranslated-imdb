Ok film about Down syndrome. Mother of twins has one very sick the other is good, but it has downs. The mother does not think she can pick it up so that it gives it to some people who have 15 children 11 have slumps! Mom does not like and she thinks that he should be with his family (I agree, too), so they take it to the court and the family gets split up and lose a grandparent, he never really says, when Mom and daughter make-up? I think that this movie is good, but the plot is familiar, it is still good and has a few unintended laughs!
