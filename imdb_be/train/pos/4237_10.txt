Charlton Heston wore one, James Francis wore one, but Mark Wahlberg prefers not to wear the traditional loincloth. I hope that no one casts him as Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 Planet movie, but Estrella Warren barely showing cleavage - her hair is always on the road. Tim Burton could this sexy monkey saga and gave adults in the audience to see. Even the virtuous Helena Bonham Carter never goes out of his suit, which looks like a big curtain. She's cute, but all love the material is limited to a worried look and a bit of a motley kiss at the end. As in the field of artificial intelligence, which is discussed among the types of sex between robots and humans, but never delivers - Planet of the Apes hints on the species romance between humans and apes, but only hints. Lisa Marie is the only monkey who dares to be sexy. This movie has three great actors Tim Roth, Miss Carter and Paul Giamatti chewing the scenery as a trio of monkeys and they are fun to watch. Superlative makeup (some Oscar) costumes, sets, music make this a hit summer movie in 2001.
