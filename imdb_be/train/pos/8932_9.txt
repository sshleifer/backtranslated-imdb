The film is not visually stunning in the usual sense. It is not a series of beautiful images. Instead it visually interesting film. It makes the viewer constantly processing or possible to imagine the context of different shots. This kind of thing is easy to try, but it is difficult to succeed in. The film refuses to use the crutch of the genre, to help the less than fully captured by the viewer to get what's going on. Instead, the film touches and moves through a number of different genres. The trick loves the film is the ability to enjoy this playfulness. I suspect that 99% of North American audiences just do not get it. If you try to pin down the story of this film or philosophical message, or symbolist structures, etc. You will be wasting your time. There is not one of them. feints film only with respect to these and other genres at times. The only unifying force in the film's own sense of Claire Denis, that fits together. There are so few feature films that come close to meeting Kant's description of what art is, namely, the power of the court itself, rather than simply summing up the experience of a concept. The film usually takes the easy way out and selects for the simple pleasure of understanding what is happening. Most of the film is not art. Most of the film does not come close to art. If the movie does, how it does, and even a nice big circle of spectators, it's a miracle. My negative comment on the fact that sometimes I find the film too simplistic purchase to various narrative threads that pass through it. Tahiti father-son story, despite the fact that this is no ordinary ultimately makes things a bit to clear and simple. It dominates too much.
