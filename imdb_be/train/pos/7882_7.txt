"Ship AhoyÂ», it was probably done in order to demonstrate the MGM talent. The film is a fun trip on an ocean liner en route to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the time, in which the country was drawn into World War II. It was typical fare for a studio, which gave a film light weight of public entertainment as a distraction during those difficult times, the country of residence. <br /> <br /> Excellent Eleanor Powell is seen at its best in some musical numbers where it clearly shows us that she was a dancer to be reckoned with. Red Skelton is also seen in the straight parts with not too much clowning, he has a beautiful Mrs. Powell on the ship, which brings them in Puerto Rico. Irresistible Bert Lahr has good opportunities in the film to show that he was a funny man. Virginia Gray also viewed as a fun girl who does not deceive anybody. <br /> <br /> There are good musical numbers featuring Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, in which one sees, among other things, surprising Buddy Rich, who has several solo with Mr. Dorsey and Ms. Powell. Young Frank Sinatra is also as the lead vocalist, with the support of the pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic journey to be savored proponents of this genre, which is fully controlled by MGM.
