Soylent Green I found to be a great movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Run Logan you like. <br /> <br /> So, the film is old and there are no special effects and some of the actions of a few can be best described as "cheesy", but the story perfectly. <br /> <br /> the story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very serious. <br /> <br /> in the end, the secret was not a secret, but the story unfolded in the lung at the right pace. <br /> <br /> This is the closest modern equivalent of the day would be «Dark Angel» in terms of having been shown in the United States to be a third world country.
