I do not consider this film until recently on that and found the story in relation to Poland and the small town that has been plagued by the Nazi occupation of the local towns as well as in many other European cities, such as Norway. The First World War ended, and the people in this city are still suffering from their fallen soldiers and wounded war that always creates. Alexander Knox (Wilhelm Gimm) «Gorky Park" is returned from the war and has lost his legs and was a former school teacher in the city. He was raised by a German and was not very happy with the Polish people, and they, in turn, did not fully accept it either. As the party of Hitler grew Wilhelm Grimm wanted to be a Nazi to come back and punish the small Polish town to treat them with respect to it, which was really all in his head. Marsha Hunt (Mary Pacierkowski), «Chloe's Prayer", played a prominent role of a woman who lost her husband and a romantic relationship with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many historical and some very real truths about how the Nazis killed people and family all his life. Cattle cars presented in this picture of the Jewish people to head to the Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this movie, and how this subject, to give him part of his time; this film is very down to earth for the 1944 film and the story that you do not forget too quickly.
