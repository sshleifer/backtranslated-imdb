After watching the Dick Tracy in the $ 6.99 bin at Future Shop, I decided to give it a go without any prior knowledge, and being a big fan of mafia and crime films. I was very surprised to see a lot of fun, smart and entertaining film with stiff performances throughout. The film moves well, it is, of course, another solid performance from Warren Beatty, but the real standouts of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was pleased to learn that Pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top of a gangster trying to demolish the city. Madonna was great, the girl is in trouble, it really made an impression on me, and add depth to her work. If you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch the fun, clever film with more action and tough scenario then give Dick Tracy try. I do not think you will be disappointed. And the list of cameos from Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman, among others.
