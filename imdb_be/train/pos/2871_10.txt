Comment? As my comment necessary? It is about consistently masterpiece for all seasons and all ages. This is the only type of films that I still have the patience to watch. In this, as in other films Disney has some kind of magic. All the characters in a certain sense, "alive" and "real", so it's easy to understand the message, even if you do not understand the language, (as I did not realize when I first saw the film, because I was about six years old). Maybe my English is not so good, but I knew what I know, mainly because of this kind of films, and this is another big size of this kind of movies, which are now rare. But there is a great shame. In my country, now it is impossible to look at this, or any other Disney film! We have no copyright, so that our children have disabilities to enjoy and learn from this kind of films. Thus, we will watch this movie again, "Once in a dream," or ...?
