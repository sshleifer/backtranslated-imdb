Gender Bender sexes things up a bit for the d-file. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but the ending that leaves much to be desired. Gender Bender is also x-files debut for actor Nicholas Lea, better known as Alex Krycek. In this episode, he plays Michael, a man attacked one of the "related". You should see the episode just to see less than spectacular start Nic Lea. The interesting thing about the relatives' power of seduction. " If Marty makes his victims, they have turned on him / her. However, if seduces Andrew Scully, it is only because it disoriented and groggy, and did not become attracted to Andrew. Maybe it's because Marty has more experience in this than Andrew. This episode reminds me of why it sometimes miserable shooting in British Columbia. Throughout the episode, he is so wet, damp and muddy, it could not be that much fun. Despite the disappointing ending, Gender Bender has a decent episode for viewing.
