Terrible mother-son duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) sucks the life virgins and their latest goal is beautiful, but lonely Tanya (MÃ¤dchen Amick). However, these monsters are allergic to cat scratch ... I was never a fan of the sloppy, oversized bestsellerists like King, Koontz or Barker, but this B-movie, written by himself, Mr. Dung is actually not so bad than this It could be. Yes, sometimes jaw droppingly brutal, but there are actually some surprisingly impressive touches: good old cemetery, terrible soundtrack and candles gothic house scene, the mirror shows the monstrous form of the villains, etc. Of course, the film is dirty pot spout dialogue, Mr. Dung and all-tactics-of-the-toilet seat obsession vilify people who are overweight, which leads to a completely senseless plot mentor rapist, but there is a rose among the manure.
