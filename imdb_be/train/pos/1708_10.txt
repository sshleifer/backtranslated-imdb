Looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to wonder what some people do for fun .... <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to see the film during his all too short a theatrical perspective. The audience laughed his head. I look at the tape of it as I type and it's still damn funny! <br /> <br /> He also got the sweet side, with unexpected twists and turns of this pathos. Late, great Royal Dano is particularly effective as a lone, down on his successful farmer Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and Jay-Jay Anderson as lead large children. And the actors in the Martian costumes, although limited facial expressions, do a great job <br /> <br /> Another thing to look at is the background details. The film is full, pastiches honors, as well as links to other SF and fantasy films. Look at Martian costumes next time. One of them, dressed in a suit Marty McFly, the second is a Ghostbuster, the third is in the form of Atreides House, and the fourth wore Last Starfighter flightsuit.
