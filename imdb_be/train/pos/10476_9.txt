My first acquaintance with «Whale Music» was Rheostatics album of the same name that I bought about 1993. I read liner notes and band said the album, which remains in a prominent place in my collection, was inspired by the Canadian book. <br /> <br writer Paul Kvarrington in /> I took the book in a few months and devoured! It is strange to read! Ever since I read the book many times, each time finding a new element of Desmond and his desire to complete the Whale Music. <br /> <br /> I found the film in 1996, in the video. I did not have a lot of good experience with the Canadian film, but this one worked for me. The role of Claire could have been cast in different ways, but in general I think that the vision of Paul Kvarrington was translated beautifully from the book to the screen. <br /> <br /> The sea Chaykin gives a moving performance as an isolated genius. The film deals with family relationships, love, and find someone who understands. I highly recommend «Whale Music» not only music lovers but anyone who has ever lost something or someone is trying to find its way back into the world.
