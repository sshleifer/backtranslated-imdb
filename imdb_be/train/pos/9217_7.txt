It's really a funny movie is stupid cast of characters, each about a voluptuous middle-aged woman in Hollywood, and a touching, funny story of love. Capomezza-x and Malacici are competing provisions in the Italian neighborhood in New York. They are also contrary - extreme - the end of the taste scale. Their children cast in the main roles of the Church production of Romeo and Juliet. Of course, they fall in love. On stage! Mayhem and confusion that this causes, as parents feud with each other and their children playing in the background for us perfectly tasteless house Capomezza, and perfectly tasteless catered wedding. <br /> <br /> In addition, four more top-parents and charming young lovers, the characters include the vaguely wise priest, a simple, who speaks grandmother, a lady who waves the wand and goes on the spiritual advice, she receives from the middle is called blessed Roscoe and motel beds shaped like the back seat of the car, and two doves. There is no sight gag or highlight which does not click in this crazy film. <br /> <br /> Even the names of the two families are part of the fun. «Capomezza» can be interpreted as "low-brow" and «Malacici» can mean "arrogant snob.» <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive Italian stereotypes, you may not like this film. If Bette Midler bother you, you may not like it, because all the women in this film do look like Bette Midler Martha Stewart. The rest have to love it!
