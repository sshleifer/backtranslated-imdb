This was my second time watching the film (in the version in French, unlike the first, which has been dubbed in Italian), and I feel that it improves on these screenings. <br /> <br /> A convincing if slowly built -up study of character that beautifully shot and with the Parisian settings to be equally impressive. Ultimately, it's not a top-class Polanski, and I would rate it at number 9 in his filmography, but he still believes the combination of thin shivering, and, surprisingly, often broad comedy. She also has a wonderful cast, all of whom are in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> However, I'm a little confused by the sudden compulsion to Trelkovsky to "change" the previous tenant; but the owner cafe in front of an apartment house, where he is given all that Simon used to keep asking him if he wanted any other, there is little to show (as far as I could see, anyway), it's something that everyone wanted it! Okay, so he found things Simone were still lying in the apartment, but that it was forced to wear her dress and make yourself at it (even if he apparently started doing it unconsciously)? After his nightmarish visions in the bathroom, the last part of the film (where Adjani all but disappears) almost disappointing - especially the scene where the owner and other residents witnessed his suicide attempt, as if it was a night at the Opera !, This concept, which has already 46 years ago by Jean Cocteau in the blood so it was used (1930) <br /> <br /> ending that is at once predictable and unresolved: just what do the two drivers and passengers is a particular flat jump out of the window;?! I remember this factor listened to me on the first viewing, as well, and I'm sorry to say that this is not more clearly! Keep in mind, the first two-thirds of the film is quite hard, but I want to Polanski was less reliance on obscure points of the story everywhere.
