Director of the Union has been uneven career in the horror genre, creating such masterpieces as "The Return of the Living Dead 3" or "Bride of Re-Animator", but at the same time, he made a terrible movies like "Faust: Love of the Damned" or ordinary " offspring. " He obviously better in the producer chair, where his work produces films Stuart Gordon was wonderful. <br /> <br /> Â«Dentist" is one of his lesser works as a director, but has the advantage of a low profile in the film and the absence of claims makes it a very enjoyable experience. It tells the story of Dr. Alan Feinstone (played superbly on Burns), a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life really is not as perfect as he thought, when he discovers that his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman) It has to do with the boy's pool. This event disturbs his mind and puts it in a killing spree when he takes revenge on the world for being "dirty". <br /> <br /> The room is very well handled Yuzna, as he takes us on a trip the next day Feinstone revenge. What makes this film different from most slashers it is that we do not in the future victim, we go Feinstone, because he is the main character. We see how it goes from a respected professional in the psycho murder a day. Yuzna film manages to give the exact number is unknown, but adds a good dose of black humor, which really helps the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the premises of success by Burns as Feinstone. It can make you feel sympathy and hatred for him at the same time, subtle humor and his character has another aspect that helps the film. The rest of the cast is not so good, and I think that their sub-par action film hurt more than it should. A notable exception is Ken Fori like a detective trying to catch Feinstone. While part of it is fairly small, it does a great job with him. <br /> <br /> C dentist as killer bloody scenes is expected and provides greater Yuzno SFX in the right quantity. It's good to see that he does not go in the top with him, as he usually does, and I dare say it is the highlight of the film. It has the exact amount of gore that is expected nothing less and nothing more. Yuzna restrain its excesses common and a great result. <br /> <br /> While it's not among the most famous Yuzna film, I would say that this is one of his best. Of course, this is not the classic material as his masterpieces, but it's the film that entertains and never tiring and boring. This low-budget film is simple, but for what it is, I think, that rocked. 7/10
