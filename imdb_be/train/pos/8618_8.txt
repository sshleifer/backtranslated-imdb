Samurai (also known as time shifting) with the crew of the American aircraft carrier, they argue to stop the attack on Pearl Harbor in 90 minutes, and then go home and hope that no one recalls that Japan made the first and with a lot of balls in 1979 with the film Sonny Chiba. But unlike their Hollywood counterparts The Final Countdown, it is to see my room with: abandoned 400 years in the Japanese feudal wars, its peacetime soldiers decided that their best hope to get back lies in provoking stories, trying to change it by combining with warlord to conquer the country ?? Ki a lot of tanks and helicopters against the samurai action, including a very large relentless 25 minutes of battle sequences featuring the cast of thousands suffered serious damage to each other. And yes, there is a beheading. <br /> <br /> Of course, things do not go as planned, and even superior firepower does not stand up, and expressed hope to thousands of soldiers.

Impressively directed and surprisingly well thought out, soft rock and country and western songs, sometimes distracting, especially if they have English songs sung by Japanese artists, who clearly could not utter a word to speak the language, but that's forgivable flaw in wonder good science fiction. Action <br /> <br /> optimum DVD in the UK is a good transfer of the director's 138-minute version.
