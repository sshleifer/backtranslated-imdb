John Waters did the most expansive buoyancy, heart, dark, personal short film, I think I've ever seen (well, maybe fast food Fast woman comes second) Director clear vision ... whimsical story, personal characters and odd reflection of the family and his own inner life ... t never forced or stylistic above the arch. <br /> <br /> There's not pretentious design a shot, melancholy, or log grading .... Martha Plimpton's amazing how furlong sister..Eddie inspired casting. Grandmother with said Mary, tea-bags, recycled clothes, yesterday's trash becomes art today - and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing that we can appreciate a family ... and a modest life.
