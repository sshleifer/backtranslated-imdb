It's a plain old horrible ghost story. I showed some of my friends in my cinema club, and they were fascinated saved for the finale! No blood or gore- just good old-fashioned suspense. It starts from the very beginning, and builds and builds. The ending is a real twist that caught me off guard. <br /> <br /> Well directed and well acted. This is also a "period piece" - set in the 1920s-, which added to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed, I received a book by Susan Hill from Amazon. The film follows quite closely the book. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, is not readily available on DVD. My copy VHS. This along with the «Haunted», probably two of the best Ghost Stories I've ever scene. Which just goes to show that a little creativity will surpass "in your face" to gore any day!
