In 1990, Brad Pitt and Lewis did Juiliette TV Too Young To Die, where both played much the same part of what they do in Kalifornia. I have no doubt that this is what led to their casting in this great movie on the screen. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia is an aspiring novelist David Duchovny and his girlfriend, photographer Michelle Forbes on a rocky relationship grades because of his obsession with writing spiritual books and get into the minds and hearts of serial killers. In fact, he got the most extraordinary odyssey planned, he wants to go over rough terrain and visit the sites of several well-known serial killers. But he and Forbes is had. <br /> <br /> The fate intervenes in more than finance the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis a couple of amazing southern species that have agreed to share the cost of gas on this cross-country trip. It turns out that Pete himself a serial killer, and he decides to do a little research on your own, delving into the mind of someone who is passionate immorality. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia sun type of movie I usually go, but actually acting ability and charisma Brad Pitt to make it work in a meaningful way. Pete moving definition of inbred Gothic refugee from Deliverance. But it is better than it is Juliette Lewis, who once again plays these types of low self-esteem, which she seems to be fine. See her scene with Forbes, she does her hair and Lewis describes his sad and miserable life. Lewis and reaction Forbes dialogue should be presented in acting classes across the country. <br /> <br /> For those who love slasher clicks, they do not come better than Kalifornia.
