This film is based on Frazetta art, mythical fantasy illustrator. Some of the characters right out of his paintings (the croupier Death as the best example). Surprisingly, but the animation is possible to maintain a sense of original art. Bakshi is well known for its intensive use Rotoscope (tracking technique live action sequences), and this film is no exception. However, since the theme of the film is quite realistic (all characters are human beings), it works very well <br /> <br /> But what I really like about the story here :. At this time, we have a story with interesting characters and good action sequences really disgusting villain and a beautiful baby. This movie has a sense of the best comics of Conan, is not surprising, since Roy Thomas is the author of a series of our favorite Marvel Cimmerian! This is far from a bad Conan live-action, not to mention all the B-movie genre. <br /> <br /> Would definitely recommend!
