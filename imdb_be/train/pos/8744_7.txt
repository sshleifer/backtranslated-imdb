This low-budget film with a cast of unknowns and at least spot fires. Philippines substitute for Thailand, and no one really goes to Hong Kong. The stock shot Cathay Pacific Airbus landing in the old airport makes the transition very well. This film proves that you have no mega budgets or headliner star to make a great movie. It does not contain any mistake, any surplus of that young Filmakers often stumble. Solid skills from people who know all the aspects of filmmaking and who understand the trade-offs between art and rentals. A great piece of work!
