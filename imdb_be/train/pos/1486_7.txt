I was very happy to go and see, "Milan," a film shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri Rome is a director who understood correctly, and fortunately printed in the film Milanese philosophy. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of the standard -in career- Milan pair, from "birth" to death. The birth, marriage is so typical of any scheme, which is original and includes everything in an instant wedding guests back story about how the couple came to each other and felt in love. Life is hard in the "Urbe" Milan and after the candy of old times became tougher and tougher, and then, finally, the product of: a child who is instead further strengthen couple relationships weaken it, because "selfish effect" typical of today "metropolis" personality. Advertising media from all over the "creative" under stress atmosphere helps recover part in the plot. We are losing the values ​​of life, and it is good and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp film from the director. <br /> <br Senza in Pellet in /> The actors are well chosen, Stefania Rocca beautiful and well characterized and a positive surprise, an unexpected good Fabio Volo, well known for his "trash" TV series :. Le Iene <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
