Any bartender directed the wind blows, he will sing the song Deus. Anarchy controls logic and common strain of thought. The story of this movie just goes or which way the wind is blowing. And it really can be refreshing, to see if you are ready and willing it. Spectators, who say that there is nothing to keep the storyline together right. Who the hell is that Windman anyway? Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp lovely, bustling, happening place and Any Way captures that feeling. It also captures the stupidity, racism, bureaucracy, addiction and violence that survive unnoticed in a seemingly friendly city. The film is entertaining, funny and a little shallow. Barman screen debut will not do as a heavy blow, as his music debut. In this light, some of them may be disappointed. But again, the "worst case scenario" will delicate subtitle for any wind blows.
