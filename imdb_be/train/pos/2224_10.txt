Female butcher (played by sexy Jennifer Thomas II) has an amusing work is done all the fantasy of all men on death row, before they meet their creator. And what a way to go. Fortunately, this movie is not real, or we would have a lot more people in the world on death row. <br /> <br /> It starts very slowly. Poor lighting and bad game, like most (B) of the film. It gets better as it moves forward. And it ends with a bang. <br /> <br /> I would rate it very high in the low-cost, very sexy movies 90s. It must be seen as only children away or in bed.
