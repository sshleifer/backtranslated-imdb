I'm talking about the domino principle is extremely underestimated film.anyone, who took the time to explore our modern order history, St. Petersburg, RCT, MLK, g.wallace and indeed many others can only conclude that the author knew the principle of dominoes what he said about.roy Tucker can be Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray or Serhan or Arthur Bremer, maybe even John Hinckley or timothy mcveigh.to mentioned scenario few.the conspiracy involving spies, big business and political killings it is in fact not fiction, but a sinister part of our confusing ekzi stentsyyalnay history.god help us, but the domino effect of more than fantasy.if fact, this leads to a small loss of sleep, maybe it should.don't take my word for it, investigate for yourself.
