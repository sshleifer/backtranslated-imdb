This movie was excellent. I did not expect to live up to all the hype, but it was done. Like all the films the Bourne action fast-paced, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two films in the trilogy, you'll love it too. The plot is simple and there is no plot twists that are too unrealistic. Well, Julia Stiles character appears in an Italian safe house was a kind of far-fetched, especially after what happened in the reign, but it makes sense that she is the only character in the «Treadstone», that Bourne knows he does not want that he died, and he could be trusted and the only man to lead him in the right direction. The action moves the characters and their reactions to what is happening around them. The fact that I have always loved about the Bourne films that Bourne could kick butt, but when compared with men, as good as he is fighting the fight, and it takes a lot of damage to them. They never refer to the audience as idiots. <br /> <br /> All of the actors were firm in their speeches. I think that Damon may play Born in a dream and receives excellent support from Joan Elena reprising his role from the Supremacy, Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie and trilogy. I miss Franka Potente, though.
