it is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. it is really refreshing to watch and I was in the path many times. I believe that there is a factor, the public consciousness to this, too, which makes it very interesting. if they were white girls, they would get the same response? maybe they would, perhaps, they will not? the characters do not know borders (check my texts) and do not exclude any of these twisted sense of fun! There are so many funny sketches. Bob the Builder is a favorite one. this is so stupid, it's genius. if you like the twisted black comedy, then this is for you. if you like to keep up appearances is probably not isn't.3 blond one cheerful BBC British comedy show on TV! It's such a fun show and the characters are unleashed on the unsuspecting public are laughing loud funny! It would be impossible to maintain a closed face to look crazy characters and the reaction of the public! This series is easily adds excellent comedy produced!
