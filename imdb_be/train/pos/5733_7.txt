I'm going to tip the scales a little bit here and say that I enjoyed it. Nevertheless, the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies. This is definitely something that most people do not get, because the nature of absurdities. <br /> <br /> Animation terrible, but yes, this is the point. The protagonist is a foul mouthed, violent and stupid. Anyway NO redeeming qualities. his wife squeals and screams, apparently, barely capable of the most basic communication skills. Most of these stories are completely absent of any point <br /> <br /> but then again, this is the case;). <br /> <br /> If you are not sequiters, profanity, and a complete and utter chaotic your thing, you'll love this. <br /> <br /> This is very short, so I would probably have to rent rather than buy.
