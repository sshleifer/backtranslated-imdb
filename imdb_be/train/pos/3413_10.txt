Just I came out and I can not believe that this is a brilliant documentary. Rarely do you get out of the theater in such awe and wonder. In recent years, movies have become so over inflated that the thrill of finding something really special and unique rare. Amores Perros did it for me when it first came out, and now this film does for me. I do not know about it before it and what a surprise. If you hear the term, you can get the feeling that this is one of those touchy film about the amazing triumph, covered on top of music and try to make us fully confident that most stories it tells, but then, without giving us. Fortunetly this is not the movie. People tell the story! It does such a good job capturing every moment of their participation in a while we enter into their world and feel every second with them. There is so much of the rise, which makes it all that they go through so much more intense. Touching the void was also a great instrument of mountaineering and which shows the intensity in an attractive way, but this film is much more of human history. I just saw him today, but I'll go and say that this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.
