I took the film without the cover and without even knowing what it was, but when I watched it, I laughed so hard. Currently, one of my favorite movies of all time. Rusty and the kids created a masterpiece, I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor. Thanks Rusty for the fact that we need something to laugh.
