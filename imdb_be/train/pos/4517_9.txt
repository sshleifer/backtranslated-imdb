With this theme, it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs, trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Pasdar does an excellent job of creating Gerald real person, someone you care deeply about, and as a result you feel it struggling trying to live and Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but, as Geraldine, he looks HOT! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters electric. These two characters, who feel love for each other, and it comes through, even if they just look at each other over breakfast. Even potentially cheese sub storyline corporate acquisitions plausible, and you will be applause at the end! At least, I did!
