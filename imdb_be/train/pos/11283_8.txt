"Tarzan and His Mate", the second of the MGM Tarzan photographs, picks up a year after the "Ape Man Tarzan events." Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle, and Harry Holt (one of the missions in the first film) is returned, this time accompanied by a less than honorable Arlington Martin, in search of ivory from elephant graveyards. Of course, a variety of dangerous and exciting adventures taking place on the way <br /> <br /> The first film to romanticize everything -. Jungle, adventure, romance itself, wild animals, and even death. The second film is still a lot of romance and a lot of wonderful action sequences, but more serious tone is the basis of action. Symbols dare to ask such questions as: What should I do if something happened to Tarzan? What would Jane do when she was herself stranded in the middle of the jungle, and she had to fend for themselves? Although this is probably the real questions people will ask in this situation, it creates a certain amount of darkness, it is not always as exciting as the ratio of throw-caution-to-the-wind of the original. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth that we see in relations Tarzan and Jane. Tarzan still speaks very broken English, but he obviously learned a few new words of his assistant. Also, their love for each other really blossomed, and we feel that they really spent a year together in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Most people believe "Tarzan and His Mate" surpasses the original "Tarzan Ape ManÂ». I personally liked the first movie, just a little bit better. The main reason is that the relationship between the team of Harry Holt & Martin Arlington is not as nice as the relationship with Holt James Parker (Jaina's father) from the original. The character of Mr. Arlington can work as a great movie villain, but he's playing the hero for being too much of the film. The film can never decide whether we have to love it or hate it. (Also, I do not want to give anything away, but in one scene where we must be clear that hate him Jane would never know about those events, so that the end is not as satisfactory as it could be.) these detractors are relatively minor, however, and it's still a great movie. <br /> <br /> As with the first film, "Tarzan and His Mate" has a strange scenes, great shots of wildlife, and one of the greatest songs of the screen constantly. If you liked the first film in the series, this is definitely a continuation see.
