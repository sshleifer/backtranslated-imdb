It turned out cool production that must have been a low budget. A variety of characters wonderfully, with axes dwarfs 7 feet ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between the findings, not too sentimental, but enough to keep the interest going romantic. I also enjoyed the mix of humor (which can be very easy to make mistakes, too much / little), which meant it was not too dark and not too spoofy. It was a big step forward compared to other efforts Eaves, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a great website that is worth checking out. I can not wait to Bain, when the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
