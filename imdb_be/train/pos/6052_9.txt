Highly recommend !! <br /> <br /> A well written, funny movie that will appeal to everyone out there with a sense of humor !!!. Give it a go, it's good to see an independent British film more than holding its own against the big established studios !! Definitely worth adding to any collection of movies. There are scenes in this movie, I'm sure that many people will be able to relate to. You will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the wonderful soundtrack. I particularly liked the option Orban Vietnam Jimmy Cliff and the Tower of London by taking Freebird. <br /> <br /> Go on give it a go ............ you will not be disappointed.
