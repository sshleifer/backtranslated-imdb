More than just a "children's film", "hole" looks at how past incidents still affect us today, regardless of whether we know them or not. If a teenager Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a camp, where he was forced to dig the whole day, he discovers a number of things about the camps, and his contact with him. Through flashbacks we learn that a number of things that are closer than we think (you will understand it better when you see the movie). LeBoeuf does a very good job, as do other members of the cast: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette, and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting film.
