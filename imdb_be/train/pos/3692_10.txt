I watched this movie a few days ago in a small independent film in Paris. It was my last night in the French capital and the best farewell I could choose. These twenty episodes made me relive the impression I'm going to Paris in the heart-warming process without drifting into kitsch or sentimental sentimentality. Each episode is full of surprise, strong emotions and suggestive photos and each short film is directed in accordance with the rules of a good story. For me, this kind of film requires a lot more talent and as a director and storyboard writer than any epic drama of two o'clock and they succeeded in their task perfectly! Stories have been carefully selected based on their relevance and to express the respective District smell wonderful. Each episode was seen with the other ankle was a different theme, different style and twenty stories lead to a harmonious orchestra movies. The most outstanding advantage of an episode of the concept, in my opinion is based on the fact that you can switch between a wide variety of feelings and moods without the danger of overload, just the opposite: m√©lange of sadness, melancholy, pure joy, despair, anger, anxiety, curiosity and passion gives it film unique freshness and harmony. And do not forget all the love theme! The love between the characters, the love between the characters and Paris, as well as the love of directors and actors / actress for this project. I do not want to go into details of the episodes, because there are so many, but I have to single out a number of world-famous actors and actresses from all over the world and their approach to this project. Some play with their image, some broke it fully and some have interpreted the stereotypes associated with their home country and the role they played before, so that intertextuality has received all through the movie. In general, I can absolutely recommend this great collage and will look forward to its release on DVD.
