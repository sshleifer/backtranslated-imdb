The bartender just wanted to do the film because he wanted to. Just as simple as that, and he did it. Not only in their purpose, but also in creating a beautiful film, very clearly. He knows how to use the pans, the sequence of the slow tracking jib, camera crane, etc. in a nice, smooth road. This gives the film a very relaxing feel to it <br /> <br /> The story about the life of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common but one :. Party, they all attend to, which is also the turning point of the film. The beauty of this picture is not the question of how the characters have an impact on each one (in comparance with similar, of course, the best film as magnolia). I just do not think it was the idea of ​​the bartender. Beauty lies in the details of the various experiences that people go through that creates or destroys their lives. The bartender is very successful, telling these little stories that describe a little experience. He knows the people ..... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> soundtrack is also great, but not a surprise, as we know, that bartender is also very successful composer and musician, with his band Deus. Music sometimes passionately, and at the same time relaxing, which promotes solar, smoothness of the film. Sometimes we hear the funky pop / rock tunes that give certain scenes forces that they need. <br /> <br /> There's only one drawback, and it is the last hour. Whether it was the environment that beats me? It was not the last scene, fresh and accurate than the stage until? I can not understand it ... <br /> <br /> In general, a beautiful sunny film that raises up the Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> (this is the wind, which flows through the girl's hair on a sunny day makes it even more beautiful, it is a fresh breeze that makes you relax, if it passes you at a crowded party when someone opens the door, it's a breeze that carries the spirits with this beautiful girl who sits next to you in the park, which you have just met a week ago, it was the wind .....) <br /> <br />
