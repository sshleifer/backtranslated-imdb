Barbra Streisand is a tour de force in the history of Hollywood. Her performance of the song and one of a kind and special in the halls of great movies. The scene where she is introduced to the audience by unexpecting Kristopherson, against the will and its crowds, only to turn them around with her magnificent performance of "Woman in the Moon" is one of the best examples in the film about how well a great singer can win an audience. It's real. The scene where she writes Evergreen on a par with the best in the business .. all living things, not to stir up the lips, very special. Streisand is often criticized for the fact that Diva, but she delivers on that. It is majestic singing "With One More Look At You. She deserves an Oscar, she and Paul Williams received for Evergreen. Kristopherson had his moments too far above most of his appearances in the movies. This version of "The Bourne franchise" is the first one since 1937 (Janet Gaynor, Fredric March), though I will always enjoy Judy Garland and James Mason musical remake of 1954 I did not see the DVD still does not know about its quality.
