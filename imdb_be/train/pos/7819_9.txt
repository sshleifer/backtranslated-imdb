What a movie! I never thought, Richard Attenborough could have a film in it. Gandhi always left me indifferent, except of Ben Kingsley, and I never thought Attenborough especially good director. But Cry Freedom held my interest like few movies lately. This is an exciting, fascinating political cinema with large protrusions Kevin Klein and young Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> Kline plays Donald Woods, Editor of South Africa, who befriends a civil rights activist Steve Biko. It begins in the heavy friendship, for Woods sees Biko ~ d as black preference preaching hatred against whites. Biko but, with his kind words, optimistic attitude and full transparency, the victory over Woods and leads him to the reality of apartheid that Woods did not know anything about. <br /> <br /> Biko decent, law-abiding citizen who selflessly opposed to prejudice and a system which keeps down his man. One night, coming out of an illegal gathering, he was arrested and beaten to death. Authorities are trying to hush up the case, because Biko became a huge face in South Africa. But the truth is coming out through the efforts of the Woods. But what should be a celebration becomes a nightmare just like Woods and his family became the target of the secret police. <br /> <br /> This film has an interesting structure. It actually has two narratives: the first tells about the life and death of Biko. It is not strange the first half, completely dominated Washington's charisma that may be his greatest performance yet. <br /> <br /> The second half, no less interesting, Woods tells attempts to escape from South Africa to publish a book about Biko. Woods became the enemy of the state, banned persons, which means that it can not meet people or leave the country. In addition, he was constantly spied on by the police. Kevin Kline gives a great performance in the second half too. <br /> <br /> While the first half is pretty simple, others are doing interesting things with the editing, giving flashbacks Biko and events that point to repression of the black South Africans. Some may argue that this is to make it more interesting, but for me, the second half just as exciting as Woods and his family develop a daring plan to escape South Africa. <br /> <br /> In the last minutes were so heartbreaking, I was in tears. George Fenton and evaluation Jonas Gvangvy certainly has something to do with it. Although I've never been much a fan Fenton (can not stand him by Gandhi), I believe that the estimate for Cry Freedom is one of the most beautiful ever written for film. The film, thanks to the music married the powerful images, sometimes reached incredible peaks of emotion. <br /> <br /> Cry Freedom is definitely not just watching a movie because of Denzel Washington. This is a film to be desired in its entirety. Acting, writing, music, editing, cinematography come together to create a perfect synthesis of an ode to the forces of the human spirit. This film deserves a place alongside films like The Pianist, Life is Beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.
