I really enjoyed it movie.I was fifteen when this movie came out, and I could relate to. This is a film that I would show to your children, to let them know the feelings they have are normal. It's funny to see how we could be so devestated things at such a young age..who knew we had to bounce back .... again and again .... Great movie !!!!
