Higher and higher has been one of the less Broadway Rodgers & Hart is the only battle was 84 performances on Broadway in 1940 still gave one of his biggest hits it never crossed my mind. <br /> <br /> However, with the exception of one minor song, so disgusting Rich, the entire cost of Broadway was evil when RKO bought the film rights. Instead of a new account of Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson was written mainly to accommodate one Francis Albert Sinatra, who was making his feature film debut. <br /> <br /> Sinatra, who made some vocal cameos in the previous films, takes a letter from the page of his singing rival Bing Crosby. If Bing made his feature film debut in the Grand Broadcast, he played Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra took over the role of Frank Sinatra, and I can not think of anyone who could do a better job. <br /> <br /> Chairman of the Board declared a third of the stars here, Jack Haley and Michelle Morgan. He has a butler pantry and she is a servant of Leon Errol. In fact Errol millionaire who did not pay for their assistance in seven months. Mainly because it's going to go belly up in Chapter 11, or so, it shall inform the staff. <br /> <br /> beautiful old soul Errol to work and none of the staff do not want to lose a good thing. They combine their resources and get Michelle Morgan to embody the daughter of Errol, that's for Switzerland with her mother. The idea was to catch a rich bankroll, hoping to save the family fortune. Michelle is just starting to look at the other. <br /> <br /> This is a small area, and certainly no worse than a whole lot of musicals, but RKO invested the film with a good cast of players. Barbara Hale and Risdon play a debutante and her mother, who suspected that something was wrong, Victor Borge this state is not seeking costs, Dooley Wilson, Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, Marcy McGuire, Mel Torme and Mary Wickes, played by other household Errol staff. Not a bad bunch at all. <br /> <br /> Sinatra sang three good ballads all of them had some commercial success, the music stopped, a great way to spend an evening and I could not sleep last night. The latter was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song, but lost to Alice Faye You'll never know. <br /> <br /> 1943 was the year of the musician Union strike against the recording industry. In order to get your stuff from Frank Sinatra recorded the song with higher and higher with a capella choir to Colombia. Bing Crosby recorded the song from his movie Dixie in the same way, for Decca. Both were condemned President of the Union, James C. Petrillo as the scabs and the two do not cross the picket line again. The strike was not fully resolved before 1944, although Decca sold earlier by other record companies and settled before Columbia, RCA Victor, and others. <br /> <br /> Strike provided some anxious moments for Sinatra. He had just left the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, if the strike was. He closed the necessary space for its artistry, if he was not sure, leaving Dorsey be right career move. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, higher and higher was obtained as a legend was launched.
