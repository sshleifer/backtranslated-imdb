Overall, I was very impressed with the pilot. The initial first fifteen minutes were worried, since he did feel that the creators have tried to create a version of science fiction The OC, but this fear is to straighten out when there is a terrorist act, and hence on the show steps in the topics and situations that I very rarely see television solutions. <br /> <br /> BSG discusses topics such as monotheism, existentialism, the reality of death and terrorism, but they were primarily overtones, there for the viewer to contemplate or to ignore if they wish. Here, on the other hand, these objects are the focus of the show, and I personally found myself waking up works such as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points when viewing and be surprised at how well these topics were discussed. I think that if you are a fan of the two I just mentioned or other movies / TV shows that deal with subjects I reference, I think you will find at least something here. <br /> <br /> In terms of starting point to explain the situation as we know it in the BSG happened, I think they coped very interesting, I especially liked how they explained where the belief in a single Cylon God came, and the creation of Caprica was just enough advanced and modern technology thrown out to make it happen in the future, but not exactly a stranger to us as viewers. <br /> <br /> The only real weak spots that I noticed was the relationship between parents and Greystone actress playing "Lacy Rand," While I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, with their scenes seemed to lack chemistry at this point it may just be down to the development of their characters, but it's something I think we have to work. I also discovered, Magda Apanovich convincing in their roles. This again can be traced back to the experience and the time required to develop, but in the whole episode of her actions seemed forced and not very confident. <br /> <br /> On the basis of the pilot I am very looking forward to see where «Caprica» is the future and we hope that it will touch the greatness that once made BSG.
