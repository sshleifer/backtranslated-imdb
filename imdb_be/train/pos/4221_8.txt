I loved this episode, but it seems to me to be some sort of quick reference to the Secretary of receiving punishment for the actual accessory after the fact. Although I like when Columbia episode has an unpredictable twist, like this one, the resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode, along with the disclosure of the murderer. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is priceless. At one point, Gordon plays the famous writer, make some comments about how flattered famous Lieutenant Columbo, making a mocking allusion to the real life of a detective known as a crime-solver. This is one of the best of the many great contributions Colombo.
