Let me say first that this show was top tier when John Ritter was there. After his death, the show was a little drop, but producers did not appear on the show, adding, James Garner and David Spade once cast from 2003 to 2005. <br /> <br /> The show centers around the family Hennessy, Paul (John Ritter, peace be upon him), his wife Kate (saga), their daughter Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson), and their son Rory (Martin Spenzhers). If Ritter was on the show, I would squeal with laughter (and I am proud to admit it, I am), but now that he's gone, I'm just a little laugh sometimes with a hearty laugh. I am very glad that I fell into a trance of the show after the premature death of Ritter, because what he did with the EPS Ritter is much better. <br /> <br /> Ritter character just so well acted and well rounded, you can "t help but love him. He was always bossing around girls about dating, but he really wants to be happy. This is the ultimate dad hates other entertainment. <br /> <br /> Saga great as well, and it is also likeable character. After the death of Ritter, her character provides a good influence and power, not only for their children, but I think Saga formed life Quoc Davidson Spanjers, because she and Ritter have been friends for a long time. <br /> <br /> The funniest person on the show must be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. It is the ultimate blonde: beautiful, slow, stupid, but it is a clever man. She's off the wall with her innocent fun "blonde" humor, and how arrogant it. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson can get a little annoying, like Kerry, but it is the purpose of her character. The only drawback of this show is that the show never really gives Kerry's nothing to be happy about. She was always after Bridget and her character feels like it's just thrown in there. <br /> <br /> Martin Spenzhers as the lone son of Hennessy hysterical, and when Ritter on the show, it is mostly comic material. After the death of Ritter, the show did provide some storylines for Rory. <br /> <br /> David Spade and James Garner are not all nothing but laughter, sometimes with a side of history, C.J. et al, the nature of the recession. Garner plays the father of Kate as a little background information. <br /> <br /> In general, I give this show a great review, because it's a great show, it was a tragic event happen that crippled him. You will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 --spy
