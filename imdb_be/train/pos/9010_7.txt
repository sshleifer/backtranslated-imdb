A bit quirky and enclosing a bad taste; but smart enough to be worth watching. Wheelchair binding young woman Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) has teamed up with the reluctant teacher, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who dreams of manned flight. It builds the airplane in his garage and is going to fly. He wants to revive his troubled life, taking care of an independent, dying Jane, who suffers from a neurological disease, which has all but left her speechless and very small motor skills. Wheelchair and full of spirit, her last dying wish to lose their virginity. She offers herself to Richard, that will not help her directly but is ready to rob a bank to pay a gigolo to make a deal. I found this film is ambitious and with a sense of humor. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and likability.
