This short film that inspired quickly to be full length feature - Spatula Madness - a fun piece that argues against such cartoons bring several authors. Short film stars Edward spatula after dismissal from work, joins the fight against evil with a spoon. This premise allows some funny content near the beginning, but a little present for the remainder of the functions. 15 minutes operating time of the film absorb some odd-ball comedy and a little musical number. Unfortunately, not much else is beneath him. The plot, which is set really did not have time to show. But this, of course, implies that the story is better than in many big-budget Hollywood movies. This film is worth watching at least a few times. Take it for what it is, and do not expect a deep story.
