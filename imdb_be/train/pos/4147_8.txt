I do not think that this film is for everyone. But I saw him this weekend in Seattle, and I thought it was so funny. I have not laughed that hard in a movie for a long time. I thought that all the actors did a great job. You will be laughing from the first moment through the very last scene. I suspect that some viewers (especially those who take WAY too seriously) will be disabled by this brand of humor. Not me. The film was a real surprise. And the whole theater was rolling with laughter throughout the show, I went to that makes me think that a lot of people enjoying themselves and were happy to have a good time at the movies because of the change. I can not wait to see it again! If you are in the mood LOL, this is for you. Funny funny funny funny!
