I think this is a great option, I came here earlier to help me find which version should I use, and I went to see Jane Eyre in 1983 and read the comments from the comments and help me get this version. I do not regret choosing this release, and neither do you. I tried to watch all the different versions and none matched to it, there's nothing like a book, and believe me, when you read the book you want something that is in accordance with it. If you are looking for something real and move after you read this book is difficult, because you want something that is in accordance with it. I would say, God himself has led me to this version. This points to the true love for people. I would say that the love of God greater.if have anything better, I'd like to see it. but so far there is not like this!
