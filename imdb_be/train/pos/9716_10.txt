In order to enjoy the film in the best case, you should be) much in love (without marriage) b) recognize the English sense of humor, which is about admiring the gallant and witty life situations, not just work fun with) pretty much smarter, because the authors given the opportunity to laugh and cry at every moment of the film, and only when you meet the "b" and "c" requirement, you can learn and enjoy the entrance of the author. d) to fully enjoy the movie you have to love women like Kirsted Dunst, who is so naturally sweet and exciting. c) you have to admire the creativity, a bit melancholic people with large and prominent figures <br /> <br /> If you meet all these requirements, you are likely to appreciate this film is about 10 points. <br /> <br /> I've never laughed half (!) as well as from the view of this masterpiece. And I even had time to shout, laughing at some point (I always get sensitive when good things happen to Kirsten Dunst)
