This is a very interesting film, which follows the rehearsal process of production of Macbeth NY. Despite the fact that there is a lot to say about power, jealousy and ambition (the theme of Macbeth) in our modern world, the film works best if it does not take itself too seriously. Educational actors, such as John Glover, Gloria Reuben and David Lansbury do good jobs in the lead roles, but the highlight for me was the gay scene, where the "murder" of the Bank (John Elsen) is rehearsing. Perhaps a more interesting movie for those who participate in the theater, but he who loves Shakespeare, must enjoy this film.
