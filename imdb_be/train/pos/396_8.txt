Legend of Zu <br /> <br /> I remember the original Zu Warriors Tsui Hark did 18 years ago. During one Christmas, a rare week when Channel 4 in the UK, found a week Hong Kong films, Zu Warriors was so exciting for a very young audience, and his brother, and so memorable that it was etched in my memory it has now grown up to ... languages communication <br /> <br /> in fact, I think that the original Zu Warriors is one of the earliest films that I saw in my childhood that I can clearly remember the storyline and scenes from. And the memory of seeing his Yuen, Hung summit and another classic in their prime. <br /> <br /> So, when I saw the remake of Zu Warriors, there was a sense foreboding. Can it beat dreamy childhood memories I had the original, or it will move along the path of other remakes and die the death worse than thieves and their broken necks can be found in those kung fu movies? <br /> <br /> Well, the answer is I can not say. But that's because it really is not a remake. History (and style) is almost completely different. <br /> <br /> The Legend of Zu tells the story of the king of the sky, a lone warrior, whom his lord, Don, declares her love for him, but her life was taken from her monster called Insomnia. Two hundred years later, Insomnia returns to reincarnate Enigma Dawn Insomnia and returned to destroy Zu. At the same time, White and Red Eyebrows try, with the help of Sky King to stop Insomnia. <br /> <br /> The plot is not one full of twists and turns, but there was enough in it to keep me interested. But I can see this film, like the one that you love or hate. The film is very much about the special effects, with the majority of its multi-computer-generated environments, as well as The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two, this film was one that did not overdo the graphics, and it was tasteful. Nothing is rushed - unlike the hero. Backgrounds were in addition to the current and does not overpower the scene. <br /> <br /> The story also includes a plurality of symbols and interlacing of many individuals makes the film intriguing. It was possible, on the border of "too many cooks", but in general, each character had its role in history. But some of the roles seem to be "extended cameo", in my opinion, and I somehow I left some question about the necessity of this. <br /> <br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo plays a very central role in the movie, but I can not say that this film showed his best performances. Cecilia Cheung, seems, at least, aged in her actions, but it's still pretty raw. Kelly Lin was a new discovery for me. Despite the very short role, I apologize and admit staring! <br /> <br /> In general, I must say that really like this movie as much as I enjoyed the "original". Given that both films are made legendary Tsui Hark, the two films together is part of the chronicle that shows how to create a film in Hong Kong has changed over the past two decades. And the beauty of this one is the fact that you can not compare the two movies at all, as well as apples and pears apples pears. <br /> <br /> In the end, both thoroughly enjoyable film in its own right. And I return to the memories of watching the original again. <br /> <br /> The two to watch, but can not be compared.
