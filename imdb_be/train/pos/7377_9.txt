this film is almost impossible to describe. alternative name of "Do not look up," much more descriptive. Like most Japanese film history not as linear, as an American. The story revolves around a filmmaker who filmed the story of ww2 deserter. A lot of ghosts (?) Actress, who died (?) While filming a TV show back in the 60s. Director is the only one who saw this show. if you've seen Ringu (Hideo Nakata directed the same), and liked it, you'll like the ghost of an actress. I loved actress ghost much more than Ringu. really scary and disturbing film. 10!
