If the answer to this question is yes, then you should enjoy this great movie. I just saw him a couple of hours ago, here in Paris (where the film takes place), and I still feel great injury I got in the back of my eyes ... What a visual shock! I have never seen such a beautiful black and white photo and is a dramatic change in the way of doing animated films. I firmly believe that there will be before and after the "Renaissance", similar to what we saw with the Pixar movie or experience Akira and GhostInTheShell. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated films, and I hope that the French initiative (unknown small French studio with a few young people who have a dream called "Revival" ...) will get success and recognition he deserves. Vive La France!
