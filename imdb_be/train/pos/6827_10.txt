I spent 5:00 drenched in this film. Nothing I have never seen the sun come close to a delicious fright this film left me. Never against the extended aging women, the human fear of the dilemma in the jumps from the screen for viewing. Personally participated in the ninth degree, the film puts one of the undisputed common sense of our lives. I enjoyed this indulgence with raw bile wounded deep inside. This makes it possible to mutually co entire history of human conflicts that go much deeper into the pain, isolation and distorted views of themselves and others. As a result, only our lukewarm formation of the bridge from the muddy sediment of the dead we have to face. Birth in search of real people is a happy pursuit. The quest for realism is crossed with the dark earth of our bankrupt culture.
