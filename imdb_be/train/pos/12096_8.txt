I watched this movie several times and found it to be very good. This film is also known as "The Castle of fear", "Coffin Of Terror" and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele, it is usually pretty / awful self. George Riviere, Actor, does a good job with his role. The entire film is dripping with atmosphere, and there is a lot of tension throughout. Good camera angles and action, for the most part, it's not bad. This film is well suited for a rainy day or in the evening. I have a director's cut DVD, which is far superior to the edited TV version. Grab the popcorn, turn off the lights, sit back and enjoy. John R. Tracy
