often laugh out loud, sometimes sad story 2 working divorced men - Lemmon neurotic clean "house husband" and Matthau slut sports - who decide to live together to cut costs. <br /> <br /> Beautifully photographed and directed. The script is very scratchy - that is, there is always more than one side in almost every line. Particularly funny scene involves two British sisters (Evans and Shelley), who seem amused by all who speak, but if Lemmon busts his photographs of children and, yes, the ex-wife-to-be, he's got the girl wept with him to Matthau can show with the promised drinks! <br /> <br /> It is very interesting.
