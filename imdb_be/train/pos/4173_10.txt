A kind of road movie in the old-fashioned trains in late summer Slowenian province. In the beginning you see someone in underwear garment trousers of black cloth, and if the same young man in black pants to go out with two suitcases, you see that the trousers of the missing on the flag of mourning (appearently his father died) . On the train he meets a young woman, and almost without words, but a lot of small gestures, begins an amazing love story. It's like something surreal, very poetic and a bit strange, a film with a lot of amazing characters and strange incidents. Beautiful pictures with love to detail.
