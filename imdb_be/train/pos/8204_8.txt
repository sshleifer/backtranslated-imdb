Ambush was generally better than The Enforcer, in my opinion. He builds to be a great movie, but then I saw the villain (s) and was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ambush different from previous installments. The plot went to the other side in this film, like Dirty Harry does not take so many police approach at this time. We also do not see the villain (s) until later, which means less screen time for them, it is better for all of us. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood once again steals the show as the Dirty Harry, said enough Hingle was nice, as the main Jannings, is the new boss Harry. Dillman seemed to change their name of Captain Briggs here, anyway, it was not any different. Michael Curry well as Lieutenant Donnelly, Harry annoying boss. I personally enjoyed Kevin Major Howard as Hawkins, a young punk who has a vendetta against Harry. Elbert Popuell was very rich, as Horace, Harry's pal. Audrey J Nina was good as Ray Parkins known lesbian around the city. Jack Thibault was well matched as Kruger, pervert. Now for the really bad part. Sandra LCI, a longtime lover Eastwood was horrible as Jennifer miscast Spencer, a love interest in Harry. And Paul Drake was just terrible, Mick. <br /> <br /> The film would have been much better if not best writing and acting in some areas. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
