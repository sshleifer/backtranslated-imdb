I saw this movie on True Movies (which automatically made me skeptical), but in fact - it was good. Why? Not because of the surprising plot twists and fascinating dialogue (of which there are few), but because in fact, in spite of the fact that people say that I thought the film was accurate in this figure, teen, engaged pregnancy. <br /> <br /> This is not Dawson's Creek, they are not slender, cold witty characters that wind through sexuality with a slight knowledge. They are children, and they act like children. <br /> <br /> They are stupid, embarrassing and annoying to get confused about everything. Yes, it may be accidental, and they may just be bad actors, but I do not think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (if not trying to be cool) very believable performance, and I loved him for it. Patricia Arquette IS whiny and annoying, but she was pregnant, and after a teenager? The combination of these two is not quite lavender on the pillow. The plot was very predictable and, but what? I believed him, his stress and inability to cope - it brave, yet slightly misguided attempt to reconcile them. I think the characters are acted by someone else, it would be really annoying and unbelievable, but they were not. Surreality it reflects the situation they are in, that he was sitting in class and she walks on campus with your child. I was angry at her for it, I was angry at him for being such a baby and blamed her. I felt it all <br /> <br /> In the end, I loved it and will recommend it <br /> <br /> Watch the scene where Dermot Mulroney works from harmful counseling session. -. Performance career
