This film is an amazing Nonae-stop laugh riot, including all the usual ingredients of comedy Dawid Dhawan - clumsy hero, funny supporting characters, fictional doll for heroines, nasty villains, jokes, rocking soundtrack + choreography and a small dose of action, <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are both in the dual roles of police and crooks. The heroine of the Amitabh COP Ramya Krishnan and Ravina is opposite Govinda cop. Heroines are only blush-choked props, as usual. The speculators NO heroines. Paresh Rawa carries a criminal act in Daud forward (he played like Don KHOOBSURAT too). Asrani shines in a short role. He does RETAKE on his famous «Angrezon zamaane ki ki jailer" acts in Sholay <br /> <br /> Govinda is flawless, as usual. - as a joker, a good-natured cop Pyaare Mohan and as a swindler Chhote Miyaan. He imitates the style of Bihari Hindi speaking with hilarious results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, it pales in comparison. Still, AB excellent. Madhuri Dixit makes a cameo as himself in the song «Makhna». She dances like the wind. <br /> <br /> Music Wihan Shah is amazing. Check the "Kishi Disco Mein Jaayen», «Makhna» and the title track. <br /> <br /> Do not look for any LOGIC, because it's a comedy and the script has full usability. Just enjoy.
