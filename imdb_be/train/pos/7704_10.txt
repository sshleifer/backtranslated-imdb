Some elements of this film is dated, of course. All white men's crew, for example. And, like most of the Pre-Star Wars science fiction, he has a tendency to admire itself for too long. <br /> <br /> But, so far, none of the film never capture the flavor of the Golden Age of science fiction, as this one did, even down to the use of "electronic tonalities" to provide musical accompaniment. Robby the robot embodied robots Asimov, and was the inspiration for all that has been, from the C3PO data. <br /> <br /> storyline is, of course, Shakespeare's "The Tempest". Morbius is Prosper, and banished magician who finds his kingdom captured uninvited ... It was a film that is treated as an adult science fiction genre, perhaps the first.
