When it comes to the creation of the universe of George Lucas is the undisputed master of his last film Star Wars is very, very good (and more appropriately evaluated in comparison with the two previous films in the original saga). Recently seen Revenge of the Sith movie really puts this in perspective. The final battle is even more disappointing knowing that Anakin Skywalker was in the manipulative hands of the emperor. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter, considering the love he felt for Padme and the love that she felt for her children. In fact, while new films (especially the episode II) inferior to the original films, they are good for only one reason. They make old movies, it seems even better. <br /> <br /> Mark Hamill does an exceptional job in this film. He really brings change Hatch survived seem real. In all fairness, I believe that he was to become a great actor on the basis of these films, because he really does a great job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you may feel that he did the Raiders and Blade Runner between the final chapter of Star Wars, because he seems to have grown quite a bit. He adds comedy (obviously inspired by the Raiders) to the character that works brilliantly. In short, Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher has never been a really good actress, but it does a decent job and, of course, cross-country. Ian McDiarmid appears in this film and seeing Episode III, I can say with certainty that he is one of the most skilled villains ever. James Earl Jones still provides the voice for Vader, and he is still very, very good. <br /> <br /> In terms of the look of the movie it's pretty safe to say that the universe Star Wars looks better than any of the previous (two) film, but it was always Fort√© Lucas, so that in fact expected. The final battle over Endor very well done in terms of both general and tension effects wise. It was also a nice touch that Lucas decided three battles take place at the same time, it added to the overall strength of menopause. <br /> <br /> The only thing I feel is pulling down the film from an otherwise deserving 9 are the Ewoks. These little creatures are so annoying, they ruin almost every scene in which they are located. In addition, I believe that it will be a little Kiddy, when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows could defeat a squadron of attack aircraft with laser guns and powerful technique. <, Br /> <br /> Return of the Jedi in general a very good movie, but the fact that Markuand is less experienced director than Kershner does, that the overall feel of the film is less than brilliant. Also stupid decision by George Lucas to add to the universe makes the Ewoks, the film falls short of brilliance. <br /> <br /> 8/10
