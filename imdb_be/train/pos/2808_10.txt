This film is not sick, and does not oppress. It -is- sad because of AIDS in the early '90s -was- boring. But his real message is one of love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom were in the long term, loving relationship. Their devotion to each obviously immediately, and how devastating AIDS escalate and become the center of your life, you see the strength and commitment, which are really friendly. <br /> <br /> If Â«Silverlake Life" was originally released, I was deeply involved in the education of HIV / AIDS and health, volunteering as a counselor at the clinic HIV / AIDS. The film spoke to me like no other film of its day could AIDS, because Mark and Tom were real people living experiments themselves, which I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from first-hand experience of what it was like to look first AIDS erode bright, young, healthy man; Seeing this happened with Mark and Tom in the film was very much like to look my real friends to deteriorate. He touched me in such a way that, even after all these years, still amazes me.
