Family problems abound in real life, and that's what this film is about. Love can keep together by a member of the tests and trials, and that's what this film is about. One man, the pope, has the maturity and strength of mind, to support the family in the face of adversity. Children grow up, be all one, in a hard way to realize that no matter how old they are, or father, his father still loved their children and are willing to give them a pillow when they fall. All actors who show their characters made outstanding performances. Yes, I shed a few tears along the way, knowing I had such an experience, both as a young adult, and then as one of the parents. This is true of life is one that every young adult and a parent, it would be nice to see, although some of them do not realize until they, too, are not parents. A must see for anyone who cares about their families.
