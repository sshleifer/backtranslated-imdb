I grew up in Houston, and was nine when this movie came out. In the end, I do not remember anything about the film. But I remember feeling it caused from Jill's and a mechanical bull to hit song Johnny Lee «Lookin 'For Love», which still brings back memories of my childhood, when I hear it. <br /> <br /> However, a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult, and all I can say, I was stunned. Several films hit me harder. This film is as raw and real as you can get. From Uncle Bob's Ranch, a chemical plant in Texas City, Ballroom, Jill, and Bud and Sissy. Perhaps for this reason he does not have a broader appeal. But no matter how you feel about the country music (for example, I can not stand it, despite my roots Houston) Urban Cowboy unique piece of the American pie. For this reason, I love it!
