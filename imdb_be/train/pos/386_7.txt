visual artistry Tsui Hark is a quick look at it in this movie. Unfortunately, the terrible acting Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the urge to strangle her, watching it, it's so bad :) made it difficult to watch at times. <br /> <br /> This film is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I first saw it, my jaw dropped again, and I thought that I could not see anything even remotely like it, but that's how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of Chinese historical kungfu novel ! Without a doubt, this is one of the most promising Chinese historical kung fu epic ever made. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, Tsui Hark has not improved in the department of records and history and dialogue rather juvenile (his apparent obsession with stupid and overly long image of evil men did not help). To make it worse, this film is very strong cast. They decided to use the "hot" popular idols of Hong Kong as the main characters, but, unfortunately, as Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung totally unsuitable for historical kung fu drama, because they lack the grace and mystery that such characters as It is supposed to embody. Adam Cheng Siu-chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version is infinitely better. <br /> <br /> I want to someday Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark can join forces and create a film that has a visual artistry Tsui MTR, but with maturity and narrative poetry Zhang ...
