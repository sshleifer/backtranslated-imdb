The turning point in "Matador" comes about half through the movie, when Denis, inexperienced man from Denver, is sitting on the balcony of their hotel in Mexico City, enjoying the silence. Someone knocks on the door, and knowing that it was Julian, a paid assassin, he refuses to answer. But he did really? <br /> <br /> Richard Shepard, director of «The Matador», introduces us to the character of Julian Noble, which does not exhibit the qualities repaid. In fact, we have seen it in action, doing what he does best. If Julian meets Danny Camino Real in a bar in Mexico City, he spilled the beans and tells his new friend that he really does for a living. <br /> <br /> Denis, who came to sell their program for the Mexican company, but it seems to me that it competes with a local outfit that seems to be in front of for the contract. Denis naive person who submits the extraction of charisma and charm doled out by the smarter Julian. It is not until some time later, on a cold winter night, the killer appears in the door Denis asked his friend to return the favor and to accompany him on a trip to Tucson. It was at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan, acting against type, it makes a great contribution with his irreverent Julian Noble. Just watching him walk through the hotel lobby in his Speedo and boots gives a correct idea of ​​his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays a direct part of this amazing couple. Hope Davis is only a couple of scenes, leaving us to lament, why she did not stay longer. Philip Baker Hall puts emergence as a liaison between the Julian and his job. <br /> <br /> Richard Shepard manages the style of working with his own material. Musical accompaniment is crisp and Rolfe Kent Cinematography David Tattersall enhances all.
