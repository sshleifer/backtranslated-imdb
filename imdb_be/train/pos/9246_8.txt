One of the greatest mysteries of life, affected by the daily, so good girls so often more interested in the snatch and heels than the good guys. <br /> <br /> It's worse when the good guys even want to marry these girls, girls still prefer jerks and heels, even after the jumps and Heels showed his contempt, they have shown that they are simply interested in using the girls . <br /> <br /> Stu Erwin is a good guy who continues to be a good thing after lying and cheating, and even after losing the girl completely. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is a jerk, and it is perfect in the role, and the sad note of their fans. <, Br /> <br /> Jean Harlow comes across as a more coherent Mae West, even sounds like La West in some of her cynical dumping lines. <br /> <br /> more puzzling is the fact that many of the other characters, intended for the bad guys - I mean, hell, they are closed, so they should be. - so obviously a good man <br /> <br /> In fact, there are a lot of good people here, people who, in the fate of Mr. movie or a story, would growl and back-stabbing, but he goes out of his way to help someone else. <br /> <br /> So, perhaps, the story is quite formulaic, at least by modern standards, but in the end, the audience will be pleased to see. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have is that so many really good actors do not give credit. Once again, we can say, fiery "Thank you" to IMDb.com.
