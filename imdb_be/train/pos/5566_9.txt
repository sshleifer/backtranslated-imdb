This film is fun to watch, buckskin have much of a story (well, not the plot), but there are good jokes and situations that you will laugh. Storyline Cheech tries to be a good date, while Chong party with his cousin Cheech (they smoke grass, go to a music store, a massage parlor, a comedy club, and even to go to someone's home, they do not even know! Rated R
