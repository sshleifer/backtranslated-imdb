Given all the political views aside, Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor's "Gandhi, My Father" a good film that deftly explores the tangled-side-Gandhi family has, and the struggle of his eldest son Charilaus Gandhi with society, its larger-than-life father and most importantly the demons in his head. One draws a parallel with Gandhi the father of the nation and fights any son could be with their father <br /> <br /> To act well. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshay Khanna, strictly that add color to order spare and pathos in the heart of the painful story of Harilal, who mourns to be embraced only once, and escapes to the slightest touch of a finger. <br /> <br /> Feroz Khan's direction and production of fabric generous and attractive, however, the scenario could have been stronger. I saw the game a few years ago on a pirate DVD video type (he was named Mahatama against Gandhi, I think), and it was certainly more exciting. Although the movie background score and the father-son and mother-son moments just brilliant fun. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been great. This is borderline to it. It has a capacity large enough to be just a story differences between father and son or a Gandhi, or even both. somewhere lost the plot and if you expect the absolute embodiment of emotion, nothing comes to you. <br /> <br /> It compares well with other Gandhi. Of course, not a review of a film like Gandhi Kingsley, or as abstract as Hey Ram Kamal Hassan. The film is just about manages to find its footing; However, one is left wondering "what if ..." It should be an hour. 7.5 / 10
