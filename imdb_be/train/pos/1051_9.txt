It is a powerful documentary on domestic violence in Cameroon. The "sister" in the law are women lawyers and judges, who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands abuse their wives and one woman won a divorce, she desperately wanted by the Muslim Board. It's a pretty long time - about two hours - but fascinating both in terms of individual plaintiffs and defendants and lawyers who have successfully represented them in the halls of the court, under the chairmanship of women judges. It will leave you, so she left me a lot of questions about how it was this change. How and when the woman began to occupy positions of power in Cameroon? Ask a few cases are shown in this film had a significant impact on the treatment of women, as a rule, by their spouses? Whether the provision of the Muslim divorce court, contrary to the clearly expressed will of the husband, one time event? I'm not saying that the filmmakers could answer these questions. They have made this film two years ago, not yesterday. And they made the film deserves a wide audience.
