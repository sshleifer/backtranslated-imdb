Farrah Fawcett well in this powerful one thousand nine hundred eighty-six drama where she plays Marjorie, a woman who manages to escape the clutches of potential rapists. Well done Tara, because Golden Globe "Best Actress" candidate. <br /> <br /> If it rapist Joe (awful plays James Russo) comes to her home, which she shares with her two roommates (who convenient out!), Marjorie has to play along with the daunting demands of Joe. It makes for some disturbing and shocking images! <br /> <br /> If her roommates come home, they are surprised (to say the least) Marjorie actions, and great work on Alfre Woodard, who is desperately trying to convince Marjorie do the right thing, and lane atvaryts him to the police, makes the film even more nail-biting. <br /> <br /> I find Diana Scarwid very annoying, but when Joe finally admits that he had come there to kill them all, it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama really . <br /> <br /> as a whole, of course brilliantly thought out and well acted film, and I have watched it hundreds of times now! well done to all the participants.
