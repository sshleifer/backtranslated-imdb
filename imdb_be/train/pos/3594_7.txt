Michelle Rodriguez, this film was made, when I first saw her in the afterburner. You could say that it was a cruel woman. With this film, she not only proved his acting, but did not show any fear and tough as it should be in this film. It is more a bad girl, and that's what I like about her. This film is about a troubled girl who lives life as Tom and the boy to get in constant trouble with the family and school. If she gets interested in her teaching brother to be a boxer, she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her trainer to teach her brothers. Despite the fact that they do not think that it has the potential to show they are disproved. <br /> <br /> I think that this film was a bit slow in the finals, but were well done. This shows that people can do something, even if they do not think you have the potential. I recommend it to be seen.
