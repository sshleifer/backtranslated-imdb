This beautifully done simplistic film that explores the theme, and gives every viewer something else that they take from it. The premise is simple: an unnamed celebrity actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to investigate for an upcoming role, visit the shops and watching people. It takes a special interest in the cashier in "10 items or less" band (Paz Vega), which he is affectionate, strong and exciting presence. <br /> <br /> Both actors play off one another brilliantly and bring solid size of the character that is a character study. Not the usual study of nature; each represent worlds. Life cashier mired in harsh and disappointing "real world", while the actor is so entangled in his fantasy life, that he could not perform simple tasks, how to memorize phone numbers. He readily acknowledges that he puts on his face when he talking with people, and the whole point of the study of real people shows that he is not one of them <br /> <br /> But it is not only an actor, inspired by real people for their work;. we see the reverse process, as well as several characters recognized. "His" and make reference to the way he inspired them with his and roles in the movie. <br /> <br /> favorite song teller "Al Pasar La Barca," about how she refuses to hide behind the beauty and prefers instead to pay (ie to do honest work) for boats pass, could not have chosen better. He parallels with the character of Vega, the only store employees with any ambition, whether of the brain that is ready to work hard to succeed. (It's pretty aspiration for someone who looks like Paz Vega). This is an amazing little movie probably made on a shoestring. If you do not mind walking slowly and «Talky» approach, this film will entertain. Symbols excellent contrast and effective action makes it nice. A pleasant hour.
