Presenting Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) cute movie, but, in my opinion, it might be better. Judy Garland great as always, but some scenes in the film seem out of place, and the romance between her and Van Heflin is moving too quickly. <br /> <br /> I mean, one minute, he's ready to beat her butt, but the next minute he falls in love with her. I believe that this production, film montage, and the script (even if the picture was great, the scenery was good and the costumes were good as well) could be a bit better. A feeling that the production was too rushed. <br /> <br /> supporting cast was good as well, especially the little Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter Rosie's daughter. She is 11 years old, looks very cute, and it's a shame that it does not turn into a teenage comic actress. It is in this film is much better than in my previous films, like Warner Brothers at the end of 1930 (on Broadway Musketeers in 1938, with the exception, she is really good at that), when they tried to make it into a hybrid Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason . Overall, this film could have been better, but in the end, Judy is given her everything.
