The best of the series Zorro and one of my favorite series, period. This is sufficient time is set immediately after the birth of Mexico. The new nation is counting on the gold produced by this one city, to save solvent republic. However, the golden god, Don del Oro shaking the Indians and steal the gold for themselves. His Zorro and his group of people to rescue. Reed Hadley is winning Zorro and he cuts admirable figure, it reaches a good selection of trimmings (almost all of which were re-used in subsequent series Zorro and other series, as well) .The story is moving and it is not clear who is beautiful the real bad guy. There is a reason that I have seen is the most of any show I've seen, it's just a great adventure. The only thing I can compare it to is the Mark of Zorro with Tyrone Power or one of the other thugs period. Its super and highly recommended.
