A typical 90-comedy, sitcom similar to our modern day "My family." Thatcher to be the height of the majority of political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for everything that she can. "Bloody Thatcher», possibly in conjunction with most of us. David is a typical teenager, cutting brains with bread knives, by Jenny, Moody's eldest child, a teenager, is only interested in boys and more boys. Bill and Ben has been working as much as they can to keep your family afloat struggling in the economic climate in the early 90s. Assigned to the first two series were not as successful as the last, however, a series of 3 years, where it all kicks off with lots of laughter, that I care to count. in general, this show is not to get the best viewing times and they should be held on a little longer. it is clear that they could not be held in after Gary Olsen died, but I think they should get rid of «Catherine Tate», «Office», «Little Britain» and return to the classics!
