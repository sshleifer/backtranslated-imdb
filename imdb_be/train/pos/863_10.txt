I was fully involved in this film from the first to the last minute. He brilliantly shot, with lots of interesting and original perspectives and methods that are used. The plot is surrounded by a deaf woman who is determined to friends and colleagues, yes. She hired an assistant to work with her true intention was to find love. He's an ex-con, and she uses it to get back at those who hurt her. Instead it should help him with the robbery, which requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. The film goes into a dark film noir, with a pair of swashbuckling scenes, and even better ending. The real beauty of this film is how the director will take advantage of the lead character's disability. Using sound keeps voltage consistently, and dramatic shifts from quiet to noise keeps the blood pumping, that's for sure. Throw in a little black comedy and the erotic undertones of sexual repression you have the makings of a great film. This is the kind of film Hollywood really wants to do, but just can not.
