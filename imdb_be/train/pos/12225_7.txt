I saw this movie, and even if I would have known who the killer was originally I still love to watch. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on the Lifetime network film quite a lot. And I mean, since it's close they could play more to Halloween. So be on the look out for him, if you are interested in viewing it. I believe that Alicia Silverstone very well play a role. I really like her as an actress and person. She seems so nice and down to earth. Kevin Dillon, he performance was so so for me. I'm not trying to knock him or anything, but I believe that his brother Matt would be able to pull this stupid evil serial killer better person. Kevin just seems too sweet for me. But I think he did well.
