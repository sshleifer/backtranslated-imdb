Intelligent, wry and exciting, "invisible people" stood out in 2000 among the usual line of Sci-Fi, in balancing «Farscape» 's fantastic art direction, and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty, cynical plots and dialogue of contemporary film noir. Shaw sat between "Law & Order" and "Doctor Who" on the plausibility of the meter, but there was no doubt that the «I-Man» 's characters out of a cartoon. Even characters that bordered on predictability, as the Guardian, official and Ebert received a pardon from the template. Paul Ben-Victor and Ventresca was the chemistry that has developed and shifted elegantly, more characteristic of the revolving door the team of writers and directors. Effects never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and science only occasionally bordered on absolutely incredible. low point of the show is still interesting, and I have never seen such tight pilot episode. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi is to pay tribute, and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD edition of the show. Every time I run a marathon "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" on the Sci-Fi, I rolled my eyes and sighed, lamenting the excitement and opportunity of television science fiction that the "Invisible Man" and the like are presented.
