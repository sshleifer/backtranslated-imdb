I decided to watch this movie at the Tribeca, based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and found it to be one of the best films in the festival. Both leading actors provide a well-rounded tangible performance, which seems to correspond to the characters on a personal level. The director did a great job, which brings the characters and the story of life with a skill that is usually not seen in the production of the first time. <br /> <br /> One interesting aspect of this film is a love snuff and New York (Brooklyn in particular). The film revolves around a family business furniture and meanders thin cinema like carpentry and ordinary lives Brooklyn ?? Kudos again to the Director on the excellent choice. <br /> <br /> This is a gem, and I whole-heartedly recommend it (I'm sure it will make it to the screen).
