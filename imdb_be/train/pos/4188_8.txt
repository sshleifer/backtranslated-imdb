Samuel Fuller interesting director, mainly because it was very controversial politician in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" was represented by the hypocrisy and fainting America and «The Big Red One» was an effective portrait of the horrors of war "Merrils Marauders" painted war, if necessary, and hell, "the Pickup on South Street" about the dangers of communist spies. All his films makes for a very exciting show, and despite the fact that it is often classified as a B-movie director, fullerenes was as good as any major studio contractors. «Pickup on South Street" is not a 'it is an exception, and, despite the dated, Art eh strange film ahead of its time. It is also very fast paced, hard and sometimes brutal film noir. <br /> <br /> action across the board is fantastic. Widmark makes pretty sexy for a big anti-hero and Jean Peters as a girl who works for her boyfriend communist spy. The show stealer is Thlema Ritter however, is absolutely wonderful performance as a police informer. Corners Fuller totaled great that makes an action sequence ever more exciting and hard (it is very strong for its time). The camera is constantly moving around just like Tarantino and his school will do forty years later. «Pickup on South Street" is a big influence of changing noir thriller. «Shock Corridor» Fuller is my favorite movie, but it is a very close second. (8/10)
