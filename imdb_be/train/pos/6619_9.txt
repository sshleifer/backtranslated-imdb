Blade Runner (Deckard is a Replicant!) <br /> <br /> The City of Lost Children (supplemented feelings or whatever used and abused and basically, well, just give us much less than we could dream), and <br /> <br /> Dark City: <br /> <br /> They really should be added <br /> <br /> while now, I had expected the animated film, which may be affected. I just like Miyazaki stuff there. This one is the first. <br /> <br /> Uh, scratch the "animated" part of it. <br /> <br /> I have intense love-hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you do not leave, it should be mostly love, is not it? But, there is a lot of science fiction and noir themes are completely immersed in this movie, it's just amazing to watch. <br /> <br /> These people have done a fabulous job!
