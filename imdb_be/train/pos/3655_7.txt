De Sica becomes one of my favorite directors, but this one was a hit-and-miss for me. Grinning idiot youth become squatters community leader in a deserted area outside Milan. This is the detailed history and sparkling innocent poor masses, complete with evil capitalists and militant police force, but gradually it turns into a fairy tale fantasy as a child prodigy Toto develops the unlimited powers of a superhero. I've had it up to here with the ever-smiling Toto after 10 minutes, and when the magic has taken over, I was left in the dust. There were so many great shots organized, so many good characters among the settlers, I thought it was a waste of the film was not more serious with his material. The combination of neo-realism and fantasy out more experiment to "see something-we-can-and-forth-mom" than as a full-fledged part of the work / art.
