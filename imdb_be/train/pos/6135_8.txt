Bedknobs & broom is one of Disney's masterpieces. It was filmed sequences and animation actors and actresses who interact with the animation. (A similar concept was used in the Mary Poppins when children disappear and Mary pavement art.) I basically rated this film through the eyes of a child, because I had not seen for many years. Then it was one of my favorite movies. It was a magical and mystical, and the last stage (conflict since ghostly armor, who went into battle) were my favorites. It was also a lot of stop-animation to be used with spells (ie, people turn into a rabbit), which may be a little outdated and stupid now. (In addition, I believe that the film begins slowly.) Through the eyes of a child, it's a fun movie, and it's easy for kids to put themselves in the place of children in the film. This is a creative film, which is, unfortunately, largely forgotten today.
