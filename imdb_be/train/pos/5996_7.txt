Again and again, I said that if people do not want, remakes and sequels, they must stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent film. Having said that, though, the last time I saw the independent film should itself would have been easy to six months ago. So here is a review for indie that I have drawn attention to on Youtube; Treatment. <br /> <br /> Immediately, you can say that the film is on the way the film avant-garde who telegraphed to the use of extreme close-ups, scopophilia and quick editing. He is proud of what she looks like - and he has a right to be. For the most part, it is very beautiful drawn little piece except for one inexcusable contempt for the rule of 180 degrees and a comically poor fire-effect, which is a phenomenon that seems to be the hallmark of for self-funded projects. <br /> <br /> However, despite these amateurish mistakes most of the shots is really nice to look at. We are presented with a good use of props and locations, good visual action and some very atmospheric, editing fluid consisting of a higher score, as it is definitely something that you will not see very often at all of Youtube views. The plot is fragmented and, although the basic premise is fairly simple, some of them may find it difficult to follow exactly what is happening, but what we see here on the vanguard of speaking; You can not expect a simple three-act structure, and if you can not be prepared for this kind of film. <br /> <br /> If the film is unfortunately let down but sound. What you will hear in the course of a distorted voice-over, which often rings hollow, and even worse a continuous background music that passes through the minimum change, and does not add much to anything. So much attention is paid to the visual, the sound sounds openly forgotten, and it becomes really obvious when you realize that you've just missed about four proposals of the story and have to go back to pick up something that slipped past your attention. <, Br /> <br /> So, give it a watch, but do it with the sound off <br /> <br /> A final thought. was anyone else reminded cover for the Red Dwarf novel by Doug Naylor "Secret Man" at the beginning of the film? If you have a book you know what I mean.
