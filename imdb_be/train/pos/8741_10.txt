"A Bug's Life" as a favorite candy bar - it is full of great little pieces that add to something really delicious <br /> <br /> The story might not be the best ;. This is reasonable, has a "heart" (emotion), and each character has a pleasant "arc" (growth or changes). For comparison, only the characters in "Toy Story", to be "arc" are Gul, who learns to love to be a toy, Woody, who overcomes his dissatisfaction with Buzz. There are tons of laughter and cute moments in "A Bug's Life." All of the actors in turn, a great voice work and animation, and motion and detail is excellent. <br /> <br /> this serious movie buff do not throw around "10" th easy, but this film certainly deserves "10" I have given it.
