Before Cujo was the Devil Lucky Dog. In 1978, on Halloween the movie "The Devil Dog Dog Hell" on the night of the premiere. Family History Getting a new puppy (from a farmer who just happens to be next door to sell fruits and vegetables), because their dog Skipper was killed.Coencidence? Everyone loves a new dog, but there is something strange about it. <br /> <br /> It is not long before Father Mike Barry (tilt, First Blood) begins notice.H wife Betty (Mimi Yvette, where boys, Jackson County Jail, Snowbeast) are different and his children, Charlie and Bonnie ( Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, maids and professor, Hi Larry, Tuff-Turf) also changed. Do you have a dog that has something to do with it? He decided to find out and do everything possible to save his family. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it has Ike and Kim plays the dark side of ourselves than what we've seen on these mountain witch movie. This is one of many 70's made for television horror movie that was really scary for a horror film made for television. The music was terrible and even the ending, which I will not speak made you think. <br /> <br /> This film also stars Kercheval (Cliff Barnes Dallas) and RG Armstrong (who could not stay away from the devil remember films "Race with the DevilÂ»?) <br /> <br /> It is worth watching.
