I C & C fan, returning to his notes, and liked the film, but at some point in the mid-1980s on cable television in San Jose, California, he was shown with an alternate storyline, which destroyed the entire point of the film. All references to marijuana have been replaced by "diamonds". The bag, which is "Red" drops to Chong diamonds in it instead of the marijuana, but the conversation still remains the same ( "... it is worth ~ $ 3000 / lb"). There is also a story in which clips of aliens on C & C surveillance ship were added, and talk to each other about getting diamonds. In the end, instead of a "space of coke," is something else. I do not know who created this version, but it was horrible, and it is obvious that they were trying to make it a family / children. It would be better if the network does not broadcast at all.
