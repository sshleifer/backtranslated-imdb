La This is me la Luna (Moon and Chest) describes the life of a boy of 9-10 years old by the name of Aunt, who is obsessed with breasts growing in Catalonia. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very man, like all the characters in the Bigas Luna film (also director of ham, ham). Tete reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be in this age. Also from Catalonia (northeast Spain), he brought a lot of memories in my mind. This film shows how beautiful Catalunya there are good people, a good life, and especially a lot of, not busy people.
