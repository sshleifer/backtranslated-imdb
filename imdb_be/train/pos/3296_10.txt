Meena Kumari has more style and elegance just a transition from standing to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies. The director has produced more than memorable scenes touching beauty than seemingly possible. Music and Dance highest quality. You may notice the director has all kinds of things that happen in the background in the first dance scene: another girl dances drunk who falls down the stairs, a lot of activity, but he knew that we would look Mina dance, and I do not I will bet if you look through it many times, you do not just notice.All, perfection.JQ
