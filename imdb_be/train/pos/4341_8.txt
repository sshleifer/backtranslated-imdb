Who has no unresolved issues with your parents? And parents have no outstanding issues with each other? <br /> <br /> I know it sounds hard. But it is played for laughs in the film as a comedy doing better and better drama. I always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a bit concerned that their star quality may be too large for a small film, I was fascinated with the first scene. <br /> <br /> Especially interesting was the discovery that the son is doing about his father, as a man. And Peter Falk's monologue about the hard-working, sacrificing father and a husband was a perfect balancing point. Without this scene acted so well that the film would have seemed much less nuanced, and character is much less interesting. <br /> <br /> Well done, Paul, and Peter!
