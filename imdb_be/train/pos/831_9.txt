I saw this film while he was under the limited edition, mostly for the novelty to see Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out that one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. It begins almost like a thriller, but steadily progressing in a cheerful piece of work, full of witty and great comedic energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. In addition, while I say that this film is a comedy, he does not forget that is the heart sometimes can be very moving when you need it. When I entered the theater, I do not know what to expect so much more than a mustache, but the fact that I was one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Leaving the theater, I felt very fulfilled from the movie and I plan to see him again in wide distribution. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well-written script and a large mustache.
