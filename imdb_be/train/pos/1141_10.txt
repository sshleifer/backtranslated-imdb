Anyone who does not laugh all through the film was embalmed. I watched it at least twenty times, and I still get tears in my eyes of many scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as CELEST Talbert, fading soap star, whose supporting cast is trying to get her to replace, in the hope that their own star rise. Fields, 45, until now, that wonderful and beautiful elf quality and perfect figure, which is contrary to its having three children. I'm addicted, I'm in love with her. <br /> <br /> cast of "Big foam" is filled with stars, who perform their duties to perfection. Kevin Kline is flawless, like Robert Downey Jr., ing√©nue Elisabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of his earliest roles, Carrie Fisher as hypersexuality casting director, actor who plays a small part as a waiter without his shirt on. Naji beautiful as unlucky costume, and best of all, Cathy Moriarty, as a nurse Nan, who leads a plot to get the character field is removed from the show hilarious. <br /> <br /> This film should have won the Oscar for best comedy, best leading lady in a comedy, best comedy leading man in many other records, including the letters, directing and supporting actor and actress. Get the DVD, so you can watch it over and over again for the next twenty five years. You'll still laugh at him when the disc wears out.
