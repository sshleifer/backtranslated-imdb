I looked Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10. It was right after the Bay City Rollers. I saw that he had come on a family channel one day, and recorded on my then three-year old daughter. I forgot all the things that I loved in my childhood, the magic flute, zoom broom makeup. <br /> <br /> Witcheepoo in this show is clearly low technology. The mayor is certainly precedent Mayor McCheese, and all this being stuffed with annoying Googly eyes. But the kids love this stuff. They are way, way, and see a guy running a puppy than sit in front of a high-tech computer animation. There is a (soft) farce, but not adult themes, such as sex or people do not die, and the children take Jimmy scheme. Children think that would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone that their house was on fire, and I loved how every time my daughter saw a stream in the sky, she thought, Witchypoo flew over his head. Music is old, but you do get used to it, and my daughter loved it. She used to sing "another difficult, different lonely" in the car. My daughter watched the show at least once a day for 5 months, and this is one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I can see that the new Pufnstuf 2000 is in the works. I really hope that they are trying to save an old taste and do something as a computer-animated characters, etc. I think that the new generation will love Pufnstuf do.
