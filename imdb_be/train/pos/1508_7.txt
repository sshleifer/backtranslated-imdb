This film is good for what it is, and unpretentious; I would not watch it twice, but I Completist Cushing, and that's why I watched it. The best asset of this film: the brevity and efficiency. Compared with other similar films, he does not pull her legs forever, as each of the four (plus one) segment lasts 30 minutes, with the last at 10. Good vibes terrible. In the first segment, the horror writer is suffering from "writer's block" moves into a secluded old house looking for inspiration. He is even too much, when he starts to visualize one of his fictional madmen. The site plan is similar to premature graves. Proper use of twist the point of view: the writer becomes mentally ill ... or (as the show ends) his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with phobias husband take it wisely and protect their possessions .. .yet will intrigue prostitute to survive, to enjoy the fruits of his brilliant plan? <br /> <br /> in the second segment, two long-lost friends gather together in one secluded old house, but did not seem to help to visit the quaint horror museum, a wax statue of the long lost love of his youth, which were once separated them. From Gothic Museum goalie they know the woman portrayed is dead with an ax wielding murderer ... or is she? <br /> <br /> The third segment was less interesting for me. <br /> <br /> fourth shows actor horror -Who thinks he is the best of all-sunken to the depths of low-budget films C. Look for a suit to give more credibility to his fictional vampire, he gets the real deal. This segment also lacks the solidity of the first two. <br /> <br /> duties fairly, with 2 primary segments that contribute most of it. Good film, taken with a grain of salt. Not the best Cushing nor Lee ... but worth watching.
