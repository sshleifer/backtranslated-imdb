it's really a pleasure for every lover of Bolan, some might think it's a little on top, and that it is only about Ringo and Mark's ego, but I think it's like any other concert video, except that it is for except Marc Bolan, not just a guy! I especially liked the music video for the revolution of children with Elton John and Ringo Starr. Only this clip is worth all the money, I can not believe that they did'not release this version of the single. The film is really great, especially for our dogs. Now, I was not alive during the 70s. but the Danes as a whole was completely shot out from what is happening around them. The media did not play or show some popular music then, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, they only played a bit with The Doors, the only really popular songs, though. Yes, I know from my father, that seeing it, gives him back some of his youth, he had never experienced. <br /> <br /> I will not do it for too long, so ... If you're a little supporter of Marc Bolan, you should see this. You might find it boring or as mentioned earlier, a little above. But at least you've seen one of the best musicians ever, in action! <br /> <br /> The only thing that bother me a bit, is that the ride swan entirely on the tape. but I forgive him, because Jeepster and Get It On so wonderfully played.
