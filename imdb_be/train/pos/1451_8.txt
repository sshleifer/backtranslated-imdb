I saw this film about 6 times now. And every time I view it, I'm more impressed with the history and acting. It's like watching a train wreck while on the move. Its subtle in its approach, but is very effective in achieving their goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> The plot is very good dichotomy. On the one hand we have the Deputy Major, of Eddy Calhoun (Cusack) unknowingly breaking the network of old boys that forms deer Major Authority of New York and on the other hand, we have a mob boss Zappati, who intentionally tries to maintain the status quo, all necessary means. This situation is well culminate in the end, when orders Zappati Alselmo, to make it easy on themselves, killing themselves and Calhoun Papas order to do the same, from a political point of view. <br /> <br /> The film also contains some really great acuity such as (personal weakness of mine): - you do not summarize a person's life in a moment - the only new in this world is the history you do not know, <br /> <br /> as a whole, a great movie that deserves a much higher rating.
