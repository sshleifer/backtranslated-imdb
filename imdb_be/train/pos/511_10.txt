I am the first to see this film almost 21 years ago, when he was responsible: (before the days of cable and satellite television) matinee. I was out of school with the mumps and I was completely wrapped in foil. I had bought it in the video for 10 years, and I want to get a DVD-copy. David Niven is my favorite actor is constantly and I think it's a mockery, that he was more than he looked so many times when Oscar came. I also think that the Queen should knight him as he easily did so much for the film industry, if not more, than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. as the film moves from black and white to color and back to well done and the film has such stellar actors, Roger Livesy, Marius Goering and the early appearance of Richard Attenborough.
