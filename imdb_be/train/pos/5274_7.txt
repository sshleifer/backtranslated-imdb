Yes, I loved this film when I was a kid. When I was growing up, I've seen this movie so many times that my dad to buy another copy of the VHS because the old worn out copy. <br /> <br /> -My family received a VHS copy of the film, when we acquired a new VHS system. First, my mom was not sure it was suitable film for 10 years, but because we just bought a new VHS system it has allowed me to watch. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is every little boys dream ?? The film contains superb setting, great muscled barbarian, half-naked beautiful women, big bad monster and joke you'll get only when you get older. So, a couple of days ago, I put a video and then watched a movie after a long time. Firstly, I was bored, and then began to think about how much I love this film when I was a child, and continued to stare. So, the experience was not as great as I remembered ?? Action is very bad, the plot is very bad jokes were not funny, but women were still pretty. Yes, I grew up. Even though the movie experience has changed for me, I still think it's worth 7 star. For the good old days, you know ??
