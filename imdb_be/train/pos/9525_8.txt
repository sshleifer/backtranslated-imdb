Road to Perdition can be summed up in a row, Thomas Newman. This is a memorable and beautiful, but you know that this music is similar to another work of Newman and listening to the soundtrack you are reminded of the smell of a woman, the meeting, Joe Black and The Shawshank Redemption, you are reminded of other films as the story unfolds on the screen. As Sullivans overtake America tries to escape from a psychotic killer do you think of Escape, Irish gangsters is Miller's Crossing while overtones of guilt and atonement can be summed Coppola Leone's gangster epic. Despite the presence of everything seen before feel it should not be taken as a severe criticism of the Sam Mendes film I repeat it memorable and beautiful, and the only drawback, which work against him is very slow opening twenty minutes, and I was a little embarrassed, as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be loyal. But if you stop to consider how much sentimental mess Spielberg could do with a story that revolves around a father and his twelve-year-old son works for your life, you can not think that the outstanding director Mendes <br /> <br /> Road to Perdition is a film in which all the actors give a perfect imagination. I've never been all that captured Tom Hanks, but it is as good here as he was in a lead role, is probably better. Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent, but in no sense, I believe that I was watching an American screen legend wearing a false accent - Newman's performance of works due to the thin body language, his character is torn by guilt, but Newman never milks it It comes from the top. Although never upstaging Newman, which gives the best performance in the film two shaving supporting actors Craig and the Law is also very memorable, as American gangsters and while the law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig can progress as a character actor, if he had decided not to become James Bond, a role which predicts the end of an acting career
