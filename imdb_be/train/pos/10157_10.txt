This is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by Johnny Cash (decorated in black, of course), who sings a lot and talks a little bit too. If you like Johnny Cash, this film is quite enjoyable. Also note the blonde a picture of Jesus in this work ... just for fun, try to think of five Jewish men with blond hair ...? Anyway, its a fun representation of the greatest and most important story of all.
