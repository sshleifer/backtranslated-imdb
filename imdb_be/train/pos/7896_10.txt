This is an excellent example of early Bette Davis talent. Production above average to 1936 timeframe. I can not understand why the owners of the rights to the film have not put it on DVD. Owners, please, please release him. I would buy it immediately. I have not seen him in more than thirty years, on television, but I remember it well.
