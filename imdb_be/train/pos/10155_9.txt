I just can not understand the negative comments about this movie. Yes, this is a typical boy meets girl romance, but it is done with so much talent and polish that the time just flies by. Henstridge (talk about winning the lottery of the gene pool!) As the magnetic and attractive as ever (who said that the golden age of cinema is dead?) And Vartan holds its own. <br /> <br /> There is a simmering chemistry between the two leads; film most alive when they share the stage - a lot! This is done so well that you find yourself ordering them to come together ... <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to negative comments - if you're feeling a little blue, watch this movie, you will feel much better. If you are already happy, then you will be euphoria <br /> <br /> (PS: I'm 33, Male, from the UK and a hopeless romantic is still looking for his princess ...).
