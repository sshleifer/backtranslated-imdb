Of course, the original is better, but it's not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it consists of 3 stories, but hey, so what? I thought it was pretty good to be honest. I really liked how Anastasia has changed a little, when she fell in love, it shows what love can do. History was not so bad. <br /> <br /> I also liked Cinderella's voice better than this. I have nothing against her voice in the original, but I just think it sounds better here, the better. I also loved her personality in it, it was more of the spine, but it was still kind of <br /> <br /> So I'll give Cinderella II :. Dreams Come True 7/10.
