My rating 10/10 just for the fun factor and assumes that you have decided that you like "Slaughter HighÂ» even before watching it. Yes, this is a typical place for several years-after-a-dirty-trick of history, but how can you not like some of the things they imply here? I could not imagine that the bath scene in a million years. <br /> <br /> OK, so maybe we could be cynical and say that this film does not offer anything new. Well, it does not apply. This kind of film that the characters in "The Scream" is probably observed, and this contributed to their rules on how to survive a horror movie. After all, who does not like to see people suffer for doing these things? It is obvious that he has a kind of a reaction in a half whisper, as people are punished for having defended in 60 years. But still, you have to love this stuff! So, with apologies to Don McLean, the jester sang for the king and queen!
