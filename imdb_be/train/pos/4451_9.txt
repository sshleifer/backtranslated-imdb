The premise of the story is simple: an old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a young child, and tries to convince the police that there was a murder. Although very little dialogue provided throughout the film, the visual story, narrated by the eye camera alone I made the film very interesting. Installation of gray forest conveys a feeling of loneliness, which complements the silent characters themselves. We can also feel helpless in the inability to convince the old police of the murder, which parallels the inability silencer child to tell their own story. <br /> <br /> True terror is a sense of hopelessness, helplessness, and irrationality, this film successfully addresses these elements visuals alone, but do not rely on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror movies use if the story is weak. <br /> <br /> Cleverly, the story unfolds at a slow pace to create tension within a few creepy and strange moments. The ending is as unexpected and plausible. Reminiscent of Japanese horror films such as «The Ring» and «Dark Water», or the British horror films such as the "Lady in Black" and "Innocent," the film gives viewers experience the true atmosphere of terror. I recommend to those who love a good fright chilling to the bone, to give this film a try. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you have not seen the movies that I just mentioned above, you can give them a try, too.
