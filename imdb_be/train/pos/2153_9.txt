This film was charming. Accountant wants more out of life than the approved conventional success. What makes it work so well, and makes it so different from the standard dance film is that it is not really about becoming a «Great» it's just about finding a way to express your personality. Great triumph in the end, it did not win the competition, not the discovery of an entirely new style of life, but the simple joy of doing what you want to do other parts of your life. No one shows their passion, they find their soul tranquil. <br /> <br /> Japanese background makes a subtle oppression and "secret life" ballroom dancing and clear and personal. We can all see ourselves in the layman.
