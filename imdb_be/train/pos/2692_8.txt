In the film, this is what leads to obcession a young boy who is suddenly in front of all his mother's milk to the newly-born son. Thus, he begins to try to find the breast, which is able to feed him. He believes that a woman recently arrived, and from here on film all around it. <br /> <br /> This film lives much on imagery, more than the story itself, espectator captures certain moments (the unforgettable moments) and some of the characters (the film deserves thourough analyzes on almost everything that happens because it usually means that then ...). Neighborhood scenery, typical of the region, as well as the behavior of surreal characters, and symbolic, and excellent mixed soundtrack Nicola Piovani takes us to another dimension, rather than parallel to the real world, but which crosses it from time to time ... to live in this the world should watch this movie, although we can in the end, and the moments of tired and a bit sick with excessive obcession, which may have bred for ... <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist. .. 8/10
