It was a good movie with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved brother transformation and the consequences of a terrible disease on the family. Well-acted and well-aimed. If there are any flaws, then I must say that the story illustrates a typical suburban family and their difficulties again. What about all the people all the cultural? I would like to see a movie where all these cultures indicated - as in real life. Nevertheless, the film soared in terms of its values ​​and its understanding of how the disease can bring someone closer to his or her creator. Favorite movie, and it brought tears to my eyes
