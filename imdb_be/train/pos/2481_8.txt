I admit that I've only seen about three plays by Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and, of course, Hamlet), which I liked, I found another so-so (Macbeth), and Hamlet, I just found a masterpiece. I am pleased to inform you that this adaptation as well as an intense and dramatic game. The action is extremely strong (with a cast that features Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, how can you lose?) And change the time period (I think somewhere between 17 and 1800s) plays off nicely, as the characters move and they say their infamous line right from the script, that any fan of Shakespeare's play will receive from the chill. If you are in this popular drama, I urge you to watch this powerful 1996 adaptation of Shakespeare's supporter Kenneth Branagh.
