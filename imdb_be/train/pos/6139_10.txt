Great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson perfect, great songs, dances, with a special mention for "Portobello ballet" magnificent. As for the animation section, the match between the animals became a classic; climax with the attack of anchors is a scary and exciting. I recommend to see the restored version of 134 minutes, or at least 112 minutes of video. Here in Italy, we only have a version of 98 minutes, although the film was presented in its original release in the management of 117 minutes. If possible, watch the videotape and German: it was created 98 minutes of work, but it is not in every refers to the Second World War and all the scenes between the English and the German fascist invaders!
