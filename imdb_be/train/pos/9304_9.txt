This movie is great. Just. It is rare that you find a comedy with levels, and it is bloody good example of this. When I saw the movie first, as the credit rolled, a friend and I looked at each other and said ... you just catch that? For those who doubt, take a look at. See a comparison between Vic and the people at the club, the DNA! See a variety of characters, each of which is fighting for position, and if you do not see anything else, to see the connection between treatment and Vicky way through the film. It's all in your head Vic! The opening line of Vic world. The final scene takes place with the camera in Vicki's head, and inside, the whole world! Quotable carefully, excellent cartoon gangsters, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
