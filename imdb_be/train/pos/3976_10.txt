I just saw Pharmacological year on VH1, and I love it. I think it reflects very well the history of drug use, and most importantly it has a strong message ALL GENERATIONS. There Woodstock, there Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison's death, and there are many, many examples of drug use and addiction. It is fully covered and the time line of the evolution of drug use in America in good and bad ways. In my opinion, this film is well done, and I would like to congratulate its creators, because that is exactly what you need to play in a TV these days. I'm waiting for DVD release. You must see it !!! This film stunning-- BIG TIME!
