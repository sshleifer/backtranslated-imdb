You can survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the TV version was edited down a bit. Like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a family or a less adult who is willing to pay strangers. In Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as parents and Christina Applegate, Lisa Valco, daughter. Drew alone around the holidays because it does not have their own family, so that it delivers a family in the suburbs of Chicago for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Mays, who I remember best for the game Arthur Maude husband hired to play Duda grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth can be painful. Household Valcos collapsing but Drew situation. Drew rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprise visit. You can not buy what you wish for! Actions and writing mediocre, but the first roll rate pulls it to the final scene.
