Whether it's three guys in their tighty-whiteys shaking up dude tied in twine or a girl say "What up, dog?" The Roadkill lump, there is something, please, all Knuckleface Jones. It's strange and surreal and not quite fully understood thread ... but it will never lose you. The first time I saw him, I almost laughed myself sick. And every night when I come home and watch it again. Remember Coyote Ugly ... is a film that has strengthened my crush on Piper Perabo. Watch it ... before it's too late!
