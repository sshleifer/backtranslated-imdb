During the war, Inc we find a logical continuation of the current outsourcing all activities related to the war we are currently doing in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you are familiar with the antics of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater abroad, you're halfway home to fully appreciating the satire of the latter part of Cusack. Cusack plays a corporate hit man named Mark Hauser, who finds himself in Turiquistan organization of trade shows in the newly liberated country, as well as its cover, waiting to get access to his latest goal. Despite the fact that he finds himself intrigued reporter anti-establishment plays Marisa Tomei and pursued over-sexualize pop star, played by Hilary Duff. We get to know the past Hauser, which includes the tragedy that haunted him since and corporate assistant named Marsha Dillon, who is actually running the whole operation for him (and played funny Joan Cusack). Although some moments played by the over the top, they are not always moments that you would expect, and the little touches often catch you off guard. All the principles of inclusion in solid performances. Duff accent comes and goes, but otherwise it does a very good job, and goes a long way to dispel her Disney image. Tomei funny but understated while at Cusack own almost every scene in which they are located. To be fair, they provide good material. Writers turn in a good script with enough twists and visual gags to keep you giggling all the way to a predictable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the end, the only thing that keeps me from rating it higher plot twists this way to the expected conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you like your comedy broad and physical, there probably is not enough here to keep you interested in the whole movie. On the other hand, if you like the sly comedy and broad satire, this is for you.
