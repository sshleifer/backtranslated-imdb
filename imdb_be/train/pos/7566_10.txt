The name of the young lady is Bonn (floor). She is attractive, apparently, lives a pretty decent life, but then inexplicably pulled from their homes and lives an evil dude and diverse evil henchmen. Now she does not have the slightest idea what the hell is going on, just a bunch of people armed-to-teeth, seems to want her death ... and she is going to die without even knowing why. <br /> <br /> Oh, I hear whining all the time. Now, when the content is so cheap to produce, and people can create their own movies / books / comics / internal organs, there is not going to be the one to ensure that there is a quality standard! We will drown in the shit! The only people who really think that people who have not watched any movie or read any books recently--, because we are already doing the dead man's float in the shit. They are people like Ferrari and Rodriguez, who put the falsity of these ignorant so-SOS, throwing $ 8K on the table and makes ... well, I'd say this is the best action movie than anything you have seen in theaters this year. .. but you have not seen any action flicks in the cinema this year. I saw the cashier. You avoid in droves. You would be better to catch a copy of this, carry entertaining twenty minutes, and get on with your life. <br /> <br /> It is very fun. You enter as Bonnie, with a lot of questions, and where it all ends is uncertain. All vanity was previously done several ways, but not in such a compressed amount of time and with such a concentrated tasty shootout. You are there an atmosphere of mystery and guns. That's right - it's all the filmmakers promise and they deliver <br /> <br /> It warms the black pit of my heart to think that it was done at such a budget .. We get a fair amount of elapsed indie films here, but rarely do we we see something as polished as it is short there, and we've never seen done in the genre of action, which looked so good. Hell, you could pass those two guys, MI: 3, and it can make me watch. Bond franchise. Hell, no. No, in fact, even better: I'd like to see what these guys are doing the function yourself and stay away from Hollywood. Whatever is out there killing the film industry, no doubt, infectious. <br /> <br /> The best indie we've seen in a while and most efficient map indie calling we've ever seen. On DVD for $ 20, and has the bonus features of a donkey. Go to the cinema ticket budget and put it up so instead.
