Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy star in this "modern" musical, which demonstrates the ability of comic Macdonald. Surreal 40s music seems to make fun of the 40's fashion, even if they were in the current fashion. Scary costumes and sets (yes B & W) add to the surreal, dreamlike quality of the film. A few good songs enliven the film, with "Twinkle in his eyes," the number of general lighting, including a fun Jitterbug number between McDonald and Binnie Barnes. In addition, the huge cast is Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Dambril Douglas and Anne Jeffreys. Also to be seen in the extended part of the discharge are Esther Dale, Almira Session, Grace Hale, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafael Ottiano ~ d, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others. <br /> <br /> A lot of fun and nice to see the beautiful MacDonald in her zhitterbag / vamp procedures. She could do it all.
