The first and only time I saw a woman in black, I think this is the only time, to my knowledge, has appeared on television in 1989, it was Christmas Eve, and my father and I watched it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight in the village church. I was very young at the time, but I do not know who was more than scared to walk on the churchyard to the entrance to the church that night I or my father!. <br /> <br /> There are many factors about this film that makes it so badly, but I think 0ne of them is the fact that there is not much in the way of the audio track that plays on background of almost every Hollywood movie, so that every creak, thump and explosion is more enhanced in your head because there is no distraction. Another factor that distinguishes it from other ghost stories are no factors jumps involved like things that jump to the toilet, so it makes it not necessarily what you see, but what you hear and what you think is happening. This smart environment as nothing scares you more than your own mind runs riot to think around a corner or behind a door! <br /> <br /> The magnificent story about ghosts, I've never seen anything that could match it and re-scaling all will be again and again on TV, I can not believe the BBC removed it once ( as far as I know) only one show!
