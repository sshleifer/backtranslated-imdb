Van Bianlian old street performer, who is known as "The King of Masks" for his mastery of the art of Sichuan changes. Liang is a famous opera singers Sichuan art and respects the van as an artist and as a person. Liang is concerned that his expensive art should not die with the van, so he sows the seed in the mind of the heir to Van. The film is about prejudice, male domination, state of the art, jewels, and most importantly warm. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this film enough. The entire movie in a loop. Everything has a meaning. Its long history that has been edited so that the length of the film is only 91 minutes. The overall satisfaction. Within five minutes, it's a feature film, in the next five minutes ITS boring film, in the next five minutes Its a thriller. He just keeps changing his mood, his character changes its appearance. The last scene on the rope phenomenal. History and the script is flawless. The actors are great. The two protagonists artists you can say they are carried out. Very impressive. He was not even nominated for an Oscar. That year, "The English Patient" won the best film Oscar in the category of foreign film "Kolya" won. "Nick" was just OK, and the "The English Patient", the less said, the better. Careful 9/10.
