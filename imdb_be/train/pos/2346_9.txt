Very sweet pilot. Show smells the best films of Tim Burton's Edward ... Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Cinematography, storytelling, music, external sets all scream Tim Burton. There must be a connection, or a strong influence, I just have not researched enough to know where he is. <br /> <br /> As I've seen on the forums, but Anna Friel plays a poor man Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see her on the screen, I see Huy. Do not get me wrong, Anna Friel does a great job. Her character is very sweet and attractive, and you can easily become attached to it. This is more of a distraction, I keep thinking, "Why do not they get Zooey Deschanel." <br /> <br /> Lee Pace is doing a great job, too. I'm trying to remember where I know him and just watched him. Wonderfalls !!! Excellent short-lived series since 2004. If you like Pushing Daisies, you should go to rent Wonderfalls, which is another creation of Bryan Fuller ??. Hmmm <br /> <br /> I loved to see Swoosie Kurtz (The World According to the GARP) and Ellen Greene (Little Shop of horrors) again. Two underrated actresses character who never make it to their performances.
