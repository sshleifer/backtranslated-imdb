An outstanding film 1943 Oscar Paul Lucas gives a calibrated work as the head of their family by bringing them back to America from Europe as the Nazi threat deepens. <br /> <br /> The usual stunning Bette Davis maintains its reputation here and the change was not nominated for Best Actress in this or any film 1943. <br /> <br /> Encounting treachery around them, Lukas successfully cope with the situation . He knows that he must return to Europe for a clandestine mission and return it does. <br /> <br /> Davis again pulls out all the stops with Katharine Hepburn-like shedding tears when they have to leave. Resolute, she knows that her eldest son should follow him on his way to freedom. <br /> <br /> excellent film highlighting the positive American propaganda against the evil enemy.
