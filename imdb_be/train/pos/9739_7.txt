I had the pleasure to watch this movie, mostly because of Simon Pegg, who quickly became a solid cash Draws comedy films. <br /> <br /> He was hired with his dead-end of London publishing work in the long shot of New York media mogul Jeff Bridges as a writer, for one of his famous rags. <br /> <br /> After paying him proper, he does it in the upper echelons of celebrity letters hackdom (hereinafter "number seven"), where it gets to be himself in a minor celebrity. The storyline is very funny and Gillian takes impressing an auxiliary role as unrelenting advertising agent. <br /> <br /> On the way to success, he finds the true meaning of love, etc. <br /> <br /> formulaic plot aside, the film was very funny, mostly because of Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges, and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was good as the love interest. The rest of the supporting cast did a good job. <br /> <br /> It was a good comedy, and is well worth a check out in theaters.
