Big British indie film! Fantastic chemistry between the three main characters make for some fun drug nourish many parts that Chichi and Chong would be proud of. Great to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (even if it is unloaded hand, since Quadrophenia!) Harry Stretch surprisingly good and fun for the ladies! I loved the final fight with his nod Zulu, and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set himself on fire on top of the Pops! ... it does not work .... he's really conscientious British hippies !!! You do not have to be a biker to enjoy it, and it's me right in the pub on Friday night after the repeated viewing of the collection. <br /> <br /> Give this film to go and you will not be disappointed.
