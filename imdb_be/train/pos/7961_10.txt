"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of those wonderful old movies about pets. It deserves a place among the great films of the genre, and even in the world of cinema as a whole, along with other animal films as "Old Yeller», «Napoleon», «Fluke» and «Air Bud». This means that it is more than just a film about a pet. <br /> <br /> Could this be a "remake"? It's too good to be a "remake"! I know that this is one of the heart, since my early teenage years (when I was 12). <br /> <br /> This is a family film treasure. This is an emotional, exciting, adventurous, exciting, interesting, humorous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, touching and sometimes dramatically. This is one of those films that put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of films. <br /> <br /> This film does not have enough quality. It has a well thought-out plot, nice character, lovely and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, gorgeous scenery / landscapes majestic mountains of Sierra (Oregon). Looking ahead, it is not all mountains: forest, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets ... In conclusion, all the miracle of pure nature - really full panorama. <br /> <br /> The main human characters are good, well-developed and well-displaying relevant actors. Robert Hayes is amazing how good-hearted father, Bob Seaver. Grayst well as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren equally well as hope. Kevin Chevaliya is common, as the young and cute brother Jamie (his appearance actually reminds me very much, Kevin Corcoran in "Old Yeller»). Benj Thall big as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> When it comes to our four-legged friends, my favorite shade. The shadow of the faithful, wise, mature, beautiful, caring and loving old Golden Retriever (brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche). Chance, the American bulldog, is the opposite of the shadow. He is carefree, silly, impatience, anxiety, awkward, funny and likes to play (voiced by the talented Michael J. Fox). Chance just can not stand still. Sassy is a presentation of the image of cats'S: elegant, independent, self-confident and very proud, with a typical ratio of the cat, but with a certain feline charm. Sassy is a seal point Himalayan cat is one of the most beautiful breeds of cats. Sassy is voiced by Sally Field, who also does a good job <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends, do big "actors" in nature :. Ben, like a shadow, Rattler as an opportunity and as a Tiki Sassy. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated film, but the classic his own right. Its sequel is clearly inferior. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be on the top 250.
