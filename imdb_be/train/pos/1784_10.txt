Evening entertaining movie with some detail. All the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances. With a huge cast, though, one waits for a stellar acting, but in this movie exceeded expectations. You can refer to the individual and the situation in one's own family. As one observes the interaction of family members of his family recollection immediately brought to mind. This is one of the few films that inspire one to read a book. Usually it is the other way around; one reads the book, and then want to see the movie. I will definitely get a copy of the book by Susan Minot and read it. Rhode Island scenery is spectacular, as the soundtrack. Any car buff would enjoy apparently able revived car period. It goes without saying, but I highly recommend the evening. Watch it you will enjoy it.
