I found myself in a mess, watching it. Altman touch to zoom in and out were there, and I was waiting for these devices to comment on characters and situations. Unfortunately, as far as I could see that they were sometimes free, sometimes witty, often fruitless to point to some ironic or other compound. In particular, the two zoom-outs of gilded dome in the savannah just do not understand.

In general, the scale was, well, inconsistent, and sometimes even banal. <br /> <br /> Another Almanesque devices, such as multiple pane of glass between the camera and the object turned out to assume sollipsism characters or narcissism or opaque state of knowledge.

And within a few leaves from Georgia to Chicago for part of (brunette?) Daryl Hannah, except, southern accents were convincing. <br /> <br /> exciting and the mood was spectacular, even if the story is not quite the rivet viewers. Moodiness to coastal hurricane barometric Mortise was exquisite, painstakingly rendered. - I felt like shouting at ceremonies to include a swamp cooler Pronto <br /> <br /> Torn, in the end, I judged him to 7. <br /> <br />
