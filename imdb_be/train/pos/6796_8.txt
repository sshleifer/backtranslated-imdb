Zodiac (2005) was an interesting film from German-born director Ulli Lommel. He directs, producer and co-star in this latest production. Not only that, he was able to make an interesting film on the cheap. But it reaches a new low, if Mr. Lommel running footage from almost all of its catalog of films. I saw the movie clips from The Boogeyman I and II, the War Birds, Holly Wolf, brain waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol makes a cameo because of serious courtesy of the film). Despite the fact that it uses a lot of the old staff, he works them a good (and very creative, I might add). <br /> <br /> The film is a young man who copies the original Zodiac. it is compared with the writer (Ulli Lommel), which was originally written about a serial killer in the late sixties and early seventies. Other writers (David Hess) helps him to try to find the copycat Zodiac. Could the killer be stopped? Will the writer has made two and two together and regain some of its old glory? David Hess still people? You have to find out for yourself and watch the Zodiac. <br /> <br /> This film is not about the original Zodiac. I also heard people complain about this film shot on video. And that. old-school style of artistic director overshadows the fact that it was shot on video. My only complaint is the use of more footage from the early films of Mr. Lommel (but I understand why the "wink" "wink".) Do not believe the hype. It's gritty and street-level horror film. As the reservation in the early states, this film does not glorify and not murder. You should like this statement. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for fans of Ulli Lommel.
