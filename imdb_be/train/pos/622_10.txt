Although I do not consider myself a big fan of the movie stories, Stardust intrigued me through to see Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was going to see it as a power Velma von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy, she is evil so convincingly here, as a witch, especially with its age-ugly make-up at the beginning and at the end! Robert De Niro is also great as a captain of a pirate, who is forced to hide "in the closet" to defend their "reputation"! Almost all the actors Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others do excellent work here. While the Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there are also wonderful people Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard), and Kate Magowan especially when we first met her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is excellent as a leading Tristan, and he looks so much like his father Dunst as a young man, I thought that was with him in the early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments comparing this princess bride, and while I can see some similarities, the main difference is that with the RV, you have always known that this is just a fictional story told by an old man with his grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that's what you see and hear may actually happen, even with all the fun that comes around. Thus, on that note, I highly recommend Stardust.
