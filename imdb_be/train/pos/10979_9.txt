This documentary tells the story of the great and small Eddie Beal, a mother and a daughter who lived in a hermitage in their family mansion in East Hampton, New York from the mid 50s to late 70s. By that time, the filmmakers find them, house collapses and women, one 78 and the other 56, share a shabby room. The older Eddie Beal is Aunt Jackie Kennedy Onassis and her younger first cousin. Women initially gathered evicted from the house because of its dilapidated state, but Jackie sent them money for repairs, so they can continue to live there. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, this film may seem exploitative, no matter how the woman seems to be in the best mental health, but also at other times, the film is hard to look away from. "Little" Eddie blames her mother for her present condition, and her mother fires back that Eddie will never be successful, it is thought. "Little" Eddie often seems trapped in the past, focused on the choice she made a few decades ago, and loves to show off pictures of her youth, where she clearly was a beautiful debutante. Her mother seems to be more resigned to her fate, to live the rest of his life in terrible conditions. There are some hints of the glamorous life of women as well as presenters from the photos that show a happy family, to a large portrait of a senior Eddie next to her bed. From what we see in the house, most of the rooms it is empty, the walls are cracking and falling apart, and the "little" Eddy leaves food in the attic in a raccoon for a holiday. And, of course, there are numerous cats running around. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is incredibly boring. Although no woman, it seems, especially depression of their lot in life, they live in squalor absolutely terrible. It is not particularly clear, if there is even the tap water in the house, and you get the impression that they are in fact abandoned by their families. <br /> <br /> However, as a documentary film a wonder to behold and highly recommended.
