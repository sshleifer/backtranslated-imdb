This film is not only about shooting school, in fact, it had never even seen. But this only adds to the power of this film. Its about the people and how they deal with the tragedy. I know that it has been shown that students who survived the Columbine shooting, and give a sense of closure for many of them. Action is excellent. All three main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) perfectly in their roles ... I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Its one of those movies that makes you talk about that after you see it. This provokes a discussion of not only the school shootings, but human emotions and reactions of all forms of tragedy. This tear Jerker but it's well worth it, and one I will watch again and again
