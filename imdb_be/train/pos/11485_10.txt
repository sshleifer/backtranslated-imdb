Zero-day leads you to think, even to rethink why the two boys / young people will do what they are - commit mutual suicide after killing their classmates. It captures what should be for an ingenious way of life for two people who have decided to withdraw from the common civilization to determine their own / common world through a combination of destruction. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect film, but given the fact that the money / time director and actors were - it's a great product. In terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicide / murderer is better than "Elephant" - in the sense of a film that gets under our "rationalistic" skin is much, much better film than most of what you are likely to see. <br /> <br /> An imperfect but honest with terrible honesty.
