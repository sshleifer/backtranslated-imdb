This crime thriller, it's kind of like a film noir, although changing the context of the post-war to a cold war, and there is something relatively decent to say about humanity. In "the Pickup on South Street", the police are good guys, the criminals are genuine guys, and only enemies "commies", which will ultimately differ from the good-guys is that they are emotionally personable, driven by a real concern for them own costs, as shown in the permanent monitored in close-ups that speckle the film. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the characters. Persons in this film is quite unique and detailed: Skip to pick a pocket, which is able to confuse any danger, and sometimes, going through their personal belongings; Nov. informant, who is just trying to save up for a spectacular funeral, but who managed to capture the hearts and respect of almost all the other characters (and the audience); Candy, the patient called innocent girl who only thinks she is doing the government's work and did not fully understand the plot it is involved with; and Joe, an ex-boyfriend Commie evil villain who is trying to hide everything from everyone, and, oddly enough, this is the worst person to do it. Throw in a heap very colorful minor characters (for example, a guy with chopsticks and police) and Â«Pickup on South Street" refers to you with the brilliance of individuals as they hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frame. <, Br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
