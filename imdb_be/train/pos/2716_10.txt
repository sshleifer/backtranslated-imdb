All I remember about that was great ... a great cast with Sam Waterston and George Inessa (before he became more familiar to US audiences) .... excellent scenario as only the English can do - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Campion mystery type, but with a twist of Jules Verne. Kind of like MacGyver would be it was in England 80 years ago ... at the beginning of the scientific / technical revolution of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> I've often wondered, when the creators of the show MacGyver seen. MacGyver first aired about 3 years. <br /> <br /> I have 1 episode of a significant deterioration of the tape.
