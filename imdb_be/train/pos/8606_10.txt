It turns out that there is no medium in this film! Most of them are in a dream, and, like most dreams, it is often silly and illogical. It is also an excellent production with some great songs and great performances, especially our angel. <br /> <br /> Janet relaxing in suspecting abuse and various other faux pas at the reception dreams funny, and its Jitterbug with Binnie Barnes surprise and delight. At some point, she gets to sing an excerpt from Carmen, and then the final trio of Faust (holding the dog, for some strange reason), and then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> This is a surreal comedy - very interesting, if you can get into the groove.
