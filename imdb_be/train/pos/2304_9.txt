I thought that this movie was very well done. That occur in the mid-1950s, things looked up to me. He was well matched and believable. I usually do not care for this type of movie, because they simply do not have the depth, but I felt this film was plunged and the characters, and you can feel how they feel, you should know them and take care of it. It really took me in my youth, and let me remind about more innocent time. This film can be enjoyed by men and women, and all age groups. After the film was finished, I'd been part of the two. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is bound to be a classic. If you have not seen it, you should try to catch it when it is on television or rent it ...
