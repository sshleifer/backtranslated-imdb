I consider myself a bit of an expert on boxing movie and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling "Gentleman Jim" the best boxing film ever made. That is, the film Robert Wise / Paul Newman «Who-Up There Loves Me." This the film can be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" close number 2. <br /> <br /> film not only chronicles the growth of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing in a crucial moment of transition. at the end of the 1800s boxing departed from the rigid rules of boxing to the days of a "gentlemen's" days in a glove, Marquis rules Ap nsberi. And the sport moves away from the days when it was illegal spectacle and in the time of acceptance and respectability. <br /> <br /> «Gentleman Jim" is not a realistic look at these days. This romanticized and, yes, even a bit sentimental at times. But it is always so great. Errol Flynn perfect as "Gentleman" Jim, which is actually not a "gentleman" at all, but simply a fast talker from a working family. Alexis Smith is quite beautiful as an upper-class woman, with whom he has to do with a love / hate (in the end we all know that it is, of course, love that wins the match). <br /> <br /> At the end of the "Gentleman Jim" the great John Sullivan (L, whose famous line was not "I can lick any man in the world", of course ... romantic again) hands over his belt at Corbett. It truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made. realistic? Nope, but it's fine. Hey, if you want realism hours "Raging bull" instead. It is much more realistic boxing movie. but "Gentleman Jim" much more pleasure.
