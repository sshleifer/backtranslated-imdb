Preston Waters to the poor summer. In addition, his birthday is coming up, it does not look promising anything. <br /> <br /> First, he had to share his room with his brothers, who are going to do business. They can not do it in their rooms because they do not have enough space. Off birthday he receives only $ 6 tokens while others get $ 32, $ 35 and even $ 50 if one of his greeting comes early, it only receives a check for $ 11 <br /> <br / > Go to the bank, he learns that he needs $ 200, at least to start recording. Leaving the bank, bully steals a check. Chasing after a child nearly gets him run (certainly his bike gets destroyed) criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). Quigley just come from the bank and give the owner $ 1 million to give this guy tomorrow. Quigley begins to write a check for the damage, but only succeeds in writing his name in front of a police car circles the area. Fearing that he gives Preston a check, she tells him to give it to his father to finish. <br /> <br /> On the same evening, though, Preston tells his father that he does not want a new bike, he wants his own room back, even better his own house. His father limiting its room for the rest of the evening. Discouraged in his room Preston figure thing could be worse, he realizes that he forgot about the check, it is still in his shirt pocket. It's empty. <br /> <br /> Using the computer and after careful consideration, he does it for $ 1 million. The next day, he took with the owner when you try to cash it at the bank, who thinks that he is a man, he has to give $ 1 million and does. He did not even like a real man named Juice comes in a moment later. <br /> <br /> Currently, three must track down Preston. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Preston fun to buy all sorts of things including his own home and even going on a date with a lady disguised bank, which is actually FBI agent (who is trying to track down the bad guys 3 down). He does this person to the name of Mr. Mackintosh, which he works, and even planning a party for him on his birthday. <br /> <br /> But in the end all catch (the money runs out, the bad guys get it). <br /> <br /> generally pretty funny movie. Miguel Ferrer plays his role very well. If you liked it in another Breakdown, you'll love it here. He does all kinds of wicked crazy things. <br /> <br /> Rick Ducommun (busy with the boss of the ghost in the machine) plays excellent friendly driver in this film.
