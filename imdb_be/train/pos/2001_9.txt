I was lucky enough to see "Oliver!" In 1968, on the big movie screen in Boston when I was a teenager. Later, during the summer of 1969, I was glad to see that this film is still playing in the famous cinema in Leicester Square in London, after he won the Academy Award for best film of the last year. <br /> <br /> Th success of "Oliver!" both on stage and on the screen reminded me that not all the talent begins and ends on Broadway in Hollywood. This legendary story of Charles Dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, has been beautifully brought to the stage in London Lionel Bart UK. His charming music then became a hit in New York and around the world. A screen adaptation was made in England during the summer of 1967, and then released in 1968. A lot of music and the incredible numbers. The song "Who will buy?" Wanted hundreds of actors and British director really deserved Oscar put it all together a seamless manner. Some Canadian and American talent is also a part of this wonderful product, but basically it is a tribute to the skilful British studios like Shepperton. Good show! Other movie studios in Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, and Ealing Denham also gave the world a lot of movies to appreciate over the years.
