Eddie Murphy Delirious easily the funniest standing concert film I've ever seen. Most of the act, as a rule, have a lull at some point, but it is people. For 90 minutes there is one thing that is not funny side. Since Eddie does funny dead-on impression of Mr.T, laughing non-stop. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was done in 1983, and Eddie nothing nearly as funny is not done. it is incredible that the person who wrote it is phenomenally brilliant show, wrote a movie called Harlem night, which was not very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie, when you are there, please go back and do a concert film in the spirit of crazy. Believe me, your fans will love you for it. And I think you know that.
