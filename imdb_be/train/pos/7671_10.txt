Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs has done it again! <br /> <br /> Anton Mordrid been on Earth for 100 years, waiting for bondage, evil sorcerer, to come so he could kill him. Mordrid Kabal and is used to train together, both children Mordrid knows all the tricks in the Kaba. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit confusing as the beginning, but soon you will feel part of the action. I'm not giving away the ending, so go and see the doctor Mordrid! <br /> <br /> I found this film to be very pleasant, because it does not have a lot of violence, no sex scenes. The film focuses on the story, and that's what I like! I believe that the best films are the ones where time seems to be flying. This is because you are so engrossed in the film. Dr. Mordrid is fantasticly exciting movie! I give it a 20 out of 10. It is worth seeing! <br /> <br />
