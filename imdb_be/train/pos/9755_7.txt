The last time I saw the film I was about seven years old, so my opinion may be exhausted over time. While I enjoyed filming that switches between cartoons and live action. At that time, I was sad for blue camel and his sad life. In addition, I felt joy when, after Captain Contagious kidnapped heroine (or cowgirl princess toys) the tables were turned on him. Unfortunately, the producers decided not to pass this film on VHS, so all I in the twenty-year old memories. I am sure that if I once again saw the film, which I think is corny and juicy, but I really liked this movie at the time.
