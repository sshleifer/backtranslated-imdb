After tracking him down for six months, I finally found a copy, and it was not disappointing. <br /> <br /> I do not frustrating because I'm one of those die hard fans of SMAP, which should see all of your work and I finally got to see the so-called hot film Goro. But I could not believe that Goro was forced to make a film as such. In his polite I am now, I'm sure he cringes, he made this film. However, they found the perfect man for the embarrassment, uncomfortable and half depressed much of the time. <br /> <br /> Man, I still can not believe he made this film ... I had to cover my eyes, many did not believe that he actually made a film .... Hahaha .. .. <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I watched it. Thank God, he grew up ....
