I know that many people have a particular fondness for the Alistair Sim version of the story of Dickens, but for me it's 1984 version is the one to beat. My wife and I have a copy of this film on VHS, and we look together every Christmas Eve. I often say that we could watch it on Halloween, too, because it is very scary ghost story <br /> <br /> Scott -. Printed material, such as Scrooge - a tremor mean and nasty, making it the transformation of all the wonderful and moving. I think that there is to his work in Patton. Spirits of all effective, each of which is worse than in the past. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal shape of Christmas Spirit Coming shivers down your spine each year. And the fact that the supporting cast! David Warner, in particular, is in great shape, as Bob Cratchit, Suzanne York, as his wife. <br /> <br /> I seem to recall that this version sticks close to the original story than most - but I could be wrong, as it was a few years ago I read. Regardless of what this incredible Christmas classic.
