The first episode immediately gave a good impression of what to expect from the series! Secrets that are waiting to solve a lot of good drama! I love that they gradually reveal the stories concerning characters! Explaining simply stay excited! Of course, this show has some drawbacks! The first two series have a few characters who, for whatever reasons, are not in the third season! Many characters have a decent sent, but some of them simply do not exist! As Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe they will return in later episodes! But it's a little inconsistent! That being said «Lost» manages exciting each episode (especially the first two seasons)! This is a very hard thing to do! I noticed that in the third season focuses more on character development than the mystical aspects of the show! That's not bad! It even retains some episodes of getting bored! One of the elements that can be considered as the strength of the show different characters! You will love these characters! Good or bad! But in the end, I want to see some of the mysteries should be solved and get closure! Danger «Lost» getting canceled due to declining ratings next! And it will be devastating!
