I found the show really late at night, and gave it a try. This is a refreshing change from other types of things, these late at night, when you catch my drift. Its simplicity and sweetness values ​​of the heart helps to remind me of how friendships were as children. This is what I have given every time I find it (which happens very rarely, maybe I should really check lists! Haha) ..... and the tension between Joe and Nick are so cute. Like any good chick flick, you really emotionally involved in the signs. Good Alla "Louisa May Alcott also inspire good stories :) So, apparently, I have to finish the 10 lines of text to my opinion to be true, so I guess I'll tell you a little more. Children play talented actors and actresses, as well as the settings are beautiful and filled with nature - is one more thing you do not see a lot on television. I hope everyone gives him a chance. I understand, and I understand that it's juicy, but it's a good heart. As I have said, it is refreshing.
