This is a very good Spanish film, but I'm concerned that there will be many feel lost, because many in the world do not have the slightest idea that it was the Spanish Civil War is all about or where he fought. Being a history teacher, I had a big advantage, but I could easily see how a movie can be confusing until you piece together all the parts. I doubt that this will be a big problem in Spain, where the film was made, but also for other audiences, they can be a bit confused, until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a 12-year-old Carol and her mother returned to her mother's hometown. Years have passed, and you will gather, they come to Spain from New York. Despite the strangeness, Carol says is good enough Spanish and most of the film about how it adapts. And why she and her mother alone, I shed today for those who do not pick up on the fact that Carol's father is fighting in a war on the Republican side (who in the end lost in this very bloody conflict). <br /> <br /> movie gets an exclusive brand for its excellent camera work and music. Rather slow and chaotic rhythm is not bad if you get someone who can take movies that way. I have seen several other Spanish films about the war, and this comparison is very good for them - no better and no worse. - just a decent slice of life film about those who are left behind, as well as a good majority clicking <br /> <br /> PS - If you do not know which side is which, Republicans were mostly socialists, and they were supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico, as well as volunteers from many countries (including the US). Nationalists were led by Franco and helped Portugal and fascist governments of Germany and Italy.
