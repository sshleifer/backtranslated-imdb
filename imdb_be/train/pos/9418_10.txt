I had this movie on film for many years and started watching it again in the morning (while waiting for my clothes --- how ironic!), Mainly because I wanted to hear the name of Benjamin Frankel music again. I ended up sitting in about the first half hour, fascinated, as the wonderfully assured direction, writing and speeches. The film is like a who's who of 50s British star character: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and in particular, Ernest Tesayger, much as the dried shennye old giant of the textile mills. Not to mention, and Alec Guinness, Joan Greenwood, sun sign players as such, but charming, charismatic leads. This science fiction pure and funny comedy as well. All time classic, and I hope that no one is trying to remake it!
