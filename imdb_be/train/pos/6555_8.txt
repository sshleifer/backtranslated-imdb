I have read more than 100 books, Nancy Drew, and if you're not bright enough to catch on another Nancy Drew movie was with the younger Nancy Drew, not 18-year-old who did not go to school, that all books. It was when she was sixteen. So, naturally, she does not like about as smart as the one in the book given that it is only in the 10th grade. Also, I thought the film was very cute. It was clean and suitable for everyone. It was funny at times. I thought that Emma Roberts did a great job. It was clear, by its nature, and cute. I liked the unease that Nancy and Ned around each other, because they were obviously not old enough to be in a serious relationship, as they are in the books. It was nice, the PG film, which I thoroughly enjoyed, because I, unlike most people my age, enjoy movies without sex, drugs or profanity.
