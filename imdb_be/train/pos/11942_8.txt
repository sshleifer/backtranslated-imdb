At the funeral of the well-known British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends recall how stubborn he was while looking for a scoop. At the same time the deceased Joe discloses the identity of the Tarot serial killer in London. He's cheating the reaper, and appears to be an American journalism student Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on the scene in the middle of the magic show magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, and tells her that the killer aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra Sid pulls in its investigation, looking for evidence that Peter is the killer. However, she falls in love with him and questions, Joe Strombel right in his scoop. <br /> <br /> Â«scoop" is another great comedy Woody Allen outside of Manhattan, in fact, back in London. His ironic and witty lines are fantastic, and I laughed a lot with its inclusive fate of the hero in a country where people travel "in the other side." Sid Waterman very funny and Woody Allen in top form, as a comedian. However, his current muse Scarlett Johansson, of which I am a big fan of action and is extremely annoying in many moments, changing its focus on inclusive theatrical pronunciation. Her character is absolutely foolish and disorderly, and I was very disappointed with my performance (probably the first time in her filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still fun and worth of entertainment. . My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop ?? O Grande Wagon" ( "scoop ?? Great scoop")
