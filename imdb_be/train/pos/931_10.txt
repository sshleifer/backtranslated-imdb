Like all versions of the story, but this time it is my favorite time. George C.Scott gives depth of character Scrooge that others do not give. The film shows why he becomes so bitter. Changes in Scrooge appear gradually, when he is faced with a variety of ghosts and incidents that they show it. <br /> <br /> This film has the best Tiny Tim today. It is suitable age, and does not play someone almost a teenager, as well as in other films. Anthony Walters still has all or most of their baby teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner excellent as Bob Cratchit. He's such a versatile actor. It portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He plays the role with dignity, not as snotty man cowering under Scrooges'thumb, but as the man who gracefully put up with him because he has a family to provide. Susannah York and other actors do a great job of bringing the characters to life. Edward Woodward is the best Ghost Christmas present I've ever seen. Most often he is playing in a cheerful Landmark type Santa. In this he shows anger at Scrooges relationships and really makes Scrooge reconsider. <br /> <br /> costumes and sets really bring London to life Dickens' time. Great movie.
