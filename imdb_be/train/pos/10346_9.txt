That there were about 1939, which helped to produce so many great Hollywood movies? Well, whatever it was, the magic can be found in the Colombian film. This long forgotten screwball comedy that Turner Classic Movies began to show. (Maltin Movie book does not contain it.) Almost every department, Strange Mr. Williams gem. <br /> <br /> This is the story of police detective first course, which can never find the time to marry his appointed. As wedding bells are going to ring, he will be called to the murder scene. The lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals, but belong to the police. There are a lot of laughter in the process. <br /> <br /> Melvyn Douglas again proved that he had few equals in the light comedy. Joan Blondel was at the peak of his career, and it is a delight. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride cheerful. <br /> <br /> The film goes on a bit too long, but who cares? The screwball comedy is always able to entertain, and this film belongs right up there with the best.
