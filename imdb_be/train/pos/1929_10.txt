I recently had the pleasure of seeing the Big Bad Swim in Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival, and I must say that this is the best film I've seen all year, and the only movie that I've ever felt inspired to write a comment / review about. This film has been beautifully directed and combined scenarios with realistic dialogues, great acting and inspirational messages. Ordinary life come together in the classroom adults to swim and become extraordinary in the celebration of the diversity of life. It pointedly illustrated images in the first minute of this exciting film, where we see only the legs and torso of individuals in a variety of shapes and sizes come in a puddle of water. This film brilliantly directed both actors and is located in the magical scenes that keep your attention and imagination.
