I first heard of Tears of Kali a while ago, and it sounded like something I would be, but with all the films I have come on a regular basis, a kind of fell off the radar. While roaming around the local WonderBook ... I noticed a box for it and grabbed it. I must say I am very glad that I did. TEARS Kalita strange mountain, sometimes downright awful film, which to some extent limited to, obviously low budget. - but it is still interesting and useful for hours <br /> <br /> Tears Kalita center around a fictional India based on Taylor-Erikkson cult group that practices meditation and other rituals, in pursuit of the face and shooing " inner demons "of the individual - but apparently, these methods work either too good or not good enough (depending on your point of view, ...) as a dark force, not only kicked out, but unleashed on hapless victims. <br /> <br /> film told "almanac style", with a short, but memorable and "eye-opening" intro sequence, and then go to the three stories that make up the bulk of the film. <br /> <br /> First ( Shakti) is a journalist who visits one of the cult members, which is held in a psychiatric hospital. The journalist goes undercover to investigate the cult of wanting Taylor-Erikkson, but we see that her true motives can hit a little closer to home. If the interview takes fierce, the journalist believes that she may have got over her head ... <br /> <br /> The second section (Devi) refers to a violent young man who was sentenced to psychological rehabilitation instead of prison for beating a young man in a coma. We believe that the doctor in question is actually Taylor-Erikkson «graduates», and its method rehabilitation is far from the norm ... <br /> <br /> In the final story (Kali) revolves around faith "quack -healer» and his assistant, who performs "miracles" for a fee. If the doctor can not help helping one of their clients, and actually throws a force that has its possessing demon is now free to move and looking for a new host ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that I really enjoyed TEARS Kalita . There are some drawbacks to the film, that contain it by really cool - but it is an original and ambitious movie for what it is. My biggest gripe with the production is poor and uninspired over-dubbed dialogue. Dubbing subpar, and I would very much like to have the option of subtitles in the original language track. Some observers say the poor acting that I do not always agree with. I think that dubbing is so dim that makes the performances seem to be stunted, that is actually not the case. In fact, some of the plays pretty damn chilling ( "doctor" in the second segment, and the "client" in the third easily come to mind ...) and distinctive. Gore FX is very well done for a low-budget film and, with some graphic scenes of eyelid-removal-by-cuticle scissors, and, to some decent (but annoying "rocking") itself pencil-in-the-throat suicide -flaying, and a few other goodies, thrown in for good measure. Not as rough as some of the more "extreme" gore movies there, but certainly more than the average horror fare. I also found the story in relation to the cult group to be intriguing and a welcome change to the typical horror story is nonsense. There are many scenes of this atmosphere and tension, the like of which I have not seen in a while. Although the shortcomings in some basic ways, I still think that tears Kalita will appeal to the majority of "underground" horror audience - some scenes may be too much for the more mainstream audience. Specifically it recommended - 8.5 / 10
