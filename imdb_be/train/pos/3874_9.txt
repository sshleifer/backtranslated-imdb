And I absolutely love Isabelle Blais !!! She was so cute in this movie, and is very different from her role in "Quebec-Montreal", where it was more like a man-eater. I think she was nominated for a Jutra. I mean, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was significantly higher, IMO. Peltier has done an excellent job for his first time out, and I noticed that he snuck a couple of his buddies with rock-et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage and Andr√© Ducharme. It was interesting to see them in this, I do not know that they will appear. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've ever seen a romantic comedy from Quebec that I did not like, and this one is as good as any I have enjoyed watching. And if you're in the states, and wondering how you can get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca handed it to me in less than a week.
