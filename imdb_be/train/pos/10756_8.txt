Very interesting and moving documentary about the World Trade Center tragedy on September 11th 2001.The main theme of this is the heroism of American firemen who tried to save as many people as possible, as they could.The film deeply emotional and rather anxious and many people saw on the screen lost their lives! Recommend.
