That's what music genre was made. Humor, talent, romance, and action all rolled into one. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was excellent. Nothing else needs to be said. Marlon Brando, but not a singer, did a great job winning the hearts of many with his image Sky Masterson. The fact that he could not sing added to his character. The ladies in the film were in order, but the men in the film, of course, stole the show. <br /> <br /> This is a real classic, that can be appreciated at any age. It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Definitely the film will be watched and enjoyed!
