also this Christmas a special one that I remember very fondly for me. In 1989, I grabbed 2 CDs, which I found in the recording track, giving one to my sister and keep the other for yourself. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition, and I would like to be able to actually see the show again, and not just remember, I'm listening. <br /> <br /> This has been noted elsewhere that John Denver made a number of appearances on The Muppet Show, and they have done more than one special together. Good communication between Denver and his vague companions emerges clearly here, in a charming and funny show, which is good for all ages.
