Cassandra Peterson Elvira originally created in a television hostess night horror movies, and if the character was unexpectedly popular, she found herself doing everything from beer advertising in blemishes on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. It reached the peak of its popularity in the late 1980s, and the film ELVIRA, Mistress of the Dark was the result. <br /> <br /> The plot is light. TV horror hostess Elvira dream of success in Las Vegas. If her grandmother dies, she goes to New England in the hope that the estate to provide enough money to support a stage show; She was disappointed, she inherited a rundown house, a poodle, and an old book. It happens that the Puritan city beyond description, and it is fair indignation everywhere she goes. It also happens that her great-grandfather secretly evil sorcerer and very intent on laying hands on "an old book." Add a few teenagers, clove bun and hated women with and there is a bra with padding you go. <br /> <br /> No one will accuse him of being a cinematic masterpiece, and it is drag now and then. But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates great talent from the beginning to the end: naughty, sexy, mixing humor and animals with acute outbreaks of comedy, she dances through the film like a circus arena in the banal and often self-irony jokes. From Flashdance disaster witchcraft madness, it is never less than wildly exciting. This is a huge amount of fun, and the conclusion of the film even manages to generate significant uncertainty. Elvira will better her evil uncle and save the day? Well, I do not want to give anything away, so let's just say that you'll have to learn a lot of fun. Quality <br /> <br DVD /> in order, and there is little in the way of bonus material, but if you're in the mood for something stupid it is obligatory to respond to the desire. And if you've never seen Tassle-spit, you are in for a treat. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
