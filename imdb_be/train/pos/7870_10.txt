The film is a real show as indifferent and selfish upper society has become. She has a lot of character and each character, which is the other person category. The character is not 100% good and moral, as opposed to the typical heroes of all Indian films and no sign is not 100% bad, and all are just different. The film is very perfect combination of emotion, drama and entertainment. The very first time I liked the film, which picked up some social issues. I would recommend everyone to see the film. Madhavi Sharma, a journalist who covers the hip-shaking Bollywood party for Page 3 of the newspaper, but it is the story of how she became a criminal reporter for a newspaper. But this is not all, it shows how she could not survive there, and when she helped save a few innocent children brutally suppressed her voice. Even she is fired from his job. Then she could not find work, and crime reporter has to do Page 3 again. Not only her, but very, very large number of characters are intertwined in the film, and all giving different sensations while watching a movie. I would really congratulate the director for making such a big movie. Please do not afford to miss.
