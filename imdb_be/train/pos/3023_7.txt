This pleasant minor noir has an upper roll and a lot of memorable scenes. Big distraction is a complete disregard for these accents. Spanish characters in the film played by a Frenchman (Boyer), Belgian (Francen), Greek (Paxinou) and Hungarian (Lorre)! And top it all Bacall must be English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, all the performances are very good - especially Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene in which Boyer, Paxinou Lorre and to meet and talk with wildly different accents, is a real hoot! And I think, seeing as they were the ones that they actually had to speak Spanish anyway! It seems rather strange that Warner Brothers could not find Spanish actors, speaking in Los Angeles! Of course Hollywood has often been "some old accent will do" policy - my second favorite Greta Garbo (Swedish), Mata Hari (Dutch), who falls in love with a Russian soldier, played by Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Maybe they should have Novarro for "Confidential Agent" - it would be great in the role boji or at least Francen (which would be significantly saved on dark make-up the budget).
