In any number of films, you can find Nicolas Cage as the strong, silent hero, Dennis Hopper, like a maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle as vamp / tramp, and late, lamented J.T. Walsh, as heavy. These types of roles of these four can play in a dream, and they did it often enough that, to see how they play it again on the border of the stencil. What a relief, because John Dahl, the master for a lot of sentiment with small steps, directed this thin noirish thriller. Hopper manages to resist the transition at the top, Cage shows little more depth than its normally-surface action characters, Boyle alternately hot innocent and intrigue and one gets a feeling of hard iron heart that is central to its nature, Wayne. Dahl gives a sense of the direction of the country void Big Sky, where the story takes place at the same time be sufficiently intimate to show how wrinkled forehead may indicate a radical change of scene at the store. The plot twists are top-notch, and one of the other big twists in this film is the fact that some of the secondary characters, in fact, act as if they have a brain. It is not often that the secondary characters, such as sheriffs deputies have more brains than their superiors headliners. But the director as smart as Dahl, you should not be surprised by anything the intelligence associated with this film. Great movie.
