Delivery of some very humorous rough lines on Pierce Brosnan alone is worth the price of admission. He plays a kind of "psycho twin brother, James Bond", separated at birth, no doubt. How intense You are a person, his character is very sexy, but even better, it is very funny. Add the good, uber-cute American "guy next door", Greg Kinnear, to adjust the contrast. Countless space, bright colors, and sharp humor provides excellent entertainment. Hope Davis is well cast as the "gem wife." But the focus of the film on two guys, a new "Odd Couple", and this is the part that works very well. Have a great (probably, R-rated) laugh, and look for a place where the story goes a little deeper.
