George Raft, Steve Brodie, carefree, dancing gambler, who can never give up bold as pitted against logging, sentimental, Chuck Connors (Wallace Bira). Soft touch for every poor, Connors impulsively accepts waste, in particular the runaway orphan "Swipes» (Jackie Cooper, complete with kittens!) And homeless Lucy Calhoun, the city is an innocent with the ambition to become a writer. <br /> <br /> In this male-dominated culture, communication takes place mainly in the form of violence (one sees why Bauer is a favorite Martin Scorsese). Exploding cigar provide the town. «Swipes» likes to throw stones at the windows in Chinatown, in one case, installation of laundry alight. (The simultaneous arrival of two volunteer fire companies Brody and beer leads to a fight, during which a building is burning to the ground.) Beery accidentally pulls out the troublesome girl and thumps of all those who disagree with him, including Brody, whom he wins, at night fisticuffs on moored barges to regain control over its cabin lost on a bet that Brody would not have the courage to jump off the Brooklyn bridge. (Brody makes the jump, but only because the trick with dummy fails at the last moment.) <br /> <br /> As usual, Walsh fills the frame with detail showing the pleasure of everyday life clippings; singing waiters, bartenders bullying whore with Suicide hall being thrust into the funnel, tailors collaring hapless Hicks off the street and get them to buy the costumes, they do not want. Small but lovely little film.
