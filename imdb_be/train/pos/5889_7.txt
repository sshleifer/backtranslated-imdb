Well, I must admit that I've never seen "Rhoda" and only one or two episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." Despite the fact that I did this duet comic talent do not know, I still love this movie lot. <br /> <br /> Mary goes back to work. Rose is trying her luck at the time comedian. Rhode struggling with a career photos. And Meredith ... that she does again? These three stories, which we follow in two hours funny and entertaining in their own way. If the two long time friends are reunited, it just makes the movie better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised how well it was written. Little jokes thrown in Mary and Rhoda were funny. The script itself was very well together. <br /> <br /> I saw Moore and Harper in the other films in the past few years and thought they were very good. But I had no idea that they were working on this as a team. While both actresses are doing their share to carry the name of this film, they never seem to let me down. (During the execution of this film.) Joey Lenz and Marisa Ryan scene say okay, but nothing special. The rest of the cast, like Jonah, Cecile .... and still work well together. <br /> <br /> Given that this reunion, one would expect a show fan to enjoy it. With a non-fan, I still use this little get-together. Good storylines for each character, and the two main characters, what makes this film very well. (The new version of the song MTM theme does not hurt.)
