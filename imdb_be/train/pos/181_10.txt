UC 0079, almost one year of the war in the end. Neutral Side 6 colony has been focused on the Cyclops, the task force Zeon. Their goal, a new Gundam is built exclusively for Newtypes (presumably built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga) inside. When the little boy Al Izuruha, a supporter of the Zeon MS, meets chained after the battle breaks out in the colony, he befriends a novice pilot MS Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. The two became good friends, Al treated as an honorary member of the team of Cyclops. Thanks to the show, Bernie acts as a father to Al (whose real father is always working) and it seems to be taken from the pilot Christina Mackenzie Federation, but in the end they must meet .... in combat. Al soon discovers that war is not a child's play and Bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to complete their mission. <br /> <br /> only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is well done show. Mobile suits very well designed, and animation may look outdated, but actually show emotion in the characters. If you like 0083, then check this one out, or if you're new to the world of Gundam, it is a good show, to begin with. If you look at the show for the drama and character development, this is one for you, he is more focused on the fact that mobile suit battle. I would appreciate it more drama than action. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, the war in the pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
