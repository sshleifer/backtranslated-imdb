Although the gap Jerker is definitely "feel good" movie. All the actors were wonderful and Will Smith, as always, does the job and does it well. I could go on, but choose any of the ten "10" rating, and they said it as well, and probably better than I could. <br /> <br /> But, since I have to include at least 10 lines to leave a comment, I would say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer. Her performance was the most enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to see her appearance in many films in the future. <br /> <br /> And this film shows that Will Smith has nothing more to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.
