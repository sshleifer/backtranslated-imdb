I appreciated the top ten only because I find it so impressive that one and eighteen years can do with a camera. It's not epic, but it is attractive enough, and I was never boring. If tens of millions of dollars can go to countless bad movies that poured en masse, and then give it to the Director the same amount of money and see what happens. I know that I will be lining up at the local cinema for its first major release. Damn good work, but well worth the money. Which scenario! This can be a low budget, but it beats the hell out of half the principal of the pictures I've seen lately. Nanavati knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on the screen. Serious kudos to her, can not wait to see more.
