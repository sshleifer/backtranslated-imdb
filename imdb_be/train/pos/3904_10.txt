In my opinion, this is the best stand-up show I've ever seen. I instantly became a fan after seeing Eddie dress to kill, but I have to say that I think this is his best work. I would say, though, if you ever get a chance definitely go see it live. It's worth it! <br /> <br /> Most of the time after seeing standing routines couple times, jokes begin to age. But I must say that I have seen this show so many times that I have literally the entire thing in memory (yes, I realize this is kind of sad), but in every joke still makes me laugh. It really feels good show. <br /> <br /> Dress to kill never get old for me. I own it and watch it anytime I need a good laugh.
