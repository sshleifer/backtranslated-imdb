Surrealistic film noir released shortly after the "real" genre definition of "The Maltese Falcon" classics, "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice." Wells films should not be assessed in relation to the others. He plays by different rules. In fact, he played. It begins where other films fatal to go away, so vaguely logical (but interesting) whodunit decorated with scenes showing Wellesian (typical style hasty), dialogue (a lot of "hard-boiled" philosophy), and unusual activity (good Hayworth allegedly intentionally dimensional). For Wells, "genre" can mean "formula", but he seemed to like using a "secret" as a backdrop for their "entertainment".
