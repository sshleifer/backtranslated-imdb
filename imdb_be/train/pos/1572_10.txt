When reading a review from another user, saying it is a terrible game, I could not stand idly by and do nothing! <br /> <br /> Well, this game is great, from the news clips (with two real persons, full of humor and confidence!), to the history, I think it's very good! I only complain about the enemies start to flash when they die, until they disappear; and some care situation in the VR missions Leila, while riding a bicycle, here and there ... <br /> <br /> In addition, it is a great game with a great story, good graphics, great characters, great soundtrack ... I recommend it! Of course! It may be a bit old, but still nice! At least on the Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version should be the same.
