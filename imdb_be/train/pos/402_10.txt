I've seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In this film, the installation takes place in the mountains of China, Legend C looks like another dimension !! Thank you for the extensive use of the Tsui Hark CGI effects. He is able to reflect the vision of the mountains, floating above the clouds to the ground, where people fly freely, and power, ranging from shaving sharp blade wing split balls and ultra cool Moon Orb. <br /> <br /> While there are many characters in it, focuses mainly on the Sky King and Enigma. Aspect of romance is, though the film seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful, and her presence on the screen makes this film worth watching. In the beginning, I like the way it looks like a countess (from Zu Warriors) and she plays well Enigma as she communicates with facing her past life. Oh, by the way, I have already said that Cecilia is very appealing to the eye ?? <br /> <br /> Actually, Zu Warriors was more comedic elements and its special effects were limited because of the time in 1983, Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and set new standards in the cinema.
