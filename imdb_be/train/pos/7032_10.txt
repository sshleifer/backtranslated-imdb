drama club at my school will be putting this show spring of 2002, and I can only hope that we are as good as this! I watched this movie in recent times as a kind of "research" for my part (Rosie Alvarez), and I would like to say, Vanessa Williams is cool! <br /> <br /> Wow! Casting for this film was excellent (with one exception). Jason Alexander, my Gawd, is there anything he can not do? He was the great Albert Peterson never - I especially loved all his funny facial expressions and dance during "Put on a happy face," It's so great! Vanessa Williams, as I said, it's cool. She was a beautiful Rosie and her transition from a secretary to a seducer was entirely plausible. Tyne Daly was hilarious as obnoxious mother of Albert and George Wendt was very rich as the unfortunate Mr. McAfee (but I liked the performance of Paul Lind in version one thousand nine hundred sixty-three!). Brigitta Dau cracked me as Ursula Merkle; she really hammed it! And Mark Kudish Conrad was a strange bird ... "Hold on!Â» <br /> <br /> There was only one audition that I do not understand, and as you will see from previous comments, many other people Useless "t understand. Chynna Phillips, Kim McAfee - what was it? I mean, she is very beautiful and very talented, but ... it looks a bit too old for the role. Eh, maybe I'm crazy. <br /> <br /> Well well, in any case, I highly recommend this film. This will leave you smiling! <br /> <br />
