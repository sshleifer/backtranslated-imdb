I swear, when I first saw this movie, I cried my eyes! A Star Is Born is a film that lets you know what love really is, despite the obstacles, John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) persons. You will also experience what it is going to lose a love like that to the end of the film. Streisand Kristofferson and have such great chemistry together, and the music is fantastic! If Streisand sings one more look at you / Look carefully now, it's just pure magic! This film made the song Evergreen is one of my favorites, and the Queen Bee is such a fun song. Also, I love fashion 70s (except African Streisand. In addition, she is a beauty.). A star is born, my number one favorite film. This film is a pleasure to watch and a heart breaker in the end.
