As someone who is looking for its existence as a "professional" person with an income with the support of the BSO in Chemistry and an MS in business administration, my common sense is always abruptly sustained external indulgences in things more artistic. My post-post-graduate classes always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal, forging / welding and artistic images, which also featured silkscreen. <br /> <br /> I also maintain health with jogging, walking, and in recent years, trips to remote destinations in California and nearby states like Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Running, walking and hiking gets one close to the ground, with time to stop and look and listen, and take pictures or record sounds. <br /> <br /> In this regard, I was obsessed with rivers and TIDES. I was also struck by the content of the documentary artist Andy Goldsworthy, and the skills and smoothness director / cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. I really could not pull out of the way art Goldsworthy camera Riedelsheimer. <br /> <br /> Well. Excellent. Excellent.
