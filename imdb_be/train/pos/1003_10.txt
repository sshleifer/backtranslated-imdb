Another Aussie masterpiece, it delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and it's very good. He does not go to great special effects as the excesses of American cinema, he pays more attention to the emotional impact. Relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney & Co. implement. It follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside, and whose husband has disappeared in mysterious circumstances centuries ago. Strange things begin to happen in the house, and John Adam begins to turn into a person who is gone, who actually was a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10
