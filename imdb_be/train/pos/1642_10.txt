Not seen the film, since the first was released, but it was memorable. Performances Rip Torn and finish Farrell was perfect, picture perfect, moving story and all the rest of it was at the highest level. Nevertheless, it seems to have been largely forgotten <br /> <br /> Perhaps because Britain is an amazing market for it, but I saw a movie on TV or video, which is boring. whether it has had more success in the US, where it can be rightly regarded as quite accurate historical drama? <br /> <br /> Always believed that 50% of a good film is the music, and although I'm not sure, I think the name of the theme was simple but moving clarinet solo "What a friend we have in Jesus." The film then proceeded to challenge that! Am I right or wrong?
