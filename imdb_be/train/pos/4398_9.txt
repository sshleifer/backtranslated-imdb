When I heard that the film was directed by Ang Lee, I made sure to see it. This Taiwanese director broke into stardom with "The Wedding Banquet" and «Eat Drink Man Woman» a few years ago, and then moved to "Sense and Sensibility" and «The Ice Storm». Now, he drew attention to another American icon. - Civil War <br /> <br /> This story took place in the state of Missouri, in the Union State with Southern sympathies. They never officially joined the Confederate Army. Instead, they created Outlaw group called «Bushwhackers», they grew long hair, and sometimes will be withdrawn Union uniforms, which they wore over his ordinary clothes. <br /> <br /> The film reflects his moral dilemma, the high drama of the time, and their supposedly heroic mission murder storekeeper and farmers who helped the Union. There are no stars in the film, except for the "value" of the singer, well chosen, as a young confederate widow like stars. <br /> <br /> Tobey Macquire cast as a young German farm boy who ridiculed for his legacy, because the Germans were sympathetic to the Union. This young man is a great actor, full of fresh hexagon youth, whose presentation covered his surprise and subtle realization, as it is exposed to the horrors of war. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Wright freed slave who travels with Bushwhackers, because of his loyalty to the young man who bought his freedom. It gives a beautiful and understated performance. <br /> <br /> Some actions, however, the wood, especially in the long conversations they have about morality. Their costumes are also new. And "southern gentleman" topic of morals and hat-tipping and courtesy to women comes across as too much - especially since they make it a point to kill all the people, they pull out their women's hands, and then burnt shops and houses. <br /> <br /> while I do not think it will go down in history as one of the "big" movies or English, I find myself fascinated by it, in spite of the slow movements and excessive length of 140 minutes . I was interested in what is happening there and felt empathy for each of the characters, all of which come across as real and imperfect people who were in the forces of history. <br /> <br /> Not much action in a conventional war movie, but it is still recommended. - especially for fans of the Civil War <br /> <br />
