For me, this film is in my top four all-time. No exceptions. James Cameron has shown itself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and as terminators, it is clear that he was a brilliant director and a trustee, as the action and science fiction goes. He sees the story and adds a wonderful quality of the film. But the Titanic is so different from others of its luster blows. The film is extremely moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting events in the history of the character that everyone knows. The history of the famous traveler fading on her maiden voyage legends so the challenge was for the Cameron, to make a true, interesting and fascinating film about it. Act perfectly as Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Jack and Kate Winslet, who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film, and in most movies, I get annoyed when a minor character does not have much in common, but in this film he is more focused, so how old Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells his story is quickly obvious that this story Rose and Jack alone, no one else. Emotionally, it is quite satisfied and can not leave a dry eye in the theater or at home. Music has become a cult and legendary. This is the best soundtrack composer James Horner and always causes so much of the film and the audience. Song after so long was annoying, but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon of it and this film. Only one problem, a common problem, James Cameron, is a dialogue that is remembered, but in a bad way, like how crappy it at points, but all that aside. James Cameron delivered a masterpiece and romantic epic that goes through your way of life. My heart would not go out of it.
