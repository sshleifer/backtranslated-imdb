National Lampoon's Class Reunion classic comedy from the early 80-ies, which combines the unique characters, a lot of laughs and some great music by Chuck Berry. If Walter depositor shall be very humiliated their classmates in their high school graduation, he seizes the opportunity to get his revenge in his class reunion. One by one he pursues his classmate, which include innocent blind girl, horny fat guy, high school beauty, the king of all Preps and even plain old dinner lady who served up slops of all children in highschool. This movie has a kind of terrible element in it, and he has a few short scenes of sexuality, so I would not recommend it for young children, but it is a great movie for teenagers. If you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complex characters and killer special effects that you can not love Class Reunion. If you want to sit down for 90 minutes and got some great laughs and a lot of fun (and who does not), then this movie should be on your movies to see the list. ++
