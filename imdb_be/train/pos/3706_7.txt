The biggest surprise in this film was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Instead of playing ditzy blonde stereotype role that she usually does, she plays a street-smart, intelligent, tired character. She has a huge role, but it does a great job, which shows Lois Harlan as a woman tired, although earlier transgressions covering for their boss.
