I was not a fan to see this film at all, but when my gf called me and said that she expanded the free screening passage I had come only for the sake of seeing Eva Longoria and laughs Biggs antics. <br /> <br /> as a whole it was actually better than I expected, but not by much. it was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days, and just like the sky. typical romantic comedy with his point, I think. the film was rather short, though (about 85 min.), but it was enough to tell the whole story, to build some character development, and have a decent happy ending. the whole idea of ​​a ghost haunts her former husband had an interesting story to follow. Eve did a good job, keep up the sarcasm and Paul Rudd, and the rest of the supporting cast (especially Biggs) kept the laughter comes on smooth pace. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked this movie only because he was a good amount of laughter to keep me going otherwise I would have given this film a lower rating. hey its chick flick, and I consider this film from persepctive Man, well, it would be more fair fight when women reviewied this film and gave it thought.
