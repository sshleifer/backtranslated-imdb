But it's kind of funny, at least, if you grew up on a Weird Al, as I did. This mockumentary about his life and career, starting with the superstar and go back to trace the origin. It is uneven in places, but some segments are still very funny, especially when he goes to Japan. While it's not quite as emotional as textured Lost in Translation, and he does not find love, however fleeting, it does capture the bottle absolutely bizarre cultural melange that Tokyo street life. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, Weird Al is not recognized as discerning cultural commentator that one; perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet. Nevertheless, it is a funny movie.
