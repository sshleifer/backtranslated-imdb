After a couple of very good ratings SUPERB point, I was very happy with the film. The film was a dark, moving, anger, pain, guilt, and very convincingly demon. <br /> <br /> I was originally expecting to see a lot of special effects, and how to caress a lover, he blew me away with its subtlety and accuracy. Brian, I'm blown away again with the artistry and storytelling with your special effects. You will go a long way, my friend. I, of course, will be the president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari, Best Actor, was the number one choice. You have made the younger Lopez look like a child compared to Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> In general, action, story line, high quality photography and amazing effects, it was fantastic. I just want it to be more. I look forward to Dreamless with very high expectations.
