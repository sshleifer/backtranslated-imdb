This is one of the best films. This is one of my favorites. The film with good acting. The history is very sensitive and touching. Good camera work, too. <br /> <br /> The names of actors and actresses are not the top of the American Star list. Nevertheless, they provide equal or better performance than the top of the list. <br /> <br /> It is such a pleasure to watch a film about true love, romance, friendship without suffering watch someone having to push a box their way to save the world. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this movie, you have no heart or feelings. Then go watch sports movie. There's no killing or horror here. See a movie. This is imperative. TH
