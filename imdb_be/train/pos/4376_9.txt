Liam Neeson reflects Scottish legend Rob Roy MacGregor from the beginning of the 18th century. He's a real actor. He captivates the audience with his charm, as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent, as well as his wife, Mary. Maria is such a beautiful woman. It is her love, making Rob Roy a legend, but it was his passion that makes her immortal love. They need each other. Tim Roth in the role of the evil committed by Cunningham; in one form or another, watching the film, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The scenery is beautiful Scotland. Environment and conditions of time are depicted quite well. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you will enjoy the Rob Roy. There is violence and gore, but it is inevitable, telling the story as it has to be said; NO gratuitous violence. And you need to listen carefully if you are not used to the Scottish accent. One important point that makes this film so good that no one actor or actress is not flattering; they get dirty and really look unattractive in various scenes. It is their ability as actors that attract you, they do not depend on the marquee name, popularity or attractiveness of sex symbol. This is something special.
