I can definitely recognize (like a freak IMDb), that «Phantom Lady» will never crack my film noir top twenty. He can not even get in the top fifty. But instead of to discredit the film is not as good as many other classic film noir genre, it is worth noting that the «Phantom Lady» is sufficiently strong and stable images in it to make it worth watching. All that is required from the viewer has the opportunity to go beyond the terribly slow start. <br /> <br /> The film does not get to cook "Kansas" (Ella Raines) does not set about trying to prove anything, but alone the innocence of his boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who was convicted of murder. "Kansas" is the secretary of Anderson's day and amateur detective at night. As an aspiring detective, she is doing very well for themselves by working on the streets of New York City at night. Gradually she begins to put the pieces of the puzzle mystery murder together. Frankly, the film belongs to Raines, and only because of her presence, the film works well at all. Once she is able to breathe life into a film about a suicide bomber, who is not interested in the least. I'm not sure if it is split into the dynamics of boneless leading man gets wine actor or director, but it is obvious that this is where it becomes terribly bad film. <br /> <br /> As interesting as Raines is as an aspiring detective, things really accelerated in the other secure communication, if "Kansas" pays a late night visit to an itinerant drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) in search of some information in order to help her boss condemned. She and drums to paint the town red new species during a visit to "all night" jazz clubs. Trying to describe the scene, or show an injustice to the scene, or, even worse, it could ruin the scene all together. You'll know the scene after the last cymbal crash ended chime. If you are lucky enough to see this movie on DVD, you will be more likely to rewind the scene again and again. As well as Raines is, this scene that makes this film deserves attention. This is mainly because of this scene, I appreciate «Phantom Lady» 7 instead of 6 <br /> <br /> For the most part this film comes off as cool and mild with a few more scenes and wonderful scene, a "drum / sex scene ", which separates this film from any other of the same kind. <br /> <br /> And just as they say in the film that "you can never go wrong with Vanilla», I would also like to add that "going to the Vanilla» is a safe fall back option if one It can not make a decision about having a tasty treat. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
