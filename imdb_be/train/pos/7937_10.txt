I thought the film "I am They" were fantastic. In the past I watched Rob Estes on "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place" and Josie Bissett on "Melrose Place" and enjoyed seeing them together again in "they do not do." They have a great chemistry together (I guess being married in real life helps that!) - the film they were both widowed with children and a career, and they fall in love and try to mix them already occupied by a chaotic family together without dropping ball. Of course, they stumble, but they keep it together, it's something that works and is raising a family is all about. So many people are talking about this movie - all good! - and the film left us wanting more. This would make a great series - attractive to many ages! - it would be so nice to see the real life, down to earth, family show like this, which reflects the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so-called «Reality TV», that all stations are predominant have with them days. Somebody tell the people at ABC Family, they have the beginning of a new series is here!
