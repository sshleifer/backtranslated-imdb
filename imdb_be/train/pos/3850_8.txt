This is the last Dutch film Paul Verhoeven made before going to make a mainstream Hollywood movie "Basic Instinct," "Robocop" and «Total Recall» among others. He sets the scene, revealing the story of the black widow spider catching prey in its network, before we meet Gerard Reve, annoying self-centered writer with a morbid imagination. Gerard was invited to be a guest at a meeting of literary club at the sea side town an hour from Amsterdam. Verhoeven allows us to have glimpses of how representation Gerard twist reality. On the question of the authors of a little close to insanity, he admits, when he reads the newspaper, "and it says that the" boom "I read" thoughts "when he says that the" flood "I have read the" blood "when he says "red," I see "dead" when he told a lot of times, he starts to believe it. "I lay the truth." he accepted the offer to become the overnight guest of the treasurer of the club, the beautiful rich owner of the salon. As he learns it, and finds her husband died, he begins to think that she is a "black widow." is it him more of his or twist reality she's a killer? is a psychological, etc. ama and counting, which of these old films are stuck in my mind, I realized my favorite floor. Looking at his body of work, it seems, Paul Verhoeven too, and he is a master of making us question our own understanding of reality. this is a good change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare. I saw him in 1983, and is a film that is "stuck".
