Having only seen two of his paintings before I came to an agreement with the Altman. Before, even though I had always marked his style of filmmaking "boring". You just have to be in the right mind to assess its mad genius. <br /> <br /> «HEALTH» rather underrated and very controversial from the press. In fact, I do not think I ever even was published VHS. Why is this? If all these bad films get a DVD-releases on a daily basis, is the only one left behind without a reason? Honestly, I have not had any real problems with this film. It was, for the most part, consistently funny and ridiculous. Almost all the scenes mysteriously interesting for whatever reason, whether it's a great dialogue or subtle performances. There is a real skill here. <br /> <br /> And skimp Paul blew on the pool bottom halfway through mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem. It is not perfect, but it is much better than most of the sludge there get DVD releases. Hell, I'd be happy with a good VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> Often on Fox Movie Channel, though, so look at it.
