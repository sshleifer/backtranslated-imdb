Rod Serling was certainly a genius and his wonderful, playful, creative mind has left something of the period in which he lived and television examples in this state of development. There's no such a show today, but rather a "Housewife" Eva Longoria Ali untidy or Hatcher or helpless shots on humor and witty banter that litter our high-tech screens. <br /> <br /> Jack Ella cut in the episode with such precision, that works and with his usual crazy that I can not help but think that Rod Serling was a tailor, had long weekly show around El, despite that he was an auxiliary to the flow of history. This episode finishes turning, as usual, but the shock humor and miscible with purely «Serlingesque» dexterity. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
