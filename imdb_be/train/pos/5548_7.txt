Star Pickford and director Tourneur - with two of his favorite cameramen and assistant Clarence Brown make editing - bring great beauty and intelligence of the story of the poor, isolated Scottish islands - the same area that Michael Powell circle twenty years after his first great success. Visions of the wind and waves, sunbacked silhouettes of lovers not only complement the story, they are the history of the struggle against deprivation. <br /> <br /> The actors bring the dignity of proud people in their roles and Pickford is brilliant as her character struggles with his responsibilities as head of the clan, who oscillates between comedy and thoughtfully here with a whip connecting wayward parents islanders in the church, sitting there with his staff her guest in her hand like a scepter, discussing her lover, played by Matt Moore. <br /> <br /> See if you can choose a future star Leatrice Joy in the ensemble. I tried, but could not.
