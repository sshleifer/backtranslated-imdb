E! TV is a great channel and Talk Soup so funny, in a flash, you can view the episodes change. We want more funny works of the best writers ever Stan Evans .. patron senseless masses ... He's really talented, gifted writer, actor, comedian, producer, director and creative consultant.Anna Nicole loves him, but he was not $$$$ billionaire that he left his billionaire. Many super stars like to make films with the actor Stan Evans, who has a "Humphrey Bogart" {} Clark Gable acting style. He has to do a lot more films. Maybe, with Steven Spielberg, or perhaps many other talented producers.We wishes him FAME moment with the great fortune to get. Does he have any layout made U-drama? or perhaps any docudrama ??? Draft Bernie Madhoff will be a great TV movie written STAN Evans. How much has he has written scripts ?? Is he under $$$$$$$$$$$$ billion contract with Disney ?? He should earn more than $ 50 million ... he might as well write a TV movie about the end of the KING OF POP .. Michael Jackson. We want to see a lot more and Stan Evans in film and television. Thank you very much. Elvis has left the building !!!!!
