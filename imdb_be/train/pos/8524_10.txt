Children aged 7 to 14 years old, got a huge kick out of this film that we gave up all the other kids on our list for my birthday this year. they all loved it! Children from 2 to 7 times and watch it often, and we enjoy watching it with them. <br /> <br /> It's rare that a movie entertains a child for so long, and offers laughs for adults, too. Many people like it more than the first <br /> <br /> Top-quality products and excellent cast, led by Christopher Showerman as an excellent George -. Athletic, energetic, and very credible, with a cute innocence and given the ability to make a tree in the face - well maintained incomparable Christina Pickles as an evil mother-in-law, Thomas Haden Church, as an evil jerk opponent and everything else. It's fun.
