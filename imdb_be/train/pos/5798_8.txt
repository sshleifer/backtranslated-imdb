I first saw it when they showed it during Easter 1993/4 and not think about it, what I bought it on DVD last summer, when I started getting into Michael Jackson (I still love his music) and liked Now I'm older. This is a good movie, but it will not be the classic film like The Sound Of Music, West Side Story, The Wizard Of Oz, etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good and so were the other actors. There were disturbing scene, as a little girl Katie getting a slap gangster Frankie Lideo who plays Joe Pesci. The scene that frightened me when I was younger was when Michael turns into a robot. My favorite song on the tape was Smooth Criminal, I think it was better than Thriller in my opinion.
