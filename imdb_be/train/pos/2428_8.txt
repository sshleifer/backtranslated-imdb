How old white housewife, I can still appreciate that Laurence Fishburne is one of our finest actors. who appreciate his work, as in the Deep Cover can enjoy watching the incredible acting range of the actor. So I think this is his directorial debut may be even more interesting. All the acting is pretty good. If you can not take Lower Manhattan useless worlds or the reality of life of crime (not glorified action shoot-em ups), it is not a movie you'll enjoy. This is the usual contribution of Mr. Fishburne an incredibly delicate relationship. I'd like to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins to go one on one at some point in the movie.
