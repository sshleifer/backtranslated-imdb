I saw it in the theater Heritage Memorial Building Joseph Smith in Salt Lake City this morning. I'm going to assume that the level of their satisfaction during this film will be largely based on their level of decision-stories. <br /> <br /> Joseph, however, that aside it was very well done, well acted, and had a good point. When you get to Salt Lake City, it is necessary to see it as a legacy of the theater. I've never been to the theater more beautiful as the picture quality, sound quality, and the atmosphere in the whole of my life ... I wonder if the Church would allow me to watch Batman Begins there! Being that I was LDS and believes Joseph as a prophet, I was moved to several places and was brought to tears quite a few times ... I guess is expected, as they are distributed to the fabric prior to the beginning of the film! Anyway, I said that this film is available in several LDS Public centers around the world, if you have 70 minutes to check it out, because if you believe Joseph Smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.
