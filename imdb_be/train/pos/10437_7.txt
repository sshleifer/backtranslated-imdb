This slow moving story. No action. No mind of the unknown. No sudden surprises. If you can not stand to see a movie about two people just talk and walk about a story that develops slowly until the very end and about Lyuba sweet romance, do not waste your time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are in dialogue, clever tale, thoughtful ideas and find true love in the fabric of life, then this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert, though, because the tempo, the music and the general tone of the film may put you in a dreamy mood. It is really fantastic. I actually had in mind. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy irritate their manner of time, but fortunately, the chemistry between them makes himself very natural, warm and affectionate. They act and feel each other from the start, making you feel like an intruder. <br /> <br /> In his conversations have excellent comments on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought that it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters, but I may be underestimating their intelligence. Nevertheless, this does not spoil the film <br /> <br /> The whole story is very simple, which I think gives it the charm of the film, and ultimately it is the power <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The flow of the movie .. It is slow. Dialogue is fascinating. History builds gently, systematically and on the merits. Build up to the final and satisfactory in the end reward.
