This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short, what I have seen, and so far the most ridiculous one. In this case, Joe takes singing lessons from a record which gives himself Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. If he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind the series, by the way), he asks Jack Carson for areas that receive and confused. Then he meets the actor George O'Hanlon (who also McDoakes), who says in his more normal tone of voice, which is not too far from his subsequent Geroge Jetson and gets on the set, where he will automatically care director. I'll stop there and just say how funny I found all of this and was fascinated by the movie star cameos provided near the end. The final scene was particularly horn so on that note, go on YouTube, if you want to watch So you want to be Picutres!
