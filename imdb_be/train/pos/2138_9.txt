The film revolves as much around the Japanese culture, as it makes the life of a modern Japanese family. Physical contact displeasure for those over 7 years (especially in public), so all that bowing instead to embrace, even if you are close friends / relatives. Ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else, and that in public too! Nevertheless Ballroom dancing Nia (in full) are very popular. People who do Ballroom dancing in Japan is regarded as a bit of nudists in the west ... much more we would like than to do, but inhibited culture. Magnificent family film that any fan dancer will enjoy for some dance sequences. I understand that he was more popular than the Titanic in Japan. I believe that the Japanese just as the rest of us - they love to be cuddled too.
