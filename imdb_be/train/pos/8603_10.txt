fiction film. The storyline is thin, but serves as a structure in which some beautiful songs are sung, and sung beautifully. (I still can not believe that such a beautiful and attractive people to sing it well.) Some of the dialogue surprisingly clever. Costumes made me feel as if I was watching couture fashion show from 1942. <br /> <br /> The film is intended to be used for different purposes. This one is designed for entertainment and this, of course. If I have one negative comment would be that Nelson Eddy was too old to be beautiful excellent graph. Some close-ups of me uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing beautifully. However, Jeanette MacDonald was as dazzling as ever. It makes a spectacular angel. <br /> <br /> This genre long before my time, and I'm new to movies Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy and related to the conversation. The music in this film is beautiful. How much I love classic rock music that fills the latest movies, there is no doubt in my mind that this music simply and clearly more memorable, more enjoyable, better built. The stars in this film are more talented than the stars that I see in theaters today. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of Beverly Hills plastic surgeons, was more beautiful than the stars that I see today. I do not understand why so many other posters apologetic about the soul of the film and in general this group of films. They say it is dated and try to explain why this is the way it is. And those who do not like to say that it is not very good, but compared to what? I think this film will no doubt be more to entertain people when so many other long-forgotten films. There is too much quality in all respects in this film to have in mind and enjoy. I recommend this film without reservation for those who appreciate great talent, great beauty and great music.
