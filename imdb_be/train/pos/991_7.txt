I'm really shocked to see the number of reviews, the film beat. This film was not intended to be a "deep thought" the film, which is what the vast majority of reviewers seem to think that it should be. In fact, it would seem that if any film does not give life changed imagination and deep, twisted, an incredible story, they would appreciate it to 1 or 2. Do not trash a movie, because you do not like the genre, people. <br /> <br /> This film was a thriller / comedy flick, and that's all it should be. And it was done very well for the action / comedy,. I was actually very surprised that I liked it as well as I do, they have never really been a supporter Jamie Foxx, and which has excessive plot, which he has. <br /> <br /> The plot was not anything spectacular, using a typical offender is released from prison, and thrown into the plot of a bad guy trying to clean up his act (see Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours, etc., etc. d., and the like), but is heated with a small amount of twist process. Now the "bad guys" really "good guys" and the realities of the "bad guy" is the uber-monster. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx actually plays convincingly humorous, while at the same time is quite clever and serious protagonist, and tried not to overdo the humor side of the film. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for in-depth the main plot, for example, in «The Matrix» or dramas such as "with the mouse and man", this film is not for you. But if you like raw action, excellent fast paced shooting, and the occasional twist of humor thrown in this film will not disappoint you. Usually I appreciated his approximately 8 (on the same level as the tenacious Trilogy), but instead gave him a 10 to try to bring the score to what it should be. <br /> <br />
