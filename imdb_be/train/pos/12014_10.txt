This is definitely the most incredible movie that I have seen in a long time. The actors gave excellent images of the characters in the film. The story was actually painted. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and her father on the boat trip to Nova, Illinois. She became a member of the LDS Church, and he has not. He thinks it's funny and makes the trip embarrassing. She encourages him to read about Joseph Smith, the Prophet. Here begins the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The film accurately reflects his life and some of the history of the LDS Church at the same time. This graphic from time to time, but it is necessary. Emotional expression was very plausible that caused my emotions splash. Filming was awesome. The way in which was presented the story was touching. After the film was finished, we just sat there can not be renamed. I was stunned. For people who know very little of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, I urge you to see it. If nothing else, but to get a glimpse of his life. For those who are members of the Church, I urge you to see it. This will increase your testimony of this most incredible person. This is a must see.
