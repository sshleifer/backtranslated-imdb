There are a few comedies, as this is where almost every line and each character comes close to flawless. It's soooo funny !! And it has quite a bit of satire there. Sally Field leads the field really outstanding actors and does good, if not perfect, work with it in the daytime TV diva. Sometimes it acts just a little wide and over the top, but 90% of the time it is a riot! In the same league, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr. and Whoopy Goldberg (who, unfortunately, too little to do here). Downey Jr. could not fully convince as a comedian and has no time to correct all the time, but he was fighting with his unit, which is, frankly, the most thankless one. But the brightest star here Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a real bitch, if there ever was one more than one unpleasant secret (you'll see in a totally stunning final!). Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue never seems quite comfortable in his part. I usually like Ms. Shu, but here it acts like a fish out of water, and sometimes seems to be in another movie. But that's not the damage, and for the most part it is at least adequate. Otherwise, filled with memorable lines and situations, it is a comedy to watch when it is on TV or anywhere.
