Maltin must have watched some other movie. (. Although I believe that his leadership of a very valuable resource, do not pay attention to his comments on that) He states that "begins well, then exhaled," if it's actually the other way around - "it begins cool and then ignited." The plot is about as simple as it gets. Happy mom, happy dad and son Happy to take a vacation on a secluded beach, dad incapacitated in an accident, my mother runs off to get help, found a dangerous escaped convict. Mom tries to deceive Convicted in aid while waiting for the pope and hangs for his life. <br /> <br /> Good white knuckler given electric propulsion Ralph Meeker, who appear suddenly (directed by John Sturges, films it in a smart way that will make you choke) halfway around as cunning, desperate criminal. Meeker unusually daring, reckless actor (at least here in the classic «Kiss Me Deadly»), and he was happy grabs the keys of the narrative of the film and speed away from the top down. His character has a habit of grinning children, and saying: "Very carefully, yes," When he was particularly pleased with his offense. There is a fun break in the action, when they get a flat tire, and he tersely instructs him hostage, Barbara Stanwyck, "Do not go." She fires back, "Where would I go?" (They are in the middle of nowhere), and he understands sitcom-ishly «Yes, it's true." Friction between the horn. <br /> <br /> There are shortcomings, some of them absurd. There's one scene where the police, which was chasing after Meeker for some time, to stop the car Stanwyck and to avoid Meeker detection puts his head on her shoulder as a loving husband, they say, it will, and pretends to be asleep, as it pertains questioned. A. It appears clearly not a man in this position and B. I think I can say with certainty that any adult who seems to sleep during a meeting with law enforcement, surely arouse suspicion. <br /> <br /> However, reliable thriller that builds to an exciting and instructive conclusion. <br /> <br />
