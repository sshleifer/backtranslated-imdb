Some people might call «Paulie» children's film, but I would argue that it's more than that. Probably more than anything else, this film successfully goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the United States - the theme given the recent debate. Drawing parrot, speaking Russian immigrant janitor (Shalhoub) about how he was looking to America for their first owners, the film tells several stories. There's also an elderly woman (Gena Rowlands), he is friendly, the Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very well made film. I usually do not expect much from this kind of movie, but it is a pleasure. I certainly recommend it. Also starring Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Holly Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
