This is one of the greatest love stories of the films I've ever seen. Yes, I agree that some parts may seem outdated, but it does not distract from the film. You must try to observe, criticize and enjoy any kind of art in terms of time. It is clear that in the "Sex and the City" standards, Charlie Chaplin was terribly boring. However, judging from the perspective of America in 1925, he was fantastic. Similarly, Sayonara breakthrough film in his eyes in loving mixed-race American «Manifest Destiny» arrogance and prejudice, as well as the complexity of the different cultures. This is a natural next step in movies such as Gentleman Agreement. His goal, however, is not only a social comment, rather, it is an interesting and pleasant, with countless lines that once never forget. <br /> <br /> However, even if we take only as a love story, it is terrific. Although some emphasis ATTACK Brando, he is in his best near the nuances and characterization. Buttons and Umeki (who both won Oscars) and the rest of the supporting cast to add much to the film. <br /> <br /> Taki, the real stars are doing a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for Brando, while tearing her sense of duty and loyalty. Her speech, when she first meets and talks with Brando is a classic and is rarely, if ever matched in the movie. Dialogue between Taki and Brando in his dressing room in Tokyo at the end of the film equally well. Of course, it does not suck mouth, spit-swapping, and worse, that serves as an example of love in modern movies, but this makes it all the better. It reflects the true love and passion, not just a 'warm'. If this film is not for you, then you are too young, too cynical or dead.
