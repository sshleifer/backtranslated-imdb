This is a great movie. I love it more every time I look. Most comedies can get pretty lame, because you know all the gags, but the mystery man has so much integrity in writing and characterization, to look again - Ben Stiller tears on the hood ornament of the limousine, or Hank Azaria says goodbye to Lasser, or Jeffrey Rush flashed his FÃ¼hrer choreography, or Tom Waits mutters while he watches a report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses to kiss from Paul Reuben - it's fun. This step is a perfect ensemble action. The story takes place directly and consistently creative workflow and not too dominant, winning all installed before the end of the window. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, to see it again, and if you do not start somewhere. You can not see it again as long as you have seen it for the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Mays, the trial scene. Too much good stuff!)
