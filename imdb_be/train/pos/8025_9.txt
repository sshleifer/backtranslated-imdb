I love this movie. Song and story lines are very fun. and the song "Goodbye" is always touches me. what a brilliant thing to do to a puppet of life, so that you really care about these things from the tissue and the tissue and any other. loud voice and a great talent. MUPPET why all the other films that came after it, so much less interesting, moving and funny? is that Mr.. Henson just really missed?
