I do not see the point in burying a movie like this in sulfuric sarcasm when he should in no way be nothing more than a vehicle to entertain the kids and prepare them for the following product lines begging crazy about. <, Br /> <br /> This is an interesting film. My kids sat quietly through the whole thing and loved every minute of it. Of course, the villain a bit over the top with his silly costume and maniacal laughter, but it's a lot easier to take than the dark, gloomy, and very painful Pokemon 3. <br /> <br /> My children watched pokemon since it started, and they quickly get to the century, where they will "divert the children's clothes," and move on to others. I am glad that we enjoyed together.
