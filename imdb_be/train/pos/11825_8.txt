Do not look for a built-up here .... a storyline just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy it. Gallery Stars emerge as the villains of the classic cartoon character in the live action comedy, which shows an incredible makeup and set design, not to mention the knock-out performances with Beatty, Madonna and Pacino. Great fun for children and adults. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
