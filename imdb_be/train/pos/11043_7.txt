Malefique largely a spectator from the beginning to the end with his sharp atmosphere. Almost the entire film is in a prison cell revolves around four characters of which a transvestite Marcus and his little retarded boy in leaving the country. prisoners soon found the diary of the previous occupant of the brick, which has to do with his obsession with the occult and black magic that lead to his escape from the cage. Hence all transactions to uncover the secret of the book and its spells to escape from prison. This leads to some failures at the exit from the cell into the unknown world. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I think the story is pretty poor and the final twist is good, but I end rather poorly linked. Anyway, I was excited until the last moment, because the atmosphere of the film is unique with minimal setup and gypsum. The murder is raw and terrible ... it does not take the blood to chill your spine and occult themes also make a very good and reminded me of the hellish theme in Hellraiser. Malefique is claustrophobic and dirty feeling cold with a greenish tinge. Sometimes you wonder when the real or occult world depicted here a stranger ... if retarded boy loses his fingers and suck lull Marcus chest it seems normal, as strange lights can be the gate to freedom? With its budget film creates a unique atmosphere and cools the viewer in a completely different way than most of the genre tabloids do. I just want this story has led to a more consistent final. Some elements, such as a visitor with a camera other prisoners obsession with books and toy doll vaguely indicates the end do not fit tightly in the history. Anyway, I'll keep my eyes open for other films from the director of Valletta, although its locking to see what he was doing a Hollywood remake "One Missed Call," which was worn-out and useless as early as Miike version.
