This is the first Tom Hanks movie, which I had the privilege of seeing in the theater, but he's my favorite. When I heard that he will play a hit man, I was a bit taken aback thinking "Mr. Hanks could pull this one off?" And he did in high fashion. In this 1930 depression era movie it is about loyalty, redemption, and one way that you do not want your children to the rocks below. Tom Hanks leads a stellar composition as Michael Sullivan. Being a family man, and the secret life of a contract killer for an Oscar nominated Paul Newman. This film Tom Hanks relies more on the reaction and watch, rather than dialogue, which he delivers a knockout performance. <br /> <br /> For one night one of his jobs, Michael, the son of Michael, Jr., played by newcomer Tyler Hoechlin witness hit. And partner Michael Sr. in crime officer theater actor Daniel Craig can not have this information. Thus, he wacks with his son and wife of Michael Sr., except Michael Jr. So two heads to Chicago to get Conner Rooney (Paul Newman's son Mr. Rooney). <br /> <br /> drama and intense story really thickens them, as a father tries to set things right, even if the son for the trip. While on this deadly journey, someone hired a hit for Michael Sr. Assassin is a photographer of the late Harley Maguire, playing spot-toothed Jude Law. <br /> <br /> The film will have you feeling the old days. And with Thomas Newman's beautiful and sought Oscar nominated score to go with it, you can not help but appreciate the film by Oscar winning director Sam Mendes. So sit back and enjoy the wild ride.
