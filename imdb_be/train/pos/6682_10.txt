I saw it in the theaters and just loved it. Geoffrey Rush gave the best performance as a super villain that I've ever seen since Gene Hackman Lex Luthor. Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens was a match maid in the sky. This film also introduced me to William H. Mays, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was a big as a blue Raj, and I especially liked that the character was not really British. The scene with him and tells his mother that he is a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes. I loved the fact that Bowler talked with the ball. Some of the funniest things involved Stiller and his character, Mr. Furious false fury, and the fact that he was a threat, and one-liners were all gibberish, and that they never made any sense. I could barely keep from applauding when he said, Â«fraculater, Freinken-kitty", it was said. But one of the things that I am most pleased that the capital of the country is actually dies in the movie. I highly recommend this movie for any occasion, and I give him my personal two thumbs up.
