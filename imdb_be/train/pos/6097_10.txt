I do not understand how you can say that Freddy's Nightmares cheese and plagiarism. You obviously do not know good TV when you see it. Episodes are packed with drama and blood. Freddy creatively as he kills people. I love Freddy's Nightmares, and I hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes: Saturday Night Special, School Daze Love Stinks. If you think this series is sucked, then you are entitled to their opinions, but remember that this is only your opinion and it does not mean anything. Freddy's Nightmares will always be one of the best series in the history, and you have come to accept this fact quickly. If you do not like it, do not look, but do not deny that it shine.
