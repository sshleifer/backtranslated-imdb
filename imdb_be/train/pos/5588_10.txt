The first time I had a window of opportunity to see it all but forgotten classics was in the early 1980s, in one of our art house, as a revival. When I looked at this fever dream exercise of sexuality in the 1930s, I thought Yowza! They went to the murder in Europe back in the day. Unfortunately, this movie was heavily cut in the original American release blue nose Hayes Office (confident state censorship board, began the most "holy" Bible Thumper, Will Hayes ... a former employee of the post office, if you can believe that), with -this his common theme of human sexuality (Heaven forbid people actually had sex in the 1930s). Ecstasy plot belongs to a young woman (Game Hedy Lamarr), who marries a much older man, and then regret it. She (Lamarr) meets a handsome young man, and does not deal with him, not as a result of a divorce from the previous spouse (Other not in Hollywood movies then --- Divorce!). Despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the first time the director works in the sound format (that is, the film seems to have methods that have been used mostly in silent films --- ie, . 1920 in expressionism). It's still worth looking out the window in the early European paintings to talk, as well as Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930) and Carl Gustav dehumidifier "Vampire" (1931). Not rated, but includes that infamous scene of nude bathing and some thinly veiled sexual references that would fare slightly more than PG-13, by today's standards (but could easily have landed dreaded «X», in the 30-ies if it existed then)
