I picked it up in «Danger After Dark» box set and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of Hyde and Gackt. I was expecting a banal horror film, which was a huge Gore-festival with a very bad dialogue. Which is exactly what would have happened if it was made in America. Instead, I was intrigued by the good development of the characters, and the way that Sho (Gackt) develops through the movie as a man. The acting of both stars is surprisingly good, considering that they are not professional actors and director did an amazing job with all of this, setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards. <br /> <br /> On a side note, the performance of Taro Yamamoto was very strange. The only movie that I saw him in the Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo anvil, and in this film he seems the exact opposite of this. Toshio bright, exuberant and hyper, which acts as a sort of comic with his antics. Shogo was a big tough guy on the island, which killed, not thinking anything about it. Thus, to watch him work, if you are familiar with Battle Royale, you will be very surprised by it. <br /> <br /> But do not be thrown off the annotation on the back of the box, because it is not really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire in it. character that Gajda vampire almost background the fact that really going on in the foreground, and you guys are going to love the last scene. It really moves the image at certain points, photos is really well done. This is definitely something to take the next time you are in Blockbuster.
