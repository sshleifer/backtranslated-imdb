My comment would be added to the section RELEASE DATE, but I could not find a place for him. I was very surprised that this film was released in the US in February 1955, I saw it in the theater "first run" in Washington, DC, in March 1958, I wonder when it was re-released, or some kind of problem? In my opinion, this film is a very easy game, but it has some of the classic characters. John McIntyre makes a bang-up job as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief. Walter Brennan makes essentially the same role he did in the Red River years ago. And, in my opinion, James Stewart gives as a wonderful spectacle as he ever did. I saw this film half a dozen times or more, and never tire of seeing his side again. Photos and landscapes are gorgeous, and offers a significant amount of entertainment for one hour and thirty-six minutes.
