I went to see the Finnish movie, and I must say that this is one of the best films I've seen this year. The intrigue consists of 5-6 different stories, everything happens on the same day in a small Finnish town. Stories come together very well, in the end, reminiscent, perhaps, a little away Tarantino films are made. Most of the actors performed very well, that is certainly needed in the real dramas of this type. I especially liked acting on Sanna Hietala, leading actress, and Juha Kukkonen. By the way I noticed that IMDB has received incorrect information about Sanna. Her name, as you can see in my review;) NOT Heikkila, but Hietala.
