So we compromised. It was quite a magical film, I liked art direction (it felt much more "real" than most children's films), and the costumes were not too mannered. Subsidiaries were not bad actors to observe (adult performances diverged toward the cheese). It was great that they showed how the bullied child bullies others, as well as children who are to hooliganism. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many adults would like to see it for yourself, but it's a great movie to take the child to. And as «Barnyard», apparently attended by more than 100 children at the same time I am very pleased that we have chosen the rarely attended the show "worm" instead.
