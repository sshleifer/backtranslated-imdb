Only once in a while we get the R-rated comedy that gets the time and attention of everyone. It is even more rare case when a critic like. I have just returned from a 40-year-old Virgin, and I can honestly say it was one of the biggest laughs in my life. I went to the show at 10:35 and every line was filled. Not only that everyone was laughing their asses all the time until the end. It's two hours of non-stop laughter. I dare you to see this movie and not laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. Forty years old, and he was a virgin. However, for this simple, five-second joke, we gave a deep, complex plot, which is not only one of the funniest you will ever witness, but there are real lessons behind him. Steve Carell stars as Andy Stitzer, The 40 Year-Old Virgin. We know Steve Carell as, in my opinion, one of the best scenes of all time thieves. Theft of funny scenes from Bruce Almighty and Anchorman especially, Steve Carell has come a long way in the end, and with pride, given his time to shine as a star. No one will forget his name as soon as they witness this pervasively funny, gut-busting, roll-to-be fun comedy. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film is not 100% stupid. Brilliant Writing Judd Apatow and Steve Carell actually has a purpose, and it's not just one hell of a story to tell. For being rude and vulgar non-stop ride of the film it comes to an important lesson to be learned. Although not presented in the best possible way, the film gives us more than a purely enjoyable time. Her gut ruin relationships will have you laughing constantly until the end, while at the same time we can see the real life struggle of people like Andy and his fellow officers. End could not be better. Moreover, it delivers what we promised, but it gives one of the most memorable numbers finishing comedy never seen. It would be ideal if there was Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson cameoing there is, but you can not win them all, now you can. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think, as Roger Ebert put it, Catherine Keener gives an excellent performance as an inexplicable Trichet, one woman Andy's heart is really for. Not only that, it also gives us a laugh, but it's crazy to see how bright it warms up the story. She was cast in the role of excellence, and it and Karel are stunning, not to mention hilarious chemistry on screen. <br /> <br /> The Canadian ratings-wise, again, Ontario is slipping from 14A, and British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba all slapped 40-year-old Virgin with 18a. The same thing happened with the four brothers, in my opinion, the second best film of the year, and I can honestly say that I love Ontario, more and more for it. For all you fellow teenagers there in the United States: Good luck sneaking in! <br /> <br /> In general, Steve Carell gives one I've ever seen the funniest performances, and almost everyone in the cast extends to the non-stop laughter. Everyone will love the 40 Year-Old Virgin this summer, and I encourage everyone to see it as fast as humanly possible. This is the best comedy of the year, hands down. He beats around the The Longest Yard, The Wedding Crashers, and, of course, and Apatow's last memorable comedy Karel, Anchorman. <br /> <br /> This is a comic masterpiece deserves a significant amount of praise from the critics, who were loving it. Every one of my favorite critics loved it, and he deserves a place on the IMDb Top 250 immediately. Steve Carell is a huge star. See one of the brightest summer now! <br /> <br /> My rating :. 9/10 <br /> <br /> Objectively ?? 9/10 <br /> <br /> Subjectively ?? 10/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
