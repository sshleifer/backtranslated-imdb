I expected that this film will be a mediocre 1930 novel. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins it back at the end. It was not like that at all. Clark Gable plays a con artist Eddie with all his characteristic charisma and mischievous eyebrow funds. He is hiding from the police when he breaks into Ruby (Jean Harlow) 's apartment to find her covered in bubbles in the bath, no less. Instant chemistry.She system plays hard to get for a while, but she can only resist a smile for so long. The heat between them is obvious, and there are some scenes that certainly pre-production code! If blackmail is a bad job, and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for the "problem girls", she was unhappy and, thanks to its neighbor in the grinding room, gives her, begins to believe that Eddie never would come to her. Harlow plays a hard-nosed, fast-talking Ruby perfectly. She never lets Gable get all the good lines! There is a particularly touching scene with her playing "their song" on the piano, which operated perfectly. The last fifteen minutes I cry every time. Really sweet romance.
