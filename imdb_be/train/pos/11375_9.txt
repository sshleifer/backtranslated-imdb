This film tells the amazing story of the history and compassion. With careful description of crime scenes in the lead researcher of mental health, you will be charmed. It is absolutely necessary to see for those interested in forensic science. Interpol relationships and how agencies work together, also great. It does not ever done too. I recommend it for those who are interested in Russian history, too. How does the police with a political party is that it was ... It's really fun and exciting. Beautiful setting. It's been a while since I saw this film for the first time. This does not diminish its impact. Not too dramatic or graphics, it leaves plenty of fantasy, well, you'll see.
