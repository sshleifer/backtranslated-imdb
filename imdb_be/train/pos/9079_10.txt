This show will be a success, because it appeals to all adults, regardless of where they are in their relationship. As a man married for 26 years, I empathize with the character of Patrick Warburton: he loves his wife, but he believes that she knows that. I also enjoy his monotonous delivery; It never gets too excited or too low. A good ensemble of characters. It will be a good addition to the lineup Monday night. <br /> <br /> I do not know how David Spade is in his role. He is best enjoyed in small doses. It also seems a little old to still be trolling for women. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the pilot, and I'm looking forward to see how the series develops.
