"Return of the Jedi" is often remembered for what he did wrong, not what he did the right thing, and that's a shame, because the last chronological contribution to the Star Wars saga is a vivid example of the epic narrative. He turned all the storylines previous films in a grand finale, and it does so very convincingly <br /> <br /> Yes, there Ewoks -. Cute and cuddly bears, which may have served to expand the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle of the film tend to slow down a bit. But the last hour is probably the best piece of the whole saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most famous villain in movie history. <br /> <br /> Return of the Jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the storyline of Darth Vader (who went from slightly implausible in "The Empire Strikes Back" very convincing here) exciting discovery in the palace of Jabba the masterly performance of Ian McDiarmid as Emperor, Luke finally comes into its own, permit Solo and Leia's romantic, and extremely powerful final moments of Endor month. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are small irritants. But they provoke generation of moviegoers who have already managed to find fault with each scene. It has a charming and moving piece of cinema, which also serves as a great final chapter. This is not a "good" movie - it's fantastic!
