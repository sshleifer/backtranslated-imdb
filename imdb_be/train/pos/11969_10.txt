I loved this show growing up, and I still watch the first season DVD at the age of 19 today. What can I say? I grew up in the house, as well as one-on Full House. I had a dad, two sisters and a dog. I think the only difference is that I have not lived with my uncle and my father's best friend. Also, I grew up with my mother in the house. I do not know what I would have done without notice on television. I think Stephanie (played Suitin), D.J. (Playing sister Candace Kirk Cameron) and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can relate to each of them, because I am the middle child in my family, like Steph, I'm a younger sister, Michelle, and I have an older sister as D.J. I really like how the show is always a moral values, because I do not really like any of the OC, as shown today. I love comedy Full House, too. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Denis (Bob Saget) funny Uncle girls, each father and father respectively. The story goes that, after the girls mother dies, Deni's best friend Joe and his brother-in-law, Jesse move to help raise the children. Three men are trying to raise three young girls = fun. Each character in the Full House is full of heart, funny, and really believable. Joey aspiring comedian with a child's heart and soul. Jesse cool, motorcycle-riding, tough guy uncle, who softened his three nieces, and later, his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin from Summerville). Both children and adults will love this show. Guaranteed.
