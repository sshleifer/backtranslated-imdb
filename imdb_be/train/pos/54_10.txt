The main room has a deal with a Columbine-like shooting the middle school, but instead of hashing over by the film reflects the emergence of the consequences and what happened to the rest of the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * shooting itself regarded as a foregone conclusion, no filming, except the reaction is almost a teenager Special Forces commando after high school shooting killer. The film has three main characters; Detective investigates a crime is not guilty is not left exposed and two teenage girls survived the incident, he plays a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps. <br /> <br /> The two girls, who have nothing in common except the shooting belongs together because of him, and drama ensues. <br /> <br /> Erika Christensen, although only 24 have been around the block so that viewers of the film pretty much familiar with its solid and reliable action style. Busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and generally I do not know, blew me away with its preferred dramatic power and presence on screen. This girl has been a part of. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, and it connects to you with an intimate focus on the still fragile relations between the two traumatize the girl. Gus Van Sant's Elephant (2003), although it is well, it seems almost superficial and scanty in comparison with home room when it comes to dramatic talent and acting skills. I can see this film got very little time on the screen and the exposure - so much more loss for so traumatized America <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten.
