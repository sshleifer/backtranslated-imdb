I was looking for the name of this film for many years. I was 14 when I think that it was shown on television in 1983. All I remember was it about the teen girl, alone, having survived the crash and survive in the Amazon. I remember how people were looking for her (family), and that she knows how to take care of themselves --- it tells a story, and I remember very well about it, knowing that mistakes have been under her skin. I do not remember much else about this film, and I want to see him again - if it is the same one - and if some of you have a copy, could you write me at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I would be interested to reach a copy to see if it's actually the same movie that I remember. He has been featured on Thanksgiving Day (USA) in 1983, and I was going through their own issues, and this film is very much influenced me. Thank you in advance!
