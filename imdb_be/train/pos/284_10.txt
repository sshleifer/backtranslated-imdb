one and only season only live here in Australia, and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I love it! All the story lines are so good! and it is much more realistic view of teenagers and family life today. but he still has strong family values ​​sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were real, and it really attracted you to the show. the show is mainly about the family called "Days" and their lives. Family Day was Abby (my mother), Jack Day (daddy), Natalie Day (sports daughter), Cooper day (outsider's son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). daily episodes of his life, with Coopers point of view on things around it. I loved cooper his understanding through out the show was just wonderful. He was definitely my favorite character. it ended so many things he could have continued, I really bored one more season was not done. it was a great show, I'm going to miss.
