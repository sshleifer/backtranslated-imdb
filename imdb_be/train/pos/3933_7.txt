The problem with an image in real life the individual is that the performance can be good, but it still does not work when the audience does not believe that the actor portrays a man. This is the main problem with "Young Mr. Lincoln" Henry Fonda gives an amazing performance, but it was hard to believe that Abraham Lincoln was polite as Fonda reflects its <br /> <br /> it, in fact. courtroom drama with young Abraham Licoln at the forefront. Is this a true story, I do not know, but if it is not, then why tell him, using Lincoln as the central character? Nothing is. In the film, Lincoln protects the two young men accused of the murder. <br /> <br /> There really is not a lot in the film, and as a result, it seems pretty empty. I wanted more of the plot and character development. the duration of the film 100 minutes, but it does not feel like it. There are several small scenes with Lincoln and blossoming relationship with Mary Todd, but they appear to be superficial. <br /> <br /> Act good all around, but as I said, fund performance works as a symbol, but not Abraham Lincoln. I just do not believe that this Lincoln that suave. However, he has a great voice, when he needed to, for example, when he persuades the drunken mob law to allow the accused to stand trial, but reflects Lincoln Fonda too obediently. The other characteristics are tough, though, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the defendant's mother. She's a good woman, we can really feel. Simple and uneducated, but very sweet; we can understand why Lincoln wanted to help her. <br /> <br /> John Ford seems to think about this film is epic, and at the time of his release, he probably was. But even then, there's just not enough material to present it as such. <br /> <br /> It is a good watch, but not classic.
