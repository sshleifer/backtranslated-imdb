A great movie with great projections of Zack & Locke. These displeasure (and I) arrived at the Garibaldi Station. (All due respect for Jerry Doyle, but in seasons 4 and 5 I lost sympathy for the character.) It did not take long to start criticizing Zack (which I like best on the show), and take responsibility . I'm sure Zack could handle. SoulHunter plot is fascinating, especially when you consider that in the sky, as does Zack. Humor complements it nicely. 10/10
