Nightmare insomnia was incredibly interesting, well-made film. I loved how she just throws you in the subconscious mind of the protagonist without fuss spectator ... the action was at the highest level - to be honest, I would watch Dominic Monaghan read a phone book! - but all the others, especially young girls, was great as well. I was very impressed with the look of the film, too. As a rule, "independent films" have a grainy, I of blast-it-on-my-camcorder look at them, but this director knows what she's doing. Lighting, cinematography ... the quality of work. I'm looking forward to the full-length works from Tess Nanavati!
