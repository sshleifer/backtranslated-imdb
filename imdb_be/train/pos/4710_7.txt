How parody movies go, there are a few that are worth the time and energy. but with the recent surge in unpleasant parodies, such as a date movie and return, is a breath of fresh air to go back and rediscover the genuinely funny farce Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> After his mother did not have the end of medical problems, little Johnny is going to work for the mob. What is a deposit of Series jokes, most of whom are working, there are, however, occasional failures. But foreign gangster who can not learn the American language (profanity wise, at least), the enemy gangster with a penchant for shooting his mouth off (... once!), Younger brother to the DA which is to get Johhny threateningly, and a hot young starlet hot for my tastes Johnny busy. <br /> <br /> And the audience is busy laughing, for the most part, because every gangster movie clich√©s pricks talented cast and decent writing. <br /> <br /> Or is not perfect by a long shot, but it is definitely good for a smile on a bad day.
