This is the second part of «The Animatrix," a collection of animated short films that tell us a bit more about «The the Matrix" world. <br /> <br /> One thing we learn how people and machines could not work and live together. «The Matrix» It's a little history lesson in the world. Not as good as the first part ( «The Final Flight of the Osiris"), but still quite interesting.
