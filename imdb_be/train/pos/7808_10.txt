This is a film that everyone should watch. Not to mention the increase in crucial moments (while South Africa is on the path to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now), it's great aims while Denzel Washington gives, in my opinion, the best performance in his car 'EASURES so far. Kline also gives good results, though, may not be as stunning as Washington. John Thaw also puts in a good turn as chief of police. <br /> <br /> There are so many possible areas where apartheid film can fall down, but it would have been avoided. It would be easy to just display the white man, as the bad guys, and black people as the good guys, but Attenborough did not. Of course there were some white characters who seemed by nature evil, such as the captain on the uprising in Soweto, but add additional dimensions for all the characters make the film unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the film as it is, but I think you need a full two and a half hours to tell the whole story, because actually it's incredible one. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie is that the funeral of Steve Biko. When the whole crowd begins to sing the South African national anthem, it's probably one of, if not the most moving scenes I've seen <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie already :. See. It may not be comfortable to view, but it is definitely worth it.
