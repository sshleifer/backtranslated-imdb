I will not, as a rule, not too in a particular show (except OC & Desperate Housewives ... hey, I'm 20!), But not kidding, after one episode Reunion I was hooked. <br /> <br /> I can not even say how bummed I am that this time interval counter to Bush's speech last night, because I was really looking forward to the 1987 episode, which now will air next Thursday. Again, the conflict was not profitable, because, being a new show, it should create the following and having a second episode pulled week kills some momentum. <br /> <br /> However, television is not always to be Emmy worthy to be enjoyable. I do not expect Reunion to take home any prizes, but I expect that it will be able to capture my attention the whole season. Always watching the first few episodes of your favorite show years later? Sometimes you wonder how you ever caught. Character takes some time. <br /> <br /> one episode for each year the idea is excellent, in my opinion. The only show I can think of doing something like that has 24, each episode is an hour ... and with a rich events of the year is more realistic than the day eventful! Please give this show a shot. Relax on the art form ... it's just TV!
