This film there are some things that are pretty strange. Firstly, it must be based on a true story. This in itself is surprising that several tornadoes hit the same city at night in the autumn in Nebraska. I wonder if the real name of the city was close to the «Blainsworth» (which is named for the city in the film). There Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is a city that begins with Blains-something. <br /> <br /> It shows the slowest moving tornado on record in what he saw, where the boys are in the house. On the other hand, the scene where the TV is inaccurate based on fact. Before Doppler radar and weather radios, we were taught that if you turned the TV to a specific channel (not the cable) and established the brightness just right, you could say, if there was a tornado coming. The problem was that by the time you could hear it. <br /> <br /> Since I know something about the Midwest tornado, he made this film for me to enjoy. I love him more than Twister. I mean, give me a break, there's no way you can make it through and the F5, chained himself to the pipe in the well house.
