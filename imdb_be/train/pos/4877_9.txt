In fact, one particular person / character is not "right", but my resume includes power line of the film. And all this is achieved without any unusual movements of the camera and / or a large production sets, but with a long history and a very (believable) and good actors that carry the story (arc). <br /> <br /> You can call it a companion piece to the great Japanese cinema / movies (such as Tokyo, history, etc.), not so much the story wise, of course, but most of the mood of the wise! Great performances, nuances in the performances that are truly gems. If you are ready to experience the touching story and want to see the film you emotionally touching than this one go. As you have noticed (and many of my reviews) I do not get into the story. There are places here in IMDb, where you can look those up, I'm not alone in the history of the spoiler at all!
