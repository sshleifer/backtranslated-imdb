But the most interesting in the journey. <br /> <br /> I found this film to be very pleasant, not only the behavior is very easy on the eyes, the humor of the supporting cast, and jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliche romantic comedy. But the fact that this sweet story, a message about finding your one true love and rings true in many ways. <br /> <br /> In the dialog box and dead-on action is well done on all parts, and top for comic effect. Bulgari scene is worth its weight in gold, actress there worthy of an honorable mention! For those who have prepared him for what is predictable - If you want to film with twists that keep you guessing ... you want a thriller. This romantic comedy ... it touched my heart, and I realized that I was lucky enough to find their true love in my life, and it was worth every effort along the way. <br /> <br /> Most of the date of the movie, a great movie for a happy cry ...
