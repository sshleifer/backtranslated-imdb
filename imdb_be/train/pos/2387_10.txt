I have a six month old baby at home, and from time to time she fights sleep really bad. One morning she was particularly hard time getting to sleep when scribbles preventers song came on TV she stopped I cried almost instantly, and for the rest of the show was content. I was sitting in her bouncy chair and watched as she pushed her feet, waving his arms, and actually laugh at this show. She kept her entertained and happy all the time. I also got a video of them, so that at the time when my little one excited I have something to calm her down. Of course, late at night when she awakens with colic dazzled doodles preventers are not her cup of tea, but they sure do come in handy if I need a little time to do housework, etc .. The biggest surprise of the scribbles preventers that my child does not even look like a tanker it would be better in the field, playing with a toy or toy with our small poodles than watch more TV, doodles preventers already completely captured her attention. I do not know if it will continue to love them in the future, but for now it is attached.
