I found this film very well in all areas. Action was brilliant of all the characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey. Tramell character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted in a minute. The plot is interesting, though, this film is more for the mind, playing between the main characters and how Catherine continued her letter with new ways and turns to her novels. The installation was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the film is that mysterious, thriller, as a masterpiece. Go this film now, he deserves better than what he got from the audience, was misled by some faulty terrible reviews of the movie (before even started), ..... you will not regret it when you go to see this ...
