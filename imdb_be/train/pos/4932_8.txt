The panic in the streets Widmark plays the U.S. Navy doctor who has your week coarsely chopped the corpse containing plague. As a police officer Paul Douglas correctly points out that the guy died from two bullets in the chest. This is not a problem, then the two of them become unwitting partners in an attempt to find the killers and those who are exposed to the disease. <br /> <br /> As noted by any number of people, for some reason, the director Elia Kazan did not throw the small details to someone, it sounds as if they are from Louisiana. Having been to New Orleans, where the story takes place, I can attest to that personally. Widmark and his wife Bel Geddes can be released because, as a doctor of the Navy, he may be appointed, but for those who are immigrants does not work. <br /> <br /> But there is a plague, and the news kept secret, the New Orleans PD starts the net from the underworld of the city. The dead man came out a ship from Europe, and he had the thieves connection. New Orleans nerd played by Jack Palance jumps to a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and begins to disturb the dead guy's cousin, who is starting to show signs of plague. Palance has received rave reviews in the first film, where he received the notification. <br /> <br /> Personally, my favorite in this movie Mostel. It happened right in front of Mostel was blacklisted, and at this time he made a specialty of playing tough guys is that really toadies. He plays the same role in the film, Humphrey Bogart, The Enforcer. Unfortunately, I can determine the kind with Mostel in this last chase scene where he and Palance chase down Widmark, Douglas, and half of the New Orleans police. Seeing weight Zero challenge trying to keep up with Palance was something else, because I'm kind of in the league Zero now HEFT department. <br /> <br /> Kazan kept the action takes place in a good clip, there's very little down time in this film. If there is any less would be Indiana Jones. Panic in the streets won an Oscar for best original screenplay this year. <br /> <br /> Kazan also made good use of the waterfront of New Orleans and the French Quarter. Some of the same types of shots later used on the waterfront. In fact, the panic in the streets about people not screaming, when they really have to be in their own interest. Very like again on the waterfront. <br /> <br /> The panic on the streets makes all the proud who are associated with him. Now why could not Elia Kazan to get some decent New Orleans sound of people in small roles.
