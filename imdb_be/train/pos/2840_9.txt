I just saw a press screening of the film, and I was pleasantly surprised. Not often does this mean that I get to see all of my favorite actors in the same film at the same time. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the scene pick pocket, and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden together. I think that their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together Elimination Chamber. My favorite scene was far away (so strange) piece of Brett Ratner ... Without giving too much, I'll just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging ... <br /> <br /> The old were really well together and you really have the impression that they have spent their lives together. <br /> <br /> And Chris Cooper Ethan Hawke and the segments packed hit with surprises that seem realistic and similar to the experience I had in the big apple. The entire movie is a great place to take a date ... especially if you already love the city. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next in the city of love.
