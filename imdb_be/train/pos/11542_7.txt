The first time I saw it, I did not laugh too much. At that time I was only fifteen years old, and I thought that maybe some of the deep humor was too mature for me to understand at the time. I had the same reaction when I saw it for the second time in a few months ago, and this time, it was because the foiled suicide attempt Felix beginning of the movie kind of dark cinema a bit. This scene has done some things, I said Oscar and Felix made later in the film, it seems unnecessarily cruel, and their personal conflicts were not as funny as they could be. If I had not known the story, I would be concerned that some of the tricks of Oscar Felix could push him over the edge. As it was, it did not make me laugh or smile, like a TV show with Klagmenom and Tony Randall did. Nevertheless, on the whole, a very good movie and it has created one of the greatest comedies on television. 7 10.
