I first saw this movie about ten years ago and I thought it was pretty funny, actually. It was not as bad as some critics made it out to be. The fact that it was written, usually reliable John Hughes shows that you can expect at least some funny dialogues. (By the way, I also think, Weird Science is quite good, which was also written at lightning speed Hughes) <br /> <br /> The film has a very bright look to it, using all the primary colors -. Reds, yellows, etc. - which makes it look absolutely unique. The cast is also quite good. Prim bunny Packard and devil demons Delores Salk are allocated. <br /> <br /> The film is, of course, by a little, but I personally prefer it to the rest of the series of "libel".
