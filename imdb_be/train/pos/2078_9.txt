This film adaptation of S. Pearl Buck is certainly a classic. This Hollywood epic, that is all, a great Hollywood movie is: birth, death, happiness, sadness, excitement, despair, and so on. There is only one thing that annoys me. I know that it was a sign of the time, but neither of the two main characters played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor, and he does an excellent job as Van Loon, owner of the farm in China. Luise Rainer plays Olan. She did not even look in Chinese! I think she was trying to get the role, but they need to put Anna May Wong as. I know why they did not, and Mrs. Rainier is very good in the film, but they are struggling to make it "real". Stillm his great film, especially if you read the book (I was in high school, a few decades ago). Its a must see, just look beyond the casting. I think you can.
