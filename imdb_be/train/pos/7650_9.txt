Wow, I loved this film. It may not have the means and the advertising that the latest Hollywood blockbusters get, but it packs an emotional punch twice. Tale revolves around this one family from Utah, and is the link between the people in the family, which provide the film with his jab. Main drive (Giovanni Ribisi) is playing its role very well, or at what time it will leave you to believe that it works all of your senses. It's his brother (Elias Koteas), who stole the show for me, though. When the two were in scenes together, they limited their lines off of each other, giving fantastic views. The large cast, a great film.
