I first saw this movie years ago and continue to watch it a few times a year when I have the opportunity. It's on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics. If anyone tell you that it is stupidity or obsolete, ignore them ... this film for those who love laughter and music. Dancing is not so important in this film, as in other films Astaire as comedy acts and shine. See this film if you can, it can be easy, but it's still entirely amusing. So I know that many people hate the black and white movies, they think old movies can be really funny, this film has to make them change their minds. None of my friends can not watch this movie without being at least slightly amused. The only problem with the film: Fred Astaire singing without dancing. It can be a great performer and a capable singer, but he just does not captivates and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. Comedy gets a bit cliche at times, but vaudevillesque burns characteristics G and G Allen is just perfect for the part and can satisfy those looking for some easy laughs. Give this film a chance, even if you do not like old movies, this film may appeal to the ridiculous one.
