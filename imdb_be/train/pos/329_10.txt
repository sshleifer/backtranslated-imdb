Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or any Greek mythological stories on the subject), it is in my opinion, is the best of all. Almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions, such as the absence of Scylla and Charybdis, and the fact that Eumaeus the swineherd recognizes Odysseus disguised in his hut - realistic acting and real scenery and costumes contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece, and not some Hollywoodish or sword-and sandals B-Flick. Despite the fact that the dialogue and subtitles entirely in Italian, when one is familiar with the story, he can still make heads and tails of what is happening and what the actors say (if you have a nice comfortable text Odyssey on hand) . At least, I did, and so much so that it inspired me to study Italian language in order to better appreciate the film more.
