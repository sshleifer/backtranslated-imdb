Return to the cabin on the lake, perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original. He would have a black sense of humor, a good thriller, a good looking girl, and of course, Psycho Killer. What are we missing? I think nothing. In addition, we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity, because it was made for television. In addition to being one of the best sequels, this is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family. It recommended for all.
