Observation of David & Bathsheba is a much better way to get your copy of the Bible, which is going to Sunday school. Despite the scenario, sometimes unintentionally funny film very interesting. the studio system had its flaws, but he spared no expense when production called generous. Peck reflects King David as strong, but the tormented poet who makes what is tantamount to murder in the bed of sexual Bathsheba, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey as the prophet Nathan delivers his usual surly and February performance. Look at the silent screen star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and the young Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Hooray for the Old Testament and in Hollywood.
