What can I say about this? This is another horror flick in Hollywood with a very high budget ($ 80 million) .Not scary at all, it offers us a few thrills and a really terrible sequence of the skeleton in fireplace.A lot of computer-generated special effects and nothing more.Catherine Zeta-Jones as always pretty, Lili Taylor, also a good actress.The architecture Hill House is amazing, all these monuments, statues, furniture ... Delicious! But I do not like the ending, because it was so luscious.Check is one and form your own opinion about it.I give this picture of 7 out of 10.
