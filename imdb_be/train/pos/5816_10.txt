The first time I saw this "film" I loved him. When I was 11, I was more interested in music and dance. As I grew older, I became more interested in operating as well. While the first half of a retrospective of the career of Michael (from the Jackson 5 to «Bad»), it is still interesting to watch. The sequence «Badder» could be omitted, although the children were very good. "Speed ​​Demon» and «Leave Me Alone» were funny, especially when police said Michael, "I need your autograph right here", after stopping him for a dance in the restricted area of ​​tap dancing. But this «Smooth Criminal», is the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did an excellent job as a nut (and that wild hair). Dancing is perfect, and so the special effects. The only thing I could have done without was the spiders. Any fan of Michael must see if you have not already. I give it 10+!
