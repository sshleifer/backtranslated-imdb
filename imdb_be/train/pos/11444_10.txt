Go to this film beautiful imagery sculptures by Andy Goldsworthy, and treat yourself to a thoroughly enlightening and relaxing. Music perfectly complements the footage, but never draws attention to itself. Some commentators have referred to an interview with the artist Snippets weak point, but think about it: why would you extend it in the movie, you can read the thoughts of Andy detail in his books, or attend one of his finest lectures? This environment is much more appropriate to show the ephemeral nature of the work of the artist, and uses qualified in this respect.
