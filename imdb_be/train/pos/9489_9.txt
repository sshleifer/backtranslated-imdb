I'm not tired, to say that this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place in a fictional country, but obviously we are talking about the Kennedy assassination. Truthful and honest district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by one person Daslow (= Oswald), and although all the other officials want to close the deal, he continuous to investigate with his team. <, Br /> <br /> tightly written script quickly and keeps tension until the end. Just part of the fight against Milgram experiment of power (though not interested in) a little ridiculous. The ending sequence - to explain who Icarus in fact - partly filmed in slow motion and enhanced soundtrack Morricone is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
