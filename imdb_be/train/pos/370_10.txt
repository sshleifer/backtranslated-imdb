I saw this movie at least fifty times, and after seeing him last week for the first time in a long time, I still felt it. <br /> <br /> The story itself was incredible, but alive and expertise Spielberg fabulous cast including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia earned an Oscar nomination for her short but powerful image Nettie. <br /> <br /> You will feel all the human emotions while watching this film. I was laughing, crying, and angry. Like most great films, he looked at the Academy with multiple nominations, but no wins. But this film, no doubt, is definitely one of the best movies of all time.
