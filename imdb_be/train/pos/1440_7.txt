I liked the quiet noir of the first part, acting on Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. Moodiness to install and Pol juxtaposition of old and young idealistic embodiment. I want Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the film; It was a serious and attractive character. The film was derailed for me when the mayor's aide poked mafioso starting to get to the bottom of something his boss obviously did not want him to interfere. No one in their right mind would not meet mafioso on an abandoned pier in the landfill. Here the story was implausible. What I do not understand why the police and Vito have a bullet when the latter delivers information that can bring down a corrupt judge?
