dead the final nightmare of the film Freddy just terrible and anxious, like any other A Nightmare on Elm Street, and it has a comedic essence of it, so there are all the other movies, but how can anyone possibly say that you can not find to Freddy Krueger scary when you were supposed to meet this man in the dream you would not find it even more scary to the comic essence of him, because his comedy shows that he does not care about the murder, which he considers very funny and Freddie also comic plays mind games with them, which in its own way is very disturbing, using their comic way, I think that makes horror A Nightmare on Elm Street what they are today, writers are very smart makes Kruger comic and terrifying as oppose to Jason Voorhees, who does not say anything and did not get wit a real scare their victims , this film is about as good as the mind gets Freddie and I would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor and a way "Do not fall asleep! ".
