I mean that in a good way, believe me. The truth of life, it is not. Oirish whole thing gets some kind of fat, but you enjoy throwing then-Flinn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. All is well. I also enjoyed seeing Mike Mazurka-he, of course, played a boxer, what else? Typical forties swarming also perform a push / familiar faces and fast-paced scenes, one after the other. <br /> <br /> Flynn well as Gentleman Jim, you'll never get past the one dimensional look at him or the others here, I think ,, but that's OK, it's a cartoon, and wanted to please, and that's all. Boxing scenes were pretty good, vaudeville logging Ward Bond riot act, and you Hadda as we see all these billyclub With Bobby come racing to the scene several times. <br /> <br /> In fact alotta fun Flynn on a roll at the time, and it's clear why the audience loved it. <br /> <br /> *** Outta ****
