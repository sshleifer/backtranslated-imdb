I'm sure would like to see the resurrection of Seahunt up the series with the technology they have today, it would return a small disturbance in me.I grew up on a black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke was my hero each week.You has my vote for the return of a new sea hunt.We need a change of pace in the TV, and it will work for the world under water adventure.Oh by the way thanks for the output as it is, to see a lot of points of view on the TV and many movies.So any ole, as I believe that I got what I want say.Would be nice to read some more plus Punk th of the sea has hunt.If rhyme would be 10 lines you would allow me to introduce, leave me be in doubt and leave me, if this is so, then I have to go so lets do it.
