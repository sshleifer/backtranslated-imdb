Two great comedians in great Neil Simon movie based on his hit play. <br /> <br /> A great combination, especially if the comedians in question, Matthau and Burns. No wonder why Burns won an Oscar for it; it is as sharp and as funny as ever. And Matthau every bit his match, if a little more naughty <br /> <br /> This is familiar territory Simon :. Two old vaudeville partners reunite for a TV special, but still can not stand each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> it is a delight to watch these two neurotransmitter at each other, their scenes together make this film an absolute delight. Myself, I especially enjoyed the "knock, knock, knock / ENTERÂ» scene. And if you're a fan or Burns or Matthau, you will enjoy it too. <br /> <br /> In fact, you will enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Pour a little "Sunshine" in your life.
