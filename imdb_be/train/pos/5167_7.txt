I must say that the worst part of the film was the first half-hour. I was very confused about who is who. For example, Bill Paxson character had long hair and was wearing a jacket. Then, when all the men come into the camp it turned out to be a character who looked like Bill Paxson, but it was not. I said, where Bill Paxson? Then there was the guy with his girlfriend. He said that she was 21. It was to be a 20-year Reunion (Alan Arkin) camp director the most memorable. Later, this same girl to interact and talk about their experiences in the camp. This does not make any sense. She would have been one year. Nevertheless, the film turned out to be pretty good. Kevin Pollak was a good guy who always teased. One guy was a complete narcissus, and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as an old-style camp director, who admits he has grown out of touch with today's young people. The best part was that none of the grown camper had successes in life. None of them had a very great career. It seemed a very real life. The film has been compared to The Big Chill. In a sense, it was not as much fun as Big Chill, but it was a lot more realistic. Thus, even if you start, it promises that the film eventually turns into a pretty good one.
