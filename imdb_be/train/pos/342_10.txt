I gave it an 8 only because he was such a low voice ... it is certainly really a 5.5 ..... Mmmm .. it was kind of a bloody, was a nice, shallow characters, and it was a few really hot babes in it. I like the eclectic murderer, because he did not kill people just like every time ... sometimes boring.
