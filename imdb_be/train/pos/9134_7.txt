«Purple Rain» has never been a favorite of critics, but it is a cult - and deserves to be. If you are a fan of Prince is for you. <br /> <br /> The main plot of the Prince saw his abusive parents in himself and he fell in love with the girl. Believe it or not, this film does not only sing and dance. There are a lot of intense scenes, and it's touching. Sometimes it comes off is ridiculous, but when it works it really works. Very horrible. <br /> <br /> No one can really act in the film. Each of the one side acts Prince as «The Time» and «Vanity 6". However, he adds the charm of the film. Someday Prince on the screen, he kindles it, and it's fun to see it in its commercial peak. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, go and see if you like a prince like me. If you are not a fan of it will make you one.
