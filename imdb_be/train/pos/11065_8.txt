This comedy with great underlying pain and sorrow succeed where most others fail. There have been many films of this genre with the more well-known actors who are trying to reach that elusive mixture, which does not come in any depth and mobility that. This, of course, because the exceptional cast with great performances by Reg Rogers Ally Sheedy seems so spontaneous, that the reality of their characters quickly capture your interest and emotions and keep them throughout the film. Firstly, the effect seems pretty off-the-wall and windy, but one gradually discovers that these two quite helpless Damaged people are desperate and are reluctant to try to heal itself, even if reluctantly, through each other. Rogers heartbreaking expression facial pain and numbness outbursts Sheedy so eloquent that one feels them as one sees them. You will take care of these two nice, but deeply afflicted, and hope that they will succeed, because it is in doubt, and everyone hanging on a tenuous emotional flow. I hope viewers will be able to see more Reg Rogers Ally Sheedy as this film proves its merit as a very experienced actors beyond doubt.
