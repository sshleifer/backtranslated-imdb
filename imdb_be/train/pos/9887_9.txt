«Erendira» film from Mexico, which is rarely talked about. The film exists only in VHS format of poor quality. It's a shame that this film was not given a DVD release. «Erendira» extraordinary and magnificent with his magical realism. "Erendira" is based on a story from the novel "100 Years of Solitude." Erendira constantly daydreaming and accidentally burned the house of her grandmother. Her evil grandmother, played by Irene Papas, forcing her into prostitution to pay for the damages. The whole city gets a piece of Erendira, so to speak. Although the subject matter sounds harsh, the film does not exploit sexuality. This is done in a mature artistic style. The film also has some amazing costumes. Some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most are the origami birds that turn into true birds, as well as a golden orange with a diamond in the center. Erendira strange film, which even managed to throw in humor. This is definitely a film that deserves a special DVD release. As they say in Espanol, «Es Muy Muy Bien !!! Excellente!
