I realized a few days ago that the creators of this film put the pun in its name. This film is not primarily about the act of "Riding Giants", but most of the people who are the giants of the sport, riding giants to change the emphasis. <br /> <br /> As a teenager, I lived on the wedge block, one of the most highly destructive and Bodysurfing best places in the world. I was a 15-to-18-foot surf, and went, and was killed on the 10 and 12-foot waves in many cases. This experience is why I am in complete awe of the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clarke, apparently normal mortal could get away with riding Maverick himself for more than a decade is beyond my reach. The first rule of security of any water sport "Never surf / dive / swim on their own." He went to the place where normal people would not, and lived to tell about it. I would not go there if the water was 75 degrees, and sharks all left. <br /> <br /> In warm water world: the first shot of the waves at Jaws always makes tingling of the skin over the entire body. It's not just the terrible waves, they are unregulated bowel evacuation waves. If we see, Laird Hamilton is not only to survive the 40-to-60-foot waves (I can hardly enter the figures), but actually working face, as a day of fun in Rincon, I was stunned. There is a dedication and focus in big waves riders which is comparable with any in the world. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. I gave it a 9 instead of 10 only because he neglects to mention that there is a great big wave riders in the world outside of Hamilton / Kalama crew, and I think they deserve a mention. Splicing in Ken Bradshaw on external log cabins and 10 it!
