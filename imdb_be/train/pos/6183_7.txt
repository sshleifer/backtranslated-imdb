Financially strapped Paramount pulled out all the stops for this entry adjustment 34 stages: a big budget, a great cast, an extravagant production and Mitch Leisen designated as director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley did not work broken focus hammer and murder mystery script, do not deserve to be in the same bin as the worst Charlie Chan first project on the street. I have to believe that the cutting was in the hands of Leisen since a large number of Duke Ellington will be brutally chopped, but that does not mean that we should not see: the number of "sweet marijuana" with a chorus girl is topless mind blower given looming production code, and it also has Ravishing Toby Wing (which, unfortunately, was feeding the terrible line and play a prototype of the dumb blonde) as chorionic hot for otherwise preoccupied with Jack Oakie. Carl Brisson action is bland as Melba Toasts, but it is a competent singer. MacLaglen reaches new plateau as a stereotypical dumb detective. And try to determine the Lucy in the choir. This rate is 7.0 as a curiosity. February 2010 rethink: I recently gave the film one more look, and now I feel that I was wrong to carry no production numbers Busby Berkeley. I can understand the argument for Leisen more realistic figures of production in the context of the story. I still have a huge problem with editing though. The Paramount, the raciest main studio in the city, facing huge problems with the production code at the wrong time in its history, from a financial point of view, and pulled out all the stops for this (also check for 1934 look for beauty). A must see for a preliminary code buff.
