I saw the pilot, when it was first shown, and I'm sure countless fans of "Spirit" hate it because, like Batman, The Green Hornet, and so he took the character in the direction of "camp". But I guess I did not get enough of Batman, because I thought it was interesting, some of the same methods as the show. There are two parts that remain with me. Firstly, if the partner Denny was mortally wounded, and he makes a dramatic speech that he has always advocated for the rights of, and subject to the exact letter of it. Then he says something like, "Boy, I was stupid!" That is his way of telling Danny to become a vigilante instead that he does (although Batman TV appearance). Then there's a scene where he tries to tempt a thief to let him kiss her, but do not be fooled, because he was too honest to kiss her convincing! It was a perfect example of the "camp", who was also "overlooked" for as an actor and actress.
