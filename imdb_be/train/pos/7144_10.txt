I saw a hole in the film and say that it must be the best film in the course of the year. It brings out the child in everyone. I mean, who came up with the idea to have a nasty boy to dig holes as their punishment? Seyker whoever. Despite the fact that the film differs from the book he was still very good. For example Caveman / Stanley had become the biggest out there. Weight-wise and height-wise, but ZigZag / Ricky was higher and armpits / Theodore was more. Also, X-Ray / Rex was supposed to be one of the little boys, but was not. The only thing I did not like about the movie was that the memories were very convincing and long. I'd seen more present than the past, but that's just my opinion. I especially like the work of boys, though. How Squid / Alan, who played Jake M.Smith was supposed to be moody and tough guy. Jake M.Smith performed just and did a great job in this, as did almost all the actors in the holes. So I would say, if you do not see a hole even then you should definitely see it when he comes back, or you'll miss out on Whole Lotta fun.
