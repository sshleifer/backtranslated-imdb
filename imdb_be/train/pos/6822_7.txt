"Opening NightÂ», released in 1977, it is trying to be ambitious production. It is possible only in a truly stunning performance Gena Rowlands. Her character actress Myrtle is not necessarily someone we would like in real life. She is self-absorbed, often unpleasant, and makes life miserable for those around her - in other words, not unlike some of the actresses! Myrtle as a woman on the verge of collapse - we're not quite sure if she fights demons real or imaginary, even though we let in on the secret too early. Rowlands, obviously well directed with the love of her talented husband, actor / director Cassavetes, which plays a role in the film as well. This film is not without its flaws - it is too long, and the last part of the film where Myrtle comes on the scene, while very drunk, it seems almost hard. "Improvisation" in some of the dialogue - at least while on stage - is too long. Some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially Ben Gazarra playing a sleazy producer Myrtle. Joan Blondel character is never fully developed, and I could never understand why she was in the film, except to settle Myrtle. See this movie for only Rowlands - it fascinates everywhere - and it's hard to take my eyes off her, even though you want to from time to time.
