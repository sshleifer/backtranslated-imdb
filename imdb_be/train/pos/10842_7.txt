So I rented a Â«Still Crazy" instead. When I described Hardcore Logo for the guy in the video store, he said, it sounds kind of like another crazy. So I rented it. Was I disappointed? Well, yes, but still crazy focuses on classic rock band, not a punk band, but this is normal. Still Crazy tells the story of amazing fruit, rock band, which broke up in the 70s at the height of his popularity on a big rock festival. Twenty years later, the band members are all trying to make a living, and are given the opportunity to play a concert in the twenty-year anniversary of this festival. They take up the offer and decided to reform on a regular basis, on a tour of Europe in the process. Some pretty funny jokes will come, and all the characters go through subtle changes. Watching this film, you feel more audience carefully edited documentary than a participant. And it's not bad at all.
