This is a good little horror film that fans of indie films really appreciate. It has good acting, a lot of gore, and a decent plot. One of them will remind you of films like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. It is obvious that the budget is not all that great, but the movie really makes up for it with atmosphere and solid projections of actors that seems lacking in many of today's big-budget special effects-filled movies. The film is really moving and there is an excellent direction and good camera work. There's no wasted scenes, so the length of the film a little short. In addition, it seems that the ending leaves a hole to continue, which would be very interesting as well. So grab your popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy it.
