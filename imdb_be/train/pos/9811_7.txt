According to the book The Last of the heroes of the Cowboy, which is about McCrea, Audie Murphy, and Randolph Scott, the author says that Albuquerque was the only film that he personally did not consider, because he claimed that it was lost. If it had not been seen for many years. <br /> <br /> It is good that Western supporters of someone doing some cleaning at Paramount since the seal was apparently found, and now it is on the open market. Albuquerque pretty good western and Scott participates in a family feud with his uncle George Cleveland. <br /> <br /> George Cleveland sends his nephew Randolph Scott with the intention of making it a part of its chartering business, headquartered in the fast-growing village of Albuquerque. Cleveland is more than just a business owner, it is the city boss, which he held in his wheelchair. It even has the sheriff in his pocket. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott Sun cowboy hero in vain. This includes not supporting the family if they are villains. He continues to work in a competing outfit headed by the brother and sister, Catherine Russell Hayden and Craig. <br /> <br /> Cleveland complete a variety of tricks, and he even sent to the west of Mata Hari in the face of Barbara Britton worm her way into the confidence of his rivals. Barbara great as homespun fox, which has developed its own program. <br /> <br /> ancestral home studio Randolph Scott was Paramount, it was there that his first contract with the studio was. Albuquerque marked the last film he ever made for the Paramount, and they gave him good. <br /> <br /> Note also Lon Chaney, Jr., who is the chief protege of George Cleveland, pretty disgusting bully man and Gabby Hayes, who just Gabby Hayes. <br /> <br /> Albuquerque had favorite Republicans across the country in 1948 with the villain as the cities of the boss who rules in a wheelchair. Definition of democracy from a wheelchair made a hash of them four direct presidential elections, and he left. They had high hopes of winning the White House this year, too, but everything went wrong and they had to settle for ersatz boss to get his answer in Albuquerque. I'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair, since there was nothing really out of it in the story. My guess is he was wounded, and played the role is because he had to. <br /> <br /> However Albuquerque should have a great appeal to the GOP market.
