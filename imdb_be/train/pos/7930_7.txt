I'll be honest. I got this movie, so I could make fun of him. I mean, come on, Â«Hood of the Living Dead"? What are the reactions I might have? The fact, however, the film (and its founders) decided he was not going to be made fun of. Instead, he was going to try my best to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And you know what? He came very close. A little less cheese in the incidental music, a little more professionalism in photography, acting as small (as props - love bag Best Buy) ... well, it's not a classic zombie movie genre, but it's still pretty neat little film itself. And action, writing, and walks all over the country better than I would have expected. There's even some decent humor, and two of our findings argue that, in order to decide when the dead really dead zombies. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the low budget (which leaves its fingerprints all over, unfortunately) and almost constant profanity, it can be quite fun in a movie. No, it's not healthy. Yes, it might be better. But the creators, the actors, the crew, they are all trying to make a good movie (instead of camp classics), and is of great importance. mannerism zombie films line a mile long, and thank you guys for entirely by adding to it. <br /> <br /> Kudos Quiroz brothers. I'd like to see what they do next. And hey, someone, give them a budget!
