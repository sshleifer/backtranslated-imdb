This is the perfect ending of the show. The fact that the admiral. Zheynuey was able to make a double switch on the Borg was great. The fact that she allowed herself to be infected, infecting the queen with the "poison" that, in essence, ended Borg was great. The way they finished it also left some, not much, for the reunion movie. However, they bring their "home" and how they did it was fantastic !! It was sad to leave a part of my family. Completing it with Tom and B'Lanna with your child as well as they are included in a quadruple alpha. It was a great way to show a new beginning. It would be nice to have a tour film of any type - just to see where their characters would be today.
