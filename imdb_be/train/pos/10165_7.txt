In fact, my vote is 7.5. In any case, the movie was good, he has the funny details that make it deserve to see it, do not get me wrong, this is not the funniest movie in the world, and it is not even original, because it's the idea that we seen before in other movies, but this one has its own taste, my friend told me that it was a movie for boyfriends ... I do not think that is true, but who cares? Also there is another film that shows us the almost the same subject, Chris Rock is in it, the name of the down to earth people, one of his very funny movie, see how if you want to, and I know that you will agree that Mr.. Rock won with his film. I would have liked that the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher, however, the movie is good.
