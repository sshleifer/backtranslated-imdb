Compelling and innovative! At the beginning of this criminally underrated Whoopi Goldberg flick authors draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and one thousand nine hundred forty-one Orson Welles classic "Citizen Kane." The authors are justified in making such seemingly disparate parallel but the audience watching too often deceived in seeing overly hyped Hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between the two films. The "Citizen Kane" Charles Foster Kane fear and admiration of his colleagues and his henchmen, like Whoopi Goldberg in the film. This film is about the search for love to the differences of each. This is an epic study of fear of failure and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self-centeredness. He who at the time of Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex formulated tiara for centuries, with the only justifiable comparisons being stuffed and Bacall, Tracy and Hepburn and Hall and Oates. If you like to watch uplifting, celluloid philosophical study of some deep human drive; Bergman-esqe, but not so depressing, Theodore Rex should be seen immediately!
