Infamous previous film code is actually a film that has caused people to insist on strict compliance with the Code of Hayes. Barbara Stanwyck stars as a young girl, whose father sold liquor has no problem pandering to its customers. When he dies in an accident, she has published with the knowledge that her marriage the body can get her what she wants. She travels to New York and continued to climb the ladder, one bed at a time. While it is clear that there is no actual floor showed that the film is pretty sleazy. Unfortunately, after the initial shock value goes out (around the time Stanwyck railcar inspector screws, so that she could travel for free), the film becomes a bit repetitive and boring. Stanwyck itself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through. As always, it is fantastic.
