I loved the story. Somewhere, the poster said there was no family, as one depicted in the film. Well, maybe there should be. I thought that everything seemed to be really a man and believable. What is the highest quality of the casting. What a great music on the soundtrack. What a pleasure it is, and what is good, but most of all, I would say two words to recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell. <br /> <br /> It really showed a good, subtle depth that has affected me. He was really in command of a widower who has devoted himself, may be too much to be a good father first, due to the refusal of his own needs. <br /> <br /> It acts as irritability ass? Why, yes it is. <br /> <br /> And you can see that this is what was great about this film. The actor, who played this character made me believe that he felt something, and not just act like he felt something, and he gave me exactly what it was that he felt and that he was deprived of his senses. <br /> <br /> Denied happiness. <br /> <br /> Denied execution. <br /> <br /> Denied love. <br /> <br /> Losing love is painful beyond belief, and many who do so will never feel something like that again. <br /> <br /> A great movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him eight out of ten.
