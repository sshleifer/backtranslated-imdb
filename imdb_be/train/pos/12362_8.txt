I will quickly address the issues of the film here: It was a very attractive story about the destructive qualities of an all-consuming passion; a young Italian woman who can not emotionally connect with her jailed political groom radicals (partly due to her non-political views and freewheeling approach to life) finds solace and passion in the new young lover, whom she had sent explicit sexual relations. Anxiety, anger, tenderness and passion that circulate around in the atmosphere of history is indifferent to quiet that seems to engulf the two wires. This gives the film a mood of anxiety that pervades through all the political conflicts that would otherwise be lost to the viewer (if you have a deep knowledge of Italian politics during the '80s). I found the film compelling ... that is spoiled somewhat gratuitous oral sex scene, the actress playing the male role ... is not modeled and leaves little to the imagination. There are other sex scenes in the movie that I feel are necessary, because they outline the madness and loneliness that the characters live. But oral sex scene, I feel tears focus on a true story. It was smooth until this moment, and as soon as the infamous sex scene (which caused so much hype in the day), it is striking the fence. It's jarring and unnecessary, and I'm in the camp that believes that the film would not be harmed if any scene has been removed from it. A pity that this particular scene may deter people from watching this intriguing film that I think is worth watching, because there is so much going on under the surface emotions and further unrest layered subtext. <br /> <br /> in general: An excellent film prevents many non-essential sex scenes.
