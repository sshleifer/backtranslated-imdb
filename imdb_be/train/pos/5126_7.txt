For urban Cowboy John Travolta plays one of the strong alpha males never portrayed on the big screen. He is a decent young man who leaves his father's estate, and strikes out for the big city of Dallas, where his uncle Barry Corbin promised to find him a job in the petrochemical industry. In 1980, he began to grow, and Texas was definitely growing in the US. <br /> <br /> Travolta doing a good job in making us care about the audience of his character, which, when you come straight to this sexist pig. He meets and marries Debra Winger, who are from the same origin, but she has some ideas that women should not be a shadow of their men. And if she hits him with a mechanical bull Jill, a man in the game, it's for him. <br /> <br /> Who is Scott Glenn ex-convict working at Jill, and this film was his breakthrough role. He's a real snake in Urban Cowboy, he gets a goat Travolta with a mere glance, and he moves to Winger. Travolta in turn takes rich woman, Smith, Osborne Osborne which slum in Jill's. <br /> <br /> Despite the character, Urban Cowboy was really one giant commercial for the self-styled biggest Honka thin in the world. Jill no longer appears there in suburban Pasadena Texas community, but the memories live on. And most importantly, on the Urban Cowboy is an excellent assessment of country / western songs that were featured in the film. I'm not sure if some of the songs were written specifically for the Urban Cowboy, but that's the only reason I can think of why the film academy ignored the musical aspects of the film. I especially liked Johnny Lee looking for love, if it had been written especially for this movie, it's a shame that he was not nominated for best song. <br /> <br /> I loved the character of Debra Winger is the best in this film. She does not lose track of femininity, but it is worth to Travolta and does it in style. And this review is dedicated to the same as the unknown woman who will one day be the first female bull rider in rider Professional Bull.
