It is very scary, and for the most part, well-thought with drama. I am very impressed with the film, and not only for the story and excellent acting, but it is such a unique film was made. Most of the films with the participation of a spy or a war filled with the smooth-talking Brit or a strong battle, but it is not. We are not talking about that kind of war, his war between man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, posing as a supporter of evil, no one will ever forget. When the war ended, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his real heroic stance should remain secret government. Returning to America, Campell meets Nazi supporters and Nazi contempt, providing interesting conflicts both inside and outside. Nolte more than pulling part, and fits the story well enough that he asks.
