At first I did not like it that much, but I did. They do not include the third generation of Trueba, love between Blanco and Pedro wans't well explained and some of the actors were very different from what I imagined. <br /> <br /> Later, I realized that if the film was more loyal to the book, it would be how long five hours and will be a kind of tedious. Now I like it a lot, because my favorite characters are there, as I portraited them. Clara really looks like an angel in the air, and its introduction to the story at the beginning of the movie was fantastic, faithful and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I imagined it just like that, not in mourning for all. Esteban is to find enough. I never liked his character, and although I was interested in it, I hated it a lot, and more specifically, when it hit Clara. As in the book, the last part is the most exciting one, and he has a real story too. <br /> <br /> The film is really good, especially when you consider that it was a gringo movie based on the Latin American book. Its strange how many famous stars there, do not you think?
