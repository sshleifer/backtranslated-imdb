I must say that, despite this feedback Angels in the Outfield was a very good movie. I like the way he teaches children to always have faith and never give up, because that miracles can happen. Unlike other baseball movies is one particular movie stood out hits of amazing special effects and well-planned soundtrack, which was very interesting. Although I liked this movie, he did have some drawbacks, such as some useless (ie until the end, when Ray Mitchell beats Homer he has not set foot on the plate, and therefore, will not score. But that's just nitpicking.) I must to say I was really impressed by the presence of this film and morality: Just faith, do not give up.
