Watch this Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in the film about a dead girl is in a new girlfriend. It Gabriele with Desperate Housewives and the guy who wore the "Sex Panther cologne" in Anchorman. If you wait for Golden Globe nominated film, then you need to rethink how you look at movies. However, if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes, and you want to watch a funny movie, you've come to the right place. The characters are all funny. They work together very well. The real match is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He was so funny, he was alone, and she was funny and good looking all at the same time. I went with my wife, she loved it, and so do I.
