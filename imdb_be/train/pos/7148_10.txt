This film is one I highly recommend. It is about a boy, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf), who wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to Camp Green Lake, in a temporary detention center for boys. There, he was forced to dig a hole 5 feet and 5 feet diamiter. There he meets other boys camp (Zero Magnet, armpits, squid, X-Ray, and a zigzag). All they dig and not "build CharactorÂ», but to find out the law of treasure Kate Barlow. Throughout the film (and the book) Stanley learns more about the past, more about yourself and more about digging holes. I give this movie 9.5, because I am very picky when it comes to books to movies (I want the movie follow the book exactly). But still it was really good.
