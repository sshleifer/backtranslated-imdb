This verse about the film, beautifully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry. It captures the atmosphere of the time and the place is great. (Italian Lake District in the twenties.) This is a love story with a twist. Symbols are unique and truly. Settings are very exotic. Some scenes --- funeral boat in the fog --- high long shot of a chess table in the center of a bizarre patterned tile floor --- beautiful drawings. And instead of the obligatory happy ending, this story has a bitter sweet one. If the film is an art, it is close to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
