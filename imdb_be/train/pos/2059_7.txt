What would the film have fun! Shepis absolutely beautiful and the Beast is a special and original. It really brought me back to the monsters' 80s. Budget is clearly low, and not all of Pacino behind the lens, but it does not matter, because it never takes itself seriously. With cattle trailer trash to high flying martial arts moves scary, it really would be a movie stone. Grab some drinks, snacks and a couple of friends and sit back and relax. I enjoyed this movie so much I went out 3 Scarecrow acquired all movies. Of course, they are not for everyone, but to each his own. Sometimes you just have to install the thinking cap and smiles.
