SPECIAL DAY (Skol - Italy / Canada 1977). <br /> <br /> Every once in a while, you come across a film that really touches a nerve. It offers a very simple premise, executed almost flawlessly in all respects and incredibly moving at the same time. This is surprising in Skol «Una Giornate particulare» relatively unplanned, even hated by some critics. Time Out called it "garbage" and Maltin, a little bit softer, "nice, but a piece of cake. I do not agree, not only because the film is very moving, but within the limits of a simple story, he shows us a deeper understanding of everyday life in Nazi Italy than most of the films that I've seen. The cinematography is clearly unflashy, even a little fresh, and the plot is simple, which might explain the relative unpopularity of the film. Considering the late 70-ies of the spectators were not spoiled by great Italian film, it is even more strange is the one not really for chapitstsa critics. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a ten-minute collage of archival materials from Hitler's visit to Italy on May 8, 1938 set this background, we first meet Antonietta (Loren), a lonely, love-ridden housewife with six children in Rome's residential home. one day, when her Beo escapes, she meets her neighbor Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be the only one in the building not being present at the ceremony. He is well-educated, cultured, and soon she is attracted to him. Throughout the film we hear a fascist rally radio Concierge screaming across the yard. Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings. After the opening scene, in swanks camera through the courtyard of the modernist (hypermodern at the time) of an apartment building, apparently in search of our main characters, which we have not yet met. <br /> <br /> Mastrionani Marcello and Sophia Loren in an unforgettable two main roles, the more surprising, as they are cast entirely against type. Canadian born John Vernon plays Lauren husband, but he is only on the screen in the first and the last scene. I believe that his voice should be duplicated, as it is not of Italian origin and have never lived there, as far as I know, so I can not imagine that he speaks Italian. When his voice was dubbed, I did not notice at all. On the contrary, it is completely plausible, as the Italian, even more than the rest of the cast. The story is simple, but very effective performances are outstanding, the ending is just perfect and framing sun comes off as too pretentious, but it works completely. Do not miss out on this. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
