I thought that was a strange Hugh OKonor as young Christy Brown, and really deserves greater recognition of their role. I could not believe how well he played the role. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was brilliant too. My favorite scene is where the boys play football and Christy uses his head to stop the goal, and then kicks a penalty! Amazing performances of two Christys (and others) as well.
