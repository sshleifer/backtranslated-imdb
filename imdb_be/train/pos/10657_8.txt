Jeopardy have a sense of being a stock movie varieties - one of the films, big budget studio pumped between them / box office. It is only 70 minutes and does not have a lot of sets, and the only star Barbara Stanwyck. But the star, of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck tough lady again, how it works in the escaped convict, seeking help for her husband trapped in the Mexican desert. Much of the film focuses on how she interacts with her captor, who wants to present it to him in exchange for his help. Some psychological fighting there. <br /> <br /> This is a surprisingly effective little film - its short length makes it tight, and that a large Stanwyck to go without a mention (but I still praise it every time).
