Say what you want about Andy Milligan - but when his family was even 10% as crazy as the one in the movie, and then I think it could get worse. Unfortunately, video print of this film includes the insertion of sex scenes originally shot the distributor to increase the box-office treatment with a picture. Several times during the film's camerawork ugly and silent film music in Milligan ends abruptly and suddenly beautiful doubles for domestic actors in Milligan take over and start doing it the psychedelic 60's rock guitar. It's pretty easy to fast-forward through if you try to pay attention to the original film Milligan, which, unfortunately, is missing quite a bit of action, which has been reduced to make room for added sex scenes. There remains, however, is still a unique material. I do not think I've ever seen more than any movie before the hated mother.
