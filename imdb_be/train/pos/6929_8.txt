Saw this movie on ENCW last endless for the third or fourth time. I liked it so much I ordered a DVD. It's really beautiful and, of course, the first of Mann-Stewart pairing. More here than the usual oater, although not as powerful as the seekers. Many obvious symbols of achievement of courage, but mostly it is incumbent Stuart, his partner, Millard Mitchell, Shelley Winters and Waco Johnny Dean Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (no Joker) I wonder how nice would be the hero, who is interested in Lola, but too yellow. Stewart in The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance, he was practically reduced to wearing an apron and serving the enemies of coffee. DECAF is not in doubt. Tony Curtis Bronx cavalry and Rock Hudson behaves like any Indian I've seen on the screen there is an interesting cameo. <br /> <br /> Special performances by John McIntyre as too lucky card dealing / dealer gun hanging on a very low-grade version of the American West Cafe Rica. No one wants to spend the night there. Jay C. Flippens over a kiss from Lola (Winters) and has a few nice scenes with Stewart, before he gets to the bend of the river and the distant country. Will Geer as Wyatt Earp and the Indian chief who takes the teeth of Walter Brennan from him in the Red River a pleasant sight. It's kind of a western, which is only Stewart, Sun Wayne nor Scott could have gone. Worth a shot, I repeat. :-)
