I first saw this film in 1980 year in the midday movie location. After many follow-on views (and video purchases) it still makes me laugh out loud <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a relic of another era. - domestic comedy, rich middle-class America - but well executed well executed. But it is also a document of its age - is a celebration of post-war optimism, the baby boom and the human consumer age. This film is not a "guilty" pleasure <br /> <br /> Three outstanding modern drainage actors - politely Melvyn Douglas. stunned by Cary Grant; daffily determined Myrna Loy - complement each other and memorable characters team <br /> <br /> My favorite scene - .. "This means that we have a blast" and "Miss StellwaggenÂ» and "this little piggy" <br /> <br /> Love it.
