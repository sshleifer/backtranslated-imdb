If his DVD was released, I went to market and bought it. And I think that my money was on the right track, as I expected, before buying it. Awesome movie, what else can I say, Will Smith, he was a strange actor, as always, whether in the cinema or actions seriously. He always gives an inhibition recording. I think this is a movie after August Rush, which makes a person cry, watching him. The way in which the director described the story was really awesome. His old life and his new life in the movies have been correctly designed for the audience. Even I could not find any fault in the history or how they shoot him. I think it should be a home DVD, because it will be a really good thing for your collection. This is not a film that needs a pop-corns for fun, this is a film that allowed the audience to learn a lesson. Now what is the lesson that you can see that at the time of viewing. And I advise those who critics please see if you could find any criticism about this film, please talk to me.
