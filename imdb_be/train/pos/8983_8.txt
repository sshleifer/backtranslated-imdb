Shot in the car with the help of the windshield, someone is playing someone else their last song, someone does not respond in accordance with the voiceover. I just wonder how it began to do. There were too many scenes in this movie, I was wondering how come the camera was there. If the scenes shot where Warhols occurred at BJM after the game are true, that was unforgivable operation to the maximum, if not, it was a complete fabrication, somehow it made me uncomfortable, if it was the purpose? All the way through the movie, I thought, as the footage came out. Taken at face value, a good portrait (worn) to the genius of all we feel.
