It took a few years since I've seen it, but remember, it would like to see it again. It became a kind of "therapy" for my personal experience of my own. <br /> <br /> thirty-five old man mourning a baseball game High School, where he "missed the ball" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, "if I hit that ball," and how his life would be better because of it. Then he gets the opportunity to learn .... and getting a little more than he had expected. <br /> <br /> He reminds me so much when I was in high school, I tried twice for our drill / dance team, and execute. This team was closest to the sorority in my school. If you were on it, you were "all this." I did not try until my last two years of hepatitis B and after the second time, I took it very hard. I kicked and hit his leg badly just before the test and wore pantyhose to cover a bruise, and that made me do. That was in 1987. <br /> <br /> For many years, even now sometimes, I think, "If I do not hit my leg, I would never wear those stupid tights." Now, I do not sit and I think that my life would be better or any different if I did it, but after seeing this film made me realize that we never actually do not know how different things might be changing one small thing in the last, who knows, that could change the course of events to such an extent that I would not have met the father of my son. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change. Be careful what you wish !!!
