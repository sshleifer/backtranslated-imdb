I saw this film in 1969, when it was first released in Cameo Theater on South Beach, a famous night club Crowbar. This was the last year of the wild 60s, and this movie really hit home. He has everything; the generation gap, the sexual revolution, the desire for success, and the conflict between the movement of their family "tradition" in order to seek some way through your life. <br /> <br /> It was a fast-paced, a very enjoyable film, Vegas is hippiest peak, Sin City in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous cameos, laughing, conflict, romance, or even a happy ending. Very enjoyable time over all. <br /> <br /> A poster of this film lies on my bedroom wall. I look at him and I go back in time; During my youth and my time with my dad, a great time in my life.
