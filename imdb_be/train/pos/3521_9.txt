Other reviewers summed up this film noir well. I would just like to add to "Phew!" Comments one reviewer did relatively clearly coke nourish episode drummers Elisha Cook. It was Doozy, I must say. Cook earned some recognition for his frenzied performance <br /> <br /> A bit of trivia, I guessing :. Cook appeared as a waiter in 1941 Barbara Stanwyck film "Ball of Fire." He was a waiter at a nightclub, where Barbara sings and legendary drummer Gene Krupa drumming, most vigorously. Is it too much to suggest that spazzy drumming Cook later in the movie "Phantom Lady" was very inspired by the work of Krupa, as witnessed Cook 3 years ago? <br /> <br /> When you look at Croup "fireball", I think you will see some apparently similar movements. One hope, of course, that he was not under the influence of any drugs at that time!
