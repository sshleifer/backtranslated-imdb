Debut? Wow - Cross-Eyed easily one of the most enjoyable indie movies that I watched last year, which makes it hard to believe that the Cross Eyed is the debut of the writer. I mean - I checked in on IMDb, to find more movies this writer ... because Cross Eyed has the single signature You fucking want to see what else the writer could have said. These days, it's rare to see a film that is well written, accurate, well edited and well acted. For me - Cross Eyed encapsulates that the creation of the film should be about - combining the best of all film elements to create intelligent, artistic and touching story. More, please.
