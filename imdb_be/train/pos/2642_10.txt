Is it a film "Heart Warming". He won Peobody George Award winning "Roots", so that might tell you something about the essence of this film. I'm looking for on the Internet, how to order this movie as my former father-in-Eugene Logan, co-author of the film has been dead for several years, so I no longer have the ability to get information from him, I would like to see it only granddaughters, my daughters, to see this film, and to pass this remarkable story of his great-grandchildren. My eldest daughter was seven years old at the time he was shown on television, and I was looking forward to seeing him again. One of my friends said it was her favorite film. I will not "spoil" this film is for you.
