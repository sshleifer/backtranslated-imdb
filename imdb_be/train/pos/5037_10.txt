This may be the most underrated film of its genre. I do not remember any advertisements or advertising for it, which could be the reason why it is not so well at the box office. Nevertheless, Frailty is excellent and truly original horror movie. I rank it in the top 10 most favorite horror movies in my list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the shooting of photographs and news articles that tell us about the killer who calls himself "the hand of God." And then a man comes to the police station and told the chief officer, that he knows that the murderer of his brother. Two of them leave together to go to the place where the victims are buried, which could help solve the case. During this trip, the person starts to tell the story of his brother, and we will return at a time when the event started. Fenton and Adam, two young brothers who live with their strict and religious father, who, one day, claims that he received a divine message from God, asking him to kill the demon, which seem to adults. He receives from God a list of the names of the demons that must be destroyed, and asked his sons to help him fulfill this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely horrible and disturbing film that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Tension runs high, innocent people (or a demon?) Kills and religious experiences in doubt. He has not one, but several very clever twist at the end. If you like this genre, I strongly recommend you to fragility. Spoken DVD, and this is one of my favorite horror thriller.
