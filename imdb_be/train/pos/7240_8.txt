When I found this movie in my local video service I was expecting it to be another American cheesy vampire film in the same vein, «The Lost Boys» (1987) .to my surprise, "To Die For" is a really good movie.It little bit corny at times, but there are still quite stylish set-piece and surprises to satisfy enthusiasts.This vampire is the perfect blend of romance and horror, and it's amazing mountain on times.Highly recommended.
