Very rarely one comes across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed rare gem. Directed by writer, not only to solve the problem to direct the work, but provides hilarious performance as the evil roommate. The script takes an interesting look at not only the difficulty struggling writer, but mixes so much comedy in the desert world of the writer, that you can not help but make Ernie as a symbol. Very funny stuff. Despite a tiny budget Adam Jones has managed to give the film a serious look. He does not mess around when it comes to making a good movie. I can not wait to see what he comes up with the other. This guy can make people laugh and think; it is special.
