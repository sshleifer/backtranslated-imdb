I was first introduced to the "Eddie" friends of "indiscriminate pond", who knows, I like intelligent humor. I like the comedian who can be thoughtful, entertaining, like George Carlin and Dennis Miller. The "Dress to Kill" Eddie gives the same type of humor social observation, which stimulates your thoughts on the matter is constantly forcing your side to share at the same time. There is a wide range of subjects in the standing and they just hysterical. a piece about how to decide on a scenic Englebert will Stsyazhko leave you! <br /> <br /> Thank you Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
