Before seeing this, I was put off by the subject, but this is not your average triumph over adversity story. Although it is technically a blind Tibetan children climbing Mt. Everest, there is much more to it. This film shows a very strong, often contradictory personality of two very experienced blind adult leading the child, Eric, and Sabri. Eric is a blind American climber / athletes and Sabri blind German scientist, he founded the school in Lhasa in Tibet. They are both exceptional in its own way, but do not agree on something that will really build confidence in children. Eric wants to reach the top, and Sabri Erik wants to use it as a role model, and have fun at the moment. The nuances of the complex and one out is not really being sure who was right, or when the entire rise was a mistake or a great idea. The deepest stage with Tibetan children and the difficulties they face, before finding their way to school. The most touching for me was the story of Tashi, gentle teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him. I could watch the whole film on his life and was happy to know that thanks to the school, he is currently running a successful small business with some of his fellow students. If you like Spellbound or Murderball, you'll love it.
