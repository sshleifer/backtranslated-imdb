This is a difficult film to categorize "10 items or less". Actually, I do not care about the definition of the genre, but there is something about this film that makes you want to put it in a category, to pass, even with only one word, your feelings about it. I totally recommend this film to anyone, and if you really enjoy the movie, and if you enjoy life, you want to do the same, once you've finished browsing. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and call it beautiful and wonderful to recognize that it is not perfect, but he's done nothing wrong. I do not want to sound like I'm contradicting myself, but I believe the writer / director Brad Silberling knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspiring scenario. I'm sure he'd like to get a product that had nothing to do with perfection: a product that would have been so simple, attractive and uncompromising as its name. Well, he did it. <br /> <br /> Silberling, director of long, complex, dramatic films as "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile," proves with "10 items or less", which closes in just 70 minutes, the passion he it has for his work, and he has faith in him. In order to put an actor (Morgan Freeman) to a woman (Paz Vega) at the grocery store and take them to the places it is everyday life to them what is offered here Silberling. <br /> <br /> I can not tell you any more because the apparent simplicity is not thought provocative background that should not be underestimated. Because here it is subject to all: The camera focuses directly on the two main characters, who share an endless conversation in the car ride with stops, it is not endless because life is life. And let me tell you how to praise how well Silberling handles the situation, saying that he reached in less time (not just a movie length of time, but one day, the film develops its events) and in a smaller place, the kind of relationship between the two signs that Sofia Coppola generated in «Lost in Translation». <br /> <br /> The film is located in Tokyo, we are also faced with the actor and the woman, and they were also talking about the moments they lived their lives. This conversation, which we feel, though precipitating quality "10 Items or less" and, just as in Coppola's film, the naturalness of any situation is never lost, and the image with all the music and no words do not seem forced or included in the picture "buy time." <br /> <br /> In this respect, co-operation and its director Silberling photo Papamaykla. The man who filmed the beautiful landscapes in the "Party" and focused on every emotion in the «Patch Adams», attracts us here with visual passages of true natural beauty. <br /> <br /> But the ultimate beauty "10 Items or less" can be found in the cast (by Avy Kaufman), in its two main characters. They are the ones who transmit this feeling, I have already spoken to the first page, and I can not tell;. we feel our relationship, and we can say that they are happy and that they may even be improvising things Oscar winner Morgan Freeman, as well as executive producer of the film, just stands and confirms the status he has today in the industry, and one that is well deserved: a quiet man, filled with wisdom That can easily make you cry, it can make you laugh. And the beautiful Paz Vega (Well, I said that it was great to «Spanglish») ?? Here she proves that she is the real deal, and a lot to Hollywood it.
