I'm sorry that this charming and whimsical film (which I saw for the first time shortly after it was first released in the early fifties) was so poor reception recently. In my view, it was greatly undervalued - but perhaps it appeals more to a European sense of humor than (for example) an American may be that we in Europe can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more, as we are closer to some of them in real life! Particular mention should be made of the limited, but good music - particularly catchy and memorable song "It's a fine, fine night", which was published separately on a 78rpm record HMV (10 inches plum label, I think!) In the fifties. I would encourage anyone who is interested to give it a try if you get the chance: you can have a pleasant surprise.
