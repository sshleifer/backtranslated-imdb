There is, of course, the emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship - one based mainly on the physical involvement from the outset. And there are also emotions in the inner workings of the family Mathieu Case w / problems his mother - and how it comes to carry on their relationship. But the problem is, that leaves a lot of things that have gone unanswered (if I'm not too stupid to pick up on them). Why Mathieu in a psychiatric hospital? Which led to the break-up of the boys? And flashing back and forth between past and present little hard to follow at first. It seems that the main reason to rent this film to enjoy the thrill of homoerotic replacement, or some male nudity. But as the study of the history of love or the nature of it is missing and unsatisfactory.
