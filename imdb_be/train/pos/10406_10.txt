Abu, Thief of Bagdad, King Ahmed helps restore your kingdom from an evil sorcerer. <br /> <br /> As Europe is going to war, and large segments of the world takes place in the fire, London, Sir Alexander Korda Films presented this chic escapist fare from the legends of Arabian Nights. Crowded with swords and magic, he gave the audience in 1940 a brief respite from the headlines. He is also a great piece of film showing good acting and intelligent script. <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt gets top billing, and he deserves it, playing the evil sorcerer Jafar. His sullen face with piercing eyes reminiscent of the terrible role, he played with such gusto during the silent days. Here is a villain worth watching. As the boy's a thief, Sub perfectly cast in this, his third film. While not a hero in the usual sense of the word, his character is definitely a heroic deed and action. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors do a great job. John Justin, how energetic and sensitive as the unenlightened king who needs to learn about the realities of life hard way; Sabu receives a significant part of the action (if it does not turn into a dog), but Justin respective sports, when needs must. Excellent June Duprez plays under threat of extinction princess of Basra, the desired two very different people. Appearing at the end of the movie, a massive Rex Ingram shakes things like gin and attitude. <br /> <br /> Alan Zheyes uses his beautiful voice to good advantage as the narrator. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role as a child Sultan of Basra, forever blurring on about his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the film of the game screen, and dialogue). Aged Morton Selten reflects the benevolent King Legend. Mary Morris, later exclusive theater actress, plays a dual role in the partner Jafar and six-armed Silver Dancer. <br /> <br /> The film was launched in the UK, but the difficulties of wartime, Korda made to move it to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of US Ingram in plaster. Art direction, in the Technicolor lively, is the most attractive, especially architecture fairy tale in Blue, white and pink. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* <br /> <br /> Born in 1924, Sabu, Sabu was used Maharaja of Mysore in the stables when he was discovered by cords and placed in front of cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937 DRUM-1938 Thief of Bagdad, 1940, JUNGLE BOOK-one thousand nine hundred forty-two) was his best, and he found himself running out of Hollywood when they were completed. After a respected military service during World War II, he resumed his film career, but he was infinitely limited for many years played the role in the ethnic undistinguished minor films, Black Narcissus (1947) is one big exception. His latest film, Walt Disney Tiger Walk (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu died of a heart attack at the end of 1963, only 39 years old.
