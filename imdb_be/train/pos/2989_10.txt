Firstly, I would like to just say a big fan of Bette Midler's me. Stella is a very good movie with a great cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is one of my favorite movies of all time. She has to deal with his mother raising a child alone, she goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to bring up her daughter Jenny played well Trini Alvarado. This film is very good, and I suggest that you pick up a copy to watch it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And it deserves 4! WONDERFUL! I give it 4 out of 4!
