Performances in this movie were fantastic. Conversation was great. Jason Patric delivered a fantastic performance as the «Kid» Collins in this beautiful novel by Jim Thompson. Far superior to "Grifters", which was a good movie, this film really stayed true fiction / film noir roots, from which emerged history. I recommend this film to all fans of film noir.
