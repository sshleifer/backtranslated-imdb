A very good start. I was a little surprised to find the machine is not quite so advanced: It should have been tougher to meet, we have seen in the original series. The cast is interesting, though Vulkan lady comes across as too human. She needs to school at Spock, who, after all, is a model for this race. Too bad they could not have picked Gerry Ryan. Like Ms. Park, Korean (?) Lady. The doctor has the opportunity. Nha dismantled the other male, except for the black guy. He's very cute. Baku is to find a niche - The QL his hobby his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. He, of course, big and strong enough for heroics. The heavyweights were OK, although I do not want them to make.
