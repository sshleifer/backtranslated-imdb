Thelma Ritter did steal the picture. I just finished watching it again. I could not become emotional in their final stage. She did not get an Oscar. That's why you should not put too much faith in the Oscars. Widmark was never the best part was perfect casting as the 3-D, the vices of human beings. Jean Peters was as big as a StreetWise, tough girl in her best role ever. And Richard Kiley was very good; Otherwise, why would I hated him so. Yes, it was a heavy handed on patriotism; but, without it, you do not have much of the film. See their faces! The top three stars do not really need a lot of scenarios. I would like to see them make this film without dialogue. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita G in the "thief" can be, you know what I mean. When I was a child, in 1956, on his first trip to New York, I did my uncle Bronx leads us to the foot of South Street is looking for number 66. That's when I knew that Hollywood could not be trusted. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I'm not paying a large part of the story, because I hate it when I know what's going on before I see for myself. If you saw it, did not clarify is not required. Just maybe, someone who reads these comments have not seen "phono South StreetÂ». You will like it; simply follow the 66 South Street in New York.
