Somehow I missed this movie when it came out and opened it as the end of last week, thanks to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I can not remember another intimate drama film that does so many things so well. Drawing up a clear, realistic, nuances, and even restrained. The cinematography and editing are understated, but inspiration, allowing visually speaking stories dominate through an amazing close-up and framing of images, capturing the loneliness and alienation in the most memorable way. There is also excellent, with all the characters are painfully real and vulnerable in the most attractive way that the film has to offer. They reveal their innermost weaknesses with exposed, raw vulnerability. This triumph, Roger Michell and Kureishi, and the rest of the team. A must see for serious film fans.
