I watched this film by chance, take an interest to get the trailer on TV. I love it when I find movies like this, small, tender stories about ordinary people. Even if the end is tragic, "Man on the Moon" has some funny moments, especially in the first characteristic of Denmark, with her innocent and pure love affair with the court. It really is a beautiful moving love story with 3 high points: the performance of Reese Witherspoon, which kept its promises to the world of cinema, the beautiful cinematography "Old Lion" Freddie Francis and fantastic account James Newton Howard, who is really the soul of the film. Its theme (which deserve an Oscar nomination), so intimate and lyrical, it seems that they have made in the music scenario.
