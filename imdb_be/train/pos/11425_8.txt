The story of a little girl growing up in colonial Africa, but it is much more than that. <br /> <br /> Any increases in the south will feel the same thing. Striving to another one of a different race, which can not be completed. Even a cursory glance prohibited. There are no words necessary. Their facial expression says it all. <br /> <br /> This is the story of black slaves, Protée (Isaac de Bankole) and a white woman, Emma (Giulia Boschi). Their commitment to each other so much that they torture each, because they can not be with each other. <br /> <br /> As a little girl, France (Cécile Ducasse) alone and spends all his time with Protée. She really can not see this dance. <br /> <br /> One of the most annoying aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonists. They can not even get undressed for bed themselves. There's the world coming to an end; they just do not know about it. Their racist attitudes will be erased from their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I would like to visit the Africa. It seems so quiet; especially at night when you only hear the animals.
