I saw this film in the sixth grade at the time of the Christmas holidays, and I was very happy to see him, and when I heard that George C. Scott was in it, I was very happy, because I really like George C. Scott! When I and my class watched this movie, I was really into it, and when it ended, I was really impressed, I thought it was absolutely incredible! This is the best version of the classic novel by Charles Dickens, I've seen so far! performance of George C. Scott as a Scrooge something else, I thought he was the perfect choice, he was Scrooge, he is the ultimate Scrooge! I've seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other one with Patrick Stewart, but it's better than one! <br /> <br /> What is really cool about this action, I thought that the actors were fabulous, everything was, perfumes, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, all that they could not have found anyone better than those they do item! But the best part of the movie, George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was the absolute best! He is the ultimate Scrooge, I do not think they could have found someone better! I do not think they could have found someone better to replace someone in a movie! <br /> <br /> This film is probably the definitive film adaptation of the classic Dickens, and I really think that you will agree, you will think that this film is fantastic! I may have to buy the film on DVD, because I thought it was absolutely incredible! I totally recommend you to watch this masterpiece! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol, period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
