A great movie to watch with strange scenes and talented actors such as Ms. Shimizu and Neyzhiko TOHO. After 15 minutes of viewing, your eyes are closed on the screen, and you do nothing but breathe in the atmosphere of the film anticipates that fate will bring the character. This film makes you leave your position as a standard audience, it takes you, it makes you part of the story ... The costumes and setting of genius; especially the area okiyas artfully constructed. It's certainly not very Akira Kurosawa, but he still gets a lot of masters, especially stylistically speaking history tells us that we are in the famous land of the movie, which is quite far from hollywoodish splendor.
