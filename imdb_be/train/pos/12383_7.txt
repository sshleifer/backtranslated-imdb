Christina Raines plays an excellent model in New York, who is looking for a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and solve the mystery of the construction of themselves slowly build up to quite a climax to the end of the film. This film has all kinds of neat plot elements from the Roman Catholic Church against the devil, the gateway to hell, to strange rituals, a growing conspiracy, and finally, the famous host of talented actors and actresses who have invaded the film. We get Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles Beverly DAnzhelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum, and who can forget John Carradine as the old priest. Many of these actors ham it - especially Burgess Meredith offers an excellent comic / insane job as a neighbor with a bird and a cat. Meredith memorable as balm and Chris Sarandon. Some of the performers have little or nothing to do, as Jose Ferrer in the thankless role, even if it is nothing more than a cameo. Sight is a great horror film with a lot of psychological elements and some truly horrific scenes. End scene nasty and yet scary. I find fault with some of gratuitous sex and violence in the film, in particular, that the whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was it really necessary? I think not. In addition, the father / daughter stuff was a little more than good, but on the whole the film works and has a winning pace. Director Michael Winner does the job efficiently and effectively Creating tension and terrible moments of the film. Scenes from Carradine are particularly effective.
