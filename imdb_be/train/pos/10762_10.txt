I was one of many who had expected to see the glorified, Yankee-doodle dandy image per day, which (as famously quoted) have to live in shame, and not glory. How wrong I was. These guys were there, right in the middle, and the picture they are returned as a strange and heartbreaking. And yet all this took place on a random trip to the World Trade Center September 11, 2001 <br /> <br /> Two French films have been compiling a documentary about the life as a firefighter NY, in particular, from the point of view of a young rookie coming through the ranks. In the beginning we see the most of this footage to remind us that there was no thought to the production of a film about terrorism. This was to be a film about ordinary people who earn an honest living by helping others, and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this advantage. <br /> <br /> During the investigation, the suspect a gas line (I think my memory is a little hazy on), we suddenly hear a plane fly over his head. Camera to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing themselves in one of the towers. What should the cameraman thought at the time? Recognizing the importance of shooting the camera remains on, and perhaps knowing the same, then the FDNY allows the camera to follow them into the building. <br /> <br /> The present view of the front line. We see, FDNY commitment, their reaction (in a stupor after hearing the first person falling to their death is terrible) and the collapse of a building from the inside, while the second camera captures events from outside. <br /> <br /> If there was a terrible event, they were covered, some frames would be the dream of any young DOCO-maker to come true. Simply put, frames deserve to be preserved for all time. But what really sets this film exception is genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer. We see fire charge without hesitation, people of different races, helping each other escape swing rubble and even directors of concern to each other (they are brothers), because they can not communicate with each other in confusion. There are amazing attractions as well as the country's human history in this film, something Hollywood could never repeat (even if he tries). <br /> <br /> 9/11 film is not about politics. And this is not a film about religion, nationality, or even jihad for that matter. 9/11 film about people and the true indicator of the best and worst that we can do. 9/11 is quite simply one of the most important films I've ever seen, and would be the only film to be born from this event, if it were up to me. You can not duplicate it.
