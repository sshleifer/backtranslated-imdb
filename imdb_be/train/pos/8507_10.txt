Well, you take O.J. Simpson all American soldiers twisted American bus driver who decides to save his passengers own just incase no one is going and Arte Johnson absolutely live as a guide, who does not know what to do, but doesn "t want to admit that they are in trouble, and combine it with the Lamas, one of the three child face the bad boys who are going to abduct the heiress and leave the bus with people to die for dessert, and you have to have action, plot twists, and a lot of drama. Everything was good, but seeing as Lama baddest bad boys really blew my mind. He was very believable as overbearing bad guy, who not only wanted to steal the heiress, but the rape of women and humiliate the guy who tried to stop him. It was obvious long before he cultivated his good guy image. And believe me 20-year-old Lorenzo in tight jeans you really do not want to miss!
