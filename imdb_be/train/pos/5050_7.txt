We really enjoyed Gray Owl: a simple story well told in classic fashion Attenborough :. Slightly more romanticized, with archetypes, humor, and stress the dignity and worth <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed and said a good pace is a true story of Archie, an Englishman, who has turned his native India, and went to live in Canada, and a trap. <br /> <br /> Hard performances of all makes this film with the message viewing. <br /> <br /> The two stars of the film, no doubt, pretty we've ever seen - and the message is good with his ecoleanings. It was great to meet or read the Great Gray Owl in 1930, a unique character, and it is a tribute to the film.
