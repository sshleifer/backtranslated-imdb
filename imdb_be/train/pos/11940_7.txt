As die-hard baseball, this film is contrary to what I expected in a sports movie: the authentic look of a sports action, believable characters and an original storyline. While "Angels in the late 'fails miserably in the first category, it has a nice success in the last two. "Angel" weaves the story of Roger and, J.P., Anaheim two foster children in love with baseball, but in search of a family, with those of the deaf Angels franchise struggling to attract fan and win the game. Highlighted the promise of his deadbeat parents that they would be family only when the Angels win the pennant, Roger asks some heavenly help, and get it in the form of diamond inhabited by spirits bent reversing the downward spiral of the franchise. And if short which merged manager George Knox (portrayed by Danny Glover) begins to believe that he saw Roger, the team suddenly has hope for the transformation of their season around. - Roger and JP find something to believe in Glover, in particular, it gives good performance and Donets playing washed-up pitcher, also doing well, despite clearly having ZERO idea how to pass out of the windup!
