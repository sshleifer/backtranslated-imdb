Greetings again from the darkness. The long-awaited, twisted comedy from writer / director Richard Shepard is coming out party for the actor Pierce Brosnan. This Bond guy left. This new guy is something completely different !! I read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too pretty boy for this plum role, but Brosnan is the perfect Julian Noble, "Mediator" ... and nothing but beautiful! Do not underestimate how twisted humor in it. If you go, wait raisins and gags for all kinds of sex, murder, religion, sports, business and anything else you might find politically incorrect. Brosnan takes a great script to a new level with his beautiful facial expressions and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a joy to behold. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear is a direct Man comic Brosnan and has a lot of depth and the comic's time to do this affiliate click. I hope that Davis has a small, but subtly effective supporting role as the wife of Kinnear (in that "Bing" with her name?), Who happens to get a little worried when she has a mediator in their living room. <br /> <br /> visual and setting is perfect - including bullfighting, motor racing and Denver suburb. And how often do we get a killer and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This one is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor a bit off-center, and you will enjoy a risky film-making, it may be for you.
