Caution Spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> I saw the movie in German, so it may be that I have missed some clues. <br /> <br /> Despite some weakness in the plot, this is a movie that came through me. I especially liked acting in Lexa Doig. Sometimes I have the impression that it * is * Camila. But I can not stop wondering what happened at the end of Bob, Cassie and the baby. I believe it is, after initially be set at Bob, eventually, you end up loving him and regretting what happened to his brother and forced to lie to him. Otherwise, it's a little strange that she would wear his child and love it. It's up to the viewer to decide - and I do not like such endings. Dean Cain was just as good as always, Eric Roberts .. well, I've seen him better, but also worse. <br /> <br /> I believe that the movie more than the analysis of human relations, and respond to unexpected situations than a crime story. <br /> <br /> In the end, I liked it very much.
