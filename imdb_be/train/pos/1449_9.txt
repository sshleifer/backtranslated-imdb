This is one of the best crime drama films in the late 1990s. He was filled with a large cast, the powerful story, and many of the players involved gave great performances. Pacino was great; he was to be appointed to something. John Cusack was good, until the viewer has no objection to his Louuu-Xian accent. It may come off as annoying when you can not stand this dialect. Thus, the character Pacino collaborated with Cusack character was believable, dramatic, and a little comical at times. Aiello was great, as always. David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good, but not memorable. There were times when this pattern is referred to as a lot of character, probably too much. It may take a second viewing to remember "that Zapatti is it?" After so many cross-references, one has to stop and think just to recap. The ending was not much sting. It was built so long, and then there was a little frustration. It was one of the few problems with the film. Since the film has not been declared as a "huge, blockbuster" big hit the screen, he made some forget that this movie even existed. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the lack of a film about the "surge" in theaters, perhaps, had no nominations. He was half-successful in the domestic market, and the spectators are still learning that the name there. Made in 1996, it still stands today, and will remain popular for many years. <br /> <br /> So, make yourself a little lemon pudding (you'll see) and see this movie!
