I agree with everyone else that posted. <br /> <br /> I watched it for a long time, but I'll tell you, when I hear some music from the anime that I remember the story, beautiful animation, characters, and the feeling I got watching it, and it makes me cry (such a happy yet sad feeling). However, I believe that the love story in it felt Alittle rushed, and they do not explain things properly, but it will not spoil any part of the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I've been in this anime so much that after the end I just had to do some research (and watch the ending a little more time), and I found all my answers and more. I love how they set the historical legend to fit in the anime, it was amazing and just made me want to explore a lot more. (I've always been very interested in some of the historical figures associated with this anime) <br /> <br /> I think it should have been more series, but if that's all they had to work with then they dragged him beautiful. I recommend this to anyone who loves emotional anime with an excellent plot, well-shaped characters (some cryptic) and a bit of fantasy action. <br /> <br /> In addition, even if it was based on an H-game, he does not have any of these things in it, and I prefer it so. (I have no problem with a mature anime, in most cases, I prefer it)
