Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a fun parody of Indiana Jones and the other seeker of adventure movies that were popular in the eighties. Wayne Crawford star as Jake Speed, an adventurer who always fights villains wherever he goes. With his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher) globe trotting they are looking for some action (and some decent storylines). The duo met a young woman named Margaret (Kopins), whose sister was kidnapped by the evil white slave traders (John Hurt). It can find and convince Jake and Desmond to help her save her brother? <br /> <br /> A juicy and cheesy movie that does not pretend that it is not. I have to give this recommendation. But if you love movies, who love to have fun and for those who do not take everything at face value. <br /> <br /> recommended.
