This is the ultimate one-person show in which Eddie Murphy at his very best. Just forget Nutty Professor, and ladies and gentlemen, it is a real Eddie Murphy. His imitation of Mr. T. (pretending that he was gay), Michael Jackson and other artists of the killer. I think it is also very bold to make fun of the artist, which is very popular at the time. My favorite act is one where it is on its annual BBQ with family and plays his drunken father and aunt Bath, falling down the stairs. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine when you're feeling down! When you see the continuation of «Raw» will not be disappointed. It's pretty good, too, but does not match "Crazy."
