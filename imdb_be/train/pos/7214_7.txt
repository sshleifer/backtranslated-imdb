Deathtrap by Ira Levin is one of those films in the tradition of mystical detective, it would be very easy to spoil it gave no real examination of the plot of the film. So I'll be brief, saying that for the game, one person who is a well known secret of the playwright, the other person, who is a promising writer, the playwright's wife, who is much younger and hotter than the role should be, and one German psychic along for the ride. Directed by Sidney Lumet, is no stranger to the movie, pretty good for the most part in the creation of tension in the film is to be the engine. Dialogue fast, fresh and witty. Michael Caine excels in roles like these. Christopher Reeve is OK and really grows on you the more you see his act. Irene Worth stands as a funny psychic. How about Dyan Cannon? Love how Lumet packs her posterior in the real-fitting trousers and forced her to wear, perhaps, snuggest top around, but she was terribly miscast in this role - the role that should have been given to old actress and one, of course, less seductive. But why quibble with a clear attempt to bribe their male audience, if nothing changes now? Deathtrap funny, smart, witty, and classy. The mystery has some glaring flaws that really distract some, and I was not completely satisfied with the end, but to watch Kane and Riva led by Lumet with an increased verbiage Levin was enough to ensnare my interest and keep it in captivity throughout the length of the film.
