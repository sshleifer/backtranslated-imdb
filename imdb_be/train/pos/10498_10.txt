It's a bit easy. That's about it. <br /> <br /> Schedule pure and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d are exceptions, but this is forgiveable. The rest of the graphics are clean than GoldenEye N64 and many other games. Sounds unusual. All that communication with SFX pleasant and realistic. <br /> <br /> The angle of the camera is a bit of a disappointment at times, but it is the same for each game platform, like bungee-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then I dutifully got 120 stars in 10 times.
