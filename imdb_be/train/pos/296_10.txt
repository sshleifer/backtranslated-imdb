Sublimity is the way we must reach for beauty. And the hill is the material of the film is made. If not his best, this is my favorite of all the movies Bogdanovich <br /> <br /> This unique masterpiece reminds us, like most other films directed that life is (or should be) about:. Love lost (or failure), and faith and hope and love. As the song from which the film takes its name (a well-known part of Gershwin), the film makes the impossible truth, and tries to make us realize that one can not judge anyone; it all with ease and time comedy skillful direction (the first ten minutes, with detectives following will give almost no lines of dialogue, built on appearance and looks --with characters that "Bogdanovic touch" on the basis view-- point-of-class on film language that PB also learned from his admired directors of the Golden Age films). With a high throw and a nice soundtrack (including the best Sinatra's "Trilogy"), this film is full of self-awareness and compassion, and far from pampering and void (as some critics have written), deserves a better place in the history of American cinema than where they were placed . This is not a "long on style, short on fact": it is made up in its simplicity, and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
