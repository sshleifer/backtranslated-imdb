This is the best of 43 films that have made the Rainer Werner Fassbinder; his most successful, at least. He was one of the leading directors in New Germany after World War II. <br /> <br /> Schygulla was gorgeous, like a cold, calculating Maria Bruan, who lost her husband in the war, found it after she took an American soldier as an amateur, lost it again after he was jailed for it, and found it at the end of the Agin. Her day and a half of marriage, before he disappeared more than their time together at the end. <br /> <br /> This kind of life. Things come and go, and you do the best you can. You can cancel or change your way of thinking, in order to survive. Even if Mary straightened thinking and did what she had to do, she never stopped loving by Hermann, which makes an end to this tragedy. <br /> <br /> An excellent drama.
