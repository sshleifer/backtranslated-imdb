I was only 11 when Mr. Peepers started. This is a must see for the entire family, I believe, on the Sun nights. Repeated gags were Rob opening his locker (he had to use a yardstick or a pointer to measure the correct place to another cabinet, and do some other things, finally pushing the place, after which the doors open), and taking the pin with a new shirt (early episode, he opens a package with a new dress shirt for the rest of the show will find a finger of the other, that he missed when deploying shirt, time was all and stud got a lot of laughs.) I remember aunt who drove Rio, Jack Benny and always wanted to «S onny », to say something scientific. He will think and come up with a "semipermeable membrane" or osmosis forcing her to say how he was brilliant. (You had to be there). Marion Lorne eclipsed every time it was on the screen. Why they did not continue the POV series out of it, when Wally left (he was afraid that he was being a type, but by then it was too late), I'll never know. I saw somewhere that the first TV wedding (big one anyway) was Tiny Tim on the show Carson. Horsecocky. It was Rob and Nancy (I ever have sunk to her), and I remember he made the cover of TV Guide and received press in all the newspapers and major magazines. A trip to the Museum of Broadcasting disappointment was in New York years ago that they had very few episodes, even those that may already be there. I still remember how great it is, and it is a pity that I was a little older.
