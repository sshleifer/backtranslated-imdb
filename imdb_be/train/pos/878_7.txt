Interesting characters, a lot of tension. As close to black and white with no black and white. I was turned off accidentally supposedly cute main character, quiet, close to the deaf secretary, was able to turn to crime to destroy a colleague, rough to the people in the way, and finally participate in the robbery, and to set up someone to be hit by as bait to her own get-away. I was a little discouraged tendency as otherwise the quality of films that reflect the offender in a nice way, entirely referring to the injury they have done other than to reflect their direct opponent as other shocks. In this film, we never know who the money is in fact, they were out of, or what happens to the innocent wife who uses a cute deaf secretary to establish a sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot. It is a pity that the film would be great.
