** Note - this post may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I just got a Gamecube in September 2005, and the first two games that I bought were James Bond games, decent Agent Under Fire and dim Goldeneye Rogue agent. Next game, I had planned to get all or nothing, because my friend told me that it was better than the two games that I already had. I must say that he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought it for a tenner in the HMV, and when I got home, I hit it in your cube and played for hours on end. It was much better than my other two games, and it was much better and more interesting story. The graphics were one of the best I have ever seen (but now that the XBOX 360 was released, FarCry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics known to man). The plot was smart; fool (Willem Dafoe, named Nikolai Diavolo) and a beautiful henchwoman (Heidi Klum, Kate named as Nadanova), trying to destroy the world of small nanobots, which at the beginning of the game, you, James Bond must destroy the train. The bad news is that one of them is hidden in the breasts Katie. Then you have to disrupt their plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The big thing about this game is that it actually has an actor voice acting, such as Cleese Voicing Q. There are 27 levels, some of them. In short, some of them quite long and complicated <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - Sound 9/10 - 9/10 replay value - Multiplayer 7/10 - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a total of 90%
