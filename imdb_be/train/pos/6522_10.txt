Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy Craze Paramount Pictures really threw the ball in the restoration of Anthony Quinn directed DeMille controlled film and get it on DVD and Blu-Ray all the extras included. It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs blind as bats and they know that they have a really good pirate movie in their store on a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, which has helped to make Crescent City once again famous for its Pirate Connections. If Execs at the Paramount, finally, get with the program and release the film in digital format, then I would be happy camper. Paramount Pictures is up to you to get out of its duff and get this film right now restored
