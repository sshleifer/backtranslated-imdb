I saw this movie with a bunch of friends, and although only two of us came out of the cinema thinking how cool it was, others just laughed and said how stupid it was. Well, that's because it should not be taken so seriously, mainly in aa film that mocks the horror and makes a heck of a good job .. There seems to be another movie goes like this, too, umm .. . scary movie ?? Well, it's Australian, and original !!! Jessica Napier makes surperb performance and Sara Kanz has definate bright future in action! I hope that I will see more of them. Ringwald was a good move, and Kylie was even better move. Impossible Princess was the queen of the screen !! I recommend to watch this film, you'll be guessing to the very end due to RAPM, Hillary and the film, which was never completed 20 years ago.
