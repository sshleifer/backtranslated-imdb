Not a bad romantic comedy, in which I do not think I've ever seen Meg looking any prettier. All the players did a good job of keeping this lively romp. Of course, in the real world is not a genius mathematician to look at some kind of a techie, but that's why I love romantic comedies .... you can just forget the reality and have a good time. Good movie. Hell, Meg's baby, huh?
