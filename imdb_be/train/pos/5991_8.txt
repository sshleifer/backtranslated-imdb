Continued Angels with dirty faces only in the title, the Angels face wash suffers few ordinary machinations of the Dead End Kids. In fact, in the presence of a dead child, and Ann Sheridan it was to be regarded as a de facto continuation of the Angels with dirty faces, at least for the sake of continuity. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Ann Sheridan, she is a real bright light of this film. To paraphrase a clich√©, Ann Sheridan could read the phone book for two hours, and I would buy the DVD! <br /> <br /> Another advantage of this movie chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is held too far in the background. For a better example of Sheridan-Reagan duo I would recommend Juke Girl and Kings Row.
