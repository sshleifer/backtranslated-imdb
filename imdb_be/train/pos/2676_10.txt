Every day we can see a large number of films, soap ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle occurs. Great movie, with real feelings, with great actors, with great realisator-director. For me, there are two films that everyone should see: first, pack? "Sophie's Choice" with Meryl Streep. Secondly, "Journey of Hope." As human beings, we need to learn about humility, love of others, acceptance of other civilization, another way of life. We also have to fight against racism and fascim. We should avoid judging, criticizing; we just love our satellites. This remarkable film helps us to reach John Lennon () his dream: Imagine all the people living life in the world. These two films are difficult to see: watch it, but I'm sure that you will get sick, but better. Great film, great actors, scary story, the pain and warranty calls, but also to better understand the other. Rejoice.
