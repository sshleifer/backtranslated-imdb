I would like to state that this can be biased, since I am the producer of the film. Nevertheless, I will maintain a sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> The star of the film Oscar Ovies, gives a stellar job as Jeff Grinderlin, helpless hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than live. He brings a certain touch to his character, which really allows viewers to connect with them, often with a severe sense of comedy that canny. His mother, played by Christine Haber, a constant beam support, without it, it will fall apart on you. His friends also lend a hand in the life of Jeff, often making the choice for him, not allowing him to use his free will ... that he often neglects there anyway. <br /> <br /> The writing is superb, and the conversations flow like a scene from the film Kevin Smith, with half as many Ben Affleck Boo hoo festivals. <br /> <br /> The camera work is a bit cheesy at some points, and the sound can also use a boost, but the performances shine with fine details. It also relies on a beautiful soundtrack with local talent and an exceptional composer. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a pleasure. A rare gem among the many gems.
