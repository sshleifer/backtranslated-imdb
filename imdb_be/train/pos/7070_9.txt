One of the most attractive elements of the film Gilliam is that well thought visuals, backdrops cause anxiety, manic and frustrated characters proof of the involvement of the author. Instead most of the films (where the director is a kind of director for hire, paid to show a star or two), you can feel the presence of Terry Gilliam through experience. "12 Monkeys" indicates own vision and style Gilliam, unlike ordinary film-making for them. "12 Monkeys," is a variation on a similar theme Gilliam's repertoire: the repressive / recessive society, loneliness of the protagonist, the frustration associated with distrust, and parallel worlds. In this film, Gilliam does an excellent job of blurring the boundaries between the two worlds, using ambiguity to make the audience believe and know. This trend Gilliam neglected to fill some of the gaps, leading to criticism of arthouse pretentiousness. The difference between Gilliam and intricate posers that choice Gilliam clearly have a purpose, and all of its image has meaning. Two almost identical Cole bathing scene in the beginning designed to compare the performance that leaves the audience unsettled. His bald head is a sign of uniformity in disease covered by the world of the future, but makes it known, in 1996 the world. The name itself is a sign of creativity Gilliam, because it requires the majority of stories to flesh out the meaning to be quite clear to him. Overall, the commitment to Gilliam to make creative movies that are fun to watch and even require a deliberate and interpret audience. The film is important to watch again, since the fine details and hints that can be skipped during the first scan. Definitely one of my favorites.
