If you have had drama in your life, either your own or someone close to you, stages the pain of this woman (but, in my opinion, it would be easy as a man) goes very, very real. This is a film that is not able to cope with the pain of not knowing what to do to help yourself get through it. Obviously, this is the movie, not knowing how to help someone close to you go through the pain. This is a film that makes you realize that all alone in their suffering. This is a movie that could push someone over the edge ... that hardly sounds like a recommendation. I'm not sure I would recommend anyone to go see this movie, especially someone close to, but for me ... it's a film that puts things in perspective, showing a real pain, and is therefore very relevant to be alive. It makes you realize that hey, do you or the person next to you have experienced the pain that hey, all you worry about is now so little value
