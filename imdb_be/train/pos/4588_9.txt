Evaluation of PG-13 for violence, sexual humor and short drug possession. Quebec Rating: 13+ (must be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I saw the police story a couple of times now.In my story police thought better film with Chan 80's.He originally did it because it is not like the other cop movie that he had to be removed which was not seen Protector.I defender, so I can not compare.The actions are not so bad and the plot is quite good.I don 'remember the story well, because I've seen this movie a while ago, but what I remember, this film has a lot of great action, comedy stunts and just what a good film Chan ne eds.If you can find Police Story, and you Chan fan, then buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Duration: 106min <br /> <br /> 9/10
