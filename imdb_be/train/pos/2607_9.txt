Messages sent to a mix of the season finale, I felt a sense of joy and feelings lie and cheat. Ryazanov said all its viewers that the whole season nine was a lie, because her husband, Dan, died. It also recognizes that the family never won the lottery, as well as the fact that the season 9 lies just be the way she wanted, I wanted it to be. I'm still confused about when she told Becky ended with David and Darlene with Mark, because Mark and Becky to admit that she was pregnant. So I think it's just the way she wanted it to be, but it was not. So that the season finale was good, but sent mixed feelings. I'll always be a supporter of the show. :)
