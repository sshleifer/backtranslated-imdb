At the beginning of the film we see in May and Toots are preparing for a trip to London to visit their adult children. You can see Toots is not in the best of health, but he goes along. If he dies suddenly, May's world begins to spin out of control. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Roger Michell, based on the screen play for Kureishi, is the study of how this mother figure comes to terms with its new status in life and her awakening in the world, she does not even know it was not until now. <br /> <br /> May suburban life as a wife, probably boring. Obviously, her sex life was nothing. We get to know it was a short extramarital affair, then nothing at all. When my husband lost it can not go home, so instead, she stays behind to look after his grandson in her daughter's home. It is in this situation, in May begins lust after young and hardworking Darren, her daughters sometimes lover. <br /> <br /> Darren wakes up in May of passion she had never known. It may respond by turning himself in our eyes. Mai, who at the beginning of the film tasteless, suddenly begin to clean up, it becomes interesting and attractive woman. She ends up falling head over heels with this young man who is holding her intense passion she had never felt before. <br /> <br /> Having known a few cases like this story, it does not come as a surprise to watch my reaction to me. Her own chance of a normal relationship with Bruce, a widower, ends disappointingly May, who understands how great her sex with Darren. Young man, we believe that only in this case, to satisfy themselves and for the opportunity to extort money from May. Finally, a daughter, Helen discovers that her mother was doing behind her when she discovers erotic pictures of her mother did. <br /> <br /> The film is a triumph of the director. In Ann Reed, Mr. Michel found an unusual actress who brings so much to the role of May. Also strange, Daniel Craig. He knows Darren will react to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones, Helen is also of vital importance for the history as it is one that has to confront his mother about what was going on behind her back. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small part, as Bruce elderly man in the class of Elena and is quite effective. <br /> <br /> The film is useful for those who will see it with an open heart. <br /> <br />
