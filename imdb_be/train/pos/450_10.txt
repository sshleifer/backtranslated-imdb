I tend to any film that paints a rich picture of Italy - in my opinion, the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the film was rather short, unusually so for part of the period, and some poor aspect of cinematography. However, the remarkable story makes for him. Four houses stand on a much needed relaxing getaway with problems on their minds. Throughout the film, they realize that their problems and to start their elimination. They believe that the San Salvatore, they remain in the castle, has a magical effect on people. "This is a bath of love," says Lottie Wilkins. You can keep track of their gradual change from frustration to violent, as Italian seaside works his magic on them. <br /> <br /> All their problems and ways to solve them plausible. Actresses were great. Background music seemed to be very suitable for a romantic Italian. In general, the 10/10 film for me.
