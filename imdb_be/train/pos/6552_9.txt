I usually do not really like Emma Roberts so much, but after watching the Nancy Drew is the kind of changed my mind. Actors in the movie made it all exciting and fun. Most of the time, when you watch a movie, you can solve the mystery of the middle of the show, but it's like you're actually there in the film. The keys must all match each other until you can finally understand the crime. I still wonder how she found him. The whole film was very smart and the people who watched me also loved the movie. Clothing was my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute. I do not think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out. I give him a nine, because the popular girls did not really seem to have a piece just right, but they still make me laugh. It was a really great movie and a great mystery. I would definitely recommend to watch.
