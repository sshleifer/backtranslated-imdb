This is the first and only full-length Paul F. Ryan. He has not done anything since. Nevertheless, he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast that reflect the characters of his stories. I do not know when and why did the idea in his head, but Ryan wrote the script, who later became his own producer of the film, "Home Room". <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps carries the film on her shoulders, like Alicia, restless girl; those that we always see in the television series. With dark hair and black clothes; a pack of cigarettes in his pocket, a strange look and anxious eyes (with cosmetics, of course). The event took place at her school; shooting. Some students have died, and she saw it all. Now Detective Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber) is investigating the case, and, as expected, Alicia is a suspect. But shooting only genesis; the film is not about the shooting. <br /> <br /> Lying in bed in a hospital ward is Diana Cartwright (Erika Christensen). It is one of the survivors in the hospital. The script establishes a connection between them, the school principal (James Pickens Jr.). It helps all students to recover from this event, but Alicia does not seem to care. It is isolated. Thus, the main punish her; she needs to visit Diana every day until five o'clock in the O Â». Then the movie starts. <br /> <br /> I can not even describe how wonderful it is written, I think the film. I can identify with the characters and the situations they live; I like reality. These things can happen to anyone. And what they say it is quite understandable. They are growing and trying to deal with things they have not experienced; they do their best. Without knowing it, Alicia (if she attends Diana for the first time) and Diana (if she sees Alicia, standing in front of it) is the beginning of a journey that will determine their personality and ideas for the next step in life; After graduating from high school. <br /> <br /> The director leads Christensen and Phillips through their roles very well. Look at the contrast between them. Diana seems naive and simple thoughts; It is not in her head. When Alicia enters her room and sees a ton of colors, she asks, "Who brought them?". "Many people," Diana answers; even though we know in a few days, that they from their parents, who come every week. Parental figures are well represented, but not as important as the characters of his sons. Diana alone. Alicia seems mature and tough; smoking cigarettes and talking tough. But after two days of the visit, she finds herself back in the hospital every day; even sleep in the room all night Dean. If both of them had a falling out after that, I believe, Diane says, "Why do you keep coming back." Alicia also alone <br /> <br /> ending of the film without destroying it, comes a little disappointing. this is what I did not expect. This eliminates some of the strength in the film there. Revelation comes completely unnecessary; destroying the logical culmination of the film could be. It was a great script in any case; and excellent direction. Damn fine film. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Erika Christensen, it was a role she has to fly higher. Her role in the "movement" was impressive, but it was a big step; the main role. Perhaps not many people had the opportunity to see her in this film, and it is a pity. She had not made one wrong move since. She has even come up with a good performance in terrible films. On the other hand, Busy Philipps, who turned out to be very promising in this film (that such a transformation), did not get a lot of opportunities for other roles. <br /> <br /> The same thing I can say about Paul F. Ryan (as a director, the curse), and I expect that it is now sitting at your computer, finishing his new script; I'm waiting for his next film. I hope the best for all of them.
