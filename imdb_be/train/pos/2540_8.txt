Although not as famous as some other of their cooperation (eg, a black cat and the body Thief) is a dandy little horror film, even when the casting decision was a bit strange. Boris Karloff plays Dr. Janos movement, a strange scientist who lives in the Carpathians - near where the hometown character Dracula. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet - whose nationality was never discussed, even though the name certainly sounds French. I really think it would make sense to have two switch roles as the Carpathian role seems tailor made for Lugosi - especially with his accent. However, despite this unusual twist, the two still did an excellent job. Karloff was definitely leading role, but Lugosi acquitted himself well as a relatively normal human being - that he has not played very often in movies !! It seems that Dr. Rukh little outcast, like other scientists (especially Beet) believe his theory bizarre and nonsensical. However, in the course of the film, the NIA is correct and Bennet is especially generous in his praise for the new NRU. But, unfortunately, a great new element to detect the movement has an unpleasant side-effect of turning it into a crazy killing machine (not you hate it when that happens?). While it might have just been a good scientist gone mad story, the plot has been well built, well designed characters and insane movements are not one-dimensional killer, but challenging and interesting. <br /> <br /> This film is required to be filed for any people who hate the old horror movies, with the exception of. You can certainly say that Universal Pictures pulled out all the stops and made more budget film instead of cheap schlock like Lugosi and Karloff, unfortunately, is sought in the following years. Good stuff.
