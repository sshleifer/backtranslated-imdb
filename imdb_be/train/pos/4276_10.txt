At first glance, who is singing Over There just seems absurd and a great comedy ?? Only a kind of unusual, quiet and slow motion: what a mistake! <br /> <br /> Since the two singers on a deserted landscape, and then on the bus and a beautiful bunch of actors, it hides a gem! <br /> <br /> made up stories and false rhythm causes you to think, but it's comical, but simply allows you to guess what it will be fragile view movies. <br /> <br /> Not quite: a very funny for a moment, the dark thin cynical on the other, its development is surprising to all of you on the history ?? Very ingeniously and wittily presented all the characters are important actors and give them a full life. <br /> <br /> And surprisingly, it's based on a profound observation, a great master of the camera, and is of great importance, and in fact all, the general direction and how well presented the details that it just makes you forget that it's a movie : it's like watching a good human society, you do not know, one shot behind the camera. <br /> <br /> And you're one of them. It's simple, and just exceptional <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong !; does not mean that will be the scenario, the image quality, the score looks like an amateur, no, no! This is great art! <br /> <br /> Because it flows like a river ?? From high in the mountains down to the sea, with all sorts of grounds and wandering that this river will face on their way to the sea ?? from tiny things to the main flow. <br /> <br /> This metaphor that I used is the best way I can find to explain all the charm that there is someone over there to sing. For me, again, I take a hammer: simply exceptional ... <br /> <br /> I saw that the director is the one who made Blanc / Chat Noir chat, which I know quiet well-known ?? But, as I have not seen, I had no idea about this gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers wrote dithyrambical comments on this film, I totally agree! <br /> <br /> Eastern European cinema does not know very well, because it is rarely in the translation, but I was lucky to have this one in an original language, with good English subtitles. In general: a deep, delicious and exclusive ... <br /> <br /> For a quick burst and empty types and special buffs effect, avoid it at all costs, it may be too thin and good for you <br /! > <br /> But if you are interested in various genres and / or classics, I think you will not regret this one, and in the case of purchase, it will have good communication in your personal DVD library, with the least deserved big names like Billy Wilder, Lubitsch, or Guitry among some of my preferred directors. At least for this film! <br /> <br /> *** The film is never a good thing when the camera is not an eye in the head of the poet Orson Welles ***
