Well, if you're one of those movie katana nuts (like me), you'll appreciate this metaphysical katana spit blood swinging samurai action flick. <br /> <br /> Cast Tadanobu Asano (Vital, sterile Illusion) & Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This war between samurai clan against clan Heikki GESJ touch the zenith in the final battle on Gojo Bridge. counting body is innumerable. <br /> <br /> The demons, magic swords, Shinto priests against Buddhist monks and excellent vision provided by the maestro Sogo Ishii will do the rest. <br /> <br /> good Japanese flick for a rainy summer night.
