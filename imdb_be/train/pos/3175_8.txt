This is fine as this film pulls you forward. I was an honest laugh. No matter what the reason is the low-budget thing works for me. To be honest, my wife does not really go for it in the same way, but she prefers a different type of film. She admitted, however, that it was a very creative and well together, and probably all on a string shoe. These characters, who live and surprisingly anxious to give me something to relate in his own world. Just keep going and be who you are. Marie is what you make of them. Watching this film the second and third time I realized that there are some hidden things that passed me in the first time through. What can I say, I like my fun with some difficulty. Anyway I liked. Hope to see more.
