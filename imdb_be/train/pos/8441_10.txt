For those who loved the series, this film will be something to watch. However, it also leaves you wanting more. I loved the way that each character (Detective) made an appearance. Least to the end which is the fourth occasion they leave the chair for another film. My guess Bayless is known. This is how the series was very good with a number of scenes. This is a series I wanted to live. Thanks to some excellent cast of the TV.
