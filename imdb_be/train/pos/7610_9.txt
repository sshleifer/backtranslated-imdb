Only seen season 1 so far, but this is just great !! A wide variety of people are stuck on the island. No one is who they seem and everyone seems to have loads of skeletons in the closet .... it sounds like Melrose Place meets family Cruise and why is it so great? It's probably not, but then classified spoon full X Files, a dose of "what" ?? and a big "hey" and the island, which is all you ever dreamed of - a curvature in your nightmares and you will lose. History had so many twists and turns, it's unbelievable. Large set-up, tough action to free the recognition that at the end of each there is a man (well, almost all ... I think ...) with good and bad sides. But strange oh so strange ...
