Not as SpongeBob SquarePants, I have not seen more than a cartoon on TV. The colors are great, voice could't be better, the characters are so original, great big cartoon. Hope Nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon. I hope that the season DVD coming out soon !!! I like cartoons like this, and I hope that more people will tune in to the southeast of this great cartoon. It is very difficult to find a DVD season, so if someone finds a store that sells it, please let me know. Catscratch only product available on the No Shop is a great Lookin shirt, but very very very expensive !!! If you love Spongebob; and who doesn''t?; Catscratch you will love too!
