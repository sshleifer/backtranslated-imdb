I have seen almost all the films of Cynthia and this is the funniest thing for me. It reminds me of the early films of Jackie Chan. True, Ms. Rothrock may not be the greatest actress, but she is very good to watch and as a master of martial arts and is a very nice young lady. This film, while probably not the best of all her films, was the most interesting.
