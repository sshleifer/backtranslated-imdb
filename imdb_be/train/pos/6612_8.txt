Just like Final Fantasy CG has brought a whole new level, this rebirth for motion capture. Neither the film nor a cartoon, this motion picture looks like an homage to film noir, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner, and the new generation of European cartoonists. You see Paris, it can almost be characters seem as real as you and I blink, drive, trembling as real actors in a way never achieved before. <br /> <br /> Do not go looking in the hope of finding a mind twister. You are more likely to understand it before you're halfway out of the film. The script, of course, too simplistic in comparison with known thriller, but it is certainly a feast for the eyes.
