First, let's start with the negative points: 1) there is a large, uncovered a whole in the storyline and the issues raised did not get where near getting an answer; 2) The film is not for all people, so rude audiences become restless and begin to bark during the film. <br /> <br /> Point two above is very important, because the film is very quiet. The older type of theater (like the one I went to), you can hear the drum, which runs through the projector at times. I loved it. The film does not keep you busy with music and effects :. It allows you to think about what is happening <br /> <br /> There is a lack of rhythm, which creates an atmosphere that is fun extremely pleased enjoyable. F kind of atmosphere generated in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend a movie buff like a cinematographic work is amazing. Those who base their assessment of the film exclusively on the stories will be completely disappointed. This is the story of what you have to do is to link in your mind then. (My version is damn cool, but probably not in the way!) If you go to catch a movie, there is a very steep part: when two police officers talking to each other on their mobile phones. Ultra-cool sound effect, which really puts you in the moment. Hats off to the man who was thinking of doing it.
