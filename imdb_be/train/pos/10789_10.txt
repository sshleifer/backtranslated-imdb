When I was little, my parents got this movie for me to watch. I really liked it, and I watched it over and over again. Even when I was in 3rd grade, I was still watching it from time to time. I recently watched again, just for the sake of nostalgia, and even though the show was not intended for my age group (I'm in my late teens), I still found it to be entertaining and educational. This show is to teach good lessons about fantasy and get along with others. Some parts I found quite interesting. In addition, this show has nothing wrong with the content, so that you can leave your children alone with this show and not have to worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot. I would recommend it.
