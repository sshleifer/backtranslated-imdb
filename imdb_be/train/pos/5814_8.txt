With all this material falls at the moment with MJ I started listening to his music, watching the odd documentary here and there, and again watched the Wiz looked rover. Maybe I just want to get some idea about a guy who I thought was really cool in the eighties, just maybe, if he dare guilty or innocent. Lunokhod is part biography, part of a feature film, I remember, to see in the movie, when it was originally released. Some of them have subtle messages about MJ sense of the press, as well as the obvious drug messages are bad m'kay. <br /> <br /> Visually impressive, but of course, it's all about Michael Jackson so if you're even remotely reminiscent of MJ in any case, you'll hate it and find it boring. Some might call MJ selfish for agreeing to this film, but MJ and most of his supporters would say that he did it for the fans, who, if the truth really nice of him. <br /> <br /> The actual function is a little film when he finally starts only for 20 minutes or so excluding Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci convincing as psychopathic drug lord almighty. Why does he want MJ is dead, so bad is beyond me. Because MJ had overheard his plans? No, Joe Pesci character in the conversation that he wanted people to know that the one who delivers drugs, etc., I do not know, maybe he just hates music. <br /> <br /> Manchester United a lot of interesting things in it, like MJ turning into the car and the robot, and the entire sequence of Speed ​​Demon. In addition, the Director should have the patience of a saint when it came to shooting Kiddy Bad sequence, as a rule, managers hate to work with one child, not to mention a whole bunch of them performs a complex dance scene. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, it's a movie for anyone who loves MJ on one or the other level (which I think most people). If not, stay away. Is to try and produces Helpful and ironic Bestest buddy MJ in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson, one of the most talented people to ever grace this planet, but he is guilty? Well, with all the attention I gave on this subject .... hmmm well I do not know, because people can be different behind closed doors, I know it's a fact. He's either very good, but a foolish man, or one of the craziest liars. I hope it does not last.
