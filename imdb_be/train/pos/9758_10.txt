Personally, this is one of my favorites of all time! no, I'm not 10, I'm 30 ..! I own an old, original VHS that I bought in a store lease. I watched it countless times .. <br /> <br /> while a fun film for children, it's intriguing film for adults. I once saw this film whiile .. I was not sober. my eyes were opened to things I had never noticed before. I saw morality as it is strongly recommended both overtly and some subconscious .. I wish I could remember all that I have noticed, in particular, but it was a long time since then. Be sure there are many things which were discussed throughout the film. If you get a chance to see it .. .. not sober to do this, you will not be disappointed .. in fact, you will probably feel quite happy and warm. <br /> <br /> The unique and beautiful!
