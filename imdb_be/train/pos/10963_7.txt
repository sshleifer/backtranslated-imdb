I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's sister and a cousin of the women, will contribute to the Maysles', to make the "Big Eddie" and "Little Edie" The theme of the film. Of course, they could be considered as "skeletons" in the family closet. Additional features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers lending some of their ideas in these beautiful women. I would say that someone is interested in fashion will find a discussion of this fascinating designer. (That is, "Are they nuts? Or am I missing something?"). This film is difficult to find. Netflix does not have it. Verge of doing, though.
