There's really not much to say about this movie .... that's rough, but fun. <br /> <br /> site plan (from IMDB) <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> Two losers from Milwaukee, Coop and Remer (Parker & Stone), come up with a new game, playing basketball, using baseball rules. When the game becomes a huge success, they, together with the help of billionaire BASEketball form a professional league, where everyone gets the same salary, and neither team can not change the city. Team Coop & Remer, in Milwaukee Beers is the only team that stands in the way of the main rules of the changes that the owner of the Dallas criminals (Vaughn) wants to initiate. <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> The acting is very good, because there arn't many big stars in the movie. Although I am not a big fan of «Southpark», Parker and Stone do a very good job in his first real film. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny moments in this film I can not come close to naming them all. He never allows, and they do not try to put some Cruddy drama to make it more serious. <br /> <br /> And my favorite aspect of this movie: The Soundtrack. That's fine. I especially like the "Take Me" and "Beer" by Reel Big Fish. Very underrated. <br /> <br /> In general, crude, but very funny movie. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
