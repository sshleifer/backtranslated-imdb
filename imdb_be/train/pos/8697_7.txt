Often laugh out loud funny play on sex, family, and classes in Beverly Hills milks more laughter from a zip than he had seen since the days of Grandma and Jed Clampett. The plot focuses on two chauffers, who already bet on which one of them is the bed of their employer (as a single, there will soon be a lady, quite sexy - Bisset and crows) in the first place. If Manuel win his friend pay off his debt to violent Asian street gang - if he loses, he has to play the lower man to his friend! <br /> <br /> A lot of raunchy dialogue rather patient physical humor, etc. But many of the comedy under the surface. Bartel memorable as a very sensual Audra family member who finishes taking his sexuality, teenage niece in the summer "mission trip" to Africa. <br /> <br /> fun fun.
