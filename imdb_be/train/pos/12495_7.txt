What's good about it: Some ingenious and truly awful little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan. Do not rely on the downed soundtrack pervades their "gotcha" moments. Even if you've already seen all that there are still a few things in this movie that will make your jaw drop <br /> <br /> What could be better for him :. The action was the time, flat and unconvincing. He had a quality of "shot on video" in some places (though, the atmosphere was achieved mainly cares), and the camera work is full of unnecessary Closeup of senseless actions. Although the effects of really awful, I think they may have gone to the well a few too many times, with some of them. The ending seemed rushed, and silent, what could be more dramatic moments. The viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves rather than as a challenge to the filmmakers, but because they just missed it. <br /> <br /> However, the good little indie horror film, which is easily a few steps above the average. Well worth a rental.
