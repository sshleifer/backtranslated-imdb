Apparently Deodato learned early on that his story would not work when he went to her too seriously, so he decided to camp it. As a result, a film that can be viewed either as ridiculous sword and magic epic or as a very interesting comedy! And I think I'll go to the second path. Short Gore points well done, Paul Brothers openly scoff material (they even bark at each other in one scene!), And there is also a charming, energetic, good-natured appearance Eva La Rue, the girl tags along with "the boys." Besides, where else can you see the inside of a dragon burning like a disco ?? (***)
