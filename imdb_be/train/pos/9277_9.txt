"Film is dead, long live cinema!" Said Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors, the Romanian Film Festival in Anonimul last year, which reached the third edition and takes place in the Danube Delta. This year, the "offside" the prize went to the direction of Panahi. I have to see him tonight in Bucharest in retrospect festival. Movie dead but still very much alive. The film Panahi said in a spectacular manner, as the Iranian society looks. Digital removed, "offside" story inspired a real life event happened to her daughter Panahi: the trouble and the risk taken when we decided to visit a football match. It is forbidden in Iran, we are told. Panahi that can be done, it is done by several means, but probably a lot of work, intelligence and humor cultural patterns in a society that puts women in a separate level. The absurdity of the law becomes comical. The film has a happy ending, after all, because Iran's team goes to the World Cup. What I appreciate most of all the concept, the idea of ​​this film. I would be very interesting to see the other films Panahi was forbidden in Iran, as well. I believe that it can be considered as an activist filmmaker.
