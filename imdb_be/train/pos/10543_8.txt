Light-hearted comedy, does not show us the world is nothing that we sometimes want to escape: the world is nothing. Everything that you do not like, whether it's a pile of bills, poor memory, or even hunger can disappear in your wish. They came to this film very well, and with a pleasant starring duo had only a few things that I did not want out of nothing, and they were not even part of the main movie. <br /> <br /> First, a post-credits scene (and yes, there is one): Good for a laugh, but what they were trying to achieve with this? I was confused and wants to see a return to something after a film is nothing. Instead, we just hear a random collection of sounds, and they cry. He is trying to create a sequel, in my opinion, and in fact need not, and was not funny after a tortoise crawled out of the frame <br /> <br /> Second, the trailer :. I saw the trailer on DVD and as others have said, it is, it contributes to a horror movie that never came. Well, bad marketing, I think. <br /> <br /> If you see it in your movie rental store, look, because nothing is a great movie to watch. If you have a large screen, though, you might want to wear shades.
