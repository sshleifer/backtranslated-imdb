I must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. But to get it, I got "Spanish judge" in February, I think. It was mentioned, it was the last instance, but as I can see, he did not come back-ordered. But in any case, I have. I thought it was good. I would like to see it mainly because of the great actor, Matthew Lillard (I will not be surprised, no one in the reviews already tripe), although it is a kind of low budget, getting enough money to make this movie worth it to spend. Man, what a good actor. <br /> <br /> The story of his scams, known as Jack (Matthew Lillard), who "claim" to be traded under the name of a Spanish judge. If you do not know that Spanish judges have not seen the trailer for this, and this is the first review you read, I will not even say that they are. I believe that this will be a big turn, no one knew what it was. He needs protection, so he hires a couple of which are also scammers, Max and Jamie (DOnofrio and Golin), as well as the scammer going by the name of Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a friend who will not even tell anyone her name because she was from Mars, she said. Thus, they (mostly Jack) call it "Mars Girl». Everything starts fine, but then it turns into one big game. The game, which includes some of lust, lies and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There was some of the steps in it (Matthew and Valerie and Tamara, were not one of them). There were some scenes, they could have done better, and the account could be a little better as well. Some of the scores were actually good. The theme they used to start and end (before credits) has a good selection of songs, this is my opinion. The fight in the end, may have been a little bigger and a bit stronger, but what can you do? Another comment Matt: Damn, he plays a sleek, smooth con artist <br /> <br /> I know that this is a review, but I need to make a correction in the direction of Necro, one reviewer :. Golin is no stranger. According to this site, it operates since 1983, for me, and hopefully to others, it is well known as an Italian love interest Charlie Sheen in both «Hot Shots!» Films. But a good review. <br /> <br /> While I think this is one of those rare films that I've seen, and it's very good (that's why I gave him 10 stars above), I will give an assessment of what I thought when I first I saw it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
