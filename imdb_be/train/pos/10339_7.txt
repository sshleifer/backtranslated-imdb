I saw the trailer for this on Afro Promo, a collection of movie trailers for films with African-Americans. It seems that it is; very biased "silly" comedy in which alarmed black man realizes that his son is gay. It would seem that (RF) Redd Foxx's wife left him for his brother, who works with him in the "store" back to Phoenix. He took the bus to visit his son Norman in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> So how come RF, Norman, do not wear anything but powder blue bikini shorts, comes out of his water bed to answer the door. Trying to win time, making his elderly father to take the stairs to what seems to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake her lover, who refuses to budge steadily. This was just the place where I wrote "Why did not he wake up?" If all of a sudden he was doing, and I, and the jaw of my friend fell for the first of many times, we introduced our first glimpse of the blue-eyed vortex-hairdoed Garzon, Norman white roommate who just "was the most faaaaaabulous dream ?? "Garzon is a flaming queen type, which can be imagined, as leaving LA since 1976. He has a dress and purse and big clunky jewelry, and seems to be modeled by his appearance and persona Carol Brady in The Brady Bunch. <, Br /> <br /> Norman tells his beloved to find somewhere else to stay during a visit to his father. Garson is to stay with Waylon Flowers and Madame return phone calls when Norman calls. <br /> <br /> In this way, Russia is trying to reach his wife in Mexico. While he was on the phone, Garzon comes to pack his clothes and Russia oppose it. With a splash of 70s soul meant to call it dawn discovery (but sounding more like we're going to hear a very special emotion track), he realizes that his son is gay. <br /> <br /> His first impulse, "I'll kill him. I'll kill him. "Then the Russian goes for a long walk in which he enumerates all thoughts confused father may have, for example," maybe we toilet taught him too early. "His thoughts were all caused by what he sees on his walk, for example, a major driver of the truck, which is just as it considers what makes a real man. Surprisingly, he goes to the store and buys about eight books on homosexuality. This, I must say, it's about eight more books about homosexuality than my parents bought. Then he goes straight on a bench in the park and reading them all! <br /> <br /> RF then hires Audrey, a six-foot Amazon prostitute (in this amazing fur thing) plays Tamara Dobson Cleopatra Jones. He hired her for Norman try heterosexuality, but it infuriates Normans and he storms to go to stay with her friend Melody. <br /> <br /> Then comes Garzón and offers to the Russian Federation for the night. He commiserates over the loss of his wife of the Russian Federation, and tells the story of his mother, who bears an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos, because "she was molested at a luau." They attend long featured Wayon performance and Madame, which culminates in Madam furiously beat his head against piano while her hair is not freed. Once again, their mouths agape. <br /> <br /> So, it seems that I did not know, the Russian Federation and Garzón have a wonderful evening together! You see, balanced, traditional old black people just have to see shitty, high effeminate entertainment mega-queen to come to all the gay world has to offer! It really is that simple! It also does not prevent the Russian Federation from yelling "rape" if Garzon awakens him from a bad dream. It ends with less predictable than you think. <br /> <br /> There were so many that it was just off. What is the basis of relationships and Norman Garzon «s? They seem to have no any relationship, and Norman would not hesitate whatsoever to push Garzon out, and even when it comes to standing up for himself, he never defends Garzón or talks about their relationship. There was some sweet fancy affect both the Russian Federation is going to buy all these books about homosexuality - ?? and it sits right on the park bench to read them! I like the idea that my father is actually trying to find something about homosexuality, not just to run, to get drunk, or to sympathize with their friends. <br /> <br /> In addition, it's kind of just what it seems as a little relic of a bygone era, an era in which some gay people to think that if direct alarmed people just sat and watched the play of resistance puppets, we all You could learn to love and understand each other! And because of all the naivete of this thing, the extreme stereotypes and loaded message dialog just magically come off as obsolete, and provide great grist for the discussion of how things have changed for gay in the last 30 years. I think the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gay women friends desperately in love with them, and are ready to get them drunk to sleep with, and expand converts them. <br /> <br /> ------ Hey, check out the Blue de Merde, my website on bad movies and cheese (with a few good movies thrown in).
