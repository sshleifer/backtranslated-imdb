"Good times," in my opinion, it is necessary to see the CBS hit! Despite the fact that I have never seen each episode, I still like it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Also, I really like a song . If you ask me, though I, like everybody else, it would be nice if everybody was on the show throughout its run. everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing has always been very strong . In conclusion, despite the fact that you can see on TV Land now, I toyliva recommend you catch him just in case he leaves the air forever.
