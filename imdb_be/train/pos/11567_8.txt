In the 1930s, the studios will use short films like this one species as test sites for new entrants, given their relative ease of production in comparison with the full feature films, so it's interesting that it is necessary to star Shirley Temple, which was long ago established itself as the most famous child star of all time. Then again, it was probably not the only one being tested, I would imagine that would be a knee Frank Jr., who played Shirley brother Sonny in the film and comes comparatively less impressive results. Again, the 9-year-old Shirley Temple is probably not an easy act to follow. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a clear supervisory gag involving a leaky ceiling, which I believe was designed to have a Shirley Temple give a contemptuous look at the ceiling, illustrate the status of the working class family in the film, and to provide a clean transition to the the next scene, which shows Shirley maliciously trampling in the rain. <br /> <br /> This is Sonny »birthday, and his father does casual and terribly unsuccessful effort to hide the fact that he wants to give a sleepy dog ​​what he really wants for himself, but Sonny is afraid of dogs, so he has been bitten once and was creeped out ever since. It is interesting that, when his father insists, to get a dog, Sonny decides to run away from home and do not have a dog in the house, and it runs entirely purpose in mind, it is also interesting that the film shows what appears to be indifference to homeless, that surpasses even the surprising indifference that exists today. <br /> <br /> Sonny passes bacon man training in the iron frying pan on the side of railway tracks (just after the train passed, by which, considering how close to the tracks he was, you would have thought would have blown the guy right off the rails, but it does not matter). After Sonny gives at breakfast exchange in connection with a sour look that his joyful smile from the guy gets, he continues, and the homeless disappear from the film. It is interesting to consider that the longer the film would have done, because this one comes out of this poor man as a free end. <br /> <br /> Not that that matters, Sonny quickly hear a dog whining under the overpass, as it passes through it and jumps down to find a dog covered with burrs. This may seem trivial, it immediately takes the dog and takes him as he just ran away from home because of his fear of dogs, but it seemed to me that he just needs to be reminded not to his authority over the dog, but because of the lack of power over him. As soon as he saw a dog in need, he overcame his fear. <br /> <br /> Hey, if that's all you need, all you need to do is find a breed of spiders and I'm set! <br /> <br /> This is great movie in which everything works just the way it is supposed to, but it's quite nice and pleasant enough (and sufficiently short as it was), still a fun movie. We do not expect that the epic story in the 19-minute film, but Pardon My Pups still packs a considerable number of stories and character development in its short running time. And it also shows the fight scene at the end of the film, which must be made Charlie Chaplin proud. I'm hardly an expert Shirley Temple movies, but it is not difficult to understand how she became the most famous child star of all time.
