Action, horror, science fiction, directed by Fred Olen Ray operation shows that he has some talent director. Character actor William Smith is one of the best hard / bad guys in the industry. He turns to the audience with the best performance of an acting career. As for Randy Travis, he gives his best impression of Lee Van Cleef. He's not a bad thing in the film. Smith and Travis make a film. As for the rest of the cast, none of them really stands out. Ray did a great job directing this film, Smith and Travis have been good, I would give this B West on a scale of one to ten (ten being the best) seven.
