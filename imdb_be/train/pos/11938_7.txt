I love movies like this for their spirit, sun pun. Its decent, clean film about a baseball team that falls behind and the young supporter wished them victory, as his deadbeat dad said it was the only way he would return to him. <br /> <br /> The spirit shines through in two ways: funny cast with Danny Glover and the young Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Al heavenly messenger, adopting a dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. His energetic film. It gets you to smile, and really draws you into the sport. <br /> <br /> Therein lies a pressure. The only thing that bugs me the interesting sports movies of this kind turn you into a fan unexpecting for the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I just find it odd that I should leave the movie thinking angels strong, good team, when in fact the base of my loyalty, such as it is, lies in the Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting, actually. If it's just a film about a team Underdog children, then it is good.
