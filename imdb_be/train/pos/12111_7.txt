When I first started watching this anime, I never thought that something that the bread could be really interesting, but fortunately, I was wrong. From that moment on, I started to watch it, the anime just pulled into the world of baking, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this anime is humor, which is very smart and very funny with some jokes are repeated. But the animation, sound, and character development is below average, while the disadvantages are not visible, so much in the first episode, because a lot of work on this anime, he's really starting to show in the last 20 episodes, where the reaction and repeated jokes just grow old, and not so funny as ever. <br /> <br /> I understand that if it ended with an anime episode 52, I would give it a 9, but the latest episodes to just leave a bitter taste, which, unfortunately, can not wash away the strange 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
