Henry Fool surprised me. I did not expect that to entertain and delight, as well as, or as much as it was. Fay Grim continues to surprise that it provides a reliable continuation in the story that does not seem to need. After the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the film, however, it becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the best sequel to the brilliant indie film. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. <br /> <br /> I'm a little disappointed that some of Jeff Goldblum is so small, but I'm glad that he is part of the short-term. He convincingly and as beautiful as Agent Fulbright. Also enjoying Liam Aiken, who quite accurately reflects Ned Grimm, son of Henry and Fay. <br /> <br /> This film is a pleasure for many reasons. I am pleased, for example, to discover that Henry is not really the one who lost it seems (until the end of the Fool), and later discover that he is, in fact, a genius ... well, what really is a great stroke of a pen. <br /> <br /> I hope they make a third ... like the end of the trilogy. It seems to be missing. They should entitle Ned Fool Grimm and it should be Lee looking for their father, to confirm the surprising change in his mother, and a sense of near-genius he felt welling inside him. Provided, of course, it Fay continues to deny many of the most important facts from his son about his father. It feels like it should be done. I would buy it. <br /> <br /> Even with more action, this is not the action flick. This is more drama and intrigue ... a mystery of sorts. I'll watch it often <br /> <br /> It is estimated at 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> hostile.:.
