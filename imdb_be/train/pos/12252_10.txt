I really enjoyed this adaptation of "Emma" .I have seen it many times, and I always look forward to see him again.Though it lasts 107 minutes, most of the new site i sub-sections have been developed satisfactorily, all the characters are well painted . Most of the dialogue comes directly from the novel without any silly jokes added in Sense and Sensibility Emma Thompson. <br /> <br /> As a foreigner, I especially appreciate the excellent diction actors. Setting and costumes were beautiful. I find this version quite on par with the miniseries "Pride and Prejudice" in 1995, but then the producer and writer were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a very good job, which shows the "Emma" with which Jane Austen said that it will create a heroine, no one but her, I would. She's pathetic, but has only quite young and inexperienced to be more likeable. Mark Strong was also very good painting, Mr. Knightley, not the easy part, I think he has no charisma shown by Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. Even at the end of the scene (the harvest festival), which does not occur in the novel provides a fitting end, except if it shows Emma coldness and almost unpleasant to Frank Churchill, while in the novel it was fully reconciled with him, even telling him that she would have enjoyed duplicity, if it were in his situation. Strange deviation from the otherwise loyalty shown throughout the film. I find the costumes more beautiful and complex than in other adaptations of the novels of Jane Austen.
