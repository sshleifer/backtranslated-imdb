I have to start saying this was a long time since I've seen, but I saw him 5 or more times; great little tomboy, who was clearly inspired by the musical comedy / pairing new or fading star with musical groups prominences. Kay Kyser secrets would be a good example. <br /> <br /> With Spike Jones Unleashed is the best part of the show, as he and his band played many tunes, and are part of the action, do an excellent job support. Hugh O'Brien plays face, Buddy Hackett of the hearing, it was suggested that Lou Costello, and therefore, Abbott and Costello replaces wires. I do not know if it's true. <br /> <br /> In general, a nice film, but it is important to have as many Spike Jones and his band on film for history. I wish that he was released, because I have not seen or heard of him now in two decades. I hope that it is not lost
