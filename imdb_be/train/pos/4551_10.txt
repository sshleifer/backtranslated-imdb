I have never seen such an incredible acting job in the movie, as I did when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis to play Christy Brown in My Left Foot. In fact, from the scene of his role was not even finished. He played the role of Christy Brown, or at least invalid, as it all through the filming and needed surgery due to injuries his superior action was taken to his back. For me it is a great and after all the pain he had to endure to act this role, I think it is quite fair to say that he has put on the Oscar worthy performances in history. He was so artfully in this tough part, I believe that no one could do it better or more influential than he. Although I can not say that this is the greatest film of all time, I can say that he played the role of the impossible, and then continued his acting as he was not even the acting is not without doubt, the greatest legs I kogda ever seen an actor do. Probably, too, the man on the issue.
