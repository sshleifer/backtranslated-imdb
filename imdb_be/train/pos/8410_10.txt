This is really fascinating, dark movie, ruined a young student selling his soul to the devil for a lot of money in return for the devil takes his mirror image (it's done brilliantly in the film and scary predicted when Balduin, a student previously practicing fencing in front of the mirror) visual metaphor "man at war with himself," that is an omen of his immediate future. The student has the money, but the woman he loves is unattainable (he made a pact with the devil, he is cut off forever from the love and other forms of wealth of the soul), you can have love, or you can exchange your soul for money, you can not have both . Balduin pursues its twin (in intertitles put it nicely, as does the effect. Some scenes are incredible, the feeling of hopelessness, when the Devil disappears from the display Balduin surprising, since it is the feeling that his contract has not ever cut off from human society (the scene where he escapes from his double, and ends up in a "void" on the outskirts of the city, is no longer quite human (he lost his soul), he looks like a hunted animal is human society. there are so many other things to say about this incredible fil IU. Paul Wegener was a strange actor and director, the cultural hero of my. it helps if you know a bit about the history of Germany at the time the film was made and the German counterpart tradition (not Google it, get the right book) Just remember that it is very early in the film, it's a little awkward at times, but given what he has to say, and it's tragic end, is one of the best ever (yes it is!)
