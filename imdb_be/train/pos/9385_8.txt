Red Rock West is an excellent example of how well the film may be little or no budget. All you need is an intelligent script, good actors and atmospheric load. RRW delivers all this and more. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage plays an ex-marine, injured in Lebanon, which is down to its last $ 5 once refused to work in the oil field due to a bad knee. He role in Red Rock and in the wrong bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, not quite like his most menacing, but still evil) for HIT-man from Texas. <br /> <br /> It pays him to kill his wife and make it look like a burglary. Only when he gets there, just to check it out. She offers him twice to kill Wayne. Cage just wants to get out of town with his money in their pockets and leave a lover to be sparring. But a series of mishaps and failures lead him yo-yoing and Red Rock, back and forth. This ultimately leads to a showdown with Lyle from Dallas (cheeky and somehow sympathetic Dennis Hopper), a hit-man from Texas who offers to help, not knowing what he was doing the story more complex. <br /> <br /> RRW has never been a big release, so a large part of his audience found it on video or on cable TV shows. Viewing it in this way, can make it seem like a television movie, but it's more than that. Spot slow timely direction, moody score and howling wind of the desert would all make for a great movie in the cinemas, but the best thing you can do these days to watch a DVD on the big HDTV. <br /> <br /> the only weak point of the film, I can remember the sad fatal Lara Flynn Boyle on the other dike-ischemia hairdo. Of course, I'm not going to fall on her, but if it is assumed that Nic Cage's character in the militant lesbian, you'll take it, nonetheless.
