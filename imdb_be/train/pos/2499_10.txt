This movie was awesome. He had the original concept (Yakuza mob film meets a vampire movie). This humorous yet very dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death, happiness, and subtelly comments on society. On the part of Gackt Camui role Shaw was beautifully staged, and Hyde was surprisingly good for his first film as exhausted yet humorous vampire, Kei. I, too, was laughing and crying at the careless nature Toshio, who grew up with Shaw. I loved every second of this film, especially the moments, such as cigarettes funny scenes, fight scenes, and most of all, the heartrenching ending.
