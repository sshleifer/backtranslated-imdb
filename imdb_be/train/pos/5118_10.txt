******** Spoilers - Careful ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm biased when it comes to the Urban Cowboy. I love it and watched it countless times - and usually find something new about it with each viewing <br /> <br /> I think one of the things that I love about it is that the people Urban Cowboy working class. Rather than rich people who live in either Los Angeles or New York. Well, this is true for Pogo. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Bud, a small town Texas boy who moved to Houston to work in the oil fields, with the exception of. And that if Travolta actually play good dramatic films as Saturday Night Fever, instead of playing the stereotypical bad guys / good guy in the big budget films. This is a really good movie - a mechanical bull competition and the two-step dance may be silly, but you should use this for what it is <br /> <br /> Bud meets Sissya (played by Debra Winger with Slutty shine.) - and soon after they were married and living in his trailer dreams. But their relationship becomes real life struggle of the sexes. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sisi wants to be with this cowboy. But in our time, the role of men, are not so obvious. Where can prove Bud, he was a real man? It can run its dangerous work day and night to ride the mechanical bull - it can be "Urban Cowboy." But Sisi wants to run their pick-up, and she wants to ride the mechanical bull, too. So what is the Bud? As Cisse asserts her independence, she was lying on the bull riding and flirting with the ex-cheater and a prison rodeo star - a real bull rider--, Wes (played wonderfully thick Scott Glenn). The embryo is at risk, and Bud and Sissy break. <br /> <br /> Cisse huts of Wes, who abuse it. Emasculating themselves further bud becomes boy toy Pam, rich girl whose dad is in the oil, and all that entails. Sissi comes trailer to clean it up - Pam to do this kind of thing. She wrote a letter makeup Bud, but evil Pam breaks it and takes credit for housework Sissi. <br /> <br /> Bad Uncle Bob dies tragically at work when lighting strikes and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy is a chance for reconciliation, but too stubborn. Later, mechanical bull riding competition at Jill, and you know Bad is going to win. Pam understands that Bud did not love her, but Sissy - he did it for her. Wes tries to rob Gilleys, but do not know that the city cowboy, Bud, saves and plays the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> Of course, you might ask yourself, why would Bud and Sissy to Gilleys about every night and "live like pigs." Maybe that contributed to their bad marriage. Or why not stay with Bud Pam - she was not so bad, and money. Or why they had to kill his uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy were so stupid friends like Marshall and Jesse, who always try to break them, says Marshall Bud, Â«She {Sissi} riding that bull better than you!" But part of the fun of the Urban Cowboy ridicules it a bit - Needless to say, not what Bonnie Wright on stage!
