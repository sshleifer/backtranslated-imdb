It's cute and sad story about cultural differences. Kyoko beautiful Japanese woman to flee to California to get away from the failed relationships in Japan. Ken is a Japanese American worker handmade with the aspirations of rock 'n' roll stardom, but little concrete to offer to a potential partner. Kyoko "marries" Ken to be able to reside in the United States, with the understanding that, even though they will live together, until it receives the "green card" marriage will be in name only. Soon it develops that the parties are not on the same wavelength - or, perhaps, in the same "time zone", hence the title of the film. As an immigration lawyer I have seen these "mechanisms" to take on its own life, so I was pleased to see how well the director developed the dramatic possibilities of the situation.
