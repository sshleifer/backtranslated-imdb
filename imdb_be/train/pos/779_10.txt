In northeastern Brazil, the father of twelve illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sells his daughter to the average person dens organization Tade (Chico Dias), which will be used as a housekeeper and have a better life. Nevertheless, she resold farmer Lawrence (Otávio Augusto), which deflowers her, and he gives his humiliation at her teenage son to have their first sexual experience. Then she goes to a brothel in a golden field in the Amazonas and explored its owner, despicable Saraiva (Kalloni, Antonio). When Mary flees to Rio de Janeiro, waiting for a better life, she studied in cáften Vera (Darlene Glória). <br /> <br /> «Anjos do Sol" exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil through the fate of the girl Mary. In the past year I have seen "Lilya 4-ever", that tells the identical story in the former Soviet Union; Therefore, this problem exists in third world countries. The director and writer Rudy Lazhmann is a great film that reflects reality, but never showing nudity or sex scenes are obvious. This is a promising debut of Fernando Carvalho, who has an excellent performance in the role of a frightened child is struggling. Most prostitutes lovers, and it can not be considered a well-known Darlene Glória is so different it after many plastic surgeries. Slides and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. . My vote is ten <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos Do Sol" ( "Angels of the Sun")
