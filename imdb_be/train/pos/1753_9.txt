As we all know, that the sub-genre of sex comedies quite crowded. Just being overly obscene lacking. I have seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and action, comedy sex really need to have other positive aspects to come to me in these days. <br /> <br /> Joining the 40-year-old virgin, I knew mainly expected; I saw the ad after all; "It is true that if you do not use it, you lose it?" What I did not expect to find this heart and honest attempts at character development. There is still enough "off-the-wall" characters that we see so many Adam Sandler movie is still quite acceptable language drowning Noah, but somehow the film is worthy of a love story and even chat. <br /> <br /> protagonist Andy (unfortunately for me) person, I can touch. The first picture I see that he even shares my love of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the film on his wall), and throughout the film we get to see him really neat collection of antiquities. Andy also has a large number of video games and movies, and a practical knowledge of technology. Andy does not want to buy a car, because he prefers his bike. The most important thing of all; Andy is a good man, he does not swear, and he respects women, so much that he stays away from them. Combine all these factors, and one begins to think that he is a serial killer. It's like the story of my life. <br /> <br /> The other characters each have a funny story to go along with them slightly exaggerated persons and all of them work at a certain level, but not as much as Andy does. I felt that it was a kind of distraction on the road, as Andy and his girlfriend Trish is really the only true human characters in the whole film. <br /> <br /> I think, as I have one flaw I could also bring other notable one to light. Story is clever, but too predictable and, as far as songs go; it's pretty simple. We are talking about the relationship with Andy Trichet for a long time, and we all know that this will happen in the end. Of course, his final detour a little differently than we expect, but you know that it will happen in the end, and I assure you that it does. This is definitely a small spot on the film, but there is so much good here, I can easily ignore it a few drawbacks. <br /> <br /> When I say "good" I mean "bad", of course. It's a comedy of sex and he wants to be poor. For the most part, I think it's possible. There are so many funny scenes such as Andy tries to get rid of the erection after refusing to have sex with Trichet. Or the scene where Andy is with his daughter Trichet to the class of sexual education, where he ends up asking more questions than anyone else. Oh, and we should not forget, soon to be classic chest waxing sequence Â«Ooh! ! Como itself Lama "An interesting note to that scene; actor Steve Carell actually made wax his stomach and pain showed real. Of course, they only did one take, but it was still a very bold move on his part. <br /> <br /> In fact, since we are talking about Steve Carell, I would like to say that it has now risen to my list of respected comedians, which is his native surprising, because I do not even know who he was before he met the film. I'm just so impressed by his writing, acting and time, now I really want to keep an eye on his future role. This man has talent is 40-year-old virgin proves that. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I had my doubts about this film, but in the beginning the word was positive and I knew it was something I will eventually see. I am glad that I, too, as this is probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, and it doubles as something that you feel is worth watching. This is not just a series of gags centered sex together, a series of sex jokes interwoven with the very nature of the challenges and really touching romance. Now excuse me while I go puke my guts; I can not believe I just wrote that ... <br /> <br /> My Review of Frider waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
