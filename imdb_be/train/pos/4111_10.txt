I first saw this film as a pre-teen, about the age when children begin to think of their identity. I have been to a large extent depends on the person and the place of children, he raises as his own. The older boy was teased by his mother a prostitute, and none of his brothers and sisters do not have the same biological father (who Kurosawa makes clear, having children who do not like each other). People still convinces Tho boy that he is their father, by definition, only that matters. The man known as the father of all the children, except one, who still prefers her brother. <br /> <br /> Each of the vignettes is also compelling for its own stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> this is a great movie, even if it is not the biggest movie Kurosawa.
