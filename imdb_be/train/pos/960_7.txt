This is a film that has a lot of things that only the Japanese can understand. Even well-translated, there are some things that, obviously, private jokes or regional symbols. I think he was trying to send a message of some sort, but it is only that he spent with me. <br /> <br /> What I felt that basically it is a mediocre film with good special effects. A child becomes a "one" and, in the end, has almost nothing to Yokai War, which makes no sense at all anyway. It would be nice to understand what the hell they were saying, but between Azumi beans wash youkai and one that looks like a big umbrella in the language (Rihanna eat your heart out!) I could not see the plot. <, Br /> <br /> The result: good visual effects, small cries a lot, the river princess terribly cute and all the other shit.
