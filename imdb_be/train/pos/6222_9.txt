This is a really great movie. Some of the songs became immortal classics and dancing Fred and Ginger is one of their best ever. But mostly all movies Ginger and Fred are the same. After the singing and dancing was over, it's the other characters in the movie, which make the film work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His affair with Harriet Hilliard and secondary plot of the film is the reason why I watch it again and again. He adds to this film, it does not detract from it. He has a winning personality and a big smile. Randy is in my top ten favorites list constantly. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. OK, so it is not really a great actor, but like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, and so it was very nice and could climb to the top in some cases. All films Ginger and Fred had sub areas that depend on the other members to fill the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the film would be reduced by about half an hour. I just want more people to appreciate Randy, and I felt the need to stand up to it.
