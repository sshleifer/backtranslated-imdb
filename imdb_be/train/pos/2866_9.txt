I grew up on this classic western series, and as a child, always felt this delicacy was allowed to stay up late on Sunday night to watch it. Bonanza has endlessly re-watchable in re-runs. <br /> <br /> The series chronicles the adventures of the Cartwright family living on a ranch near Virginia City, Nevada around the Civil War era. Their ranch (called Ponderosa) is executed and protected by a widowed father, Ben and his unmarried three sons of Adam, Hoss and Little Joe. These three brothers have a different mother, all of whom had died years earlier. <br /> <br /> Cartwrights is a hard-working, prosperous and honorable family, highly respected in those parts. Ponderosa big, so reaching his limbs requires a lot of riding. In addition, trips away are often needed in order to buy or sell the cattle and so on. Needless to say, some of these excursions are casually. While welcoming most of the Cartwrights energy 'must be spent defending their ranch from strangers, or to protect themselves from ordinary people jealous of their heyday and a stellar reputation. The Cartwrights do a fair bit of firing guns into the air and such, but only to shoot to kill if it is deemed absolutely necessary. They participate in a variety of urban affairs, even political life in the state of Nevada. <br /> <br /> One of the main assets of the series is the main heat, which is always present (despite occasional disagreements) between Ben and his three sons, and (despite frequent differences) between the three brothers. Now, one brother could bring down the other every now and then, but generally has a good reason for it at the time, and his anger never lasted long! The characters are all very well drawn. Ben is portrayed as a successful and honorable man of great integrity. The eldest son, Adam, the most efficient and courteous brother, left in the middle of the series. Middle brother, Hess, gentle giant teddy bear, which has a voracious appetite for food and a little shy give. The youngest, Little Joe, a hot head, a handsome charmer who, on the contrary, has a long way with women. This trio of brothers to enjoy a variety of romances, but their love interests are usually slaughtered at the end of the episode, or even marriage is not possible, for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> The actors all star in their roles, including Pernell Roberts (Adam), Dan Blocker (Hess), Michael Landon (Little Joe), and, of course, Lorne Greene as the principal family patriarch, Ben . I also love to cook ranch, Hop Sing, played by Victor Jung September. <br /> <br /> This is a great action westerly with large values. The Cartwrights always noble heroes and the majority of the bad guys pretty sneaky. If only there were more programs like this Vintage Western on TV these days!
