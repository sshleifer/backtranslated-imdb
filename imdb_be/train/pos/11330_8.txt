This is a wonderful story about guilt obsession initiative. <br /> <br /> Matisse, to a lonely night walk in Riga (?) It takes a woman on the wrong side of the bridge railing. He passes by without a word. Just a splash in the water, followed by a cry for help makes him act. Only then did too little too late. <br /> <br /> film chronicles their efforts on finding out more about this woman. On the troll of the local bars, he finds his notebook. He is part of more and more of her life together. His "look" changes as his obsession grows. He should do the right thing. The beautifully filmed dialogue with "bastard ex-boyfriend," he makes Alexej face to blame that both feel. <br /> <br /> Ghosts of long takes, gritty soundtrack to emphasize the guilt, the barking of dogs. Footsteps. Excellent noir with a wonderful twist. Indie good ending.
