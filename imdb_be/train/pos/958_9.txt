Wow! I have seen so many bad low-budget films in recent years, but this one is great. Very realistic image of the life of a police officer in the city on the east coast of Germany, a strong contrast to other films or crime series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any common clich√©s about the police. This film is realistic, as the documentation and entertainment, like a drama, at the same time. Ideal compromise!
