For all HOMICIDE addicts out there, this movie was great! Every character that has ever been on the show appeared in the film. This has helped to resolve some (but not all) of the questions in this series. Unfortunately, if you really did not watch the series, most of the fun is lost, since the film made heavy reference to the existence of every season of the show. It probably would have been appropriate as the series finale, as opposed to being a separate film, but we have to take what we can get. I hope they make more movies and still have HOMICIDE characters on Law & Order.
