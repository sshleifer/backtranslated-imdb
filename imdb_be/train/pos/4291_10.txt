From the opening shots lead actor, we made an early idea of ​​how so many men's lives run by women in them, and the humor that comes through with all that is happening on the same day on the day of "normal" life. <br /> <br /> Eric Lartigau, the director raises about how many European men feel that they are in full control of your life, but without the help / support women around them can not do the work, use of the face image for the film is excellent, and his intelligent positioning of older family members (mother) is in place. <br /> <br /> While there are more than enough laughs in the movie, it still has to deal with one parent / adoption and strength of the family in society. Really helpful to watch, and again one that only a French seam that can be done. <br /> <br /> So far one of the best 50 or so films I've seen this year, and is worth five start rating. I can not wait to add this one to the DVD collection when it is released and highly recommend it to all ages.
