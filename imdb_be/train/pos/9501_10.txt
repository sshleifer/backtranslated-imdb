I saw this film when it was released, and when I was 12 years old :) And I still vividly remember the beautiful scenes, the hero / heroine to run every time when faced with danger :) And the best feature film was the portrayal of the villain ! I think that many of the so-called militants copied many, many "scenes escape" from this film !! Not only it has never impressed me when I see a copy, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) Leading actors acted superbly. Slow and realistic development of chemistry b / w the hero and the heroine was very naturally and beautifully painted. As children, we felt that love, which is developed b / w them :) it was very natural as they encounter and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that could make even the children understand the value of true love, sacrifice and care. I recommend that everyone see this movie, when given the chance !! --Vijay.
