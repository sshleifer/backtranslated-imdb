I believe that this is the most powerful film HBO Pictures has made to date. The film was to be released to the public in cinemas to watch on the big screen. It is available on the video to make sure that you look at it, and check it out. Zherolmo Chris did a great job with the leadership and screenplay. Presentation by Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffrey DeMunn flawlessly. A masterpiece of the genre.
