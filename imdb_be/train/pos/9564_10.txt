This should be the best movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine the spectacular cinema with amazing acting and captivating story, and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> dog bite dog I grabbing the edge of his seat during some scenes, recoiling in horror at the other, and left me drowning in your own tears after the tragic denouement. <br /> <br /> film left a deep impression on me. This disgusting scene of violence contrasts sharply with scenes sharp and gentle "love." The film is worth it Cat III (nudity) assessment; nety nude scenes in general, and "love" scene does not even include kissing or "making out." <br /> <br /> In the message, the movie presented to me? All people, no matter how cruel or harsh they may seem, have a tender side. Edison Chen does a fine job playing the role of the murderous Pang. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this film 10/10. It it is necessary to look.
