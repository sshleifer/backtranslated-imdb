This is a fairly slow pace of the film, the story slowly builds a former stripper who starts a new family life with a complete stranger. The viewer slowly feels that there is something wrong here ... <br /> <br /> I really loved this film, even if it leaves a little bitter taste in the end. This is a reasonable, well-developed and very well acted. And Philip Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner deep into their characters. <br /> <br /> «Pierrot» son is also very touching. <br /> <br /> thriller that does not seem like one. Very unconventional film, very particular atmosphere throughout the film, even though you may feel uncomfortable a few times with a couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a 8/10 !!
