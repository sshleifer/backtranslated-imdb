I've never been on a huge IMAX films. They are great, but once you get over that initial impulse, "Wow, it feels like flying!" The films themselves are generally quite banal and ordinary. <br /> <br /> The exception was a powerful "Everest", exciting «Wild California», and now the Air Force «The Human Body», super-sized look at the insides of our bodies. <br /> <br /> Our bodies machine complexity, that is unthinkable. This 50-minute film can be a length of 10 hours and still have not received all the systems working in tandem in the same way as I type this review, and listen to my radio, and most of us take all this for granted . <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of the pumping of the heart (it looks like a spaceship of aliens), the inside of your lungs, the tiny hairs in your eardrum, which process sound development of the child inside the mother's womb, and surprisingly, some of the ... um, the less attractive features that I thought that he would shy away from (acne, churning stomach acids ...) <br /> <br /> This film also has a pretty funky style to it that distinguishes it other IMAX documentaries. For example, we've all seen the sperm find their way to the egg, but have you ever seen how it is set in the amount of Marvin Gaye in "Let's Get It On»? This creative moments like that do «The Human Body» not only health class, but fun as well.
