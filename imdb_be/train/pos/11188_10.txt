I'm a big fan of Stephen King's work, and this film has made me an even bigger supporter of the king. Pet cemetery on the Creed family. They have just moved into a new house, and they seem happy. But there is a pet cemetery for their home. New neighbor Judd Creed (played by Fred Gwynne) explains the cemetery behind the pet cemetery. This tomb is pure evil. Jude says Louis Creed, that if you bury a person (or any kind of pet) in the repository, they will come back to life. The only problem is that when they come back, they're not the same person, they are evil. Shortly after Jude explains all about the Pet Sematary, everything starts to go to hell. I will not explain more because I do not want to give away some of the main roles in the film. Actions that Pet Sematary I did pretty good, but needs a little work. The story was one of the main parts of this film, mainly because it was so original and exciting. This film shows a lot of make-up effects, which makes the film much more horrible and terrible. One of the main reasons why this film is sent shivers down my spine, was actually the makeup effects. There is a character in this film, which is really crazy. This character is «Zelda». This special character emerges in the film is about three times, to be exact. Zelda's sister Rachel Creed, who died years ago, but Rachel still haunts her. First Zelda appears in the film is not scary at all, because she does not speak or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares the life **** with me. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it's almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great horror stories, some pretty good performances, the first section of the speed and stunning makeup. This is truly one of the most popular horror movies of all time. 10 out of 10.
