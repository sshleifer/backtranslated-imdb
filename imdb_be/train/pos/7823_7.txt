Long, but compelling retelling of friendship between the leaders of the civil rights of Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest when we see the bond formed between the two men, and how they help each other, but the second half is not as strong due to the liquidation of character Biko. Nevertheless, his compelling film with large projections Klein and Washington in the film, which is placed last on the map. Washington was also nominated for best supporting actor for the first time. In general, a well-made film, which could be trimmed slightly. 7/10 .____________________________________
