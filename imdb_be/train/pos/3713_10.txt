With this movie, it's all about style, atmosphere and activities. However, I do not think that all of the events of the plot, but it does not matter- a stunning, unexpected plot twists, and great atmosphere sucked me right, and carried me along for the ride, and I was a great time. Kenneth Branagh not only a great actor, but a master of accents, and he proves it once again with an impeccable Georgia accent. He is surrounded by so much talent in a supporting role (Robert Downey Jr., Davidtz of Schindler's List and of the Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall), I was blown away. I recently bought a copy of this film, and I never get tired of watching it. Simply one of the best thrillers of the year. If you ignore this film (and most likely, you have), then I suggest you check it out.
