One of the most nihilistic and violent movies I've ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and touching one. This action melodrama, as the world has never seen it before. Sometimes the story made me cry, and the next moment the delivery of shocking discoveries as bone-crunching blow to the gut. The cooling performance of Edison Chen. History HK-Cop and Cambodian killer hunt each other down, while little by little lose their humanity, it is strong. Due to very little dialogue for the benefit of pursuing rough images and camera-work, "Dog bites dog" purely HK-Bloodshed without heroism.
