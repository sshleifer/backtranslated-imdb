This is undoubtedly the worst game I've ever played. This is not the average shoot all that moves-view frames per second (which I usually do not care much for), but the GFX acceptable, interesting weapons and magic, large rear soundeffects ( «Scryeeee, scryeeee ..») and above all an incredible atmosphere. I love Scrye, which allows you, in certain places in the game to see or hear events that occurred there in the past. The only game that I had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of the game only because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I'm a big fan of horror, escpecially stories and films of Clive Barker, and participation in a horror story, how it makes me sad more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story. 9/10 (-1, because I am not a supporter of frames per second, and perhaps, the game was a little less?)
