Well, I said it all in all, I love movies and simpley actor ... I would give each actor Oscar ... great, great movie ... I'm 25 now and I watched it 4 times and I have different periods I always think that I will not cry, and I have always, about 2 or 3 times ...;) Meryl s. was absolutely brilliant, Jeremy Irons also..just brilliant ... I wish the film has received more awards ... I really anybody who watched that and did not like it I do not know ... and, of Glenn close was fantastic. .. the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I loved the fact that, in spite of all, Clara and Esteban loved each other so much, and how was close Form to their parents ...
