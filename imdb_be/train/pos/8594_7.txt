The sight I was hoping it would be a good movie, and I was a boy right.A great story, first of all, from the novel, and I thought it was an original story, but I believe that it was not and it was a very clever story. Michael Douglas in the film is very good and Keither Sutherland, too, but nevertheless, it is very difficult to dismiss him from his role as Jack Bauer in 24, but in the end you are doing, and it is very different Guard than he 24.also another person She tries to brush off their television roles, but failed.Eva Longeria.She was not so good in the film and had a backseat around thing.After I saw the film I had constant dreams of the Guard could not sleep.Overall worth a good movie, and I I would recommend it.
