This series is made possible in the most favorable time after the events of the Second World War, on the scale of value, which is much higher than the presumption of any person to criticize. <br /> <br /> World War II period in production in 1974 in the amount of about three decades after the events of the war, an exact correlation of events in such a way, the residual colorless propaganda and addiction. Passage of thirty years allows eloquent be backed up by an impressive and fascinating arsenal of most persons involved, ranging from some of the top military and political leaders, down to field soldiers, civilians and victims of the death camps, the remaining evidence of the unimaginable brutality which civilized people are capable . Most well or approaching their senior years, interviewed subjects had enough time to think about their experiences and in most cases there is enough time for any propaganda and zeal might affect them in the past receded, leaving only memories of what they We have seen and what they have done. <br /> <br /> information that these survivors give, reinforced strange poses and expressions they represent, telling her role to give their stories more and more influence. Names such as Il Eaker, Adolf Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Young (Hitler's personal secretary) ... the list is too long to relate. <br /> <br /> Currently, during the life of surviving this hideous huge lesson in the price of political ambition, they are young people, I repeat the same sorts of militaristic and nationalistic promotion of the war as led to WW2. DVD series, we discuss here should include compulsory core subject of history in schools, the lessons bought in such a terrible price at the time is not wasted, but must be taken to the heart of those who have not seen first hand the terrible price . <br /> <br /> I'm almost finished watching a set of 11 CDs, which saw most of the series, when a local TV channel broadcast it over 10 years ago. It has not lost its edge for me, in fact, become even more beautiful chronicle of some of the darkest days of human time. <br /> <br /> the highest possible rating seems unworthy apply to the presentation, I think the value of this series is beyond counting.
