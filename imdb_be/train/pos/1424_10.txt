Most likely annoying that reviewers keep comparing it to planet Earth ... C * of course * Earth works best - it has much more of the same. The Earth as an extended trailer for the series Planet Earth, and as such, inevitably yields and simplified. But it is not comparing like with like. <br /> <br /> As a full-length documentary film (or in fact, as the full-nothing), it surpasses almost anything you will see in your life (if you do not cross the land in the long-range helicopters with cameras for many consecutive years, and wait for a few months in the most extreme conditions in order to catch a glimpse of the most unusual creatures on earth that - lets face it - unlikely) <br /> <br /> on stories:. yes, all in the UK - including the very I - like David Attenborough, and there are few frames Annya for it will not be the story here, but hardly deserves to knock a star or three. He was not leading on the planet Earth, only a storyteller, and I'm sure he's humble and gentle to understand that everything gets more viewers it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees this will be surprised by his reverence, grandeur and glory. All reviewers agree on this point. Those who love it (ie. Each) will / should go to see the buy Planet Earth. So three cheers for its cinematic release, and a large Boooo for those who are cheap enough to buy it on DVD, instead of a box set Earth. But as works of art are not in competition here people. <br /> <br /> The land is large enough for both of them.
