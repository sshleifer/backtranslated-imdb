Watching it again after a break of many years and remember it was a flop on its initial release, I'm amazed at how well it is kept. One reason for his refusal was that one generation just thought that it was more than condescending crap and the younger was disappointed that he did not show the full glory of the hippies. Now I saw clearly that Antonioni was already known, and fascinated by the intoxicating combination of fiery enthusiasm for change and the lack of any clear vision of the future. The lead pair of excellent, and it's a shame that they took so much anti-aircraft for the perceived failure of the film. They are perfect and give very different contradictions and demonstrate the pure pleasure in lovemaking. I blame others for more emphasis on the student revolt at the beginning of the sequence, but I must say that there is in one of the directors of the most beautiful pictures look, and he certainly got the best out of human and natural landscapes. Oh, and I did not even mention the explosive ending.
