This film is an hour or so of good fun and has some really funny moments. I loved the character of Matt and tiny. They seemed to be the most attractive and interesting characters, and of course, the most interesting. Matt is very good (as it is no good cousin), and the police woman and a blonde woman biker give some welcome eye candy. I must say that I found striking similarities between Matt and another Australian actor, Eric Bana. My favorite part was the brothel scene, I liked. Overall, I liked the movie, and it will get about 8 rankings. The penalty, however, I was disappointed. It was on the side of the foot lock, and not in accordance with laces explosion. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm kidding. :)
