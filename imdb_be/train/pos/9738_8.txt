Oh dear, we do not like our super-hero's love interest develops brain with us? <br /> <br /> What's wrong with people, they lost the ability to enjoy a good health, love story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - a funny, sexy and real. I laughed out loud OOH at least five times, and I'm not ashamed to say that there were tears in his eyes a couple of times too. Throw acting and a good script, I watch a lot of movies right across the board, and I have not seen one in this genre, which was successful. Those who do not agree, please tell me where I can find some! I am sure that this book is also good, but I think you have to judge it on merit.
