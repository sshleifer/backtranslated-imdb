I could not agree more with the Nomad 7 and I commentary A HVR in. Excellent laid back Sunday morning movie. Humor thin (the exact opposite of a "farce", as one commentator noted erroneous). <br /> <br /> But what always amazes me how often I find that I want to go back to this film again and again. Initially I copied this film on VHS about 12 years ago when it was the first time one of these Pay Cable Free Preview Weekend (HBO maybe?). I never heard of it before. I do not know why it was not sold that well. ?? If the DVD were released en masse, it was one of the first films, which I replaced. Excellent combination of cast and writing. In addition, the back drop of Montana wilderness not hurt things either (beautiful). <br /> <br /> This is probably not the type of comedy for everyone, but what is it? When Adam Sandler-type material on your line, it probably will not be your cup of tea. This movie requires your full attention. Humor mostly in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> I believe that my next viewing will probably be my 12th. But I still know that when he gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of police cars start blowing, I'm going to lose it (Ed O'Neill's face is priceless!). Recommended 110%.
