I've always been a big fan of this movie, the first thing you see actors acting and a great help to make this film moving along very well. Cybill Shepherd has received good reviews for her role, and they are well deserved. At the beginning of this movie starts in the past, when Corinne Jeffries (Sybil), whose picture perfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband dies unexpectedly Louis. Fortunately, the louse gets a second shot at life when he agrees to "redistribute" back to earth as the newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues to live his new life to forget his past life, and Corino tries to get along with her. But fate crosses AlexS way through '23, when he meets the daughter of Carine Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and suddenly flooded the wealth of unwanted memories (this is where the fun begins, and annoying situations occur.) Music scene is large and heart felt and very cute. You will not be disappointed if you give it a chance, most likely, you will enjoy. Very funny and cute!
