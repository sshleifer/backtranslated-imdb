I liked "Dan in Real Life." The strange story of the journey of love, you received a letter or while you were sleeping, but not full of gags and funny rude jokes, and not so romantic, it makes you want to quit. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steve Carell) is a popular advice columnist who can not seem to get things straightened out in your life. Until one day, gathering family / trip, he meets and connects instantly with Marie ( always beautiful Juliette Binoche), a reflective model of a woman who seems to be framed in a foggy filters uhayuchy back to the classic movie starlet. Chemistry happens for a cup of tea and biscuits, but Marie must be disabled prior to the fight, and they should go away. <br /> <br /> In the future, we were treated to friendly, cheerful relative Dey, who not only They have a big breakfast together, but also enjoy the use of intelligent and sweet stupid Dan, as an example of many bachelor jokes. I liked so much that even though the characteristics of the family can be considered as some unpleasant, I thought it was a great large family picture, which NOT Venture into a parody or a crude exaggeration. Burns family just close, loving group of people who are really interested in the best for Dan. There are surprisingly awkward family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is curious, but never mean-spirited or gossip; brisk, but never kinky. <br /> <br /> And then Dan falls in love with the girlfriend of his brother, he is led to the family collection. And thus begins a roller coaster ride restrained melancholy and fun loving excommunication. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I just thought that this movie was simply astounding. It's not particularly "hip" or "smart", never too verbose and get a dry sense of humor or biting wit, as many comedy in modern movies. There is a good balance narrate visual and funny, but in a real dialogue. in fact, at the beginning of the film, the initial spark of love begins with moody discussion in the classical Hollywood style conversation where the characters say what they think out loud. <br /> <br /> So I'm probably randomly and I said, but I strongly recommend "Dan in Real Life." This is a great date movie, trust me, you'll laugh, and only if you're a freak like me, you get a little teary-eyed. Filled with joy and divine love "Dan in Real Life" does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> =================== 3.5 out of 4 stars Grade: A
