What begins as a conflict of generations in this film ends with understanding, solemnity and elegance. The film meanders through Europe with his father and young son cramped in a car more than 3,000 miles. Seizures force lifestyle, beliefs and life skills to face. There really is no clear winner. All this creates in the end, as an experience, the experience of several layers of life. For those who are interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a generous and gentle look, without being pushy about the agenda. This coming of age story of a young son, his contemptuous and rebellious nature of turning to open for more a way of life.
