"The pool of defense" a good film with excellent performances by the central, but too much of the novel, and director lacks craft shines through. He felt throughout most of the film, the characters just helped push the narrative forward. Marleen Gorris could possibly have considered the psyche puddle rather than reflecting it as an innocent victim who was tortured, torn by violent motives of others. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of literature for the screen is obviously a difficult task, especially a novel written in the early 20th century. This film does not go deep enough in the relationship between the puddle and Natalia. Rift Natasha with her mother come across refractory mother disagreed, but not a dramatic flash movie. I felt like I went through a puddle flour and ultimately tragic end, without giving a kick out of his unusual and complex personality solved. Nevertheless, it was a moving and enjoyable film, but certainly not great.
