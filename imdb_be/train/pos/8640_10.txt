This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to act in the performance he gave in this movie. Spirit was at the highest level, as it was Forbes and Lewis. 4 main characters embark on a scenic road tour of the historical sites of the murder, in one of the coolest cars ever made, 1960 model Lincoln Continental. Sooner Grace simpleton tasteful dry toothbrush and a slaughterhouse. He likes his women not to curse or smoke and wear dresses PWT. Spiritual and Forbes is a pair of artists from the city, while the early and Parker Lewis is a trailer from the rural suburbs. Despite the fact that most of the dark tones in the film, there are a lot of funny scenes to be had. Drawing up, directing and acting genius. If you love road movies, murder, humor and story, watch this movie. Each supplies, and you want more when the credits. One of my most favorite. "Hey ... to shave the dog n teach it to hunt!"
