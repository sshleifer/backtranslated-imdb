This film was quite unexpected. I was not expecting much, to be honest. the first film Greta Garbo in Hollywood? So what? Perhaps something coarse and exaggerated conventional arms waving and facial spasms that low-grade silent movie so often shows. <br /> <br /> Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo, to be simply shocked studio people as much as it did me, because this film made her a star, and deservedly so. She instinctively understands the power of just standing still, or just keeping an eloquent expression of long, lingering moment, so its effect can be felt and not just seen. I kept thinking about yourself, how did it get into the modern actress creaking silent movie? She was just a lot of years ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> The story is not all that interesting, it's the usual story of love found and lost. It only Garbo performance as Leonora, a poor country girl who does well in a big city, and then returned to get the person who is gone, that gives it life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is serviceable, but his character never really developed, and he belittled the script throughout. At some point, he did wear clothes Garbo leave in frustration, and then ignominiously back and bring them back. And let's not even talk about his terrible final scenes with Garbo, and then his wife. Too normal, he did not have a lot of pits after that, and I can understand why. But it is quite like a mystifying object of obsession Leonora. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely fantastic line in this film that just says it all. "Leonora, you become visible.". Yes, really catches the eye <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what it's all about, not seeing the whole movie, just watch the 30 seconds or so - look Garbo, as she sits all alone in her luxury car says it all. "It must be so happy, she has everything she wants" - yes, Garbo's face says it all about this. I have to see this time, Garbo is amazing.
