Ruth Gordon is one of the most nice murderers who Columbo ever had to deal with. And the plot is brilliant all the way around. This is one of the best episodes ever Colombo. Mariette Hartley and GD Spradlin great in their supporting roles. And Peter Falk delivers a little something extra in his scenes with Gordon.
