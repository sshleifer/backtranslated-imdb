Four prisoners share a single cell: dominant transvestite, Markus (Clovis Cornillac); idiot scientist friend Marcus, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will eat anything in sight, including a pocket watch, a cockroach, and his little sister; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), intelligent librarian, who killed his wife; and Carrera (Gerald Laroche), a new guy, who was caught in the corporate fraud and is currently focused on the escape. After the brick falls from the cell wall, people discover a hidden magazine written "Fountain Youth'-obsessed serial killer who took the cage in the 1920s. Is this the secret of their escape magazine? There is something far more sinister behind it? <br /> <br /> I was a little weary about getting into the film, because the only other experience I had with Eric Valette terrible One Missed Call (2008), which I think is the worst film released theatrically, which I have ever seen. However, much of what happened to one missed call, probably can be attributed to a horrible scenario Klavan, because (as I recall) the direction of Valletta was not worse than the movie (if it is decided not to include the child). Anyway, Maléfique was a good way to get my respect back. ,, This is a French film (obviously, something I like), and it's happening in the prison (which is my second favorite option after horror shelters). So that's two points for it before the movie even starts. Fortunately, Valletta I was once the film ended as well. Maléfique quite deep, quite complicated, quite a fascinating story of obsession and despair. ,, The desire and the need to bring the fantasy into reality. Despite the fact that it is not scary movie in the traditional sense of the strangeness of his power it makes it pretty damn scary. Between the climax and the conclusion was somewhat better film I've seen in a while, and I heartily recommend it to anyone looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool blood. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: 8.5 / 10 Just a little respect earned ago Valletta <br /> <br /> Note :. Paramount bought the rights to make an American remake (surprise surprise). It will be released in 2009, I do not know why, to be honest, because it does not seem to be something that would be a big profit here in the states. But, I was surprised before. <br /> <br /> Vive La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
