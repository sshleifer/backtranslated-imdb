This is probably one of the worst movies ever. That's ... awful. But it's so good! It's probably best if you do not watch it awaits a fascinating story and something fantastically clever and interesting, because you will be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it, so you can see the 50 million vases and fantastic hair Goro / bad English, thank you for a real treat. The more you think about the film, the worse it gets, if you're not having a competition to determine the most plot holes / window screw, in which case you've got hours of fun ahead. I just highly recommend this film for bored or die-hard fans of SMAP. And even then, it must be a little careful, because the Japanese fans Goro was a bit upset about it, they thought that he sold himself out. (It was not really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who served as executive producer) can do it for him).
