In our house, we are huge fans of A Christmas Carol and watch almost every version of every Christmas, including the old Reginald Owen in 1938 and a modern 1999 by Patrick Stewart. Our overall favorite one thousand nine hundred fifty-one black and white classic, because Alastair Sim Scrooge and his transformation of the surest ring. However, it is one thousand nine hundred eighty-four color has its own unique advantages and makes a wonderful and exciting story, completely honest all the novel Dickens. (See my comments on other adaptations, if you're interested) <br /> <br /> First of all, George C. Scott, of course, may seem a little cranky and does not make poor Scrooge. I love his sideburns, his long coat & hat. He cuts off the best fashion party figure, and rather handsome gentleman. However, sometimes it seems, Scott enjoys his role as Scrooge just a little bit too much, and do not take it as seriously as it should! <br /> <br /> This version has a better overall atmosphere of Christmas, hope and optimism. Once you know this story will have a happy ending. The film is based in Shrewsbury, England, it just seems like a very British. The film has an excellent musical score, with beautiful, lively caroling music during all relevant parts of the story. Sometimes I could almost smell of chestnuts roasting and pudding singing in the copper! <br /> <br /> painful ghost Marley (with its great jaw sbrosivoy scene) and three Spirits are all very convincing. Last Christmas Fair Lady ethereal, strange giant Christmas gift and cheerful, Christmas is still ahead is shrouded and anticipation, as always. However, I found a nephew of Scrooge, Fred, a little bit quiet and dark, not as fun and satisfying as it should be. I love my wife's nephew, whom they named Janet, with her wonderful, cheerful period hairdo. Instead of bluffing blind, they invented a game called Comparisons for the Christmas dinner party nephew that cute little touch, Scrooge get right into the spirit of things. <br /> <br /> Cratchits and several poor (although highly prized) Christmas dinner is well drawn, with Bob (David Warner), respectively, and the long-suffering pretty miles in his scarf. Mrs. Cratchit magically drawn Susannah York, who also starred with George C. Scott in a wonderful 1970 adaptation of Jane Eyre. First of all, this version has a distinct and best Tiny Tim, not only charming and wins a little waif, but painful. With those dark circles under the eyes, fragile tiny thing looks unlikely to survive in an hour! <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful and touching version of the holiday classic. With its festive atmosphere, it is sure to put you in the spirit of the season.
