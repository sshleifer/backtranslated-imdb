I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs have been changed. <br /> <br /> It is true that Frank Sinatra did not get a chance to sing as much in this movie, but it's also nice that it is not just another film Frank Sinatra where he basically he is doing the singing. <br /> <br /> I actually thought it was better to use your own voice of Marlon Brando as he has a voice that's right and I could not see someone with that loud voice to pull gangster feel his voice. <br /> <br /> Stubby Kaye in "Sit down, you Rockin 'Boat' is a knee Tappin ', sing-a-long that I just love. He is out of reach with his version and I still love him best. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine just fine in this part and the "Crying Adelaide" is my favorite of her songs. <br /> <br /> I really thought that Gene Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I would not consider it the first, but after seeing her in the part, it made sense. <br /> <br /> choreography of Michael Kidd eternal. If it were to be raised again in 2008, I would not change anything. <br /> <br /> I think that many times something is lost from the stage version to the version of the film, but it retained a sense of the scene, even if it was on film. <br /> <br /> I thought that the film was well matched. I played in the regional versions of this, and this is one of my favorites in this period.
