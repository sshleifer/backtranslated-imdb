and it is a very disturbing film. Maybe I'm wrong, but this is the last film where I saw Burt Reynolds actual actor, who turned the role, and delivered a message. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight and Ned Beatty, also excellent. They are unpretentious and does not know; businessmen want to enjoy the country. Little do they know what will happen next. <br /> <br /> photographs and sets are realistic and natural. This was before the days of Wes Craven. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing in this film is that places like this still exist. In America, the People still do not like the city people; it is almost a half century since the Civil War. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this film. It was filmed in rural areas of South Georgia, are still there. Not only passed by, that in Mobile, Alabama; This area is still not repaired after Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
