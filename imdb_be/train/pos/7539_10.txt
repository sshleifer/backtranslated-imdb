I really enjoyed watching this movie. like most people who watched it. I was not sure what I'm getting. Whoopi Goldberg very funny comedian, and she did a lot of funny movies; that is, a sister act. <br /> <br /> However, it was not really a comedy. a drama with comedic moments. so if you are looking for a laugh riot, then keep looking. <br /> <br /> This film about a black family moves up to the glorious city in the upper to middle class neighborhoods. I would like to say more, but it thinks that it can spoil the film. this film does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks, but also about the relationship with the black community. I think it's worth the chance. if you are not really interested in seeing another movie about race relations, this movie is not for you
