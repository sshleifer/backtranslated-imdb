Outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s, is a spin on the classic series climber, as well as "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark", only made on a low budget and much campier director Michael Anderson. Opening scene laces liberal amounts of Gothic Art Nouveau, is preceded by Batman two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a fully cast and a great hero, Pamela Hensley, a local Latino Mona marked on our hero on the goldhunt in a non-existent country in Latin America Hidalgo. The best line, our mono hero, holding his fist to his chin in the same way as you would expect him to be gentle with her and give her a hug, "Mona, you're a brickÂ» <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler ham and raw BlackHat, sea captain They are an absolute delight. Wait a bit, "Raiders .." dash "Batman", a little "Lost World", a little bit "of Lost Horizons" and a whole bunch of campiness, and you get it just right. Watch out for the cult favorite Berryman in a small part as an undertaker and enjoy using cutesy patriotic music of John Philip Sousa in. A good candidate for a DVD release, it is certainly overdue. Unmissable fun for the whole family. 9/10
