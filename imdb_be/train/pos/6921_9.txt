Keep in mind that I'm a fan of this genre, but only recently saw this film for the first time. How do I ignore it all this time, it's weird for me. For me this is the best film, the highly praised «High Noon». This is a great western with excellent action and a great story. DVD is in excellent black and white with outstanding cinematography. If you like westerns, or James Stewart, this film not to be missed.
