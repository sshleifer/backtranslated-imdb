For example, some sites a little hard to follow, and Bill has a tendency to get stronger, but it is actually a fascinating show, I try not to miss. The vast majority of episodes are very interesting and very tense, and the effect is pretty good, although I miss Robert Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I admit I prefer the old episodes of new episodes, and it's a little sad that now the program after the watershed, as I found it easier to watch when he was at 8:00. However, why I love Bill, because not only is it exciting, but cliffhangers at the end to do the next episode to be missed. It is true, however, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this program as a program that does not try to take ourselves too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
