It's good to see that the Vintage Film Buff correctly classify their excellent DVD release as "music", so that's what this film is, pure and simple. As well as its unofficial remake, Murder in the Wind (1949), the assassination plot is just an excuse for a complex girl show with Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael leading a cast of super-decorative girls including Ann Sheridan, Lucille Ball, the Beryl Wallace, Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young Barbara Fritsch, Wanda Perry White and Dorothy. Carl Brisson also on hand to give him a strong voice "Cocktails for Two". Sure, not the most popular song of the film, he had heard no less than four times. However, it is Gertrude Michael, who steals the show, not only with her performance «Sweet Marijauna», but its high performance as a spurned girlfriend hero. As for the rest of the cast, we could do without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen as a whole. The only good thing about the roles Oakie is a weak running gag of a cult icon, Toby Wing. In fact, to give you an idea of ​​how far the rest of the comedy too indulged and over-stretched, super-silent inspector McLaglen simply can not put their hands on the killer, though, you will not believe in this case it happens to be a man, do you suspect. Director Mitch Leisen actually goes to great pains to show the killer, even to dumb cinema audience member, giving the player concerned closeup after closeup.
