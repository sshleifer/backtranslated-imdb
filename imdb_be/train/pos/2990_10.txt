I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four out of four stars, but other than him, I've never read a positive review of this, unfortunately, misunderstood drama about class divisions, love and sacrifice (three themes of the great romantic stories or films have in common). <br /> <br /> Here, the main theme of class division. Stella story of Depression-era America. Nevertheless, he was transferred to the screen in such a memorable way, which is a remake (if you ask Stanwyck fan or two) is not correctly appreciated. Supporters of the original did not give him a chance. In addition, this version of Stella was made in the 1990s, it is not a time of great financial problems in the United States (like depression). <br /> <br /> Now is the time to remove the iridescent color of the glass, in the middle of a new era of decline and poverty in America, and sees that this powerful story still rings true, is timely and relevant, as always, in its new format. <br /> <br /> So, divide the class is the main theme here. Stella among the working poor, single, with big dreams but little hope to realize those dreams. She works in a bar, not a lot of money, he lives in a crummy apartment. You get the drift. In the morning, she does not really want to get out of bed. On her wall, photographs of movie stars she idolizes. <br /> <br /> A person sees that her dance in the bar. It is rich, educated, with one of these top-class families who do not have anything to do with Stella. His main concern is that the Ivy League college to attend, it is how to pay the rent, how to be "happy". They deal. They love each other. Stella terminates pregnancy. Stella tells news guy. His response? "What about abortion," she replies, "I just wanted a room full of balls." He delivers balloons, and the proposal, but she could see that his heart was not in it, and has too much honor to accept it. She sends him packing <br /> <br /> Her daughter eventually torn between two ways of life -. The love she has for her mother, as well as the benefits and happiness and love held out to her by her wealthy father. Stella, and one hated, and did not want her daughter to be as miserable as she ever makes the ultimate sacrifice. It gives only love and happiness she had ever known, to ensure the happiness of his daughter, and perhaps to live vicariously, and with hope, knowing that at least her daughter found something to live. <br /> <br /> At the present time for the film. That's right about that. Beautiful score, artful cinematography, great set design (the contrast between the two lifestyles, dirty and prone decorated mansions.) Excellent and heartfelt performances of the entire cast, with Bette Midler, in particular, Oscar worthy <br />. <br /> This is a film that is much larger and well-made than you were led to believe.
