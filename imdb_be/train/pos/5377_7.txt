"The murder of college girl" is my first introduction to writing works of Edgar Wallace ?? and generally my first real acquaintance with «Krimi» movies at all ?? and I can say that I'm moderately impressed. This stuff is really interesting, but I would have never expected it so ?? stupid! The film is an exciting and beautifully intricate plot, with a healthy dose of humor, bright and turns a very ingenious murders. There's some type of James Bond evil mastermind ?? which is always in the shade, and in front of a large monitor - recruiting prisoners to kill some girl in a particular college with a new type of poison. There's also a criminal monk with a whip, dressed as a member of the Communist KKK, getting rid of the remaining characters as overly curious teachers and such, as well as kooky police commissioner, which is stored on the business solution with a psychological approach. Seriously, if I had known before that these films Krimi were so colorful and crazy, I'd buy the whole collection of them already. Pretzels story actually raises more questions than answers in the end, and an overload of comic tricks at the expense of Scotland Yard Inspector Higgins sometimes swallow a little more, but I do not care because it was sublime entertainment. Even the funky 60's soundtrack was stuck in my head for a long time. This is a variant on the Italian Giallo, but with elements of farce.
