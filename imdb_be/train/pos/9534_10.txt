Acting in this film is very well acted film. I'll talk about that speech a little weak at times; Acting is very good but for the most part. The only actor who blew me away with his performance was Jude Law as Harley Maguire. It was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed assured Alittle at several points throughout the film, but he was also incredible. Paul Newman, well, as always. Cinematography This is what made the film a masterpiece (and I rarely use that word). Conrad Hall, a true genius. If at some point in the film you had to take a break, you will see a thin person is going to work this. He adjusts each frame so that nothing is left out. If the camera still has the card, as the quality of the screen. If the camera is moving, every shot planned understated perfection. But it does not stop there. Conrads choice of colors and the contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art. The way she lights a set of some of the most amazing works of lighting I've seen. His work on this film made it what it is. The film is at the top of the list for best cinematography with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge, and dizziness. History will say this film is a 1930s gangster flick, but I think they missed the point of the film. This is a story about the hit-man of love, which is not in an attempt to protect his son from the life he chose. This brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful relationship between two people, who have nothing but each other. Screen Recording worthy of an Oscar. Music by Thomas Newman is sad, but encouraging to activation of this sad, but hopeful story. Music are some of the most beautiful and touching, I count the herd. The direction of Sam Mendes is the new director with a sense of an experienced director. Characters that he uses and the performances he gets from his actors shooting a rarity in today's world. I'll be looking for the next Sam Mendes movie. 10/10 One of the most touching and beautiful films I've ever seen.
