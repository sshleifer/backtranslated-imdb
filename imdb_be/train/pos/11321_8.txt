When I started watching the show, I said, "Oh, no! It is as banal Elfen Lied and not even what a bloody! ". Indeed, the installation is almost identical, with only a young boy living in a big house all by himself, and then suddenly included in fantasy adventure while sexy young girls come to live with him. <br /> <br /> But this is where the similarity stops. The love story is almost as thin and intense, as one in Inuiyasha, while the children's statements and behavior are very few. Magical setting a bit trite, because it's about seven, seven employees, the fight for the holy grail of all servants be someone famous, half of all the artists who are in the same school, the rules of participation, etc. However, it quickly fades and fades from the beauty of the drawing and the script. <br /> <br /> I actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and, without comparing it with the anime that I liked more, but were from other genres, I must say that I was very pleased.
