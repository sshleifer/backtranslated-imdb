For all the haters out there: condemns the series with one episode, how to judge a book after reading the first few pages. That being said, I was a huge fan of the BSG, thought it was some of the best TV drama (not just sci-fi) in the air. But it was time to finish the story and to move on. I liked BSG epilogue "Plan", but he raised as many new questions as it answered, so I was looking forward to "Caprica," and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that it will not attempt another the BSG, and I was glad that «Caprica» something else, and I personally found the story fascinating, in a different way than the fierce space battles, explosions and scientific -fantastychnyh special effects (do not get me wrong, I like that stuff too). Stoltz and Esai Morales give solid performances, and Alessandro was just excellent. I can not wait until next week.
