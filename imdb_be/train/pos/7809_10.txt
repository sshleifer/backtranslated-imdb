This film touched me beyond comprehension, is and will remain my favorite movie of all time, mainly because it has almost all the emotions all rolled into its 157 minutes. What is the hardest thing for me to accept it, that every time I want to hear wonderful music and songs from the movie, I have to put it in my a DVD-player, so I was wondering if someone somewhere knows who sings a song in the movie and where to find them, as I looked everywhere I can think sporadically over the past 5 years. My favorite quote from the movie, when in court lawyer says: "But your own words ask for a direct confrontation, not that there is a direct call to violence" Biko responds "Well, you and I are in a state of confrontation, but I do not see any violence! !
