Tarzan of the Apes Man (1932), only more so. There's more likely, more animals, more diverse African tribes, and the scenes in which thought should be if it was okay with three or four lions, forty have been better. Tarzan fights crocodile ?? Crocodile machine back in the water, like a rocking chair, around and around, jaws oscillating. Tarzan could kill with his omnipresent knife if blown saurian hold still. Tarzan kills the lion and rhino and constantly growing number of animals. His friends are real chimps, people who wear large monkey suits, and elephants. In fact, they use Indian elephant ?? much more friendly and students than African ?? costume ears attached to their heads. Human history: another white man, worse than the others, it shows to join with Holt to go after the ivory elephant graveyard. Tarzan will not show them the way, so that the bad guy shoots the elephant, so they can follow his deathbed. Tarzan intercedes, and the bad guy shoots him ??, but of course, he survives and returns to save Jane. All other die, Holt and a bad guy, and every one of them "boys". People are expendable, particularly in Africa, and does not seem to be much difference between the black brothers who are dying because they are working on white people traveling through the forbidden country, and those black guy, killing them. This should be the last film Tarzan to Jane Hays Code did wear more clothes. There are a variety of underwater scenes in which Jane bathed naked, and although the light shimmers and glimmers of movement are very attractive. Perhaps one of Weismuller friends from the Olympic swim team doing nude scenes, not Maureen O'Sullivan. She, however, passes through the film wearing the same loincloth worn Weismuller (plus bikini top), showing a glimpse of the beautiful hips and thighs. They still do not need to say much. They sleep together, and hang out with the cool animals and stay away from the cities. Not surprisingly, they are happy.
