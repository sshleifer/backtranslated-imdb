The Finnish version of «Short Cuts» Robert Altman, in the small rural town of Äänekoski. Episodes are eternal kaleidoscope of events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and frustration, hopelessness and death. I was particularly impressed with two episodes. The first story is about a young waitress who tries to stir up a novel for his colleagues: it radiates the irresistible joy of love and life. Another episode is the old man dies in the hospital, and his wife is trying to help him die with dignity. Especially striking is the way the old must make its way against the demeaning practice of hospitals and their loneliness are contrasted with "routine" hospital crew (despite signs of accidental empathy). Compared to the classical Altman, this film is perhaps less professional, but this is definitely a big part of the art.
