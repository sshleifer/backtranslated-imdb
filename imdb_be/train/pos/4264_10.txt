I happened to see this film twice or more, and found it to be well done! The Second World War had recently ended, and the so-called "cold war" was supposed to start. This film, therefore, can be defined as one of the best "propaganda" patriotic films prepared American and secondly, people are still to be formed "Western bloc NATO" countries to face the threat of growing up next. The film celebrates the power of the United States, over the centuries, while projecting itself, starting with the then current war that had just ended. Nice and funny way to describe it is the Finding of the Americas, Columbus and rather in «espisode» New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan from a drunk local Indian .. have to see it (at least, once propagation through time for the fashion curious)! :)
