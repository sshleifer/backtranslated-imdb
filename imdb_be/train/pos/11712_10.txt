This is such a great film Â«Call Me Anna", because it shows how people suffered for so long, not knowing what was wrong with her. For Patty Duke to come out in the public eye and tell her story is an inspiration for those who suffer from this disease. I have a lot of respect for her as a person. The only thing I do not like it, I can not get it on tape, I tried to look for him, but to no avail. Anyone know how to get it?
