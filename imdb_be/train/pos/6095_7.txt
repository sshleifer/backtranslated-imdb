I'm a little conflicted about this. Show on the one hand, horrible acting is terrible (even when we get the real name of the actor like Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley in one episode), the dialogue moronic and premise / moral of each episode feels like something lifted from the 50-ies of Education short. There's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes, and cameo Englund is a short, pointless and banal-a-kind Bob Saget at the American Funniest Home Videos sort of way. <br /> <br /> on the other hand, is one of the most fun things to ever be on television. In the '80s fashion, soft focus makes the actors look like them on the set of The View at all times, the room gives the material a self-parody than deterred, so we stayed with the episode, where the average school child is afraid that if he does not his SAT his girlfriend reset he and his parents disown him, the other fears it will be locked up in prison because she substandard mother (her husband is played by Brad Pitt), the other is afraid that all parents in the world in union with him when he runs away from home, the other is afraid it will be confused with its social and deflected twin, another is afraid that if he did not break is his mother and step-dad, he'll get killed for that party at his house. The list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Given that these dreams, I suppose you could look past the absurd plot points and devices, but they left the field, there are no opportunities for writers actually scare the audience. You have characters dressed like something from the '80s-themed nightmare traveling delivering bad dialogue in a very exaggerated fashions and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose than to move the story to the next amazing point area (usually looks as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristically reasonable person, while our protagonist looks dazed and too shocked to do anything about it). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something that will scare you to stay away. If you are looking for, on the other hand, one of the funniest things to come out of the '80s ever. Careful. <br /> <br /> It was on television recently Chiller (almost every day), and I watched earlier of morbid curiosity, and now the only way I can get a good laugh every day, from Arrested Development and Extras from the air it is officially the funniest thing on TV right now.
