If redundancy landing boats, boat, by bus, bus .. it is a way to spend time, then you should go back to Hollywood films that wrap the piece in one installation, in order to get to the money shots. and at the same time leave you tied up and suspended in a film that results do not show the reality of life. Long extended trip sequence actually allows the viewer is frustrated and "wait in line" sense of characters must endure. Disappointment? Yes. Vital? Indeed. Limbo of this trip is the key to the "lost souls" of the Turkish family. Beautiful film with great acting. It is sad, but it's worth.
