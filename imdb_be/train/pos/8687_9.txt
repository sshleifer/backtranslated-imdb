It was the second entry in a regular series Columbo, and it holds up well today. How can I look at it closely is now DVD and see how it is built, I am very impressed with the leadership of Bernard L. Kowalski (who led the fine Macho Callahan, as well as countless TV episodes) - look like after the murder of murderers action shown in effect split screen on it two glasses, watch as the murder itself indicated in the mounting fashion, watches shot-point review from the point of view of the corpse. In addition, the wild, but impressive avant-garde music of the said jazz musician Gil Melle was incredible, and so helped to create an atmosphere. And maintaining performance Brett Halsey as the golf pro was excellent - such subtlety and complexity in the roles, nine times out of ten will be a one-dimensional breaker switch. "Formula" has not yet been set, when the episode was filmed, so there is still some surprises in Columbo methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp, Ray Milland and actors are of the highest quality, and it's nice to see their work - all people are familiar from many other roles yet to lose himself in his characters here. In general, this entry in the series Columbo - and many others - such as well-crafted as a very good feature film.
