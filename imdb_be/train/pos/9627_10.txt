This is definitely the funniest short made two comic geniuses. Since then, they go to, by the time Hardy simply falls from the roof, it makes me laugh hysterically. I strongly suggest that every fan of Laurel and Hardy should see this short. I also recommend that all series Ghost. If you are looking for a laugh, watch this movie and you will be happy.
