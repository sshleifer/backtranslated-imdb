The movie, which I'm going to see a little TV movie, filmed in 1996 and starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The protagonist / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical all American teenager who is under pressure with controlling parents (Baldwin). However, when she meets former CON named Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "never been kissed"), they instantly "fall" for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea about where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents to protect their "love", but she just used it to get rid of their parents, so she can be with Brad (David Lasher future "Sabrina" cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with his role of an evil manipulator and she carries the film well with the help of his friends and Nick, so that it can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast works well, and each of them holds its own, if they have time on the screen. I also found it interesting that this film was made and released in the same year, Hart began to draw Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, and it shows that it can act in their own genres of film and television. <br /> <br /> Although the film has dated a few stops it stands out as the best of his work, which includes drama or thriller, and I look forward to «Nine Dead», which comes out in November, because it shows that she can see how other people that do not are called "Clarissa Darling" or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who is a supporter of Melissa Joan Hart and Sabrina. you can see it in Internet, so I suggest checking it.
