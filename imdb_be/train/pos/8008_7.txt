As far as I know, this show is never repeated on British television after its initial launch in the late 60s / early 70s, and most of the episodes now, unfortunately, the "missing presumed wiped out." <br /> <br /> 6 Series since 1971, but still exists in its entirety, and recently I had the opportunity to watch it all, the best part of four decades. <br /> <br /> After rushing home from school, it was a significant Freewheelers review for me and many people present in those halcyon days of flared trousers, Slade and chicory Council. And watch it again brought nostalgic lump in my throat. <br /> <br /> Nothing wrong / Hammy actions unintentionally funny fight scenes, plot holes wide enough to fly a big ocean and a boat through. "fear, fright" RADA accents leading players <br /> <br /> not -.. forget everything because Freewheelers returns to the departed (dare I say "gold") the age of the children's TV drama, when the show was just about the frenetic fun and do not take yourself so seriously before they become obsessed with the whole nostalgia laden Â«ishoos "that today's writers have their young protagonists agonize over, such as the relationship , Pregnancy, drugs, sexually transmitted infections, etc. <br /> <br /> No doubt, if it had been "reworked for a modern audience" these days all-out political correctness, the boss figure is a black woman, one of the young male heroes is a Muslim, the other would be a white guy is confused about his sexuality and the girl will be all the actions businessman with an IQ of scale, which would forever to get the guy out of trouble and making them look silly - in other words a million miles removed from the respectful, ankle dislocated washer-upper Wendy Padberi in. <br /> <br /> This shows that a lot of "time." But is it bad? For example, I do not think.
