Riding Giants is an incredible documentary detailing the history and the stories of three influential big wave surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta did an amazing job, taking on the role of director and should be congratulated doing such a brilliant job. The structure of the film is edited brilliant and works perfectly with the story, interviews, animation and surfing scene. Soundtrack only adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this film, Riding Giants making a brilliant view. Personal highlights include any comments from Greg Knoll, that its direct-to-point sincerity, Laird Hamilton frames in Teahupoo, and because at the end of the film will take part. But in fact this whole movie is one big, it is recommended to emphasize that it is highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see. It's a shame it is not more well known, but it is a gem worthy of attention. 10/10
