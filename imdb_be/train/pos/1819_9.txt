When I first saw it, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about 3 times. We just watched it again and I liked it more than I did the last time I watched it !! :) :() <br /> <br /> The film is basically about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (voiced by Dom DeLuise and I like Dom DeLuise!). Charlie half and half gangster, goodie, which I like. Itching is his sidekick. Charlie was killed by his friend (NOT), and goes to heaven. When Charlie comes back to life, it is the beginning of an amazing adventure <br /> <br /> the top five reasons why I absolutely CRAZY about this film :. A: I love the characters (except Carface). My favorite three Charlie, itching and a little girl named Anne-Marie, that comes later. Two: I love the history of the period in which the film is set. This occurs during prohibition in the United States. Three Animation Don Blatt (as usual) is excellent. Backgrounds are also good. Four: There is a strange excitement in this film, which keeps me on the edge of my seat. Five: Songs in this excellent. My favorite song starts with "I need Brazil, throb, thrillÂ» ... <br /> <br /> So, watch this wonderful movie, if you can, you will not be disappointed! :);) :()
