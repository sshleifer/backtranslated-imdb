This film is interesting look at the killer stuffed genre - strange as it manages to rise to become greater than the sum of its parts. Average installation stage, 30-Somethings play a teenager, and some fine facial expressions combined to become one of the "new wave" of modern classics. As a spectator, I walked away from the movie with the same sense of "shock and awe," as when I first saw The Godfather in a strange figure, 1969. Tiffany Gardner morally bankrupt Judy deserved her the Grammy nomination, which was well documentedly stolen Ricky Martin and caring hips. Unfortunately, none of the sequels can not live up to the expectations of the original (unlike the Godfather series, gets better with each batch, and should be completed in 2012 with the Godfather 4: Eat My Fury.
