First of all, I think it unworthy of comment below for a site like this. Obviously, you do not have a flavor and taste you do not respect others. Not to give you a history lesson, but I think it should be done. Black actors from the only, if not more, successful as others. If you are not part of the race, "Black", you can not understand, quality, creativity, and bright old movies, such as "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and «Cooley High». Because, unfortunately, you are not black, you do not have the pleasure of feeling that we feel when we see these classics, so therefore you need to keep the castle fucking mouth and just follow your non-dancing race. Thanks.
