A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy works Rivers & Tides allows fans to see their work in motion. Goldsworthy looking to build their figures, one develops appreciation for each stone, leaf and spines that it uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, rivers and tides inspire and influence on his work. Although, I was happy that the film is gripped most parts in Goldsworthy (without snowballs), I feel that it was a bit long. The filmmakers have done an excellent job of providing Goldsworthy works to life, and created a beautiful film that has been a joy to watch.
