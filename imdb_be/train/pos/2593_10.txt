She comes out of left field and really not what you expected. But I love it. The most unforgettable movies come to wonder if you ask me. If you have not been tipped off about the mysterious "thing" that makes this brother so strange ... thank you for the treatment. <br /> <br /> The roles are fantastic, but not stretching so that it is sensitive. Special effects come from nowhere (seriously, it's oddly dark romantic comedy, until they do - then WOW), and they are big. In general cinema easy on the eyes, editing and sound is very good quality, and twisted the story unfolds without clich√©s. Although none of these aspects separately does not make it a blockbuster, "what the hell?" Factor ALONE makes this film treasure. <br /> <br /> People who bash this film does not make sense. This is one of those often overlooked film 90 that you either never heard of, or so like you jump at the mention of his name. <br /> <br /> I'm in the latter group.
