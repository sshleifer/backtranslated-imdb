Most people (36) gave the film 10, and those who are not too critical or perhaps expecting something else. This is one of my favorite movies of the 80's, he grows on you, and have it all. I just got it on DVD and 20 years later it still does not disappoint, with a lot of action, drama, romance, and even comedy. Add to this the large car chases, bullet automatic weapons and a lot of the material is inflated and you have a fun, edge of your seat experience! You can even sing or whistling theme song for days after viewing it. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / gf and you will both enjoy it a lot. The prerequisite is that a paperback book hero, Doc. Savage, real and help people to fight against evil, so that he could write a story about the truth of life here. Actor Jake Speed ​​is also the director, producer and author of many films. In this film, Jake Speed ​​(character) is a type of adventurer Indiana Jones, he usually uses his head to get out of difficult situations, but sometimes it will be drawn to the rough firepower (yay! And sheer luck, too!). Watch out for one hi-tech equipment "James Bond", the ultimate road warrior SUV to fall out of the sky. <br /> <br /> heroine is very beautiful young lovers of early Jim Carrey vampire film "Once Bitten," and here it is a little older and has a knockout even in comparison with her teenage blonde little sister. <br /> <br /> bad guys "really bad" people and the worst criminal scum exist and you love to hate. The ending is just fine and can stand alone or invite a sequel, unfortunately, never did - but you can only imagine what will happen in the next <br /> <br /> You have to see this movie just because it will entertain and please you! and it is worth the ticket price.
