Cute idea ... saleswoman Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits teenager tiny Lampidorra County. This country, which was not even in North America, was made the 49th state ... (of course, there were only 48 states at the time, since it was made in 1952 ...) Linda is going to the country, she has inherited, and we follow it along, as she tries to figure out what to do with this wonderful country and even quirkier people. At some point, she sings a song in which she claims from her Navajo people, and it is becoming more stupid than there .... although heavy lipstick Yolande Donlan and omni present smile never get ruffled or shmeared. There are other songs scattered po- as citizens sing to welcome their new princess. Filmed in glorious technicolor British version, or some such equivalent of only a big name here Bogarde as the Briton Tony Craig, cheese supplier. Bogarde made a big splash in the UK film industry after serving in the war, and was even knighted QE II. Craig and "new princess" keep bumping into each other, and their adventures are becoming more interconnected, as financial problems worsen Lampidorra ... Fun little farce .... through the Marx Brothers film. Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our little project, and remained married for 50 years! Guest was better known for writing and direction of his science fiction clicks, both in the UK and the US.
