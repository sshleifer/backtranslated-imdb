My son was 7 years old when he saw the film, he is currently in the Russian fishing vessel and said the film he was most impressed with and that lingered in his mind all these 39 years is the film The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He asked if it was possible for me to get it for him. I'm sure a lot of things that go through his head, if he has only 3 hours of daylight, and it was on this ship for 3 months and will be more than 3 months before the expiry of his contract. Since we have Indian blood, it is connected to this film. January 27 he will turn 47 years old, and I would like to be able to get this film for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years, and as we all know that this is one of the most dangerous professions. Can you help me get this film? Thank you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, Florida
