The premise of this film was to tickle my imagination for quite a long time. We have all heard or read about it in some scammer text. What would you do if you were alone in the world? What would you do if the world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes? In fact, the last part is actually what happens with Dave and Andrew, two room mates, living in an old house in the center of the highway system. Andrew nervous wreck, to put it mildly, and Dave is considered to be one of the biggest losers of society. This in itself is a major reason why these two guys get along so well, because they are simply only with each other to turn to if needed comforting. Just do not ... <br /> <br /> Right from the beginning of the movie lots and lots of problems happen to them. Both of them get involved with crime, Andrew suffers from paranoia and just do not dare to leave the house. Dave unsuccessful in his work and his colleagues did not treat him very well and respect it deserves. The number of problems that they are faced with constantly increasing up to this one day where they may have to face the inevitable and have to deal with it. It's too much for them, and they want everything to be just go away ... And, of course, is exactly what is happening. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story puts Dave and Andrew in the world of non-existence, first, they are surprised and have trouble understanding and solutions with the features of this crazy environment, but later they learn that they can do almost anything they want to, because it seems as if they are the only ones still remain. <, Br /> <br /> Nothing has incredibly small cast - in fact, except for the first two rounds of the film, we see only Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) in the entire film. It is clear that in order to accomplish this, the cast must be greater than for the task, because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way. Vincenzo decided to use a reasonable amount of close-up shots of her head to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well. Operator, Derek Rogers is also a good way to tease the audience by denying visual information, especially in the moments when the character sees something and react to it, but we do not see it right away. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this can not be the film event, and it is not. Much of the action takes place outside of their home when they move into the void. And that's where some of the most hilarious scenes take place, especially when Andrew finds a candy bar <br /> <br /> Currently, one would think :. "How does anything look like?" Well, it looks like nothing's for sure. The whole world is nothing to white ... white regardless of whether you are looking in what direction. This is the weakness of this film ... After an hour or less, it becomes very boring to watch, and there should be the event to ensure that it is more fun to watch. Thank God, there are some. For example, at a time when two guys due to personal characteristics, ability to jump very high, as if nothing had been done ... from tofu (as claimed by Andrew). It is interesting to see how they are instantly able to not use anything to become gods of their own little society. <br /> <br /> One of the best parts of the film set ... Production designer is clear Stefanovic did beautiful work in this film, the house where these two guys live so unnaturally fun to watch, because it still seems to be correct, these two to live in a place like this. In general, production design, without a doubt, is one of the most powerful aspects of this film really makes this film worth watching ... <br /> <br /> However, a very large part of the film is the acting . And David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like professional actors, they both are. The camera on them every second of the film and, as previously said, there are only about any props in the film, they are really on a bare stage. With a lot of character development and some decent jokes, clever dialogue (sometimes funny stupid), it works to achieve this goal. - and it really moves the film from the low budget for a well-crafted handmade <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the visual effects, because they are definitely worth mentioning. Nothing has digital visual effects and prosthetics, which is any modern horror film. There's quite a terrible dream sequence in the film, and although Drews milked the scene entirely it's still fun to watch. One of the best visual effects in the film at the end, where Andrew and Dave suddenly show their strength in this environment - they have the ability to wish all away, so if they can do it the other way around and make things appear? <br /> <br /> «Nothing» is a bright and well-lit a movie, it really helps to promote the idea of ​​them probably dead (this is actually one of these theories), but "nothing" is not a comedy, and she slowly destroys his own theory. we do not know where they are or what happened to them. we do not know whether they will ever get out, because the film ends before we see something like this. The ending, by the way, not as good as it could be. It's pretty easy to predict what will happen, until now the authors have come up with a few of the incident Which helps to make it a little more interesting, and in the end, it is quite satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Take «Hollow man", "Kill Bill", "Cube", "Age" and many other films, and you have "nothing." it is actually a mixture of different styles, so far there is no other film (at least, I know) there's nothing quite like it. For people who still remember the original Cube Production comment on his DVD, you may remember that Vincenzo Natali said that he invented the story of the cube. He says that he and Andre Bijelic visiting room mates at the time, and they were both in the very dim room with no hope to get out, "Nothing" can not very well be shielded version of the origin of the history of dice, and to this end, it almost like a prequel to one of the cube. <br /> <br /> What can I say? I did not use the «Nothing», it's a great film, and various parts of the film is very well done with tons of smart ideas, so far I feel that the film is not enough, and I have trouble finding with exactly what it is. .. maybe if we do not have «Nothing 2" I can answer that question. "Nothing" is not a great film, but not as good as I expected it to be <br /> <br /> The final rating :. 7.5 / 10
