Of all the reviews I've read that most people have been extremely difficult to Alexandre. Neither Marie or Veronica had never thought that they are particularly desperate to Alexander, it is only a little clever, but not very intelligent, as most of us, however difficult it may be for those who acknowledge. Alexander gets from life with beautiful, being completely care, receive and give what he wants. girls allow it, Veronica loves sex, his patron Marie. There is something wrong with any of this? someone to love? really? I do not think so. Although the French new wave cinema inclined to pretentious and so on, it is simply amazing because of its lack of need for a conspiracy to create emotions. Ease absolutely wonderful and all who are in the position of Alexander, in urban areas can ask for. I'm looking for a patron who is interested in?
