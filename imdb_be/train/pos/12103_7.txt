I've never seen the film, Barbara Steele, I did not like, and he was always a sucker for a good story haunted-house (especially for such great films as "The Legend of Hell House" and the original version of Â«The Haunting" and "House on the Hill haunted "), so I had a feeling that the" Castle of blood "will be right up my alley. And boy, it has been ever! it is the Franco-Italian co-production, while perhaps not a classic, that the first horror style, "Black Sunday" remains to this day, however, very atmospheric, cool chi entry in the genre ghost. The film was shot in black and white, he manages to convey really horrible miasma. The film is about a journalist who makes bets one Lord Blackwood and the author by the name of Edgar Allan Poe that he could spend the night in the castle Blackwood on the night of All Day . saints, when the spirits of those killed in the castle plays his fate viewer gets to see those deaths, and they're pretty scary, for the most part of the film is really an ant on the viewer back in the director's DVD, I just watched -. thanks to the wonderful people in Synapse - even shows amazing topless scenes and non-cat When soft lesbianism! And Barbara well in this film; its otherworldly beauty is put to good advantage plays a pretty ghost. Her presence makes a terrible ghost story in something truly memorable. No wonder that it was named the "Queen of Horror."
