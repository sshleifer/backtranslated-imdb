What a wonderful film. The characters were not only alive, but alive, reflecting the real daily life, and discord in the family. Each character has brought a unique personality in the story that viewers can easily associate with someone they know in their own family or circle of close friends. <br /> <br /> This story flow of truthful life that the viewer can assimilate and become part of the drama, laughter and tears, as the plot of the film developed. The script does a good job of capturing the common emotions, actions and reactions of the characters in the conflict, opinion and determination. <br /> <br /> I do not epic, but it's a very good movie to watch with your loved ones, knowing a lot of heads nodding and "ahhh" moments to share and enjoy.
