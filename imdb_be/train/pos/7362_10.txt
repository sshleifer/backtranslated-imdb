What a fun, sexy movie! They certainly do not make them like this anymore. 4 sex couples Au arrive in London and have all kinds of sexual adventures. Tons of weird innocence as much nudity is developing stock slapstick situations, rather than any explicit sexual desire on the part of the characters. Only when the actress accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters are rampant. Richard O'Sullivan literally gets "Randy" (sic). The film, of course, betrays the origin function as erotic lying in Nudie cuties and Naturism old school movies. My special interest «Au Pair Girls» is that I'm a big fan of Gabriel Drake. If any actress never looked better naked (it is thin, but surprisingly seductive), or dressed, come to that (I loved it from the original launch UFO - who else could take away the purple wig), I'll eat my hat.
