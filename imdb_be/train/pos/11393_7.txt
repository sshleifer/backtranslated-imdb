Uggh! I actually was not that impressed with this movie, although I must admit that it is technically well done. It really gets 7 very high production values, but also for the entertainment value, not rich. In fact, I think this is one of the most overrated films of 50-ies. He won the Oscar for best film, but the film is just boring sometimes with so much dancing and dancing and dancing. This is because unlike some of the musicals that have a sufficient number of songs along with a strong history and to act (for example, to meet with me ST. LOUIS), this film almost all the songs and dances. In fact, this film is about the longest song and dance number in history, and if you're not in this film will quickly bore you. Give me another story! As a result, with bloated production numbers and a weak story, this film, like a steady diet of meringue - it's just not comfortable with in the long run. <br /> <br /> To think ... a film that beat out "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "place in the sun" for the best film! And, even worse, "African Queen" and "ace in the hole" were not even nominated in this category! Even more amazing to me is that the "trump card" lost for best writing, screenplay for this film - even if the "American in Paris" was almost no story to speak of, and largely driven by dances and songs.
