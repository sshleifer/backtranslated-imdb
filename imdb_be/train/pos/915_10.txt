All the talent of Mr. Soorazh Barzhatya shown in his first 3 films, I thought everything was an accident, because his fourth one Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon was so bad. But I must say that it was not an accident. This guy is talented and he did just fine Vivah. it affects you right from the first scene. consistency between Shahid and Amrita are awesome. The chemistry between the two actors gives glimpses between SRK and Kajol. As usual Alok Nath as a good and loving father is fantastic, so Anupam Kher. But its the Shahid-Amrita film.Amrita looks good in most scenes, although Shahid looks a little young to get married, but he does a good job of self-conscious, but still mentally strong suitor. this film will especially appeal to those who lived through those beautiful moments in their lives. Overall, a brilliant film. hats off to Mr. Soorazh Barzhatya ...
