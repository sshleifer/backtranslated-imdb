The Thief of Bagdad is one of my top ten favorite movies. It's interesting, is not parched, it is beautifully filmed and art direction perfectly. Casting could not be better. Rex Ingram made me believe in genies. And the embodiment of evil, of course, fascinated by Conrad Veight like Jafar. He set the bar very high. <br /> <br /> ..I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and never get tired of it. This film is an adventure for all ages..no-one is too old to enjoy it. Thief Bahgdad jog my memories of more innocent time ... I was ten years old the first time I saw him, and the United States was about to enter B. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor, he was able to continue this underlying " viciousness "a few years later in" Casablanca. " And Korda merged, I think Justin and Dupree again in «The Four Feathers» .... great shooting!
