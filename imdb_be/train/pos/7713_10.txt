Modern sci-fi thrillers more like Rambo in space with monsters special effects (often ridiculous, such as the sounds of explosions in a vacuum). Although tame by today's standards, the special effects of "Forbidden Planet" was very strange for its time. Even today they still hold credibility. However, the best part of the film, perhaps the reason that radio thrillers still appeal. Much of what is happening is left to the audience thinking. (what is being Krell look like?) With a lot of history borders never announced or made available only after all the tension and suspense is carried throughout the film. the ending was very thought-provoking and ask alnenne. In my opinion, this is one of the best (if not the best) sci-fi movies ever made.
