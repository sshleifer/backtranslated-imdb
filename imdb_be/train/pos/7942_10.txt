Giallo fans, look for this rare film. It is well written, and full of all kinds of conventional low-lives that inhabit these movies. I do not want to give anything away, so I will not even say anything about the plot. The entire film creates a very strange atmosphere, and you do not know what to expect or who suspect. Recommended! The only place where I have seen this film in English with European Trash Cinema, for $ 15.
