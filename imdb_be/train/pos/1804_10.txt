First of all, I have never been scared of this underrated gem in childhood ( "The Little Mermaid" on the other hand ...). As my title it was one of my fav children's films that I still love as a teenager. This is a beautiful, bitter film about residuals German shepherd named Charlie (fantasticaly voiced by Burt Reynolds), who killed his boss / partner in crime (it is the second name of Carface). Charlie is sent directly to the default paradise, because "all dogs go to heaven, because unlike humans, dogs are naturally good and true and good." Chalie sent back to Earth, because he wound his life hours, if he gets into more mischief with his best friend, and tickling the little orphan, Anne-Marie. I watched it all the time as a kid, and I still occasionally look at. In any case, this is an excellent bitter film, as I said, it can just leave a tear in the eye ...
