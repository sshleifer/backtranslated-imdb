I watched both sides twice. Like the history and enjoyed seeing the old Patrick Swayze as a hero. He was very believable as a hunter Allan Quartermaine and, of course, exceeded the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I admit that I would like to see someone else as the "Lady in distress". Alison Doody must adhere to modern and period pieces. She did not have the kind of woman of the 1800s. Other actors were terrible and the story was very good. I am pleased to see that this generation of actors are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be regarded as old. Age is inevitable, but let's not hide from it. The man in the 50+ can be much hotter (and Patrick really sexy), then green youth, no matter how beautiful. Hoorah for character strings, to go along with a big smile.
