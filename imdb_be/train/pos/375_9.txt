it was one of the most moving films I've ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I watched it the first time, and every time it's on TV my eyes glued to it. acting and the plot is amazing. it seems so precise reality, and it affects so many controversial topics. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama.
