Well, this may be one of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandy gives an idea of ​​the tour-de-force! Unfortunately, her career never took off, but - finally - it will always be remembered for her first three pictures of the course: "The King of Comedy," "Dallas Doll" and "Without you I am nothing." She puts on a different person from New York to create a secular Diana Ross biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and tough, tender and sensual, philosophical and melancholic, she convinces the audience in every scene, and in fact it is actually "very beautiful." Watch this one (unless you are from Iowa), you will certainly enjoy !!
