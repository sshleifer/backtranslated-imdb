Todd Roch mad genius. «Knuckleface Jones", his third, and most fully realized, the short film has an unusual sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads. The fact that the film is about the heart, and it almost certainly would not agree with me on this as a regular Joe finds the confidence to go through life with a bit of inspiration. Or not. You just have to see for yourself. Brief periodically makes rounds at film festivals, so keep your eyes and catch it if you can - you'll be glad you did. It's fun. And check out the other short films Todd also popping up here and there from time to time: «Single spaced" and «Slug 660».
