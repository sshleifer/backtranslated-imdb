I agree with the comment above, I like the realism in this, and in many films (not just movies on eating disorders) manufacturer, seem to forget that. They take issue every day and create a very dramatic scene, and then the end of the movie come everything is perfect again, I do not like, because it is not a reality. Not wanting to say things can not be better, not meaning to say things are not in the film, but he does not spend much of the film to create all these problems, and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again, when people are eating disorders people do not just admit it and want to get better, and then the life of peach, it takes a long time, and I like the way this film we grow with the characters, we go through the difficulty with them, getting better and worse, because it is a very important part of the film. It gets into the minds of people with eating disorders, and shows the complications and pain, in a very realistic, and I loved it. I also love how it reveals the secrets and betrayal people feel when suffering from an eating disorder, it is terrible to see how people react when they find out, especially if they approve it. I thought that this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told, and defiantly one of my favorites.
