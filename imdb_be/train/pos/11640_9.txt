What I really liked about this movie is that, like Hitchcock's films, is a thriller that does not take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock realized that people go to the cinema to have a good time. What seems, Hollywood, forgotten in recent years. This action movie, but he's got a lot of laughs and always has one eye winks at the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams beautiful, as always. Cillian Murphy terrible than he was in Batman Begins. In the old days, there were guys who always played the bad guy. We do not see a lot of that these days, because I suspect that Hollywood agents considered a bad career move, but Cillian Murphy is really good to be bad. <br /> <br /> directorial surprisingly stylish. History is good, but the dialogue could use some sprucing up. <br /> <br /> Â«red eye" is really funny film, and the people applauded when the closing credits rolled. If you're in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller "Red Eye" can be your ticket.
