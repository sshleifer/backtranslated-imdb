Lavish production values ​​and solid representation in the simple adaptation of the classic Jane Austen's satire on marriage games within and between classes in the provincial 18th century in England. Northam and Pelty is salutory mixture as friends who have to go through the jealousy and lies, to discover that they love each other. Good humor strengthened charity, which goes a long way towards explaining the possibility of assessing the age starting material (which was toned down slightly in its severe skepticism). I liked the look of the film and how the boom have been created, and I thought it would not rely too much on the sequences of head shots, like most of the other films 80s and 90s do. Very good results.
