In an alternate 1950, where the outbreak of the undead (caused by the mysterious "cosmic dust") restrained by the use of special electronic collars, young householder, Temi, finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly), his newly acquired family domesticated zombies. <br /> <br /> Fido is fast becoming a surrogate father Those whose real father is not able to adequately express his love for his son (or hot to trot-wife, played by a lovely Carrie-Anne Moss) next traumatized as a child (if he had to shoot his father, who was trying to eat it!). <br /> <br /> Those working at the site of trouble, however, if the collar of his putrid Pal is for a moment, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbor. With the authorities in the wake of feeds with trouble brewing with a couple of local bullies, and his mother form a bond with their immortal home-help Tiaya will be able to keep his new found friend? <br /> <br /> a refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick, Fido is thoroughly entertaining, magical dark comedy, which should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor. Taking Romero zombie verse and transplant it in 1950 small town America is brilliant, and the result is simply one of the most original films to combat all the "reanimated dead" theme, which I've seen. <br /> <Fido BR /> Connell is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame, along with Bub Day of the Dead, and The Return of the Living Dead Tarman in; it's not often I feel empathy for a walking corpse, but the performance of The Big Yin so well that I actually turned out to cheer for the big blue bag of manure! The rest of the cast also give flattering speech, a young Kn Rey (but by) and Ms.Moss worthy of special mention ?? Ray Player, for one so young, he puts in a particularly guaranteed turn, and Moss, because she is so damn tasty! <br /> <br /> This is the third zombie movie that I watched this week (the others being somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and quite fun Flight of the Living Dead), and, to my surprise, it's also the best. Directed by Andrew Currie gave fans of the genre something truly original value and talent to watch in the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 10 rounded to 9 IMDb.
