Big surprise, probably because I was expecting that it sucks. The reviews were pretty dismissive about it, although they all seemed to agree that the concept of the golden man learns that his new girlfriend super hero, and find, if he wants to break up with her, she kind of crazy. I kept waiting for it to fall apart, but he never did. Of course, it does not make as much as his strange room, as it can, and wants to be short if it might be better to expand the universe of the film. But I can not blame him for it. Uma Thurman big as bipolar superhero, G-Girl. And I found, after several years of love for him, Luke Wilson can be absolutely perfect if cast as a schlub. He gave two of the best comic performances in 2006 (the others are largely unpublished Idiocracy). I totally cracked in the expression on his face when he and Thurman first sex. This is one of the funniest sex scenes ever. My only real complaint is that they are doing G-Girl a little too much of a psycho, like almost unbelievably so. Maybe with some background, I could take it better. I can forgive its flaws, though, because I had a very good time watching it. Underestimated, of course.
