Although John Woo boiled my number 1 favorite film. But I have to say that the history of the police is my number two favorite film. I say this because the stunts, fights and action is my favorite part of the film, when Jackie Chan jumps off the rails at the top of esculator the mall grab onto a pole, surrounded by Christmas lights and slid down the pole fell through the skylight, and finally land on his back on the hard marble floor. OH! Buy at amazon.com for 14:98. (Or something in the $ 14.) VHS new line of home video. any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to answer. (I'm only 14, but I know where you can find any movie ever made.) If you are looking everywhere for a movie and I can not find it, please reply to me. Thank you and good night!
