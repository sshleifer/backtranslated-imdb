It is simply one of the best performances of the classic Dickens story. The script is very closely follows the story was originally written by Dickens, and captures the perfect balance between the atmosphere of the movie and the game atmosphere. Viewers who love either format will find enough stories rooted in their presentation style choices. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott brings a charmingly realistic approach to the character of Scrooge, and very convincing in the development of character instigated by ghosts visits. I found that he was able to win me over to the point where I sympathize with the old miser, it is rarely done in other versions. Excellent work carried out by supporting actors significantly add to this production, which is simply the most enjoyable of all versions of Christmas Carol, I've seen.
