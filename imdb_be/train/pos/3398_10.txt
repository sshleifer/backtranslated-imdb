I saw Soylent Green in 1973, when it was first released, and possibly eight more times over the years on a video or TW .. He was always one of my favorite sci-fi and / or Charlton Heston movies. <br /> <br /> In recent years, the Egyptian Theater in LA twelve Charlton Heston film retrospective. I flew in from out of state to see six films in two days. Soylent Green looked great on the big screen with the Egyptian ideal of the new seal. Since its opening, the installation on going home scene in a big end of the film was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston, as a policeman, living in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and understanding of how the world used to be, and Eddie Robinson, as a man who remembers the past, both large . <br /> <br /> Their chemistry together perfectly. The film also looks a lot better in a large 35mm print. Fleischer knows exactly how to fill the screen, and cinematoraphy, writing, music is used, and all of it works. The film is also very powerful in his sad and very possible vision of the future. Just think how the world's population has grown, tropical forests have disappeared, the resources used to green the greenhouse effect is getting worse since 1973. I just wonder why this movie is not playing in theaters all these years. His reputation should be better. <br /> <br /> Speaking of reputation, often people say, like Charlton Heston is not a big actor. Seeing him in El Cid, Soylent Green, commander, The Omega Man, Will Penny, and Major Dundee back to back, I am convinced that he is one of our finest actors. Of course, he did a dozen other great films, and for those who care you know what they are. <br /> <br />
