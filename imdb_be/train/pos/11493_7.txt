Unborn pretty good low-budget horror film exploits the fears associated with pregnancy. This is a very well-acted on the always serviceable Brooke Adams and b-movie stalwart James Karen, but the supporting cast is pretty average for a b-grader. Music, Gary Numan all people, is also good. Scenario Henry Dominic pretty clever for this sort of thing, although there is a hint of misogyny that. Rodman Fender direction is only adequate, and there are some unnecessary panic cheap. If you're a fan of Adams, whose film career is not as famous as it should be, check it out; She is beautiful as always.
