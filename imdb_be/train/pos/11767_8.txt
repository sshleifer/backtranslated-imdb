What is a good movie! Made Men is a great fighter with a lot of twists and turns. James Belushi is very good, as a former hood who stole 12 million from the boss, who must fend off the gangsters, HILLBILLIES his wife and the local sheriff (Timothy Dalton) .You will not be disappointed, hop on board and enjoy the ride. 8 of 10
