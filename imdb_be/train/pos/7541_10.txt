This film Showtime really deserves a much better rating of the viewer than 4.5; I gave him 10 on the basis of the history and activities of the two stars. After reading the comments spectator, I was surprised how many people have been waiting for this film comedy. Yes, I see that the IMDb lists it as a Comedy / Drama by genre. This is certainly misleading, is not it? Fortunately, I saw the movie before you go to this site, so I had no expectations. In fact, based on a summary of what I heard, I expected it to just be a drama. I'm wondering if this is not pumped up to be a funny movie called so much low voices. <br /> <br /> Another factor that could cause a low voice, that this film a lot of "character-driven". "Driving Miss Daisy" is an example of another film initiative of character that comes to mind. previous comment Someone complained about the sad trial. Tom (Danny Glover), stagehands, seemed to distract from the real story of the film. That is how it was engineered upward social recovery of his family - and his personal troops, if you will. Nevertheless, they served to establish trust and to justify his right to go to Greenwich and to move "up" in the world. <br /> <br /> Tom's obsession became a compulsion. He proved that he will stop at nothing in order to fit into the white neighborhood. Its a shame when another black man moved next door not because of skin color. It is because of all that "uninvited" represented; all that was left behind Tom. In fact, Tom became the Oreo cookie :. Black on the outside but white on the inside <br /> <br /> In the last 20 minutes of this film are some of the most powerfully written, directed and acted (Whoopi Goldberg) I have ever had the pleasure to watch. I realized that the climax of the film was not obvious that the event happened next (do not want to give it away). The culmination of the verbal and Whoopi delivers it. I'm still not clear when this conversation when she tells Tom that Tom -Two college going or when she lets it all in the middle of the night and wakes up, Tom. However, isolation is great. . You know that life on the street will never be the same <br /> <br /> My favorite kind of character controlled motion: people go through the problem, some pain, do their dance, they grow, they change, and life goes on. As an audience member, I can learn something or be inspired.
