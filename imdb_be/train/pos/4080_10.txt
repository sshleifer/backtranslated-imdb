This is one of the best animated family films of all time. In addition, virtually all of the major competitors for this title came from the same creative mind Hiyao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. In particular, the other big films include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "delivery service Kikki in." Gone are pretty good, but a bit too horrible for a typical family fare - better for teens and adults. The only thing that distinguishes "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" from other Miyazaki films is that it is much more tension filled adventures trip <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so well.? . Because it is a complete package: the animation is very well done, and the story is really interesting and compelling <br /> <br /> Most of the Japanese anime show, but obviously dark or cynical or violent; animation itself is often intermittent, stylized and minor. None of these problems is not to annoy the castle in the sky. He has an idea to burn, and the characters are well drawn, if slightly exaggerated version of realistic people. (None of this trench coat to wear poser) There's not a lot of adventures, but not the blood and the blood. Animation is smooth, detailed, and cinematic ally in the composition - not a lot of flat shots. Backgrounds excellent. <br /> <br /> voice in English dubbed version of the first course, in particular, the two wires, Pazo (James Van Der Beek) and sieve (Anna Paquin). Sound engineering is big, too. Use your sound studio, if you have it. <br /> <br /> One of the aspects that I particularly enjoyed the fact that much of prehistory remains unexplained. Laputa had once lived, and is now abandoned. Why? We will never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to take everything else that is easy to do, because the invented world is so fully realized. In fact, it would be fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the supporting characters, most of which are one-dimensional stock characters (for example, a gruff general, stupid sidekick, kooky old miner, etc.) Very It is recommended for people between the ages of 6 to 60!
