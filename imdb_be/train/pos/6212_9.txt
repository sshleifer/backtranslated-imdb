I have deep sympathy for this film, despite turning out to deliberately less "polished" than in other films Ginger and Fred, not to mention a little problematic casting Harriet Hillard in the lead romantic role. <br /> <br /> Once again with these films, the story of a minor consequence - Astaire plays a very unlikely sailor and Rogers novice performer in (which happens to be a brilliant former hoofer (of course)!), seedy dime dance music hall. Despite the fact that their relationship is bright and fun to watch, they get caught up marked with the main story Hilliard and Randolph Scott can not find any chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it was a last minute decision, Hilliard was rather miscast in this, as it has no presence on the screen to give the film that he needs, despite the something sweet and pleasant throughout. The film may be useful in the promotion of Lucille Ball wise cracking life brass character in a major role, as it simply shone in every little scene, and would make a great Helen Broderick type of side impact at Rogers stuff like bright film (see «Stage Door», made in the next year, for example, the wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses). This is a one-dimensional nature of Neanderthal Scott finally falls in Hilliard is even harder to believe than the Aster to be in the Navy! <br /> <br /> Currently, the important part, singing and dancing: Nothing more can be said about the "Let's face the music and dance," but this is a brilliant and moving and beautifully made, and I often watch the scene with tears in his eyes. However, other songs in the film deserve recognition as well; "I put all my eggs in one basket" is a perfect example of comic instincts Astaire and Rogers, and almost makes fun of their reputation bursting into spontaneous, entirely synchronized dancing. Other highlights of the "I'd rather Bring Band» and «Let Yourself Go», which show how these two talents can perform just as brilliantly as alone together. I almost forgot to mention that this is one of the few (if not only) time when we see Aster brilliantly playing the piano; It seems that human talents are endless! <br /> <br /> In general, I prefer it to "the Top Hat" and "Swing Time" (though only), as it is more earthy and spoke with such enthusiasm by all participants, it is hard not to like the cool factor .
