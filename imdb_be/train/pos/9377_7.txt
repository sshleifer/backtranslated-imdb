Surprise thriller with lots of twists and double-crosses than scribble pad. mixing large cast with an intriguing storyline under control in the Twin Peaks-ish influence the director Dahl. Nicolas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows a large image of a man in a grave looking for the right thing to do. J.T. Walsh (RIP for great actor) always a great villain like Dennis Hopper. It is such a shame that he never made a higher profile in the business. I'm sure he has his followers, though. Overall, this is a great film that shows you that you do not need a big splash or commercial soundtrack be an interesting movie.
