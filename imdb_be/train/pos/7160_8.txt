Disney film that dares to do something different, should at least be awarded for their efforts. "Hole" does not make the same mistakes, as one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teens were in the camp. For the first time events are not explained in detail. Retrospective scene really serve the purposes and present several mature that may surprise the viewer. I have to admit that at first I was a little scare serious movies. But I soon realized that we had to relive those moments, to see the beauty of the story. in addition to the story, this film also does a good job into question some of the methods used in the correctional facilities. (One example where the Caveman forbidden to teach Zero to read, because they have to dig a hole to build a character, how to learn to read will not help this). "The Hole" is a film that is smart and beautiful . A must see!
