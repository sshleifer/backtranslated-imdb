My room mate ordered this one from the web some time ago, and I finally found the time to look. It's ugly. It cheezy. It's very stupid ... but it's also very fun. I mean, it was the most fun we had watching a movie like this, because the «City Of The Walking Dead" many years ago. It was like the old drive-in theater again! You could tell the guy who made this film like all the terrible duplicate of zombie movies. this one has all the clichés and techniques of those movies rolled into one, which is great, because it's supposed to be so. Cheeze ratio is high, clotted blood flowing and the laughter roll! the effects come from the untidy to good , the one where the guy gets torn in half, and one where a guy gets his lo Xia pushed through his chest and both are great! Actions go from terrible is actually very good. There is not much plot, just lots and lots of gore. It is one patterned after the zombie films from Italy and Spain, I think, because they linger on the gross scene forever, like this film. If you want TROMA movies, cheezy material B-class, you can not do anything wrong by watching it. A good way to spend a Friday night!
