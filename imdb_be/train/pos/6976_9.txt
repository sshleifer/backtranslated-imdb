I did not see the BSG, I tried to look it up once in the middle of the show, but could not get into it. However, I saw Rebirth Caprica yesterday I felt a little lost, so I decided to watch the pilot today and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising show and the only side effect that it had on me, now I want to see the BSG, as well. <br /> <br /> But what I really liked, I should not be hardcore BSG fan, to understand what is happening in Caprica. From what I read on the internet that they are trying to reach the female population, as BSG reached way more people, and, at least in my case, it worked. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that if you are trying to watch the show to do it from the beginning, starting with the Pilot.
