Warning: May contain spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I saw this film in 3 times and I loved it every time. Seeing it again, I'm always reminded of how good it is. HBO TV film very well done, like most of his films are- it would have won an Oscar for this performance he was released for general distribution rather than a made for TV. <br /> <br /> I'm sure, who knows, read the other reviews here, this is the story of a serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. He killed 56 people for 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried and could not be found, so it was only found guilty of 52 of 53 of his murder). The story is actually focuses more on forensic analyst, Victor Burakou played to perfection by Stephen Rea. The person who gets tortured and frantic to find the killer, despite the additional obstacles placed party hacks, part of it is important, to be sure. There is a very touching scene at the end of the film, which is referred to as in America, researchers typically remove serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not, because of mental stress and frustration. In accordance with the accounting Burak worked for more than 5 years before his first break from it. He followed the matter to its conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, his boss, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, in fact, tells him that he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing that he had given him a break before. <br /> <br /> Rea productivity by making it so well, he does not overplay, you chew the scenery, or do anything that detracts from his image of a man who is obsessed to find his killer. He is a man with enthusiasm, but does not show it in the same way as it is so commonly depicted in detective films. He rarely gives the flash after quietly put up with more than most can stand under such circumstances. Rea makes so much of his face, his eyes, he does not need to replay. He just * that * - His character, so disappointing after such a long time, at one point, driven to despair, he actually said that he would prefer to find a 3 at one time than in any year. Of course, the fact that he was not aware that he wants more people to die, he just wants to get some clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel this person. He gives us to understand, but a glimpse of what he has to live with the horror and futility. <br /> <br /> Mutant, to be sure, a child Chikatilo was the one who produces such "monsters". Chikatilo character very well done Jeffrey Demanov. He somehow (not possible, although it may seem) causes some little self-pity. Perhaps he is the worst of us has gone wrong? In any case, his performance is very well done. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, Colonel Fetisov (later elevated to general) also does a great job. He begins to think that cynical secular official, who did not seem to be much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone Burakou blocks. But in the end it becomes more than just an assistant, he actually actively involved in helping Burakou. There is also a very good turn of Max von Sydow as a psychiatrist brought to help profile and find out what they are looking for perverts. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film deals with a painful, grotesque and violent story, it's really more about what it takes to catch the killer than the killer. All around a very well made movie with a great game and a great script. The script was unable to do what is best of this type of film making :. Writing the actual events and to place them on the value in the dramatic structure, which makes you feel like you know the people behind the * facts * <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars
