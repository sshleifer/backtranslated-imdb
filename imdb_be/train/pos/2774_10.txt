For me, cinema and acting is all about telling a story. The story of David and Bethsheba a tragedy that deeply and can be felt to those who read and understand the Bible. In this movie, I thought that the story of Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward was at its best. To know and understand the story of David and his journey to become the king of Israel, I made the story all the more attractive. You can feel his passion for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed real human side of the man, who at one time was larger than life. fear, reluctance, but obedience Susan Hayward his power as its king was beautifully painted it. It could also be tightly David almost Uriah spent the night at the gate, but not at home. As well as sorrow, when he was killed in battle. Raymond Massey powerful and authoritative condemnation of the King made me feel his anger. A lot were quite real and believable atmosphere. In general, I think it was one of the best films that this kind. I gave it a rating of ten.
