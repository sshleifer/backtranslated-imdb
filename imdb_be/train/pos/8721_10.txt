Disney (and the wonderful people at Pixar's, of course) offer a good, humorous stories, combined with the best computer animation. I admit that perhaps the "face" of these errors have been a bit more static than that of «Antz», and they only had four legs (in «Antz» six ...). But the backgrounds are beautiful and the animation was spectacular. But let this be a lesson: he was not a computer, which made him such a success: it was the people's car, which added a nice little twist that I missed in the «Antz». Some moments were, of course, "bloopers" at the end (So keep watch in the end, it's worth it!), Which was very funny and original. The line "Filmed entirely on location" intended for a more attentive audience.
