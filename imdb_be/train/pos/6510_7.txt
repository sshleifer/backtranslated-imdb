I actually really like what I've seen this cartoon so far. Of course, the animation is not the best, but to be honest, I would like to see this type of a cartoon style made quickly and cheaply than the old type of style are made quickly and cheaply (which is starting to happen more and more often-- is only a style that It looks good when a lot of time and effort put into it). There's nothing wrong with angular lines and a small black dot eyes - in fact, I think it's very cute. As a child, I never thought that the design of Scooby-Doo was particularly charming, but I think it might be better to know. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Shaggy was always my favorite character, and believe it or not, but I think he has the greatest potential for some depth. Of course, the show does not focus around the original "Mystery resolution" topic, but it was just a tired old formula anyway. Do not get me wrong - I'm sure there are writers out there who could bring a much greater interest in traditional occupations Mystery Inc. (That was not enough in recent years), but at the same time it is a pleasure to show deviations from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby still funny, but it is not only a comic. They are still timid, but finally have the opportunity to use what appears (shock!) Int. They are the same old eating slackers, as always, but now in fact seem to be getting on with my life through inheritance. <br /> <br /> Uncle Albert I find the original Scooby-Doo joke be pure cheese and unintentionally hilarious at best, but this show really has the ability to genuine humor. Also, I never really like Casey Kasem as Shaggy, in any case, so that the new actor Sun annoy me as much as it does other people. (I still think Billy West was the best though) <br /> <br /> In general, while not a big cartoon throughout the history of animation, more achievement, among other incarnations of Scooby.
