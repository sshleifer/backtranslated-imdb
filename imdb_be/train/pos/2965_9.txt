Very possibly one of the funniest films in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, funny and, before you see it, I suggest you see the «South Park» is one of the funniest cartoons created. Buy it, you laugh every time you see it. Pure genius. If you do not think it's funny, then you have no soul or sense of humor. 10 out of 10.
