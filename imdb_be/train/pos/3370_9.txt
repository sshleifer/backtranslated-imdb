Just I finished Cronicles heroic knight only a minute so I consider myself very please, but the question still looms on me. Although it would seem that the first 7 episodes or so is actually a paraphrase of the first record Lodoss War events the truth is that they really are not. It would seem that the creator CotHK had another vision of the original is finished (and this may be the reason that the first 7 episodes of the case), but I do not think so. CotHK can say that it begins 5 years after the War Heros, who was part of a pair. I think that the director made the first 5 episodes, it seems so much like the original just to summarize, to give the viewer a little reminder and introduction of characters and their cases are made because they are much less after a series of legs in the history of Sparks in. Now, after making a series of punch in terms of Spark, we find ourselves whipped another 10 years (15 years after the war Heros). Spark and his team are doing, in some cases, resemble Parn and his crew, as soon as the tour kicks into gear, especially a love story that is brewing between Spark and Neese. I also thought that several times during the CotHK, I threw in the original series, and if not for the long blue hair Spark, I know I would be pressed to stop a few times to make sure that the correct disk was. In no case do I consider this fundamental delivered back, however, the authors have done an excellent job in crafting believable characters and a great story. The only thing that makes me offended that the Ashram and Wagnard return. Ummmm ... what ??? Do not get me wrong, both great villains, even if only a criminal trait Ashram is that it supports Marmi. Perhaps I missed something during rough series, which explained that part. As for sequels go, though, I highly recommend CotHK. I put both CotHK and, even more so, the original Record of Lodoss War Lord of the Rings is much higher. Both are more epic than I have ever seen or read. I highly recommend it.
