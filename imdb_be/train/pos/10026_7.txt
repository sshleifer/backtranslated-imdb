Without Kirsten Miller, the project should be completed. However, with the awe inspiring beauty and talent, which Miss Miller, I would definitely recommend it. It looked as if the other actors were just playing her performance. Sad attempt to Wagner in honor of this film was a little disappointing, but several scenes entirely detract entertained. Basically a reproach to writing and storyline, talent assembled group did heroic work of salvation, that was a disaster. Miller charismatic delivery and timing were impeccable and truthfully. She plays the thin line between assertive and domineering, but never insulting if she actually engineer, she pretends to be. I wish I had seen it on the big screen, but unfortunately I was lucky to rent it before it was lost.
