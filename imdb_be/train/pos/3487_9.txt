Wrestlemania 14 is not often viewed as one of the greatest of WrestleMania, but I would personally put it in my top 5 if not top 3. It has so many great things, and it really meant a birth Attitude Era, which was the best WWE era, in the my opinion. HBK has the heart of a lion, and his rudder Austin, as he did, on his way out was pure class from him. This is one of the hottest crowd you will ever see, and he has J.R and King in their ad better!. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? team battle LOUD pop L.O.D to return to. I am not a supporter of the battle, and this is another average one. Very predictable, even when you first glance, it's obvious L.O.D wins. Looking at the Sun 8 minutes or so, but it certainly helps. <br /> <br /> 2.5 <br /> <br /> the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship <br /> <br /> So Michaynoku | C | Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> Taka gets amazing popularity to its input. Quickly, snakes, and very interesting. If the two more time, they would, of course, tearing the roof off with their material. Taka Michinoku driver to win <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Championship WWF Europe <br /> <br /> Triple H | .. C | Vs Owen reservations here, tea handcuffs for slaughter. Good pop for Owen, mixed reaction to travel. Indeed, the very underrated game that belongs to one of my favorites for Wrestlemania, actually. Two mixed together very well, and Owen can go to someone. Win a trip with Chyna interference. <br /> <br /> 4.5 <br /> <br /> mixed match Tag. Marc Mero & Sable Vs Goldust & Luna. Definition of pop for Sable, unheard of this time for a woman. Sable really looks hot and the crowd just eat it!. Sable constant singing, and they break out almost every time she gets into the ring. Not bad for a mixed tag match, he was entertaining antics, and it was a good time. sable team will win if Sable struck a technical knockout. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock Vs The Rock | C |. Before you consider a match, I would point out, The Rock showed his huge potential with his interview with Jennifer Flowers, before the match. Good pop for Shamrock, a large heat time for The Rock. Too depressingly short, and I thought that the end was fun silly antics while clicking Shamrock was strange to see, and the crowd went crazy over it. Rock retains title if the ref is changing decision. <br /> <br /> 2.5 <br /> <br /> match Dumpster, for the WWF Tag Team Championship <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk Vs The New Age Outlaws. The Outlaws are not as already over, as they were going to be at this time. The crowd is really more dead, but I thought it was some great Hardcore bit with some sick looking bumps. Cactus and Terry won the title in the end. <br /> <br /> 3.5 <br /> <br /> undertaker against Kane. A great time of applause for the undertaker. Much better than it access to Wrestlemania 20, and the big man of the match against the big people, it was really good. It was a great fight with all of the undertaker with a sore bump looks across the table. WWE was smart, making Kane is looking strong, even in defeat. After 2 years expel tombstones, Taker, finally puts it, with the third one. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> the WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Special Guest Enforcer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Vs Steve Austin. More heat for Tyson. The crowd goes ape sh * t Austin is definitely one of the biggest I've heard bursts. Mixed reaction to KBC. This is a really special match up, one of the greatest WrestleMania main events in the history, you can tell when J.R even gasped. HBK gives it his all, that was to be his last match, and Austin is rarely better. Hostility and electricity from the crowd is amazing, and it's as exciting as it gets. Austin wins a stunner, with Tyson knocking out 3:16 joining Michaels. Austin festive victory, it is a miracle to behold, with one of the nosiest crowd you will ever see, the king said that this is correct, they are crazy. <br /> <br /> 5.5 <br /> <br /> The bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the biggest real. It has everything you want in Wrestlemania, and really started to push the Attitude Era. It's very special for me because it was the first Wrestlemania I have ever seen, even at 98. "Austin Era, has begun!Â» <br /> <br /> 1/2 9/10
