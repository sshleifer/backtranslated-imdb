Meryl Streep a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know that she was ridiculed for having a lot of roles, with a focus, but it nails the accent every time. Her performance as Linda Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly pleasant, and not all that smart. But this only makes the work all the more remarkable Strip. I think it only costs 10 or near the Oscar nominations. About the film, well, there were a few interesting things. I do not know much about Australia, but the theme of religious fanaticism among the general public played an important role in history. I basically missed it the first time I saw the movie a few years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. And it seems that the Australian press as well as experienced in poverty induces harassment and overkill, as well as their American counterparts. Very good movie. It is a little different. Grade: B
