Acceptance role Jack Albertson and Sam Levene played on Broadway, Matthau and George Burns played a couple of old time vaudeville comic team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale, who seems to have a different outlook on life. <, Br /> <br /> Matthau can not stop working, the man never learned to relax, take some time and smell the roses. He is capricious old cuss, whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin is becoming less and less work for him. <br /> <br /> What hurt him bad was that about 15 years ago, his partner, George Burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family. Workaholic as Matthau can not understand it and decide Burns personally. <br /> <br /> Benjamin gets to brainstorm, to combine the guys and do it on national television special. What is happening here is pretty fun. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys also sad, bitter story, and old age. Matthau on screen for most of the film, but it's Burns, who won the prestigious as an Oscar in old age 79. <br /> <br /> Burns brought a little personal in this film as well. As we all know, he was a straight man a great comedy team Burns and Helena, which is a detachment of Monty Python borrowed a lot from. In 1958, for health reasons, Grace Allen resigned and George kept walking up to the age of 100. Or at least pretty close to as an active performer. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys by Smith & Dale team, however, and if you like The Sunshine Boys, I highly recommend you see a pair of tickets to Broadway to see a couple of guys who were interested in the American public at the end of last century. Doctor sketch that Matthau and Burns do it themselves with their material. <br /> <br /> And I think you'll like The Sunshine Boys.
