I am sure that most people already know that story, Stingy Scrooge gets a visit from three spirits (ghosts of Christmas past, present and future), which emphasize the part of his life in the hope of saving his soul and change his path. Dickens classic story in one form or another, has stood the test of time to become a favorite holiday favorite. <br /> <br /> While I grew up watching the 1951 version starring Alastair Sims, and I believe that he is the ultimate Scrooge, I was impressed with this version, which was released when I was in high school. George C. Scott played convincingly and medium Scrooge, and the actors playing the ghost quite frightening and threatening. David Warner Bob Cratchit and good. <br /> <br /> This version is beautifully shot and uses the more modern styles of shot (for 1980), which makes it more acceptable for my children than in 1951, black and white. <br /> <br /> This is a worthy adaptation of the story, and one that I watch almost every year at some point in the Christmas season.
