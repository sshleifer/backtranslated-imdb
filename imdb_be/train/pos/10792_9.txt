Good show, very interesting. Good acting martial arts. A good story plot. All the main crew did a good job of Robert Urich, Chuck Norris, Jennifer Tang, and especially a big hand to Jadson Mills. Especially great tribute to Robert Urich, in his last days. GREAT! the actor who will be really missed.
