I saw this film is addicted to Jane Austen and always doubts about the sense of cinematic rendering the complexity of her novels: well, it's simply a transposition accurate, intelligent, tender, caring, tactful, respectful, intense, in a word, perfect <! br /> <br /> «Emma» is one of the finest and funniest Austen novels, thanks to the general pervasive irony of situations and characters. The film respected the subtle irony, not paying attention to the comic element (Miss Bates, primarily). What interests me in the novel and the film makes it clear, is a profound knowledge of human life showed the English novelist and modern look, with which women, men, and their relationship is processed, and it is amazing when we think of as a woman novelist of the 18th century, who lived almost alone, could understand such a depth and truth about life as she did what most, and still fascinates me. We can feel the present in the whole film: just replace the costumes, as well as to use more current language, but the situation, feelings, ideas, it would be very modern. I think morbid interest in other people's lives, or that allude to envy, which is now more than ever to dominate women's relationships, and still difficult to identify and give expression to their feelings, especially love: every situation is becoming universal and is not covered by the value time. <br /> <br /> The cast is really talented and offer a very good and very brilliant performances: a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suited for this role (at present it would be probably too mature for him), Toni Collette just fine. And how I envied them for the beautiful dresses they can wear! And then, the spectacular English countryside, where each situation receives a magic and dreamlike dimension ... really nice and decent movie.
