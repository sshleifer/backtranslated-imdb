Seven Pounds stars Will Smith as Ben Thomas, a collection of IRS agent who has an ulterior motive for the meeting of those who got their tax payments. Thomas caused the death of seven people while driving to talk on the phone, and the movie's behind his attempt to try to atone for it, frankly, inexcusable crime. <br /> <br /> The storyline is as subtle as a brick through the window of a house green. What you see is exactly what's happening - even the ending of Titanic was more surprising when compared to seven pounds. There is absolutely no rotation at all, there is never any confusion or doubt about what is happening. <br /> <br /> I usually only like Will Smith, when in full mode, Bad Boys. Man at his best when sports gun, driving a Ford GT, and said, "Oh hell nah", as every time he tries to act seriously it only comes across as an unsuccessful attempt at trying to get the Oscar, which he so obviously, desperate for. This is probably the main reason why I was not looking forward to the movie, although it is very low. There are flashes of comedy, but they are thin, in fact it was the most understated performance of Will Smith I have ever seen, and the only reason he was fantastic, and, ironically, should be nominated for the main award. <br /> <br /> supporting cast were also grand - Rosario Dawson is quite a lot of staring at the death of the entire film, and Woody Harrelson, and Barry Pepper were beautiful, like, where all the other players a bit <br /> <br /> as a whole is sentimental. - but he does not throw all the usual clich√©s and sentimental violin to give you no other choice but to cry. There were several times that even my hardened heart almost broke. You will be hard not to find one of the situations that are not relevant to your own life, which makes it seem more real. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 8/10. Shaw Will Smith turns to the drama without all the frustration and the pursuit of happiness come the better for it.
