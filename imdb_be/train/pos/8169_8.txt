It's a bloody mess and quite convincing. Corbin Bernson very much in command of this film, with its smoothly psycho control freak eponymous practitioner. Linda Hoffman plays his cheating wife, and it is very easy on the eyes - unfortunately for her, the little "date" with a man pool brings severe punishment so that the good doctor knows best - shame about that pretty smile! The last half hour of the film is devoted to the nature Bernson loses it completely and the focus falls on the young actress named Virginia Keane. An extremely talented artist, she was a pig in the spotlight since the braces come off. Good legs, too!
