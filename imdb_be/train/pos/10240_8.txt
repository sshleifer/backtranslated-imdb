Genre:.? Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, circus <br /> <br /> The main characters are: Tyrannosaurus rex, pterodactyl Elsa, wimp Parasarolophus, Ooo in Triceratops, a boy named Louis, a girl called Cecilia captain New-eye . ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa), etc. <br /> <br /> What's going on? Four dinosaurs (see above), serves some of the "brain grain" and is now a pleasant, friendly dinosaurs, which will be good for children. They go to New York City with big plans ?? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This is a cute animated film. Dinosaur animation when they are nice and friendly little floppy and not so good, but they look nice all the same way. I like dinosaurs when they are nice and friendly, they are good, friendly and good. Like (almost) all the symbols signs, especially Elsa and Cecil, but I certainly like the others as well. Overall, I like this film a lot! :-) <br /> <br /> It is recommended to: People who like good children's cartoons, people who, like the dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think that circuses are not always what they seem to be ?? Enjoy! :-)
