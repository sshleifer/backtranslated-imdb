Wow, that was a movie was absolutely magic I could not believe that I began to wake up so late to watch it, but it came at the end of an ounce, I started to look, I could not stop, it was a full range of very good actors wow even Eartha Kitty and Ruby Dee Forest Whittaker and James Earl Jones, and many other well-known actors and actresses, it was more than a glimpse into the history of it was eye opening to another part of the society, people do not know about and can even be embarrassing to talk about. I had never heard of the book or the movie about this before, and it is something that black history is never refers only looking down, because they were privleged and mixed race, I highly recommend this film
