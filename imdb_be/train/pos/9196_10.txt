Key in Petto cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy in a box that is outside of his apartment one day. She decides to bring it up and fix it cuts. Then she leaves a note that he eats the food she did go home, because she had to go to work. When she returns home, but she believes that it is still there. He tells her that he wants to live there with her brother or cousin. Desperate to get him to leave, she tells him that if he was her pet, he could stay. And as a pet, she says that he will not have any rights and do whatever she told him. (Not in the distorted way!) To my surprise, he agreed, and since then it is known as Momo, her pet.
