I did not give this film a perfect score, to be honest, compared to the great classics as "Citizen Kane" and "Seven Samaurai.» However, this film, so that everything is fine, it's a real shame he kills bad for wide IMDb voters.

I'm sorry, but to ask a 6-year-old child to outdo Dustin Hoffman as Rainman requests can not be in the movie. <br /> <br /> Moving past this minor complaint, the movie has the best of the many films buddy road trip, CON-game character as a friendly party-animal (Party-bird?), Disney, as humor for young and old, etc. What's not to like? Shalhoub is its role as a pair of comfortable jeans. It is normal for him, it seems. ( "I'm Russian ... I like long stories.) I do not like mango, but it almost makes me want to go out and buy.

I do, however, admit that he is happy moment colors my review «. Paulie» I was on a road trip during a major heat air conditioning car died, half the restaurant was dead cooling (as did our hotel), and I said. "let's watch a movie, employing air-Conde itioning. "So we did. So for 100 minutes, we were cooled, amused, and given the heart-warming experience.
