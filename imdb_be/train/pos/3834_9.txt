Great movie! Slow: YES <br /> <br /> ... but the original, deeply atmospheric, dark and terrible, totally surreal (feels like a nightmare) <br /> <br /> I would compare it to David Lynch .. ( eraserhead, Inland empire, Blue Velvet) style can be mixed with a small amount of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (insects!). Also some Jodorowsky (Fando in Lis) .... <br /> <br /> Add Night on Earth, Angel Heart and a little bit of the only begotten, Pi, (it would be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) Jacob's Ladder, Barker Forbidden and Salome - ., which should form together with at least the concept of dark night ... NUIT noir <br /> <br /> If you're avantegardistic and / or surrealist cinema (like me) you're going to like this. If you expect anything else, like a movie, full of action with some average plot - try your luck with something <br /> <br /> The final word: The plot is very, very strange and unusual, and it is probably #. 1 reason why most people who do not appreciate this film hate.
