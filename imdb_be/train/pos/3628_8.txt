The film was a lot of basic family values ​​and love. He expressed human emotions and was an inspiring story. The script was clear (it was very easy to understand, making it ideal for children) and was nice and humorous time. Were charged several characters to search. Cinematography were acceptable. There was no sense of experience that many filmmakers did today (which opened quietly getting a little warn out). He was obviously filmed, but was a nice soft quality. Although the editing could have been done better, I thought it was a good movie for the family to enjoy. And the organization of information was just thrown at you that was something I did not want to, but overall it was a good movie.
