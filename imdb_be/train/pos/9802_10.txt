First, I have always been a supporter of the cartoons of Batman, because the theme is so universal, "that all living things have an alter-ego. This is true in the mystery of Batwoman. While the overall story is good, I was disappointed that they have not really done a lot for the franchise with this. <br /> <br /> throughout the film, you are trying to find out who the identity of Batwoman, unfortunately you can learn, easy to look at the plaster of loans placed on this website (so if you have not seen it does not go there). I was kind of disappointed that they do not fi lm more. 75 minutes is too short for any film. The secret identity of Batwoman also comes too early in the film, as it were, in the middle, and becomes an anti-climatic later, because you know that the good guys always win, and that a new character known as Batwoman will disappear after the movie ended. <br /> <br /> I'm not very sure about the new style of animation that is used in this film. I love the sleek new characters, but there should be a few more details, where the item is called for. Some of the animations look so awkward and brutal that it grabs your attention immediately diverts your attention away from the main storyline. I do not really like the bright atmosphere used in most scenes, he seems to lose its dark and gothic feeling Batman. Similarly, we have got to learn more about Batwoman identity, so that we can build the same deep sense of compassion, what we do with Bruce Wayne. In addition, I think that the fight against Bane had to do better. In a typical children's fashion bad guy meets his demise too easily either by disconnecting, giving, receiving or electricuted do something dumb that works against them. Let's think about this was not even a single drop of blood spilled in this film too. <br /> <br /> As a result of its good entertaining movie and I recommend to anyone a fan of Batman to watch it. He has a good storyline, universal appeal and even more incumbent on top. I just wish that they could cause a permanent change in the history of making Batwoman stay to make things more interesting. Do not just enter it and then push it off once she did. I would also like to see someone find out the secret to change at last. In order to have any other than Batman solve the mystery and fill it later with the details. <br /> <br /> I hope more animated films to come and look forward to the moment when we will actually be able to see the decay between Bruce Wayne and Barbra up. He was stringing it all together, and do not even like her, and I can not believe that she was stupid enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older. I also want to see the time, when Tim Drake takes, because he was sick of the old. In short, I want to see all the things that have led the characters to where they will be in Batman Beyond. Otherwise, the same formula will be repeated just finish it faster than if they had simply decided to move on with the story. <br /> <br />
