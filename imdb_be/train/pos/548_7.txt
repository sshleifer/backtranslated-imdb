This film was as good as some other westerns made by Anthony Mann and James Stewart as a Winchester 73 and Naked Spur, and much better than the Thunder Bay and bend. The film begins as an ordinary Western, but it is becoming more difficult as it goes forward. It starts with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan, arriving in Seattle, and Stewart is accused of murder. He was acquitted, but the cattle stolen by a corrupt judge. Stewart then agrees to keep something, but I forgot what it is, but Stuart only care about making his cattle back. As the movie goes along it as Stuart cares only about himself as well as his character in the Naked spurs. It gets much better on halfway after they arrive in Alaska. This is one of the best westerns Stewart.
