I could not help but comment after reading a very short "Not bad" comment. This film is much better than not bad. Actions are stellar, even the children in the cast, who do not play nice, or anything else, but to act as well as friends of my son. The film is intelligent and expects the audience to be as well. The back flush dual storylines are imaginative and contribute to the story, not to act as a temporary filler. I watched this movie with my kids, and then I watched it again myself in a few days. If you have children, and sick to death of the films that inspire diabetic coma with their sweetness, and then check the "hole". My 6-year-old enjoyed it as much as my 11-year-old, and my husband and I enjoyed it as much as the two of them. How many movies can you say that about?
