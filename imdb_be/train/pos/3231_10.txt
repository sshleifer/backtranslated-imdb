The soldier is not a great film, and all that it has hated a lot of good reasons. But I liked Soldier much, partly because my expectations were so low that I saw surprised me. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the art direction is tight and well executed. As far as science fiction backs go, soldier does things with a design that is 90% of the genre. Set, costumes and props were consistent and well-formed; I do not like all of their future military style, but I was struck by the effort. For me, it made the movie worth the time it took to look at. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I am a supporter of Kurt Russell. I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable films of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive, and his films of John Carpenter. Soldiers, in fact, action, and the role of Sergeant Todd is the main character action. It is not the role of the award, but collects up to Kurt convincing emotions with very little dialogue. <br /> <br /> Third, the fight scenes and well-choreographed battle. This is not the iron monkey, or even die, but then again, it is much higher than the average level of quality in the genre. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen him, you love fantasy fighters pick it up, if you pass on your rental depot choice. Just do not wait for the next BladeRunner.
