I'm a huge fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. And I really enjoyed this flick. I enjoyed here is much more than I do with other summer blockbusters. <br /> <br /> It's funny hearing people criticize this film with the bases as "lame story" and "it is much rougher than the show." Remembers ANYONE rude humor in the pilot episode? Daisy makes incest joke and Bo says that Luke probably fathered half the children in the orphanage. The only reason it has been emptied, because it changed the interval previously. <br /> <br /> As far as the story goes. It was the perfect story Dukes. In fact, as the remake of it it is likely to remain accurate to the source material than any TV show that has migrated to the big screen. <br /> <br /> While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville entirely accurate as their small adaptations, they do a great job and work very well together. I was not too keen on Bert Boss Hogg, though. And I would like a little more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the film, Roscoe bit ... scary. <br /> <br /> And who has not had a smile on their face, as the General Lee of the race through the streets of Atlanta and back roads of Hazzard <? br /> <br /> The people afford to enjoy the film, which is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikini and pursuits, you will not regret. It's just a big dumb movie!
