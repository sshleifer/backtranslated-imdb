This is very helpful when one is familiar with the culture and the time period in which the film takes place. First of all, these houses are not Geisha, they Ojra (prostitutes) in Yoshiwara type of "green buildings", about 1860, give or take ..

The film deals with issues of loyalty, love, and perhaps most importantly, how people deal with adversity, both their own and that of others in their immediate environment. This is outrageous, plus photos with hauntingly beautiful music, makes for a wonderful trip. Just plug it in, to suspend disbelief and enter into their world. You will not be disappointed.
