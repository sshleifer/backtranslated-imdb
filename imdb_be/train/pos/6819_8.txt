I found «Time At The Top» entertaining and stimulating experience. Action, while generally not brilliant, it was quite acceptable, and sometimes very good. As the film is clearly aimed at a younger demographic, it is certainly one of the best works in the genre (Children's Sci-Fi). Normally, I would say that Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia produce the best movies and TV shows for children, and "the time of the top" does nothing to discount this theory! I do not think a lot of action and continuity are important for young people. A good story and a creative scenario is much more important to them. Both are found in abundance in this film. The special effects are good, without being distracted from the story, or close the viewer by their own imaginations. It would be very easy to give excessive load SFX in this film, but it would be completely destroyed all of its "raison d'être". <br /> <br /> settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this film, and complement the beautiful clothes and historical accuracy. Overall, this film is very satisfactory, and I recommend it to all the spectators, who can see the world through the eyes of children, or those who are trying, like me! Now, I really have to read the original book as soon as possible.
