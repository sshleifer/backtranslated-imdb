Scientist working desperately lonely finds a way to find a meteor impact crater, which has a new radioactive element. All (pseudo) science and technology breakthrough talks about the 1930s right up there, including the idea that radioactivity can cure any disease, if properly harnessed. If he calls his opponents -Who threw him out of the scientific community and derided it - pay their discovery, they offer a "joint" expedition to Africa ... of course, they end up stealing a lot of others. The initial discovery of the NIA, giving him only the balance of the loan. In addition to this, an effeminate weakling, which is similar to the supporting comedy actor of the worst Abbott and Costello (Lawton) literally steals Dr. young trophy wife HP (Drake), who falls head over heels for this piece of human. Advancing horns like a deer was not about to make dr. Movement (Karloff) any friendlier, so he goes on a clandestine mission of revenge ... Kill 2 enemies and friendly others. Bennett (Lugosi), the only one who helped him ... finally succumbing to the deadly radiation, which allowed him to get his revenge, to start with, but (to my very dissatisfied) spared the harlot and that poor excuse for a human being, she married. Acting mainly good, with Karloff and Lugosi was very good. Check hysterical housekeeper scene ... Other characters are not worth mentioning ... it is recommended, as well as all the old Universal horror ...
