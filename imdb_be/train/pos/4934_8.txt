"Panic on the streets" is quite unknown small film from director Elia Kazan and was taken to his classical masterpieces such as "A Streetcar Named Desire," "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden." Kazan has already won an Oscar in 1947, before the film, so he was not entirely unknown at the time. Nevertheless, the "Panic in the Streets", mainly film, which took place under the radar. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this film is the Oscar winning script. It has a very good concept and its perfect tense thriller material sniff crime / film noir elements. The dialogue in this film is absolutely gorgeous and gives the film a sense of reality and accuracy. <br /> <br /> Cast quite unclear (especially at the time it was released), but it still shows Mostel and Jack Palance in one of his first roles in the movie. Particularly impressive Palance as a tough gangster boss with a very powerful looking face. <br /> <br /> However, the film drags a bit at some point. The film begins with a very good, but after the beginning of the film slows down and does not always make the right decisions in terms of the tempo and the point of view of the story is told with. <br /> <br /> However, the "Panic in the street" is very watchable film, mainly because of its solid script and a powerful dialogue that makes the film believable one to watch. For fans of the genre thriller is a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
