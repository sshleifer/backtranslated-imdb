This movie is definitely cute I have seen in a long time! Excellent animation and magical characters (even the bad guys are cute!) Make this one overall winner in my book, as well as in the books of those whom I have seen it. I still want to see him again, but there was no time. Better than Toy Story, which was nice, but it's not good.
