In general, do not even come close to the sum of its parts. No problem. This film shows the line of some of the most diverse creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast. Segments invented around the same theme, "Love in Paris", but the similarity ends. In fact, given that the approach to the subject of all these different directors takes so many forms, it is amazing that we can even feel that we still look the same film. No great effort was made to turn it into a coherent whole. This table has so many wonderful ingredients, I'm glad that no one was trying to put them all in one dish.
