This film has a special way to tell a story, at first I found it quite strange as he jumped through time, and I had no idea what was going on. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the story line was simple though, but still very real and touching. You met someone for the first time you fell in love completely, but finally broke up and promoted the death agony. Who does not go through with it? but we will never forget this kind of pain in our lives. <br /> <br /> I would say I'm more touched as two actors showed a great performance, showing love between the characters. I just want to make history could be a happy ending.
