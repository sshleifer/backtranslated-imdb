Edmund Burke said that "all evil needs well for me to do nothing." Hollywood often gives us garbage, because it lacks the family goes to see quality films. This film was an inspiring story of loss and recovery of faith. He did not have any violence, any improper conduct, and does not deserve a PG rating. West landscape was filmed well, and some of the prospects were simply breathtaking. The actors were a little young for their parts, but otherwise plausible and talented. Music score was too loud, and in some places completely drowned out the dialogue. I am rarely surprised endings of movies anymore, but I was pleasantly surprised by this. Sometimes the good guys win, and they will benefit from an honest effort. We liked this film, and a message, and would recommend it for the whole family.
