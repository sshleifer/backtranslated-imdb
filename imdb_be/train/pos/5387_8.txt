Even in the 21st century, childbirth is dangerous: women have miscarriages and give birth prematurely. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. That is, the theme of "Life Begins": look at "severe cases" maternity ward. Loretta Young has played a leading role, a woman brought here from prison (what crime she committed is not related to the plot) to give birth; it is contrary to the fact that she will have to give it to the child after birth. She's in the room with several other women who share their joys and pain with each other. <br /> <br /> While Loretta Young is a leading, outstanding performance, as usual, put in Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of the «B» Women Warner in 1930, showing quite a bit in a supporting role, and sometimes getting the lead in B movies (Farrell played Torchy Blane in several stages in the B-movie «Torchy» series.) There Farrell plays the future a mother who does not want their children, since they will only get in the way. She does everything she can get in and drink like a fish, the way nurses, including the smuggling of liquor into the chamber (this is, of course, during Prohibition days) - apparently, they have never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome ago in the 30s <br /> <br /> it is interesting that, unlike the majority of films in the early 1930s, it is not women are clumsy idiots interfering heroic men. - that the situation is reversed, with expectant fathers being mounds quivering jelly. (Watch out for the old character actor Frank McHugh as one of the prospective parents.) "Life Begins" as early Talkie, treats the subject with a fair spoon melodrama, to be sure, but it is a magical little film. Turner Classic show this, although rarely; I've only seen the show a few days in honor of Loretta Young. But it is highly recommended viewing, when he will appear.
