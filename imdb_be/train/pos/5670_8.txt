Esther Williams gets his first post MGM major role and finished <br /> <br /> to a good start. This film is well-acted entertainment unknown <br /> <br /> a constant theme that will be repeated a million times more. <br /> <br /> in the future - an innocent girl has passed a terrible woman hater. Esther <br /> <br /> looks great, and if she wants to, probably could go on <br /> <br /> do more and better films, but her autobiography, <br /> <br /> largely refused to work for marriage. In any case, she <br /> <br /> nice and participation that it's fun to see her in a completely different role <br /> <br /> The outer part of the "musical voyage." Universal was incredible for <br /> <br /> to make films with the former MGM stars after beginning the studio <br /> <br /> dropping their big names, he began to slide down the hill. Stars <br /> <br /> Lana Turner, June Allyson and others have to make films, as a first course <br /> <br /> into a universal, since they are obviously still drawing power <br /> <br /> ticketing. I would like Esther did more, but since she did not do it <br /> <br /> makes this one all the more special.
