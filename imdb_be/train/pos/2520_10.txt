Despite what others have said (* cough *), this is my favorite movie of all time. I do not know how long I've been waiting to see him, but when I finally, I immediately fell in love. Of course, it's strange, but it only gives it more exciting flavor. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of the first Gackt and Hyde movie. They did not do very much at all, maybe 3 or 4 vertices of each of them. So, give them credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best in the first day. I believe that they throw a strange situation there, but I look over to find the best moments of the film, the emotions are recorded and whatnot. So I gave, and will always give this movie 10 out of 10.
