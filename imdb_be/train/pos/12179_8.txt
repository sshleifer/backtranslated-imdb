I happened to watch this movie by chance a few days ago while flipping channels. My expectations were not very high, but it was an interesting movie.In «A Guy Thing», Jason Lee plays Paul, a Puritan, Seattle guy who is going to marry his fiancée, Karen (Selma Blair), and settle on unchallenging life of middle-class thrift. We first met with Paul at his bachelor party, where he professes no desire to engage in any normal activity of the bachelor type it (surprisingly few) friends support, if he's a bit mischievous and gets into a hot mess around with his soon-to-be trouble and strife. Of course, the next thing Paul knows that this morning after the night before, he was in bed with a naked hula dancer, and his mother-in-law phones to inform him that Karen is on her way again. Oh, and a hula dancer Karen's cousin Becky (Julia Stiles). <br /> <br /> From this small acorn potential problems grows a mighty oak hectic tribulations as Paul scrabbles from adventure to failure, trying to conceal what he had done while at the foot of the appearance of being obedient, focused on the family good Man, that is super-excited about his upcoming wedding. His efforts to bring Karen does not leave any wiser about any potential wrongdoing on its part, ironically, it makes Paul's closer to the fun-loving Becky, forcing him to question whether he really wants a life that seems to have been planned for him film contains the correct the combination of comedy and romance. Definitely worth a look.
