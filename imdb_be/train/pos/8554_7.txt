Wow, it was yet another spin on the original American Pie, is not as good as the camp area, but certainly much better than the naked mile. Dwight Stifler and Eric lead comedy in this, but I actually prefer the dialogue in this one on the naked mile. The script was written a lot better and the comedy flowed smoothly, but most of the comedy comes from sex, but that's okay, because that's why we are seeing these films anyway is not it? <br /> <br /> Dwarf Rock also had a very good cameo, given the intense effort given to him in a bare mile, his scene with Stifler was strange and made me laugh my ass off when I saw him. <, Br /> <br /> film a definite improvement in my sight, as compared with bare mile, if you enjoyed the previous films of the American pie, you have to, as in the hostel if you do not watch all the American sector spin-off spending money .
