With "Twelve Monkeys," you have to pay attention, but if you do, you will probably find a lot to appreciate. I know what I did. The history is interesting and has to do with time travel. The virus has killed a lot of people, even in 1997, and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back in 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990, he was arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), which probably has something to do with this virus. It is also responsible psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), who does not believe him in 1990 when Cole disappears from a mental hospital until he is chained and locked in a room and reappears in 1996, Catherine begins to believe the history of Cole. <, Br /> <br /> film constantly plays with time. Cole makes a phone call and leave a message in 1996, he picked up in the future, and "they" are sending someone. For Cole, that someone is just seconds after the phone call. These things, as it happens throughout the film, and so you need to keep the attention. You can ask a few questions, but since you do not have to answer yourself, it is better to negotiate with the film. <br /> <br /> works "Twelve Monkeys," as science fiction, with some great designs and a dark atmosphere, and it works like a thriller. You are never sure what will happen next, and it helps the movie. Maybe it has some flaws in the story, but, since we are talking about fictional things like a trip back in time, you have to take what the film tells us, and just trying to enjoy it. It was easy for me.
