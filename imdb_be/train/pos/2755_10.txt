When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a typical "love your neighbor" stuff .... The more the film takes place, the more I got involved. Great acting from both actors, direction was large, unusual story. I am crying eyes off for the first time in my life the film. A real must in any serious videoteque. 11 of 10
