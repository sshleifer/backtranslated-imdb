If you ever wondered why they do not do porn with a plot to watch Dream Quest. On the one hand, you have to give Armstrong credit for the creation of an effort to capitalize on this idea, and to use such a strong adult throwing a name to put power behind it. On the other hand, it also quickly becomes clear why most porns never more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue leading to sex scenes together. These people simply can not act (and history, unfortunately, is limping to the ridiculous extent). <br /> <br /> However, I gave it a 7 because it was a good try, and there did not seem to be a lot of effort to cut corners. In addition, I would like to see more attempts like this one. Maybe someday I will see a wonderful combination of porn and plot.
