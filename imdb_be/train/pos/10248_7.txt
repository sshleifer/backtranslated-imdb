I first heard about this movie after buying 1976 flowlines «Snuff». I was told that the Devil experiment was much better, so, naturally, I went ahead and ordered the box set Guinea Pig. I was very interested to hear what Charlie Sheen left trying to ban the film or a second or so my interest peaked. <br /> <br /> Devil's Experiment short film, with no history, no development of character, only 3 men tortured a woman for about 45 minutes. They tortured her in many ways how to beat her, spinning in circles again and again, forcing her to drink alcohol, causing her to listen to the hi-pitched noise for 24 hours to break her arm with a hammer, burning and put maggots on burns, throwing intestine on it, and eventually thrust sharp needle therethrough eye. <br /> <br /> I must say that a lot of this film was a fake, being beaten scene. But then, some of them are really well done, as you cash. The scene in which the woman is now spinning around in circles makes me dizzy to look at. Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to harsh noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. Worst of all eye scene. I do not shutter while viewing it and just thought, "Damn, that looks pretty good for such a low budget film." I really enjoyed the flick, but I do not know if I can recommend it if you have not seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10
