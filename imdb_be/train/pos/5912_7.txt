Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> «Coonskin» is a film one and only Ralph Bakshi, reportedly, a satirical exposure of black actors and film negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at life in black America today (in the modern during the day, I mean - 1975). Paramount threw it like a hot potato that just burst into flames. <br /> <br /> But this film Bakshi, controversial, exciting, and be sure to see almost by definition alone. Not just another random "shock-jock" from the film, which is trying to shock for shock. It Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if he made the film, he has something big to say ... <br /> <br /> While it's roots are based on cheap black actors, «Coonskin» this is not just another mannerism knock- from the dominant white film or any kind of single-clicking. «Coonskin» wants to be more. His goal is to fry sights higher and some a lot more fish. <br /> <br /> The film is not just mock the genre. It is also not only accuses a black man, but in fact, seems to show the love, beauty and heart in the most unexpected places. <br /> <br /> «Coonskin» tells the story with some convicts awaiting prison breakouts. The fact that it is at all possible to break out of prison in «Coonskin» world only makes it old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> One of the prisoners is about a trio of black brothers in Harlem named Brother Bear, Brer Rabbit, Fox | Preacher, who want respect, and part of the action and are ready to get it by any means. Itallian crowd runs all the real action <br /> <br /> The famous black musicians star :. Barry White and Scatman Crothers, and Charles Gordon, the first black playwright to take home a Pulitzer. Something big is happening here, obviously. <br /> <br /> The film plays out as a descent into this world, this side of the racial section. By malicious, hips, deep, soulful black man with hatred in his heart and a gun in his hand. <br /> <br /> Bakshi films you never know the meaning of the word «sublety.» It looks like he had never heard of the word. But it may be subject, as required by extremism. Real anvil satire. Some items can not be solved softly. <br /> <br /> Bakshi merciless god dammed. Here, not a single member or a minority of the Harlem scene appears healthy. <br /> <br /> characters are "animated" in the "real" all depending on the mood and the situation there. Cartoon characters people and all of them share the same reality and are intended only to be taken literally. <br /> <br /> Bakshi never simply show the ugly cartoons just for shock. He always has something to say. Not a black person wrongly. Here, in contrast to Spike Lee's "fooled," it seems that he will use it to try and do something to say. <br /> <br /> As well as 99.9% of the Bakshi film, this one includes an animation and live action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki not just be a trick here. All these techniques are all connected to each other, the clutch together, saying something. <br /> <br /> anyway, this man feels inevitably dated. Many of these types of films (Bakshi inclusive) is very relevant, very tremens. They reflect a certain tendency for the day, but a review ayuchysya back with them years later, there is only an unmistakable sense of nostalgia (as an eternal truth). <br /> <br /> Although the music, clothes, slang, and so the city is clearly looks like the pictures that belong in a capsule time, attitude, spirit, and heart can not remain the same, regardless of the fact that I -. king ear is anyone who actually saw the movie, state of affairs and was in the company of people know what I'm talking <br /> <br /. > Even some of the black characters rabbit (junglebunny), bear a large Ol »and foxes. One of the most acidic and questionable racist symbols Harlem dirty cop who is hot on the trail of the "dirty n ----- s" after the death of a police officer. But this is not just a business for him. It is also for the rest of the brothers wearing the shield. It's just pure sadistic pleasure racist touch black. <br /> <br /> The sequences involving Godfather and his lady is one of the most moving parts of the film as a whole, of which there are many. It plays out like an opera or ballet <br /> <br /> promo line :. WARNING: "This film offends everyone" This is not just hype. Proceed with extreme caution. <br /> <br /> You have been warned ... <br /> <br /> Dane Youssef
