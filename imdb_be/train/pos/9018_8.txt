Despite the low-key release in the country, as well as blatant disregard for other countries (the rating «R» in the United States did not help - it is fair, just because HBC uses the C-word), it really is a fine piece of work. Sentimental at times threatens to strangle him, but this is overcome by designated game two. <br /> <br /> It is easy to win applause just because you play a physical or mental cripple (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, and so on), and Bonham Carter can not fully capture the physical degradation MND but her vocals stretching and emotional ruthless drive to compensate fully. In fact, almost all of its implementation is carried out through her eyes (and eyes!). This clever twist on the actress, who quickly unbuttoning her reputation as an English rose, and is formed as a figure of some growth. Awards must surely follow, although, unfortunately, not for this wonderful work. <br /> <br /> Branagh, one feels, is never enough, given his best film (with the possible exception of "Hamlet", and his game has been diluted with a large cast). Here, however, he leads both his performance playing on the handle itself loathing, unstable eventually, attractive guy, he does not always appear with the subtlety and detects both the intelligence and depth. In short, we believe it, just as we could not believe it, like Frankenstein, as a priest in "The Proposal", as a lawyer in "The Gingerbread Man", even as Andrew in "Peter's Friends". This is definitely his best performance yet - why, he could not produce the goods much earlier <br /> <br /> In the film, it's more like a television sacrifice, and without their stars will probably not be? very. But it was nice to see that this pair performs their socks like this, and I look forward to them (though not "Love's Labor's Lost" ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC receive 10 out of 10.
