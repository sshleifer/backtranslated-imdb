Geniuses William Cameron Menzies and HG Wells craft this unusual timing of the film, with the ambition and scope is hard to find today. They predict the Second World War and the way the UK has been attacked, and the fact that the war will be followed by space race. They change the timing; in the film War and space exploration much more, but there are a lot of quality right thing, it's weird. We even see a helicopter (the film over them) <br /> <br /> unforgettable futuristic aircraft giant and meritocracy scientists who seem Romans with bubble helmets. And if you can see through these funny costumes, you can evaluate the state of the art architectural masters from the 30s, the vision of wells from a rationalist society, interesting reflections on the nature of power, and John Cabal as the archetype of the enterprising and inventive people, the one who chooses the form of reality and not be in the form of them. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 to 10 inspiring as this last monologue John conspirators.
