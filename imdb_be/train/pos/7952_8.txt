This is one of my favorite family films. I liked very much when I was little, and it still holds me now, when I'm older. I still laugh at the same old jokes and can even shed a tear again. I've never much cared for the animals talk, or at the very least, the UN animated ones, but this one I'm going to stand on. This is quite an old film, but he will always have a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> There's no live animals of films that I can think of at the moment when I could even compete with, not to mention how much like this one. I could give too much praise in this film, but I do not think the show. I really keeps that great message that "Home is where the heart is." Or at least that's the message I got from him. Definitely recommended for a good old family movie night.
