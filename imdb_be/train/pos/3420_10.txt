This film is a must see movie for everyone. Congress should see this true documentary from the perspective of a soldier, as well as all in America. The previous reviewer has completely missed the point - the point is to uncover the truth about training our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists, but are simply living in our territory, "the enemy", and what it does for men. We need to support our troops by bringing them home immediately to another person was killed or wounded. It also shows that the government does not help his veterans, those injured mentally ptsd- with post-traumatic stress disorder, either physically, with the loss of limbs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
