Often only after the pass few years, we can look back and see the stars, which are really the stars. As the French critic, whose name escapes me, he said: "There is no Garbo There Dietrich There is only Louise Brooks .."; and, thank God, Louise Brooks This is the third of its European masterpieces, but it is also an exceptional film as!. one, if not the first French radio station, the next script, written by the famous Ren√© Clair, reportedly completes (the direction that is) Georg Pabst, and to enable voice of Edith Piaf before she was well known! So much talent to work and in the film, but it could turn out to be a masterpiece! And that is what this . Elm It's a shame Louise Brooks blackballed by Hollywood when she returned to the United States - so much talent to mold so arrogant on the sidelines in the film, in the annex to getting to watch Louise Brooks in action, it's great to see the pictures of Paris ca. 1930 and hear a young voice Piaf. I never get tired of this movie!
