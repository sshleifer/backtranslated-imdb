No other movie made me feel like this before ... and I do not feel bad. Like, I do not want my money back or the time that I've been waiting to see this movie (9 months), and I do not feel bad about using two hours on a sunny summer day to watch this ______. So I say, "_____" because no matter how much I destroy my brain, I just can not think of a word in any of seven languages, the film to summarize. I have no idea what's going on all the time, and halfway through the movie I need to rest. No film has ever done that to me before. Never have in my life, I would like cauliflower, milk and baguettes a lot. Thank you. - Ed <br /> <br /> Uh. * Clears throat * no words. No thoughts. I do not know. I really do not know. - Kate
