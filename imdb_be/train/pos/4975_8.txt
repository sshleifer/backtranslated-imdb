I swear to God, it's been a long time since I've seen it. Probably about 18 years ago? <br /> <br /> The film tells (children) all of human blood and circulatory system. Very professionally put together - Disney style of animation, as well as human actors - he was sent to Frank Capra, for Pete's sake <br /> <br /> View overkill !. I wonder if the very high cost of production is worth what is past filmstrips of information on the human body? But boy, these kids look up to know it: even now I remember clearly, Dr. Baxter challenged himself Nemo call that common material is more reminiscent of human blood to a doctor immediately responds "seawater."
