This stirring Western spins the story of a famous rifle early west, which was a welcome one and all. James Stewart is a cowboy who wins the prized Winchester in a firefight, only to lose it in the robbery. History details the persecution Stewart rifle and a specific person through the film. Rifle changes hands, over and over again, as if the owner is doomed to lose it by violence. The picture has a lot of action and suspense, Stuart closed his career. A large cast of supporting Stewart here, namely, Stephen McNally, the Duryea Dan, Millard Mitchell, John McIntyre and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters, seems here and miscast purpose of her role is quite featureless. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, Smoothie teenagers in recent years, have short, but good roles.
