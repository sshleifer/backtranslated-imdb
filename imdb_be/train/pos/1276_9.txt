I love this movie. Noir imagery combined with Spillane on Sun nonsense character Mike Hammer works wonderfully to create a mood and a feeling of rare in low-budget detective films in the early fifties. It can not be "The Maltese Falcon", but this film makes its own contribution to this hard in the genre. Spillane is often criticized for alleged misogyny, etc., but the "ladies" are way ahead of their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. Poor old Mike Hammer as effectively played Biff Elliot, blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist, whom he met when investigating the death of an army buddy. If penalties finally gives his face a picture. Good to see that 50 years of censorship did not make famous filmmakers omitted the last line. Conscientious low budget classic.
