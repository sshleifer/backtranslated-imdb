Artimisia was late last night. At first I did not think I would, but seeing that I do not feel I was still asleep and did not, I went to look and feel intrigued by the young Artimisia, virgin, clean and warm. Her love affair with an older Tassi envoked known senses. Despite the fact that the film is based on a very romantisised level, rather than the reality, I liked it a lot more than usual biographys or costume drama. Big game, big camerashots, great music and lyrics. I loved him, and I want more of it! :-)
