I saw this film in Winnipeg recently - it is appropriate, given the location of use. The first time I read a book by Lawrence back to the 70th year, and for me it has always been a very powerful picture of the aging tests in our society. It resonates when I was young, and even more so now it resonates. When the movie came out, I was interested to see if the story would survive. and I was completely amazed, especially with the performance of Ellen Burstyn in. She manages to give us a complete human being, even if the character is generally cranky and willful - someone that you do not want to live. It's great to be able to see your favorite characters come to life so authentically.
