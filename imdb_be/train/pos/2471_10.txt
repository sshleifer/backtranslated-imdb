I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching it, but I had a book with me and Shakespeare could follow the dialogue through it. My view on the film can be partially offset, as I had never read the play, but I pulled in the grip of this film. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers who ever lived and the story of Hamlet is certainly one of his best achievements. <br /> <br /> But now in the movies ... <br /> <br /> I have found that all the actors in the movie had a solid understanding of what they were saying, and thus have been able to formulate it good enough. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and King. The thing I liked about it was that it worked very well as "MOVIE", and not as a game, you are studying. You do not have to be rich to Shakespeare treat everything Misery farm must undergo. I would recommend this film to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> It has two cents.
