I second the motion to do that in a movie, it would be great !! I was also struck by the plot and the character of construction in this game. I played it over and over again (over 20 times), just to try something different, and it's becoming more and more interesting every time. Final Fantasy eat your heart out !! This should be in the movie !!!!! If anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to do it in the movies, please contact me. I would like to help with this project any day. Graphics great for PS1 and even make you forget it's PS1 most of the time. Many side quests make it different every time games.
