I saw this film at the film festival in Vancouver film and thought it was deadly smart, stylish and FUNNY. <br /> <br /> Cast been ROCK SOLID. Great job Carey Ann Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connell and up and comer, Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> Terrible, I thought about the film within a few days after seeing it. <, Br /> <br /> Writers Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak, Andrew Currie layers many political overtones - but not strong blow on the head with it <br /> <br /> in the world, they created had depth ,. and it made sense. There frivolous greedy spirit of the film. <br /> <br /> FIDO guaranteed cure strife. <br /> <br /> It is like !!!
