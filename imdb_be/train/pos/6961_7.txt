The name caught my attention, and then I thought, what will come in the story, as we have seen so many "super-human" films in those years ... and actually, I liked it, since there are a number of unusual funny scenes I did not expect. Uma Thurman is performed on average as G-Girl. Surprisingly, I was again able to watch her fingers in a wide screen (for example, at the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson, however, very well played idiot everyday guy who is responsible for most women, I could really get into his situation. If you want a light touch of fun, you should definitely watch the adventures of Matt average G-Girl and especially to encourage your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
