Worn Ann & Andy is the first movie I ever saw in theaters. My dad took my sister and I, and the funny thing - when we returned home, my father asked us "what you want to do?" And we said that we want to look Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theater to see it again - at least, as I remember. I was five years old at the time. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty scary for five years on. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets and hypnotic camel scene .. I do not remember much of the film, of course, the beginning was magical, and several scenes - I would like to find it again, and will most likely look for it now. <br /> <br /> I remember that I loved Raggedy Ann & Andy.
