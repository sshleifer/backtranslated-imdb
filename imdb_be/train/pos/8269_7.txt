I was intrigued by this film for some time, partly because of the extremely high rating here on IMDb - 9,0 with an average of more than 300 votes, giving him the highest rating of any available silent film! As I had not heard of this film before this site? Well, you can not always trust the ratings. It's actually a very good film, preserved very well, if the fine transfer VHS I rented some sign - perfectly operates on the principles, especially William Haynes, like Brown, and good location work in Cambridge with some subtle actions of personnel in Naivysočajšij Harvard football / yale - but the story must have seemed gray chestnut, even in 1926, unpleasant and charismatic self-centered guy goes to school and gets to put in his place, becoming in the process of caring, selfless friend; I doubt that people in 1926 found a lot that was very interesting in the last few reels predictability factor is high. However, it starts very well and certainly deserves to be remembered, if not offered up to the skies. Maybe the previous 350 voters, mostly from Harvard people ... <br /> <br /> Edit Currently, more than 600 voters and assessment actually rose to 9.2! Seriously, people, bulletins filling there are occurring - I defy anyone to explain why this is the best movie than "Metropolis" or "General"!
