Surprisingly interesting reflection on the nature of regret in terms of how it relates to paranoia. There's a lot going on in it, because the execution time of 74 minutes, but it works. In a panic, very thin, not abrupt reduce panic that how to settle the most recent Asian horror movies. The way the "scares" are configured similarly disturbing moments in "Wedding Crashers" (aka 4 Inyong shiktak, director Su-Leon Lee), but it's not nearly to the same caliber. The film does a good job of balancing the classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychologically. It is not perfect, but it's not what he should do. I would recommend to check it out if you get the chance.
