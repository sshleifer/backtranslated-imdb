"Tintin and I", first of all I was struck, as a masterpiece of documentary films. Shooting and editing is really exciting (almost anti-Dogma). <br /> <br /> We're going for the life of Tintin Hergé box through frank interviews with 1971 Tintin series was shown in the background of great ideological battles of the twentieth century. At the height of the Hergé have their own demon to fight, and a great part of his drawing activity seems to attempt to tame them and to leave the world of perfection. <br /> <br /> While there are spectacular panoramic photographic image of Tintin albums, and several reconstructions and reading excerpts from the album, Hergé story is told entirely through interviews and archival materials, and never through reconstruction. <br /> <br /> Hergé lived a violent life of true suffering artist. But the fantasy world that has come his imagination again and will continue to surprise readers again.
