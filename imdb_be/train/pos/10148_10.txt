I would give this film a few stars, simply because it was the «Lifetime» Presentation actually filmed in the place shown in the story - here in New York. Most of this channel, or "install" out there in the Iowa countryside, Oregon, Virginia, Los Angeles, etc., taken in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or any other Canadian areas. <br /> <br /> But if ever there was one worthy of the highest rating - 10 * on this site, this is the movie. Of course, it not for the originality of the story has been done many times, in many variations, with several very similar to this particular one. This was also done quite often on the big screen, with mega-stars of past and present, from Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, and others - and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan, and more. I think that, at least, 10-12, as well as well-known in the past to present, from the top of my head, which would be added to our time, and probably many more that can be brought to mind . <br /> <br /> I do not hoot, but my point is that, in my opinion, this is definitely one of the best of this genre I have seen. I caught him by chance in the middle of the day on Friday, at a time when I was a TV just because I took a couple of hours after a particularly hectic week. I've never run across this flick in 8 years, since it was made. And while the two wires do enough to be known by most, they were completely unknown to me. Only two actors, which I knew was Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother), I saw some things from her younger days, and Michael Rispoli (Henry's best friend Charlie), which was outstanding, as "Grams" menacing loan juice tough street guy with "tricksters." <br /> <br /> The probability of meeting and the relationship between best friends like leads, as a sub-history of the novel, with the ratio of such them, Anne and Charlie only be opened after all, this is often done plot tricks in the genre, but it does not matter for here (in fact, it enhances it). <br /> <br /> Check some of the other comments, I fully with those who are the most positive agree. The primary word that describes this film engaging, in caps. This adjective describes the performer; symbols; the chemistry between and among all the characters, in any combination are presented, and all the support, and even a minor role <br /> <br /> I love movies with "harder edge" "Rounders," The Fugitive Schwarzenegger / Stallone fare; "Goodfellows;. "even classics like" Casablanca, "" Gone with the wind, "" Citizen Kane. "But for pure, uncomplicated fun, this one was wonderful. From the bare parts of their budgets, it was equal to the results achieved," you Got Mail »and« Sleepless in Seattle "with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could not have done better than Henstridge and Michael Vartan here;. that co-stars and a bslugovvayuchy staff here were equivalent to those in these mega-movies as well.
