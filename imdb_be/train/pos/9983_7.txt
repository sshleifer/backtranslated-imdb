This film is about the essence of human relations and interactions between them. The protagonist is an old lady who at the end of his life begins to travel in the past, making the analysis of the way she lived her life. This trip was precipitated due to the economic crisis and the sons of his intention to put her in a nursing home. This is a very honest look at some of the questions that we all ask ourselves at some point in life, and there are many secondary ideas for discussion in this film, such as a family legacy, true love, marriage, or fate. Although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new, this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance the actors and the characters are very believable, but because of the time may not be fully developed some of the characters. I highly recommend this film for a quiet Saturday afternoon.
