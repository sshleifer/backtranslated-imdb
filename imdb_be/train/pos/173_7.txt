In fact, Goldie Hawn Washington (in this Park, Maryland), but I digress. It's kind of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington type of movie, with some changes, but at the same premises. I taped this film on cable years ago, because I had a huge crush on Goldie Hawn. The history is interesting, but it is very unlikely that any cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government because it saved the lives of some bumps. It made me laugh and made me mad at the same time. It made me laugh, because some of the situations she found herself in a funny way, I had to laugh. (POSSIBILITY Spoiler FWD). It made me think of the mind that our government will establish a normal citizen order it was created. And she did it in the end ... beautiful. Sorry, not many people have the guts, just like in real life.
