This film actually FUNNY! If you want to rest your brain for an hour so, then go ahead and watch it. This is called a blonde and blonde, so do not expect a deep and meaningful jokes. This movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about the two blondes. It's just a funny movie to watch on a date or a group of friends (especially if you're not too sober. Lol) Pamela and Dennis is still pretty hot chicks. It is a mistake to judge the film as a work of art. Come on, it's a movie about blondes! It should be easy, fun and superficial. Another thing, I do not think girls will appreciate and love this movie, but the guy definitely will.
