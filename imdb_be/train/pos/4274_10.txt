Most of the actors are now dead, and they were the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. I understand that this film now Divx and I can have it in your collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> <br /> All of this former Yugoslavia, a melting pot of peoples of the Balkan. This may be a land of dreams, when Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalist Sun to poison the minds of the nation with their sick ideas.
