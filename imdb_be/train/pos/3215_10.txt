It was great. Moving, action-packed and ideal for Kurt Russell. I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars. This film is the story of the old soldier who learns there is more to life than the soldiers, and people who know that there is a time to fight, to be protected. I cried, laughed and basically sat in awe of the story. Good job for writing action flick, and the plot was appropriate and sufficiently rigid. The ending was not tortuous, but it's still great. If you want to get away from New York, or rooting for the underdog, this film is for you. Nha undue amount of gore and violence, it is not difficult to observe in this regard. Something for everyone.
