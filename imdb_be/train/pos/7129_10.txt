This movie was on my wish list for the past ten years, and I just recently found it on DVD, when the grandson of my partner was given to him. He watched and was thrilled to learn that he was talking about my generation - born in 1930 and was evacuated in 1939, and he would like to know more about it - and me. Fortunately, I borrowed from him and watched it on their own, and I cried all through it. Moreover, it is to convey emotion, class difference, adversity and the warmth of human relations of those years (as well as stiffness (spoken and unspoken) ;! But it was as if I, too, with a little anorak when it comes to the ARP form ambulance ( LCC) in the right color (white) and all the army property management bombing sites and the work of the heavy rescue teams. I could not blame all of my memories, and sandbags Anderson shelter and buffets WVS brought it all back. the difference between the relatively undisturbed life in the village and wear down th war London was also sharply presented again I lived 1939/40 and his own evacuation from London with this production! I know that Jack Gold work, of course, and no one would not expect from him more than meticulous details, but it goes far beyond the accurate representation of the facts and touched the deepest chords of the human response, and only half uttered value judgments of those years. Certa was one of the biggest internal high places in John thaw actor's career and the direction of Gold and deserves to be better known. It's a beautiful film, and I've already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends.
