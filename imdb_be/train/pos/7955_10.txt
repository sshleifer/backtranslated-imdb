This is one of the biggest animal-children films ever created. I cry every time I see a shadow shout, "Wait, wait for me, Peter!" As a family car pulls to one side. This is a must see if you love animals! The best movie ever! Line in the movie sometimes silly. For example, if Sassy says Chance; "Rule and dog cat saliva!" Line, as I could do without them, but when I was six years old, I bet I loved that line. The storyline may seem absenteeism of some, but I like it. Shadow, like an old dog, who are preparing the chance to take over for him when he went on a really moving when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog. I think that everyone can find a piece of themselves in «Homeward Bound».
