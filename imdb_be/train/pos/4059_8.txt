The first official Ghibli films Laputa most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but while Nausicaa was an epic SF, this is more action-adventure comedy with a rather weak SF conditions. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour of the film, I thought that I would love it. Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki attention to detail and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in a painstaking, beautiful perfection. Animation, although it is still not in the league later Ghibli film, a little better than in Nausicaa. <br /> <br /> I have already mentioned in my review of Nausicaa, that one character is drawn in more Anime «Lupinesque» style. There are a whole bunch of them are pirates. They provide the comic elements in the film, although quite why he needed an element of the comic I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think that it was better for him. Nevertheless. saying, Dol, a pirate leader, easily the most memorable character in the film (even if it is mostly women Long John Silver. Do not be surprised if you are reminded of "Treasure Planet" at times) and well voiced Leachman in the American dub. <br /> <br /> English voice cast acquitted himself well, for the most part, really. However, something started to go pear-shaped me about this film about midway. I think the best way I could describe it is that the characters are absorbed the enormity of history. I'll come back to that later. <br /> <br /> There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people obviously love him, that I almost feel mean only giving it an 8 out of 10, but the operative word for me is "addicted" . It was more impressive than the person affected, and more than two hours, he just started to carry <br /> <br /> The decisive for me was this :. I really found that I was not too care about any of the characters, Disney would have taken in developing the characters that you really fall for them, rather than leaving them as a relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved while you were looking at strange perspectives in the film. Even this would be bearable if there was some kind of hard SF in history to do for him, but it was basically a lot gobledegook about princesses and magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls down, as I understand it, and this is what keeps him back from the potential 10 of the 10 film. Having said that, I must admit that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney as a whole in 1986, when you consider that their film of the same year was quite heavy «Detective Great Mouse». <br /> <br /> Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you must see it, but I feel it is overrated. I definitely prefer the earlier "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind." <br /> <br /> By the way, if you can watch them in chronological order, follow the fox-squirrels with Nausicaa appears briefly in Laputa.
