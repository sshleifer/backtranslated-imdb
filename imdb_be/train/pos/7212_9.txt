I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of «Death Trap" in the top 5 list of the best adaptations of stage-to-film ever. Caine and Reeves (underrated actor who never got a chance to do more than raw ballads and "Superman") play off each other very well here even Dyan Cannon -. I usually do not care - perfectly cast in the role, which uses its value as an actress annoyed <br /> <br /> Ya do not believe that a comparison of "trap" with "Sleuth "- another brilliant stage adaptation to the screen with Michael Caine - .. are genuine, or even pravyadlivymi Yes, these two stories have much in common, but "Sleuth," as many of the class struggle as a battle of wits, and a house in the "detective" is set, at least as much as the character in the film, as the two actors - house for really has no equivalent in the "trap" and a "trap." not so much a battle of wits, as pointed vignette about how people are no damned good (and not as smart as they think they are) and deserve all they get. I will just say that both films are excellent examples of the genre, and worth your time and money. This is America, after all. You do not have to choose! <br /> <br /> I will not give the plot twists and turns, but I do not think it matters anyway. I watched the DVD about eight or nine times in twelve years, and is still used in chemistry and time and average and terrible moments, when things are going "all pear-shaped." Everything is done so well that the journey is more important than the actual destination. <br /> <br /> Anyone who loves the black heart of comedy and suspense in the style of Hitchcock's filming will probably enjoys «Deathtrap» much.
