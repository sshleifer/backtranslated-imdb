It was a good movie. This is not a typical war flick, but something a little different. This film shows us the recruits in training before the war and not actually at war. This film is one of the most realistic views on war and the army, than most other films, how it's done. Farrell did a great job to sketch a conscript army and Clifton Collins Jr., and Matthew Davis contributed quite well. Seeing Farrell move from class B to class in just a few short years, you would have never thought that this would happen. I will also add that the creators Tigerland did a great job on the film in 2000, and making it look like 1970 was a nice touch. Its nice to see the talent used wisely and I hope that I will see the same talent again in the near future.
