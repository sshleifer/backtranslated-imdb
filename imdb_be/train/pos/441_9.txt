It is an exquisite film about the search for a certain pleasure in everyday life. Walk, camera work, emotions, seeking music and pure charm of this painting make it a must see. It is not readily appreciated immature or emotionally stunted. The only drawback I see in this film is that it has not been captured in a technically perfect film format. He earned the Todd-AO, Technicolor and the finest sound available formats. (Intimate film can be made seventy millimeters.) A great Italian villas influence on its inhabitants would have done even more lush and beautiful the little moments, would be even more beautiful seen and heard. As it is, it still requires attention as sweet a moving short film. I can not stop myself from watching him every time he comes to the satellite. Character conversion of content, tight and always look incredulous joy, and I really have to recommend it more often. <br /> <br /> The casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, flawless game actors. This film is about the average age and the choice of the people make.It deep and thoughtful without beating up the audience with severe chirality. See it in one sitting, and let it have an effect on you. If you do not get it, maybe you have not lived enough, or something else is wrong with you.
