My friend and I chose «PaperHOUSE» random pile of films on a weekly excursion to the Horror section-- none of us have not heard about it, but advertising on the box was really promising. And the film did not disappoint, although I still probably would not call it a horror movie entirely. <br /> <br /> 11-year-old Anna Madden draws house and visit him in his dreams. It certainly is asleep, when she sees the house, but it's so real in the sense that it's almost like a completely different reality. That from the point of view of subsequent events, it does not seem far from the truth. In any case, she discovers that she can add to the house, its contents and its environment, simply adding to the image. <br /> <br /> While this is happening, Anna has become increasingly ill with fever, and that is completely obsessed with the house and its image. In addition, she and her mother also deal with her absent father; he has a job that takes him away for long stretches, although it seems that there is actually more to the story than that. <br /> <br /> Thus, the image of the material sounds pleasant enough-- but honestly, there's something really menacing about it. Dreamworld terribly surreal - a house, for example, is just a gray box in the middle of the desert region. The people who made this film did a great job making us very uncomfortable with this alternative world / regular sleep ... <br /> <br /> One of the things Anna adds to the house of the boy, Mark, who seems to be the same the patient's physician goes on to talk about (I do not give that now, you know, from the moment it seems that this is the same child). In fact, Mark can not walk due to illness; in drawing the world of Anna, he can not walk, because it does not draw him any feet. She blames herself for his real-life disease, and attempts to correct the situation, but ... things are starting to get really weird. She even brings her missing father in the picture, with disastrous results. Bits father really scary. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give anything away, so I'll stop there ... There seems to be a lot going on in this movie. I'm sure you'll have a ball, this thing done by analyzing death with your friends after you see it-- It's a simple story, as it seems, is there actually layers of meaning? I do not know, but in any case it is very exciting. It Was "A Nightmare on Elm Street» -ish quality about it, that intersect at some point of reality and dreams. I love these things. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it feels like it could end up many times, but never did. I am pleased with the final it was (some of you sensitive types might want to have a Kleenex handy!), But in fact may have a plurality of terminals. Anyway, it does not exactly feel to pull out as soon as it's really over, but while you're watching, and it keeps fading back, it's a little nerve-wracking. <br /> <br /> However, «PaperHOUSE» a really good movie. It is well done and especially acting-- Charlotte Burke as Anna-- at the highest level. Burke, who had never before or since has appeared in the film, is a real gem. I do not know why she never went to do something else, but either way it really convincing and a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> «PaperHOUSE» is not quite a horror movie, it's a kind of fantasy / suspense / something else such as a film, with a particular horroresque moments--, but you can still watch it with your family and not be concerned that your little brother or grandmother will get dirty from the blood spray or something. <br /> <br /> Give it a chance, you will not regret it! And maybe you should read this book, as well ...
