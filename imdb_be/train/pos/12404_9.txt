I lived WY Rawlins, WY, when this film was made and I was lucky enough to be able to work on it. And as an extra, and Eddie Surkin on special effects. It was fun to see all the work scene by barbed wire revived the electric chair up by the superintendent office floor. In addition, it was really fun to get to meet all the actors, from Vigo to Crumb. In addition, the gate, which cuts into the wall of the prison for the film was and still is called "Disney gates" of local residents. If someone is interested and sometime in Rawlins, most of the sets of films still in place, and can be seen during the self-guided tour. It was great fun working with R. Harlin and wanted me to have the opportunity to do it again.
