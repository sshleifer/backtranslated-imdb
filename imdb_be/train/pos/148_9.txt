Like his earlier films, "In a Glass Cage" agust√≠ villaronga reaches an intense and very poetic canvas, which is even more refined, visually, than its predecessor. This is one of the most visually advanced and fascinating paintings one could ever see. Increased drama, intensity and hue of violence threatens to melodramatic or farcical, but it never comes into it. So he pulls the almost impossible feat to be so on top, and yet so painfully restrained, to be so charged and yet so understated, and even explosives are finales virtuoso feast your eyes. Do not hesitate, beautiful, and very stressful ... this movie is simply amazing!
