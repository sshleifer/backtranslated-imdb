I have not read the book that it was based on / inspired. This time, some (the other film roles) in a recent paper by John Ritter (the RIP), one hopes that it is fun. And it is. Almost every time, when it is present in it, in fact. Most actors, maintaining, and regular, incite each other, and the material tends to be large. He plays Paul Hennessy, the father of three teenagers: Rory, a typical man of this age, Carrie, a depressive middle child, who fights for the cause and awareness, and Bridget, loving fashion, popular Diez. Saga makes a return to what the role of women in the sitting-room, and her character is far from Peggy Bundy. The show has changed somewhat after the company g-Three went on and on for a while, they can not seem to make up their minds if they want to go for a laugh, or be bitter and making sure to be respectful. One may wonder how and why it lasted so long after that: He still can be pretty good, some additions have been successful (if you, like David Spade, most part of it consists of his making his feature) and had things to say my favorite episode last season. Humor good mix "dumb people" jokes (mostly related to the high school students), folly, dark comedy and the crude material. It deals with sex and other adult themes, but never in a graphical manner. Soft language, and, on occasion, a moderately strong. I recommend it to all fans of those who did it. 8/10
