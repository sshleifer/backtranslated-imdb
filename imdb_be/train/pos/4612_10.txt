Fred Gwynne Al Lewis, Sid Caesar, and Yvonne De Carlo star in this funny, funny movie. Late Fred Gwynne really cool as Herman Munster, who lives with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), his wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum, which has a whole section dedicated to Munster family. If the wax figure of Herman and Grandpa are beginning to terrorize the city each accuses the two. The two now have to clear their names, before it's too late. You'll laugh out loud as well as I do.
