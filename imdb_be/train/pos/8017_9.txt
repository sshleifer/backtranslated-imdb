At this time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, Electric Mayhem, Gonzo and Camilla the chicken came out of college and in the title role in the musical, they're trying to get to Broadway. After the crash of failure in obtaining its production, they have broken up, and they parted ways. I love the characters and cameos. The songs in the film "Together Again", "Look at me, here I am", "Farewell", "And I will always love you", "Rat Jazz" and "It makes me happy." Frank Oz directs this movie is excellent and all the actors do a great job acting as the real Muppets. Look! 91 minutes. Rated G. My rating: A.
