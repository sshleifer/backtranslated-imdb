This film was very, very strange and very, very funny. All the actors are very real and very strange. In general, the "look" of the movie was different, too, a kind of dreamy and bleached-out, which only added to the spacey, fumbling, Vibe wonder of it all. <br /> <br /> It is not for everyone, I mean, it's not what you might call the "mainstream", but it is something that I liked it. It's unlike anything I've ever seen. ,, unpredictable, with a fantastic rhythm and hitting the line in the most unexpected places. Children are so heartbreaking Goofy (and pustular), you can not help but feel them. In other words, it is far from «hollywoodized» version adolescents. <br /> <br /> All that for me, it does it well.
