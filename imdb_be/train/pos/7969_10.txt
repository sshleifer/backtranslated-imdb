Homeward Bound beautiful film. Y'know the part where the shadow falls ditch ... thing, I * crying *, assuming that I was only six, I cried! it takes a lot to make me cry! Dogs and cats are well trained. A good family film, * nya * for a fully hardened, Sun furry humans or animals contempt, but could for soft as shit as famous people, like me. <br /> <br /> good movie overall, 10/10!
