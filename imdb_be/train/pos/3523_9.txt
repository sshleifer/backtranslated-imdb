Bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director, Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary in an attempt to save his boss from the electric chair, searching for the mysterious "phantom" the woman, and Franchot ton like crazy and killer sculptor. And there are some interesting small part played by Elisha Cook Jr. as the drummer of the Narcotic traps, as well as other characters that make up part of the plot. If you are used to seeing Raines in a healthy part, she let go too far here, especially in the scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays someone very different, and, although this is not a convincing part, it works phenomenally. Though the plot is too far-fetched, the film has a real atmosphere and very interesting.
