I am Italian, and when I recently watched this movie again, I surprised her beauty: for the first time, I was 10 years old, and I loved it, but today I can appreciate it with an adult mind and senses. Now I realize it was a masterpiece of a special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini, etc.), by the time elapsed. <br /> <br /> epic Hollywood movies are good ... for fun. Perhaps this "Odyssey" was not the English version, because it is not funny enough ... not suitable for popcorn and coke audience. . However, for Homer pathos and existential reflections <br /> <br /> In Italy, it has recently released a very good option DVD: INTEGRAL, with beautiful flowers. You can find it in some shared files, but it is only in Italian, without subtitles. Too bad: as the dialogue and the voice of this excellent film.
