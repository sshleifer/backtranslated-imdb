I think if «Beat Street» made national identity, «Flashdance» came at the same time. The problem with «Flashdance» is the fact that there was only one break-dance scene, and the rest was a jazz dance and ballet. This is one reason why the «Beat Street» was better. The only film that could compete with the «Beat Street», it seems, «Footloose», because both the film focuses on how the dance was used by people to express their feelings maximum <br /> <br /> The collapse of the dance scene ". Beat Street» come just before the middle and at the end of the movie. I loved them all. Almost all break tricks were presented in a jam break stage :. Pluggers, torches, dizzy, suicide sitting, crazy leg death, front flip, a figure four --- almost all <brie /> <br /> As well as "soldiers», «Beat Street» really is violence, Mr. ached from the gang life in hip hop ... but in a much less restrictive manner than the first. The only major fight in the «Beat Street» was when the graffiti artist Ramon (who in the film has been abbreviated to "Rameau") pursued a rival gang member on the rails metro New York ..... fighting with each other on the third rail, and both die of electrocution on this train. Well, though this chase scene ended tragically, it was better that they died that way than having blood which It explodes from a shot of the gang. <br /> <br /> Most of the things in the gang graffiti film has been associated with hip-hop culture and rap music. Many rap appeared in the film, because the members of the hip-hop rap music is used as a distraction to the negative aspects of gang life. Even a song from the film, which closed the curtains clicked, not just a tribute to hip-hop culture - it was also a tribute to the death of Ramon <br /> <br /> By the way. , During the dance scene titled "Tango Tango", I believe that a woman drummer in the orchestra pit actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. makes a cameo.
