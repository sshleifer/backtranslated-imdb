This is a film for those who believe cinema is the seventh art, rather than the entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war Germany quite magical. You are absorbed in a dream, and you release only in the credits. The site definitely comes second, but it is still a fascinating history with serious questions raised. Just perfect.
