On the basis of the same director, which would make "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved," I am not surprised that this is a good movie. Oddly enough, «Papierhaus» is a film that I had never heard of until now, but it must be one of the best films of the late 80s - partly because it is hands down the worst of the film in the last decade. (Not to mention the Iranian or the Swedish "cinema" here ...) The current sun shining, but just solid - unlike what some people here say, (they have dreamed of this "miraculous action", as well as Anna) . Interesting fantasy story that does not end in a reasonable manner that ties all the loose ends neatly. These unresolved issues are likely to have left there on purpose, leaving the interpretation of the individual, and there is nothing wrong with that theme, like this one. «Pepperhaus» is a somewhat unusual mix of horror film and children, with effective use of sound and music. I like the fact that the protagonist is not your typical movie-cliché ultra-shy-but-secretly-brilliant social outcast girl, but a regular, normal child; very refreshing. I'm sick and tired of the writers are projecting their own inconsistencies, like childhood in his books and on the screens as if anyone cares to look more or read more about the other mean, lonely childhood, as if it's all there, or as if this kind of nature background holds a monopoly on good potential. The scene with Anna and Boy "kissing" (rather loosely) was a little bit more - arousing feelings as vague disgust and entertainment - considering that it was only to be 11, but predictably turned out that Burke was 13 or 14 when it was filmed. I have no idea why they did not upgrade your character's age or to get more young actress. But I doubt that Burke is not so young. Why filmmakers always reject the baby is older than they are playing, so dilute the realism, I will never know.
