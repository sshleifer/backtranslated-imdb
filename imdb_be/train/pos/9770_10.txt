This film is excellent, and I would recommend renting it to those whose local video store is its owner. Or, better yet, you could buy, because there is a chance that you are going to watch it again and again. I remember watching this movie as a kid, and it was great then. But again I found yesterday after seeing that it was strange. <br /> <br /> A good combination of comedy (though not as large as "Mr. MagooÂ» its one of my favorites) and actions. It deserves a 10/10, and I hope that they will make a sequel soon (fingers crossed). If you need a nanny or to take care of young children on something that I would recommend to rent this film, as it will keep them entertained for hours :).
