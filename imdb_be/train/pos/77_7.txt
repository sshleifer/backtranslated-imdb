The film begins with Vincent Price, who are going to start his job as a magician. Nevertheless, in the middle of the road after a very successful show, the police will come and close it. It seems that his old boss cheated him of the tricks that created the price - even those he did in his time at home. As a result, the price is justified killing an evil person. The problem is that while the viewer to understand why the price is killed, and the most likely to think that is a good thing, because the price was a little mad, he just could not stop at one (kind of like eating Lay chips in). <br /> <br /> film was full of very creative and spectacular tricks (including a huge circular saw and crematorium for the show), great plot twists, as well as a stimulating effect. One thing you can say about this movie, it's boring. Although it is far from subtle, that pleasure in all, though worth a look. <br /> <br /> If I had not seen a version of Vincent Price's House WAX, I probably would have liked Mad Magician much larger and killed him 8 or 9. This is because while the MAD MAGICIAN great movie it is very similar to the film that preceded it (House of wax). The bottom line is that, as House of Wax was so successful, this formula has been re-hashed in the next film. Both were done in 3-D, and there is an area where the price has every reason to kill him, but he can not stop, as soon as he made the first and both are great fun to watch. The biggest difference, and there are several that HOUSE OF WAX was in color, and had a horror film and a mad MAG is definitely more of a mystery. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see this film and (once the price version) House of Wax. They are both great horror movies of the 1950s.
