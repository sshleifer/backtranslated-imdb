Although I do not agree with the decision of Bob and Tammy to give up the child of Jesse, and this is something that I have never done, they were trying to do what's best for the child. The way this film was written, you see yourself get wrapped up in the story and ask yourself what you really believe, from all the different aspects. Patty Duke? Antagonist? Almost nothing is heard as far as I'm concerned. But in the film, it really convinces you that it is psychotic, or at least there is something seriously wrong with her. Her character is the meaning of "emotionally unstable." The film seems to end quickly, leaving a few things outstanding. But other than that, this film is really great. It really makes you think. This is not a film to watch if you just want to kick back and relax and see something cute that will make you laugh. But this is a good movie to see if you want to challenge your own beliefs, to look at things from the point of view of others, and to discover something about yourself. Note: you can even grow while watching the movie! And it's all worth it in the end.
