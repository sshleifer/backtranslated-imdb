Night Listener (2006) ** 1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Dir: Patrick Stettner) <br /> <br /> Hitchcock suspenser gives Williams released a low-key performance <br /> <br /> What is it about celebrities and fans.? What is paranoia about people communicating with others, and why it is almost the norm? <br /> <br /> In the latter case, separate the fan based on a true story, though, Williams star as the face of current-radio named Gabriel is no single reading history, he was with radio waves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a boy named Pete Logand (Culkin), who presented the manuscript to the hard work of his troubled youth no editor Ash (Morton), who gives him no one to read for themselves. <br /> <br /> No one is naturally broken, but ultimately intrigued by a nightmarish existence Pete kidnaps and sexual violence for many years, until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna (Collette gives an excellent performance), who took boy, but her correspondence with Nobody shows that Pete was dying of AIDS. Naturally, no one wants to meet the fans, but suddenly cast doubt on their possible devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted his estranged lover Jess (Cannavale), whose sudden departure from his apartment in New York is not one emotional tailspin, which has only now developed into a storm in a teacup, when he decides to do some research on the backgrounds Donna and Pete discover some truths that he had not expected. <br /> <br /> Author Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the script with his former lover Terry Anderson and budding movie director Stettner) and based on a true story about a hoax fan knew Hitchcock has some moments that are working at full capacity as and any good old-fashioned pot boiler making. It helps that Williams gives eye-catching, low-key job as a conflict kindhearted people who sincerely want to believe that his number one fan in fact real and make it like (one thing that escaped his own reality) and has some troubling terrible moments that creepy Collette one physical trait I will leave unmentioned, but emphasizes the hopelessness of his character, which can rattle you to the core. <br /> <br /> However, the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a little repetitive and predictable, despite the thin piece aimed to deceive and mystery of Stettner, it pays to listen to your own inner voice, be careful that you hope.
