It has been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used the "Wall Street" to tell us that greed is good. Now Michael Douglas takes GG morpheme person and in his Secret Service agent Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! This is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing. More work with the safety measures taken by the SS, on behalf of the president and the first lady was also intriguing. All wires were pretty good, but, try as I might, I could not take Eva Longoria as a Secret Service agent. While Jodie Foster just made you suspend belief and really think she FBI agent Starling in "Silence of the Lambs," you do not get the same feeling with Longoria. However, this is a funny movie, escapist fun with the Ring Road as a background.
