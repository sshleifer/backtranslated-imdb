It's silly really interesting movies for younger audiences. His characters steam exploded detectives whose babble relationship leads them down some very stupid way. Chasing the big murder case, you will see that these detectives go to every length to solve the crime. A lot of nudity, but a lot of sexual implication, slapstick nonsense ... all teenagers do not go. Low budget, but very interesting. A certain cult potential.
