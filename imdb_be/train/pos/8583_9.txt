The Korean War was dubbed the forgotten war in North and South America's. So many unanswered questions have been buried along with the 50,000 people who died there. Sometimes we were treated to a game or a movie that deals with the distant, frozen gloomy cemetery. Here, perhaps, one of the best. This is called "Sergeant Ryker.Â» History of an American soldier named Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin), which has been selected for a top-secret mission of his commander. His task is to run across to the North Koreans, and offer their services for the United Nations forces.
