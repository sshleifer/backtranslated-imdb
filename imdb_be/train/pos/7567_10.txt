Great movie, which shows the cross for life multicultural mix is ​​not so ordinary people in the rural areas of the Pacific Northwest. Solid guide and a letter, along with a good effect, especially speech Kwami Tahoe and Dan this. Interestingly, this film was made in the same year as a very successful "crash" written and directed by Paul Haggis. Action rate may not be as frantic as in the cities of Los Angeles and the characters may appear to become better acquainted with each other in "Besides," but the personal relationships of characters are flawed and troubled history and as resonant as any of those in the "crash". For those viewers who appreciated the "Crash" is a must see film. in addition, supporters of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will like this film.
