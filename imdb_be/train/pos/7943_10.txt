I love this show so much. it contains an animation that is interesting and beautiful. I can not believe they cut it off from the TV, and the fact that I never whether cybersix and data7 found dying or not, apparently, they survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was by far the best TV show in history. I know him until the end of hope that they will begin a series again, so I am very glad that I have to look. I LUVED IT SO MUCH <3 <br /> <br /> it from a woman named cybersix, it is not human. She goes Adrian sieldman, human teacher at Lyceum. Now cybersix is ​​actually a woman, she simply disguised person per day. On night patrols cybersix city. <br /> <br /> A man by the name of von reichter is the one who created cybersix, and as soon as he is put it alive, he uses everything possible to seize it. <, Br /> <br /> If you've never seen it before, and have fully load it. It was the best TV show in the world. Why did they cut it ???? some people have problems. but I am glad that I have to watch 13 episodes.
