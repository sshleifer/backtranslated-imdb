Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Poirot or a professional narrator would be good to look for this magic part of the end of the 60th satire. Ustinov stars as a convicted embezzlers (the first time we see him during his last days in prison, where he is preparing the tax return of the prison governor), who, feeling that the future is computers, posture (with the help of a clever part of identity theft), as a computer expert and sets for US multinational penetration. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (who was co-writer) is on top form, like this gorgeous Maggie Smith, is unusually dismissed as a hapless cockney -sparrow Shares bird. Newhart also puts in a funny performance as the head of the suspect having designs on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl is Moldno meet casually as NEWHART Ustinov for adultery boss. <br /> <br /> What I particularly like about the movie? Moreover, it is well thought out "caper film", but it's also a touching little story of love; Ustin and Smith is very convincing as the two losers stumbling into love (the whole scene with a deck of cards are especially effective.) <br /> <br /> So, what's there not to like? Well, the scenario is more computer literate than most films (that is, hardly at all), even if it captures the feeling of a large iron "business calculating the late 60's" good enough. Also, there are a few small glitches site, you probably will not notice until the second or third viewing there, but I believe that they were insignificant clings. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a film that is well worth looking for, and once you've seen it once, you'll want to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
