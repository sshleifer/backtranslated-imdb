Perfect Son story of two 30-something brothers, the one who seems to be "perfect", and the second, which is basically spin up, often landing itself in drug rehabilitation centers. After the death of his father, the two come together after a long absence and the usual rivalry between the relic. This is not a "perfect" brother makes a startling discovery that he had AIDS, that's irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to get his life in order and take some responsibility. <br /> <br /> The film does a good job chronicling the younger brother of "return", although it may seem a bit far-fetched times (beating addiction is never so simple). What makes the film more tender is the treatment of AIDS, a topic that has become somewhat pales in cinema over the past 5-10 years. As well as the development of almost sweet relations between the two formerly warring brothers are very believable and well done. The two main actors were very competent, if not very charismatic. <br /> <br /> Tough first efforts feature from director and writer Leonard Farlinger whose own brother died of AIDS. The ending is nicely done as well. <br /> <br />
