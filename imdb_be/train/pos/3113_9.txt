The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role ever), the latest spy kid on the block, brings his quest for his identity to the end, it also seeks to end the last program of the CIA «Blackbriar», to make a super-killer as he himself. <br /> <br /> I'm so kooky for this that I watched it yesterday and today predecessors. The identity was as brilliant as I can remember, and the advantage is weak (but still nice) link in the chain for the weakest area, and away from the car chase, which is easily Tops Chase this film, light is missing in action and suspense. <br /> <br /> Hoo boy, does Ultimatum is an unknown! Even if you know, the Bourne avoids power (and boy do these films highlight the police as incompetent), it is still a brilliant watch him do it. It is staggering to think that a couple of guys with guns and mopeds can create more than 10x the unknown than all of these $ 150 million giant robots made in transformers. <br /> <br /> Chalk it up to Paul Greengrass, who has this kind of shooting style stedicam a la documentary, despite the fact that he was filming characters who are far from normal, in places such as the headquarters of CIA, where no one within 10 miles will not be resolved with the help of video cameras. He seemed to hear a variety of complaints from Supremacy, Ultimatum as the action in no less than impressive, with a variety of devices, used as a weapon, as a candlestick, hardcover book (I'll never look at those as well as time) and an electric fan (do not ask). Music has also helped generate a lot of uncertainty, and hardly ever a time not to bite off-beat. <br /> <br /> does well and the evolution of the character of Julia Stiles "Nicky" put her situation into a new very sympathetic light. Damon plays a role signature with the reserve, but competence (which sounds small, but it really looks like Matt Damon could move away from the CIA and Interpol something), but noticeable sharpness moments, he is still trying to find his humanity. This pursuit of his real life can get boring, and almost in the reign, but only the best works in the Ultimatum (best case scenario). <br /> <br /> I remember the scene in "Goldeneye" (the only good movie Bond Pierce Brosnan), in which the character of Sean Bean asked James when martinis ever silence the screams of all the people he killed. Bourne regrets about all the people he had killed, and he said (or, at least, I believe) the meaning of the action without purpose, without meaning in life, and how the government has turned people into resources. . Albeit, resources who know Krav magician and can make a weapon out of anything <br /> <br /> Sidenote: it always bothered me that, despite the fact superspy and hunt the CIA, Interpol and the police almost everywhere he goes that Bourne had never thought to even the smallest attempt to disguise his features or to forge new passports. Sunglasses, maybe? <br /> <br /> If you have a pulse and love fighters than Bourne Ultimatum for you. Damn, this is probably the best feature film to come out this year. Of course, you'd be a fool to see it, not watching the first one. This view draws a touch towards the end, but I almost feel tempted to skip it. This is the first "3" movie this summer, at least, match if not exceed, the original, and that's saying something. <br /> <br /> A-
