The main room was a great movie if you have ever had drama in your life. It keeps you want to see more. You want to know what the secret is hidden Alicia. I think I watched that movie 6 times in a row and have never lost interest. Also, I usually do not cry over movies, but this one made me cry every time. I would like to find more movies like that. In general, I thought it was a great movie. The more you look at it the more you will become a part of it. The very end is the part that really got me when she cried, when he receives his diploma, because it was the name of her daughter on it. My heart felt as if it was destroyed only. And as her new friend came to comfort her, if she had not received it yet. I loved it so much.
