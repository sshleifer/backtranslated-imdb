Stunning black - white and night cinema, and lots of it, emphasizes this, saying that the real life account of the murder of 1950 in Kansas City, where the whole family was wiped out by two people <br /> <br /> In the history. It was written by Truman Capote, so you get the most liberal opposition to the death penalty posts at the end of the film, which is an inappropriate knowledge of the facts of the case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson is played by two atheists lost that twisted outlook on life and who unnecessarily Killing this good family. <br /> <br /> Despite the annoying obliquely in the end, it's an exciting story from the beginning, and the cinematography makes it even more fun. The famous photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on this issue. It makes me want more modern films were made in black and white. Watch it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey, and the entire supporting cast is excellent here. My third viewing of this film came at the beginning of April 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, was found not guilty of murdering his wife. One can not help but look at Blake, and this film differently after that.
