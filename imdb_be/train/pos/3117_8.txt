To begin with, I am very pleased that the culmination of the trilogy Bourne. Please, oh please, do not destroy it, making the continuation of years from now, or a prequel. Just leave him alone. Right..moving on.As talented and versatile as Matt Damon ... I think he just wanted to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the first two films of Borne, you will not be disappointed with a third party. It sticks to what works, and adds a little more. I was very happy to see how well all the information we get in "identity" and "Excellence" to all networks in the "Ultimatum" to finally draw a full picture of the troubled past of Jason Bourne. Action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Fighting between Bourne and the killers are always fun to watch. I've always been a supporter of the surrounding CIA movies and the CIA to collect their Intel and this film just the street, which makes it even more exciting for me. <br /> <br /> If you decide to see Bourne Ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you will continue to thoroughly enjoy the movie, but I still recommend you to watch them first. This will allow you to fully understand the character of Jason Bourne, and attached and be a part of his world. This allows you to evaluate and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure if better than the first two, but I personally think that "Ultimatum" I just MIGHT have an advantage when comparing the trilogy.
