Hard to believe, perhaps, but this film was condemned as immoral by the pulpit more than any other film, obtained before the introduction of Bluenose Hayes Code. Yes, indeed, the priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film, thereby committing a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> I'm not making this up. They had several reasons, as follows: <br /> <br /> Item: Jane loves sex. She and Tarzan is shown waking up one morning at their tops shelter trees. It stretches sensually, and with a coquettish look, she says: "Tarzan, you've been a bad boy!" So, not only do they have sex, they were with kinky sex! A few years later, under the Hays Code, people (especially women) had to be shown how to enjoy sex <br /> <br /> The point :. Jane prefers guileless as a wise and resourceful, the savage (Tarzan) to civilized, respectable nine to five people (Holt). If Holt in the first numbs her beautiful dress from London, she undulates slightly; If Holt is trying to kill Tarzan and Jane Holt, and they believe that he is dead, she sways a lot. But when she realizes that her people are very lively, interesting civilization disappears for her. And why not? Relationship of Tarzan and Jane is egalitarian: He does not have the "civilized" vulnerability, which would force it to establish itself as the "head of his wife," to download, it lacks many of the more "civilized" hang, such as jealousy If Holt and.. his friend to arrive, Tarzan meets them as heart, knowing that Holt's old flame Jane. If Holt gets her dolled up in London dress and slow dancing with her portable gramophone, Tarzan falls from a tree and grabs the knife. jealous? No. He just careful to amazing music chnay car, since he had never seen before. After he explained that he was perfectly <br /> <br /> The point :. civilized Holt dirty-minded. Savage Tarzan innocently sexy. As Jane slips into lamplit tents Holt Holt gets off on watching her silhouette, as it changes in costume. in contrast, after Tarzan dress playfully pulls away, kicked her in the swimming hole and dive for it, it must be the most tasteful erotic nude scene in the whole movie :. Couple spending five minutes in the beautiful water ballet (The scene was filmed in three versions - dressed, topless and nude - the scene was cut before the film, but the naked version is restored in the video are now available), and when Jane leaves, and Cheetah the chimpanzee steals her dress only for. tease, Jane becomes clear that her irritation only because of the proximity of the "civilized" people and their lags. Where "universal lasciviously" so dear to the hearts of seminarians? Nowhere, that is not there. Another reason why this film is hung viewed as sinful. <br /> <br /> goods: this man concept is the crown of creation, and the animals are only to be used and the human comfort, has a serious defeat. Holt and his friend wants to focus on the "elephant graveyard", so that they can dig out of ivory, and take it home. They want Tarzan to lead them to the said cemetery. You, the reader, think: "Fat chance," And you are right. He's in shock. He exclaims: "Elephants sleep!" Which he explains everything. Jane explains the feeling of Tarzan that two "gentlemen" are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane's ex-civilized woman, much more inventive than two civilized men, which it accompanies. Holt and his buddy to blow up, and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals. This is Jane, who maintains her composure. While panic boys, she takes on the responsibility, barking orders at them and walks with a rifle <br /> <br /> The point :. Suit Jane is his native ponchos with nothing underneath. (The original idea was to be topless for her, sometimes artistically overlap her nipples, which actually takes place in one short scene). <br /> <br /> And finally, a few people have complained of the tissue, because the film was a entitled "Tarzan and his Mate" rather than "Tarzan and his wife." no comment! <br /> <br /> Of course, Tarzan, who was nursed back to health of his ape friends come to the rescue, escape the white hunters, and cause the pack elephant and African carriers to return ivory they stole in a holy place, where he came from . End. <br /> <br /> So there you are. Very subversive film. Like all the other movies of the complex and interesting women (see, for example, a violent Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey), which accounted for a smooth genre in the early 30's and have been brought to this broke through the adoption of Hays Code. <br /> <br /> vitality of this film is best manifested soprano Jane version of the famous Tarzan yell. A nice touch, which, unfortunately, refused in future performances. <br /> <br /> Let's hear it for creative freedom, feminist Jane, and sex.
