Small Warning SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... very good film. And I am surprised that I have, because I'm not a big fan of vampires and sound director Deran Serafian name usually means bad news. Most of his films are below average fighters like Death Warrant and arrows. It was one of his first films, and perhaps he would have continued to shoot horror movies, not action. This film really fascinated me. Good achievement, seeing famous actors or a large budget was involved. It really is a story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of the original Dracula myth will be satisfied. Sarafian illuminates another aspect of known history Bram Stoker and remains sufficiently loyal and faithful truth. This explains the life Roemenian Count Dracula, and it scared the Turkish army away from spearing dead corpses in front of his castle. Of course, this is where the "based on the true story of" stops and reality. Drink blood and everything else was invented by Bram Stoker. <br /> <br /> In this film, Count (Vlad Teppish) emigrated to the US and seduces women tonnes. And they're all pretty girls, I'll give him that. In general, good cast, unknown persons, enough blood and gore to satisfy the more unhealthy supporter of horror and an interesting plot. This film is really unknown, and it was hidden on the dark shelf at my local video service. But it is certainly worth dusting on the lid and put it in the VCR. Heck, it's much better than the famous Nicole Kidman film of the same name. These two films have nothing in common, but I blame the film for stealing attention away from this cute little pictures. Check it out ... my humble opinion about Die = 8.5 / 10
