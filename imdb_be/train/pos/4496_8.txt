Simply put, I enjoyed this film. The reason for my interest and pleasure was not connected to anything other than the object itself. I've heard stories from my mother and grandmother on how Northern England working-class life and relationships used to be (as experienced by them), and it is an interesting description that seems to accurately reflect what they told me. In particular, paternalistic, but domineering father who "know" what is best for his family, together with his stubbornness, as this paradigm is disproved. (Not much has changed there then !!) <br /> <br /> People who saw the game will probably be disappointed by the film, because the story is not easy to pass on various media. In a sense, however, the film is a historical document, and I personally liked, if only because he passed a social phenomenon.
