I just saw this movie today, opening night. It was great !! I'm a big fan of sports films, and this was right up there as one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you are reading this ... my sister lives in Austin, where you live ..... and she had to buy you a drink once ... well ... she kind of got you ... but she did not want: C) [not that anyone would think that ...]), otherwise, it's a great movie. Anyone who loves a good sports movie, to go out and see it! : C)
