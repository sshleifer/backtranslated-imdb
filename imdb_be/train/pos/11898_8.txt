This movie is a perfect image of the Nutcracker; dancing is great, the scenery in the background was excellent, and I loved that FLOATING bed. <br /> <br /> Yes, and costumes ... I was particularly fond of marzipan's, a pack was beautiful. The special effects were very well made (eg, wood, bed, etc.), and I thoroughly enjoyed rats. I love how they do not make them scary but cute and Huggable. for the king than that, I believe, <br /> <br /> If you are thoroughly manly face, you will not enjoy it, but it's a very good film that is well suited for all ages. - not only all levels of testosterone. <br /> <br /> But I have a few complaints. <br /> <br /> First, why did they have to put the partner Sugar Plum Fairy in these terrible tights? It would be hardly any difference when he was an example of naked! And secondly .. Why would they need to do in order Culkin PINK?
