Despite the fact that I love this movie, I can hardly see, it's so real. So I put it on today, and disappeared behind my bank computers. I remember it vividly, but just wanted to see if I can find what I had not seen before ........ I have not done :. This is because so real to me <br /> <br /> other "user" wrote commentator ages must be listed with their resume. I'm all for it! It is quite clear that most of these people who have made comments about the "Midnight Cowboy," may not have been born when he was released. They mention other films Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman appeared in, at a later time. I'll be just as detrimental frank: I am 82-year-old. If you're familiar with some of my comments, you will know that I was a professional female impersonator for 60 of those years, and also appeared in the film - you'll never know me, even if you were familiar with my nightclub person. Do you think that I know a lot of the characters in this film? You bet DO !! .... <br /> <br /> .... and I am not ashamed. If you did not run in some of them, it's your loss - but there is a big chance that you eat, but did not know about it. So many moms, dads, sons and daughters might surprise you. It should be no secret many actors / actresses, did not come from backgrounds of "Midnight Cowboy." Who will judge? I can name a few, are now stars BIG-TIME, which have been brought up on the seedy streets of many cities, and were not damaged at all time spent there. I do not have any opinion, because these people, just as we all do - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, modesty you call attributes, they are all there, no matter what the package looks like <br /> . <br /> «little things" about Hoffman actually begging on the streets, in order to prove that he could do the role of «Ratzo» gem - it can be seen behind the wheel of his car all around Los Angeles - how do you think he gets his contribution? I can also name many stars of the men who were standing on the street and cruised the bar for the money. While at a nightclub last time I worked for 26 years was a world-known and legitimate, I can also mention some huge stars that were to be permanently kicked out of our backward, looking to make a pickup. <br /> <br /> this should not be a surprise, and today, although it is certainly the action in Hollywood and other cities, large and small. Wake and smell the roses. They do not smell, no less sweet, because they have a different hue. <br /> <br /> Some of the "users" think "Joe Buck" was clinging to his grandmother. Although I had seen him in his bed with a guy, I have not found any cases of this. Believe it or not, children do not always have their own rooms - because that is a must today to tell you something interesting curly can be derived in the master bedroom. Whose business? Hoffman may change begged on the streets, but some of the "users" point out that Jon Voight has not been a major star for the film "Midnight Cowboy" - his actual salary will amaze you. I think he was robbed! No one can doubt that he put into his role in clarity, neither the things that he had made him a star for such a large work as «Deliverance». He defined a powerful man who conquered his features and was the better for it: very few people noticed he raped in this film. At the end of the 60s, it may have been one of the first films to be so open, but the society is always hip <br /> <br /> I also found between homosexuality «Ratzo» and "Joe." - they were clearly opposed to one another unattractive. They found a lot of clean up relationship - true friendship. If you do not understand that at the end of the film, then you have wasted your time. Surprise "Joe", but unashamed devotion was evident. So, Voight deserves an Oscar for this role -. One that John Wayne was never able to pull-off, and he was handsome in his youth <br /> <br /> Hoffman Hoffman - expect fireworks. He gave them great. Wayne won an Oscar. Each character has been beautifully defined in this movie - if you do not think that they are still around, you are wrong. "Party"? - be present at some of the "raving" young people visit ..... if you can get a look at the line of people trying to get into the hottest clubs. - you'll see every outrageous face <br /> <br. /> Brand Viccaro was the embodiment of sleek women of society who need to get up to the minute at times. If you were shocked by her brilliant acting, thinking, "this is not real," a look at today's "ladies" who live on the verge of discrediting .... and admired for it. <br /> <br /> cruelty "Joe" is reflected in the robbery of an old man, unfortunately, is also part of life. You should not close our eyes to it, but it's not that much different from any violence. "Joe" pointedly described his goal - in this situation, I would have passed, for the money faster than he requested. This is one of the scenes that makes this film a breakthrough, one that I do not look. I am heartbroken for both ..... <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger, of course, must have been familiar with this wretchedness, to refer the frighteningly beautiful eyes opener- Waldo Salt wrote not from foresight. Anyone who has had any part of getting it on the screen, it should be understood that they are making history, and should be proud of his honesty. Maybe "only in America" ​​we can close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other filmmakers do not make no remorse in the imagination of his audience. Despite not mean that does not exist - to give me the truth every time. Bravo! for all ......
