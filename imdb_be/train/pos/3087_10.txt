Six Degrees is a great show! I watched the whole season online, because I just found it and was very disappointed that there will be a season 2, '(and to top it all, ABC has now taken it offline, so that it can not be viewed on the website more . Why ABC to create such a great show, with a great storyline and a large letter just pull it air never ending story. I think he is our imagination to understand what is happening all our connected characters. to be honest, though, I feel that ABC could at least put on a show for the online audience, canes enjoied, as they continue to re-evaluate air a reality show. Six degrees we will miss you.
