Powers Boothe hypnotic as the cult leader Jim Jones, who has not led his follower Peoples Temple from 1953 to 1978, when he led them in a mass suicide in 1978, where more than 900 died. Very well made film that may seem a little outdated because of a period of time 70, but well worth the time 8 of 10
