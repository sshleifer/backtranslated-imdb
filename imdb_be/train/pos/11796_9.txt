Only considering the fact that it is based on the infamous mass suicide incident of today would have been enough to give this 2-part 1980 because of the attention to TV movies. But the fact that he is an excellent reproduction of the life of the Rev. Jim Jones, who built the church into a virtual empire, and then invited him to disintegrate into a sleazy cult in which the congressman and his entourage were killed, and 917 religious followers committed suicide by drinking kool-Aid poured cyanide. <br /> <br /> Made very stylish, but horrible enough, unlike painfully sadistic cult sworn, GUYANA TRAGEDY has quite a stellar cast, including Ned Beatty (as Rep. Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, Levar Burton, and Madge Sinclair. But it's Powers Boothe (in his first major role) that really stands out as Jim Jones. In fact, he becomes a man, and his performance of riveting and chilling. Thus, no wonder that the film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years.
