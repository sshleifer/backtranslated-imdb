Lars von Trier has never backward in trying out new methods. Some of them are very original, while others are best forgotten. <br /> <br /> He paints postwar Germany as a nightmarish journey by train. With so many cities that lie in ruins, Leo Kessler young American of German descent feels obliged to help in their recovery. This is not an easy task, as he quickly learns. <br /> <br /> His uncle finds him a job as a night on the conductor rail line Zentropa. His job is to attend to the needs of passengers. If the shoe polish mark of chalk placed on the soles. Terrible argument follows, if the passenger is not shoes chalked up, despite the fact that they were polished. There are many allusions to the German fanaticism save such silly details. <br /> <br /> Railroad journey as an allegory representing the process of human life, with all its trials and tribulations. In one sequence Leo rushes through the rear carriages to detect them filled with a half-starved bodies being escaped from Auschwitz. These images, horrible as they are fleeting, like a dream, each with its own terrible blow not still connected. <br /> <br /> At station called Urmitz Leo jumps out of the train division bombs. According to many by-standers, he connects the bomb to the underside of the carriage. He returns to his cabin and connects with a timer. Later, he jumps off the train (high speed) and is in the cool grass on the river bank. Looking at the stars above, he decides that his job is to build, not destroy. Then, when he saw the train approaching a giant bridge, he runs headlong to take the train and stop the clock. If you care to analyze the situation, it is absolutely impossible. Quite funny actually. It is only in dreams can happen. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how one remembers small details such as the number of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with swaying train. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this movie is a well-known, I prefer the later films of Lars von Trier (Breaking the Waves and idiots). Bomb scene described above really put me. Maybe I'm a realist.
