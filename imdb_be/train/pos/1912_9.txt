I'll keep it short and concise, the people who wrote the storylines for the show genius, the actors are just perfect for the role they are playing (the character CJ is legendary), and they have so much chemistry on screen, It is making it what it is, a very successful comedy. <br /> <br /> When I saw first saw the new episodes, which are probably rising slightly more than 6/7 months, I wondered what happened to Paul. I was gutted to find out that he died, when I looked at Google. He was so funny and played his character to perfection, over-protective father who likes to keep his daughter in the shade and from the boys. <br /> <br /> comedy, I think, has gone from strength to strength, even without Paul there. <br /> <br /> Also, I think most people will enjoy this look.
