it's a great movie. I like it when Ning goes down to his black and skeletons haunt him, but fortunately, he evaded them, opened the window, and did not even notice them. Third Tian is very beautiful too. And if he thrust needle up Vi example Wu, it hysterical. and when he says, love is the greatest thing on earth, standing between the two swords is too large. then the part where he ate his muffin, watching melted guy killed a lot of people. you see it, chanting verses as he fled from the wolves. romantic love scenes, and Xiao Tian Ning look cute together. add comic moment, a giant tongue, and you horror, romance, comedy, all at once. not to mention the wonderful special effects to the 90s.
