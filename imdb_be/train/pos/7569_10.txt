While in our culture, where reality is open to the narrative overcomes fiction, as we know, the small and the big screen, "in addition" is a film that reveals the real moments of life that are more honest, fresh and innovative there presentation, what I had never seen before. Conventional agreement Beds for feeding are non-existent in this film, leaving the audience content to sit and watch the real-life moments occur one after the other on the screen. While watching a movie, and even the post of contemplation, it is hard to believe that these amazing performances, where in fact, that address. Every moment with a large cast of actors felt that the truth is being exposed to in their daily normal life. Nevertheless, "in addition" does not feel like a documentary or reality show, but instead goes into the category of its own, with its unique cinematography and direction. I look forward to watching this new category of speaking continue with other films directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This film is a must see.
