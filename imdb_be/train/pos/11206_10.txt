I have not seen this movie! At least not in full. I have seen some haunting clips that left me gagging to see it all. One sequence remains in my memory to this day. A (very convincingly looks) spacecraft orbiting the dark side of the moon. The pilot releases the flash device to take a picture hidden beneath the surface. The moon breaks out in visability. ,,, And for a few seconds there. Parallel lines, squares, Maybe .. Then the light fades and short glimse about ... that ... is gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to Earth. Excellent. I saw some of the other videos too, but would like to get the full movie.
