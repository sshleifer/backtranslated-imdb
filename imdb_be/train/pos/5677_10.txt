The third and in my opinion, the best of the Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that there is Lord Percy, who was the most amusing characters from the previous series, but Hugh Laurie Prince Regent suitably eccentrics Laughter line. <br /> <br /> in the package of this quality through strong regency sets, fine cutting sarcasm and little bits of stupid actors "Macbeth," highlight and Prince Georges "took us to" chicken impression and do not have enough words of <br /> <br Dr. Johnson's dictionary. /> Several comedies were as intelligent as they are funny, good odd lame observation or line gets into the system, but mostly it's a scream.
