This film is made up of so much emotion, especially with the great soundtrack that matches the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to please. This film was not the best first time I watched it, but after about 3 more times, I thought it was one of the best films I've ever seen. It takes place in New York, and then progresses through its life. It detects delimma in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). It passes through a state of depression, and then output a mixture of imagination. This film was beyond my expectations, and it is one of the best Cruise movie ever!
