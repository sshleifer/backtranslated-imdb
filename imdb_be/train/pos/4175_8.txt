I always wondered what happened to that magical feeling of this old Slovenian films seemed to them ... Well, of course I thought it was just a feeling of nostalgia. Or that the "feeling" decided to pack my bags and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history, and then I did not come back? Or did it? Because, he returned for the first time for me, when I saw the "Ekspres, Ekspres". And it was this dilapidated again <br /> <br /> There are three qualities of this film, which makes it unique and more, how to enjoy as it is to watch. - smooth flow of history, warm colors and what I appreciate most of all - no excessive use of verbal communication (something many others (not only) Slovenian writers should at least consider). There's no sense of words, if you can understand each other as well (yes or better) by other means in use. Just watch Bakovic and Cerar. Uh. <br /> <br /> So, just so many words, so I would recommend "Ekspres, Ekspres" to all of you as must-see of the Slovenian cinema, no matter what you may hear from Slovenia movies (if you ever even I heard that there ...). <br /> <br /> Yes, and this scene where Bakovic dance to the music of Vivaldi ... delicacy. <br /> <br /> Treat yourself. Careful.
