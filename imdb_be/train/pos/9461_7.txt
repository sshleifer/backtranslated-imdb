Steve Carell stars as a man who you can relate to (sort of) in Dan in real life, the film, which I expected, not like, but in the end like it. Not that the film is laugh out loud funny it's just that he has a big heart. We all, as Steve Carell, is not something that supporters of The Office will be waiting for him, but you know, I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Karel stars as Dan Burns, a widowed father whose daughter is not very similar to it. One weekend, he and his daughter to travel down to see his family. While there, he goes to a bookstore and falls in love with a woman. If he returns to his home, he learns that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) meets the woman (played by Juliette Binoche). <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life, from time to time, I found a little unbelievable. They are the Burns family is really the kind of people who are doing the exercises together and play board games together and do a bunch of other family things? I very much doubt. I do not know any family that, like this. Is that prevents me from giving it a thumbs? No. <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life: *** / ****
