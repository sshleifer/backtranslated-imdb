One of the most heart warming foreign films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The young girl a strange talent. Stellar performances of it (dog), old (the king of masks) and Liang (Live Boddhisatva). <br /> <br /> (Spoiler) Sadly the treatment of children, especially women, are alarming. <, Br /> <br /> loved music. The original Chinese dialogue enhances the emotional intensity of the performances and history <br /> <br /> This is a must see. - a nice family film, though not for very young children. I would have rated DVD release even higher, if the audio track has been transferred to DVD, and better transmission includes a widescreen version.
