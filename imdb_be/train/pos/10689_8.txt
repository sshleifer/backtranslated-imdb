As usual, the Hollywood stereotype of everyone in the film. But this is one classic - from the troubled white collar banker Russian women !! Well done. Even the facial expression was great! The language has been made (even in Russian) and Nicole did a great job !! Hey, guys - you get what you pay for :)
