ELVIRA, Mistress of the Dark (1988) <br /> <br /> Director: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> Starring: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Green and Makklorg <br /> <br / > plot: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) completes its telecast and sent to a small Christian town Fallwell, Massachusettes collect inherited her deceased aunt, hoping to make a lot of money to open a show in Las Vegas. Unfortunately for her, all she gets is a spooky old house, poodle, and the magic table. While in Fallwell, Elvira tries to make money, to breathe life into a teenager, win the heart of the studs (Daniel Greene), to avoid burned at the stake, and keep a cookbook from his horrible uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard), who plans to use the book, to put an end to the world <br /> <br /> my mind :. I love how Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira. She is very successful, beautiful and funny woman and as Elvira, she was all that plus painful and funny naive, not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers. In this film, her charms to good use. <br /> <br /> I loved all the "fish out of water" feel to the film. You got Elvira, with her low-cut black dress, her big black hair, and her huge "twins", and it is in the Christian city, where the majority of women do not even allowed to wear make-up. It also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) is much more interesting. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard as great as Uncle Elvira / Nemesis Vincent to steal the book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence, but still does not get in the way, and steal the scene from Elvira. <br /> <br /> What really makes the film is not the plot, but a lot of jokes. All that horror idol substitution jokes here and makes me laugh a lot more than any of the horror sequel. I have heard that there are about 56 boob jokes in this movie, and any fan of Roger Corman B-movie horror will love substitution in this film. <br /> <br /> If you like Elvira, you'll love this movie.
