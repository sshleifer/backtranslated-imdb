I loved this movie, and I'm one of the older people who are not supposed to use it, or so it seems. No, this movie is not deep - who cares? Such films are never. But oddly enough, there is a message in it. This is what each of us has the potential to be whatever we want to be. <br /> <br /> Posey great in this movie. I always thought that it bears some resemblance to the vestibular Katharine Hepburn. Thus, it is great to see that both Hepburn and Posey made films about librarians (Hepburn is Set the table). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, a must see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 8. This does not mean that every great film for cinematic standards, although there is some good stuff in it. But it is incredibly charming and interesting.
