It is really old fashion movie magic. Place large, and the situation is one of those old time Preston Sturgess films. Fi you want to watch a film that does not require much other then to rest and relax, then this is it. To act well, and I really liked Michael Rispoli. He was sharper, too. And while you were sleeping. The rest of the cast is fun. This is exactly what happens when two people get married find that they really like at the weekend that they plan their wedding. I know ... it sounds kooky ... but it is. And that's what makes it fun to watch. This will make your girlfriend a hug you or leave you, but at least you'll know.
