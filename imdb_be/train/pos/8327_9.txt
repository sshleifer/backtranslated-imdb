It was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews, as noted in IMDb), but he made a great matchmaker. He collected two very good people who play two of the best actors that work. The supporting cast (Lou Jacob, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.), all keystrokes on the screen and made it a great browsing experience. The fact that he drove a car to get around, seems to contradict all these images and posters of him riding a bike to get around. And he's wearing socks in one scene ... According to Professor never worn socks! (Two new records for IMDb goofs section.) The historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, it was a great movie to watch with a large cast. I give it an 8!
