(NOTE: minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> I came across this one at halfway and looked out, not knowing what it was and what the story was. This, of course, caught his attention; I did not know until the end, that it was based on a true story! The guy she used to do the dirty work left looks like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around, devious girl; I have to question how realistic the image is. Anyone who would have killed the husband and wife as they slept simply can not be quite pleasant. However, I had some sympathy for him, as he was set up and used; that much was clear. <br /> <br /> My main complaint with the end (here comes the biggest spoiler! skip this step if you do not want to learn it). In just a few minutes before it was over, the sun seemed to be the way of truth to be discovered. As it was, it was found in the "stings" operation, but my question is: how to make sure the police to go with him? The film shows us that, and it seemed a little too comfortable in the absence of an explanation of how they were forced to do it. <br /> <br /> I think they handled that were made for dramatic purposes, the omission explanation gave an aura of uncertainty in a key scene, which otherwise would not be there (we'd know what the scene was about, and what happens with Brad in it). <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's quite a good film; I give it a 7/10. It made me think. Now I'm curious to find out the real facts of the case <br /> <br /> Another thing :. The film was made in 1996 by some of the reviews here, it seems, seeing it as a more recent film. <br /> <br /> PS Lug system perfectly. I have not seen her. She may act a little bit, too (always a plus in her line of work, LOL).
