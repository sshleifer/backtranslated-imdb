It's about a mad scientist who creates a half-shark - half of the types of people Critter on an uncharted island, then calls all of his old business and academic friend to come and see his creation (evil laugh), but in fact he wants to it sharkman, to kill them! Many bad GCI, goofy story elements, and babies sweating in tight T-shirts follow. <br /> <br /> These monsters movies all follow a similar formula, but it's spice things up with a bit of humor (I guarantee the people who did it were tongues firmly planted in cheek), not to mention the sexual kids. But let us mention these sexy babes - more hot babes in tight T-shirts, sweat. One is in her immortal in the beginning, the other at the end. Thank you, thank you, the creators of bad movies! The plot is full of stupid things, the guy pulls up in a jeep, slammed it straight into a tree, and then offers to fly all leave the island by helicopter. So, um, well, how about we think about that for a while; we will come back to you. Sharkman paddles - or a terrible CGI or as a comic guy in a rubber suit. Mad scientist gives a pretty good idea; it is evil, it is his motivation, he does not ask for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> In general, if you want, stupid, FUN B-movie, this one should do the job.
