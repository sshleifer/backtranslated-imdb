Again, it seems quite illogical to me, at least, that the "Arthur" deserves only 6.4 out of a possible 10. one shot Steve Gordon masterpiece here is quite "likely", if not quite "impossible" to merge wildly disparate elements. The fact that he managed to make alcohol laughing people, not tearjerking tragic in itself is fine. What he gave Dudley Moore his best role, and any other cinematic element in the description of its optimal effect, including the cost, I believe, patent and outrageous. I challenge anyone to sit through this film and not to laugh. But, apparently, almost a third of its audience had happened. Well, I, for one, found it and find Gordon efforts as funny and cute, and iikes Geraldine Fitzgerald great-aunt and murderous potential in-law of the absolute gems of Stephen Elliott background characters. Even black driver managed to escape and later patronage, sniffish Sir John Gielgud was right about taking his fee, but it is wrong to hold his role. "Arthur" does not make any effort to Â«Underztand," much less rationalize the scourge of "alcoholism" (hey, Ifit not booze, it's the other drugs of choice in the number of meth, and affection are only symptoms, NOT target), it simply observes in his playful manner.
