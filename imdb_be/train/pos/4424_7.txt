As incredible as it may seem, GoJoe is an anime-inspired and Hong Kong film Samurai action with pacifist message. This ankle film effectively portrayed by the main character (great acting job done by Daisuke lit), the killer turned to the monk-boddhist Bank. Bank vowed never to kill, but he still holds a sword to fight, he thinks that a demon invasion ... <br /> <br /> GoJoe hard film speed. It worked awesome visuals and beautiful, but it is using too much hype (circling camera and high-speed drives, expressionist boom sucked color, digital effects, etc.), so that the end result is somewhat tedious. Nevertheless, the beginning and end of the movie, however, both elegant and powerful. If only the director Sogo Ishii would have been wise enough not to abuse his tricks. <br /> <br /> Other problems GoJoe the amount of violence. For a film with such an anti-violence messages GoJoe waste too much energy and time of the screen to display the endless battle scenes. Furthermore, as shown violence always is on the verge of being self-indulgent; in fact, a shower of blood in the night sky, it seems, one of the signature image films. Fortunately, Ishii wise enough to show the ugly, the tragic side of violence as well. Nevertheless, it seems that Ishii if he is sure to make a traditional thriller or a deep moral allegory. The viewer can not be sure of it, or until the end of the film. Powerful (albeit cynical) ending saves GoJoe; clearly it emphasizes that this film is more than just a Gore-festival.
