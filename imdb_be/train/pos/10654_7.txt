Phantom of the film, which boasts a truly spooky house, a good job and work the sound effects, the cast that seem to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump, and sinister aspects of what is happening on the Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are really terrible moments in the film, and I liked how the ghosts manifest in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Cost Jerry Goldsmith gave him the right atmosphere and sound design was a voice pops up around you. What I want may happen, for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating, to fight and I think he held back a bit too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and he still holds. Ghost could have used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending for me, a bit disappointing. In general, I liked it. It works well, and there are moments that make you jump. I just want it stuffed me anymore.
