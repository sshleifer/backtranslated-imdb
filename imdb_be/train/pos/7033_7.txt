First of all, do not call it a remake of the '63 film. Even though this version is more honest in the game, it is very long. Casting was good with a few exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good casting choice. She was almost 30 when she made this film, and it was hard to believe that she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly overdoes its part as Mae Petersen. George Wendt was funny, Harry McAffee, and showed that he could even hold a tune. As the '63 film, they cast an unknown to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudish fun with his role as Byrd, and it showed. I even have a soundtrack, and I like to listen to his singing. So what did that TV ratings flop? It was a long one. They put in the new songs and the stage. Even if some of the new songs were good (for example, "Let's Settle DownÂ»), whether it was really necessary? Do not get me wrong, I liked it, but I prefer to look at the '63 film (see my review). It was just a case of some actors overdo role by making some changes, and once again, LENGTH. Another thing I forgot to mention Vanessa Williams. She does a good job with the role, and music. Give her any texts, and she could sing them. So here's my advice comes from someone who has made a couple of productions Bye Bye Birdie: If you want to see entertaining take on the game, watch the '63 film. If you want to see a version more specifically for the game, see the '95 version. Just take it in moderation though. Do not be a hero and try to see it all in one sitting.
