I do not think most people give this film as much as it deserves. I love the low budget horror movies, and this takes the cake, especially for originality. Yes, the Beast is fighting frightner Kung-Fu, but why not? No one wants to go that far. I actually was not so much fun to watch a movie since Candyman. Thus, the city chooses this one child, calling him a stuffed animal, even his mother does not care about it. Then he dies and the spirit is imbued in the Scarecrow, who then goes on a death spree. His death is relatively easy to assume, once the film gets going. Initiation at the end go right into a pile of horror directors, but with greater dedication to Dario Argento's really impressed me, how cool these people who want to make movies more new genre. For the film abounds Arnold rip offs, one liners you'll definitely laugh like a stick around, and he kills the sheriff with a stick. I would say, take some pizzas familiar laughter of your A $$ off with this film. I love it for its originality, the most fun.
