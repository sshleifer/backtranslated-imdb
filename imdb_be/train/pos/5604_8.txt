If you like "Repulsion" by Roman Polanski, you should probably check «The tenants", as it is a similar concept, only Polanski stepping and playing schizophrenic Wacko. It's actually one of my favorite of his films - the second after the "Rosemary's Baby", of course - and this is a direct way to the mental breakdown of a person moving in the suicide of the former apartment. Other residents of the building all puff and guards to maintain the level of noise down - even the most insignificant "giggle" becomes a great deal and Polanski, who stars is becoming more and more paranoid and succumbs to his crazy and wild hallucinations further and further as the film carries on. He gets to the point where he dresses and behaves as a former tenant, and you realize that it is only a matter of time before he decides Tor again take her fatal jump from a window ... The film is a bit slow and bagpipes for while but if you've ever seen the movie Roman Polanski, you should know what's going to end with a bang, and this film does not disappoint. It is also better if you do not doubt in the intricacies of the room and just take it as a descent into madness, because it's pretty trippy surreal at times. Polanski very well, like a timid, furious resident who, one way or another, it attracts ever famous Isabelle Adjani. We can also see him run around in the clothes, which is alarm and paddles all at the same time! Heck, it makes for one ugly chick! So, Polanski supporters - who can actually look past his thirty-year-old pedophile charges - should use «The Tenant" in a fascinating psychological journey of the head ...
