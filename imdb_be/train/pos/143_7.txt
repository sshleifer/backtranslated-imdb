Riget II is a continuation of the good, but not as good as the first. This series does not seem to be as serious as the first one. There is much more in this comedy, a good, though. <br /> <br /> We're back in the Danish Rigshospitalet, the Danish National Hospital. Mrs. Drusse just going to leave the hospital because of her work is done, but fate wants it otherwise. She quickly chasing ghosts and Elmer does everything with the mind, and it is quick to get much worse, as the dark forces unleashed in the Kingdom. <br /> <br /> This story includes a lot more comedy as the previous. I am sure a lot of fun, but it forces you to take a series of slightly less severe. History has preserved many elements from the last series and some new ones added. It is well written, but some of the new elements just kind of silly, but keep it, making it more comedy. Good story, but not so good, original and exciting as the first row. <br /> <br /> Also, the actors also with some additions to the ordinary gypsum. They are all very good. This is an amazing story and setting. Some parts of a total freak show and the characters change during the show, so keep it seriously and keep it real is not an easy job. However, these actors to handle the whole situation perfectly. <br /> <br /> A lot of advantages to the first series are stored. The cinema is one of these qualities. The camera manual, which made the world-famous Trier gives uncertainty and reality series. This gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and Trier uses these abilities. Well, motion, big lightning and good composition and editing make it look nice. <br /> <br /> Be ready for a better effect in this sequel to that in the first. Also, be prepared to see some more. I do not think that green thing looked too good. I thought it was unoriginal and did not fit. However, these effects are not very good ghosts. Nya-digital effects look too good. Little brother looks very strange, but to accept it. All over, I would say that the effects of the OK to good. <br /> <br /> Music is also very good. Moody and pleasant. Some of them are really touching. It fits very well. In the first there is quite a bit of music in the scenes, and it works very well. <br /> <br /> All together it makes a good continuation. If you saw Riget you can see it without being disappointed. It has many of the same qualities as in the first series. Nevertheless, I would recommend to see the first set, before seeing it. These two make up series you will not want to miss.
