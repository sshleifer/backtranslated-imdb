I've never heard of this movie until I came across it by chance when browsing IMDB. I saw that he had received a lot of terrible reviews, containing very colorful expletives on how much it stunk. Of course, this meant that I had to see. I was pleasantly surprised at how shaken up is actually quite a good movie. I watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we were at many recent Hollywood comedies of famous fuzz. It's an independent film, and as such reflects its subject (sex and love) without the usual Hollywood forgery. I distinctly suspect that people's opinion of this film will largely depend on their experience. If you've never dated or celebrated a lot you do not get this movie, because you have not met people like these characters. If you have, you learn a lot of situations, shown here in a comedic manner. The ending is also good, as it does not reflect a woman as unrealistic, helpless, pristine romance, unlike many Hollywood movies.
