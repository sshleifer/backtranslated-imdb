Once again, I was looking through a discount bunker video and took the film for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the time in a movie, I find in the trash pure crap (I mean awful beyond belief), but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. This film is so much better than I expected. I found it very attractive, although it was obviously done by an amateur. <br /> <br /> direction is nothing special, but the story is intriguing with some good thrills. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I was not too disappointed. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, this film is surprisingly good-natured. There's no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. As a rule, these films require all four of these elements. Rating PG is well deserved. - not like "Sixteen Candles", where "e" word is used twice, and there is a brief gratuitous nude scene <br /> <br /> I just want to romance between Corey Haim and his love interest, perhaps, was developed more. The film tends to be plot-heavy and potentially good podagovory pushed aside. Instead of developing the chemistry between the two of them, we will eventually see a careless three minutes mounting them on their romantic endeavors. They end up kissing in the end, but there is so little that the chemistry that seems forced. <br /> <br /> «The Dream Machine» not a gem, but it's good, clean fun This is a pretty forgettable -. especially with a cast of unknowns, except Chaim - but it is also much better than one would expect, < br /> <br /> My estimate :. 7 (of 10)
