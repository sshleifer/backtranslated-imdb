At that time, magic, barbarians and demons have many diabolical tyrant named Nekhron and his mother Queen Juliana, who lives in the kingdom of ice and wants to conquer the region regulations fire king Jerol, but when his beautiful daughter Princess Teegra was kidnapped by thugs Nekhron in warrior named Lan has to protect her and must win Nekhron from capturing the world and the kingdom with the help of the avenger named DarkWolf. <br /> <br /> but nicely done and excellent underrated animated epic fantasy that combines live actors with animation traced over them (rotoscoping), this is the second best film of Ralph Bakshi only "American Pop" to be number one and «Heavy Traffic» to be the third, and "wizards" to be the fourth. It's certainly better than its "Cool World" or "The Lord of the Rings", the artwork designed by the famed artist Frank Farzetta and animation has a good color, and there is also a beauty for boys and girls. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to the fantasy and animation fans around the world, especially the new 2-Disc Limited Edition DVD by Blue Underground <br /> <br /> It is also recommended :.
