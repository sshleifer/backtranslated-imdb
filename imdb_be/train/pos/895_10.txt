I saw this movie. This movie is the best of today's needs. Dowry in a marriage is the main problem at the moment. In formulating this problem, this film is the best. In this film, the Indian values ​​are set very well. Today's young people have to understand the problem. There is less than the population of girls. And in connection with this problem of dowry, the girls have committed suicide. If this problem continues, then the next day, if not a girl, not away.So, keep in mind this statement, the youth of today should understand that we can not take dowry marriages.We should learn from this film that the dowry NOT must be taken.And, when we understand the problem, we can see the new trends in society. This is a significant change in society.
