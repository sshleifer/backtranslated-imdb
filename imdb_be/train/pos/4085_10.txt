If you were born around the time the film was completed, and was liberal / prejudice economy that I had, I'm sure that during the first 80 years, you would first introduced to go to your parents to watch dirty movies or extreme dirty movies . You know, not 100% as pornographic alchemical mixture of real drama and pornography, or that you have to get in their collection and priests in a plastic rectangular presentation of this film in a big machine called Dookie VHS. You had to be very quiet and ninja like, but still have a slight heart failure, when huge pop noises were made by pressing the Tablet PC as a button for fear of being discovered. In any case, these films were sent to the back of your mind, wait and wait to be reunited with the visual "art". Needless to say, this film fits in the above description to a "T". Many people comment on the nature of the film is very sexy, but perhaps due to me to be insensitive, I'm more disturbed philosophising. Was says the creator of us on the deeper levels of human lust and or what could be considered a real muck, race relations, bed masturbation, voyeurism, or it may be a desperate social status before the killing point, pedophilia / homosexuality, or depressed sex the nature of the social elite women in the eighteenth century in France? Who can say, but despite Mr. Borowcyzk taste for bright, unbridled sexuality to be "normal" for their work, I would say that in fact, this movie really speaks to the audience at a deeper level to the animal lust. After I learned about it, the story is much more interesting dizziness shock value, and the foreground, it is worth checking out.
