Some critics found this film is bleak, but for me it was quite a good mood and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, positive and calm stoic character of the daughter there is the center of the film, balancing the often unfortunate aspects of the setting and the story. <br /> <br /> The film is full of original ideas and characters, and the end result is not predictable :. I felt I could go either way <br /> <br /> By the way, a lot of reviews I read mentioned the effective use of black and white, but the seal, I saw, it was shown on TV SBS network here in Australia, It was in full color. <br /> <br />
