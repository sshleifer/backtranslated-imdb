Sometimes European series are less precise than those of the USA, but this time, the authors come to the right goal of creating a mixture that works in exactly the ways. Edel & Starck's big, it has it all: great story, clever, witty, always well-delivered line, surprising theatrical time revealed all the stars and the beautiful pictures of Berlin, one of the most exciting cities in the world.

Kudos to all the cast and crew of well done comedy, which is going to be required to in the following years a series of come.Watching German super.
