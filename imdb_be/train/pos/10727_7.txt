This is a family film, which for some people is the automatic shutdown. It seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with poor hands and feet, unreasonable violence and curses enough to fill a phone book New York. This film is neither one of them. It's a clich√©, it's a formula, but it's also fun. He does not ask you to think, it does not require you to take the film as a reality. He just does what a good film should do that willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. Toss well, but not perfectly. As one commentator has noted the sound assessment of John Williams was, as usual, excellent. And the fact that most of the film was shot in Huntsville in real space camp made it all the more believable. <br /> <br /> It is ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for several months due to the crash of the shuttle Challenger, which may have played a major role in its original theatrical opening, but the film ultimately contributed dreams focus many young people back to the side of the space and the opportunities that lie therein. So sit with their children and prepare to enjoy.
