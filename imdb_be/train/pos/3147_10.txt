This show is great. It has some of the best writing I've ever seen. He is a brilliant director at Dvid coach who also directed other smart TV series called Boy Meets World. <br /> <br /> This is a show with a dought one of the biggest. As COMPANY'S THREE, Ryazanov, and the famous Cosby Show it will be on TV for a long time. <br /> <br /> Since he perfectly handled joke great performances you would only dream is a great show for the people who lived in the seventies and the people who did not. This show attracts the young and the young at heart. Perfect show.
