Let me set the scene. It's the school holidays, and there is absolutely nothing in the movie. Me and my friend deciding what to watch. We are looking for a film that begins in the near future and "Grinch" is. We buy tickets, not knowing what to expect. What we got was a bitter fun. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey (who can add my No.1 actor in the world) was absolutely gorgeous, as the Grinch in the best film of Ron Howard (next to Apollo 13). Thus, this film was made, sets, actors, props and music was just amazing. He really brought the movie to life childhood. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the story of the Grinch. As we all know that the Grinch is a horrible person who just can not stand Christmas. He lives high above Whoville and never mixed well with townfolk. But one little girl is going to change the appearance of the Grinch to life and others in a sharp way. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Who (played by actress Taylor magical new Momsem) meets the Grinch, according to the tender part of his right. She tries to break down barriers and help move the Grinch in and mingle with the people of the city. <br /> <br /> All of this film is a laugh a barrel for the whole family of children and parents. Solid 10/10. Well done Jim. <br /> <br />
