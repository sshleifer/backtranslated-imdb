Anton Newcombe makes a film, and it is the main subject. Watching him put together a song, if not the whole album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent. He thinks he is a god, but prollific and interesting. DW is not so interesting compared musicly anyway. "Hey, you HAVER driver's license?" Anton says the cameraman, "Well, let pawn this guitar!". Great use of archive / home video material. Great to see the rock documents are still being made. Steep document the creative process. If you like this to see Nirvana Live! Today! SOLD! on DVD. Good experience Anton this film. 8 of 10
