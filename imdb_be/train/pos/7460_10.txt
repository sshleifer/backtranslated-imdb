I think a lot of people just wrote it off as another one of the amazing Tom Cruise movie (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut), but Vanilla Sky, of course, your own movie. Many people said that it was amazing; it was not. It was different and confusing, but not surprising. Weird Stanley Kubrick and Pauly Shore. Different is the Truman Show. Mixing is a matrix or a game. And unlike Kubrick, this film has a conclusion. All makes sense - maybe not immediately, maybe even today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. This is the essence. This is where the so-called "strangeness" that turned out to be a critic came off. If they have worked to "open [their] eyes", as the original 1997 Spanish film, they would have seen that. And if that's not enough reason to see her, to look at the music. Cameron Crowe offers a great soundtrack; he uses it to set the "feel" - the same infamous item that many do not have enough films. With songs like The Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations", playing in the dramatic and emotional climax of the film, it creates an unusual, but amazing "right" feel. Great movie, in his scripts, music, acting, and images, Vanilla Sky, unfortunately footrest surface film, which critics accuse to sound smart. Excellent: A +
