Secret of Kells can be the most refined film that I've seen with triplet Belleville. Although stylistically very different, Kells shares with triplet and (jaw-dropping 2D opening sequence), Kung Fu Panda, an incredible art direction, design, production, background / layout and color saturation that ball to his senses. Kells so generous - almost Gothic in the layout (somewhat resembles Klimt) is surprisingly flat in general an overall perspective, abundant in Celtic and lighting design, but the characters are so simplified and attractive - and it all works together nicely. You fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. You are so drawn to every detail of the story, and every stroke of a pencil and brush. Tommy, Nora Ross, Paul and all at Cartoon Saloon (and their extended crews) achieved with this low budget / very small manned film is absolutely amazing. Wave of support among our animation community is phenomenal. This film captures the spirit and buzz among our colleagues to recommend this film spread like wildfire. Congratulations to Kells on his numerous awards, his nomination Annie, as well as his current Oscar qualifying run. They are all very well-deserved bows, really ...
