This film is not nothing but a dark, gritty masterpiece. Maybe I'm biased, since the era of apartheid is an area that I have always had to. But I would say that it takes directly from by Freedom Cry and Cry the beloved Country. Unfortunately, by the time a few days ago I had never even heard of this film. Inside one of the most underrated movies of all time, probably because it was a small film company, I had never even heard of it before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors, in any case, it is believable and dramatic, Hawthorne plays well his despicable role. Do not look for the humor in this film, there is none. It's real wild and gritty to the last, and tangible, I would say, bring a box of tissues. But films as big as this make you wonder, why did not it happen that the greatest films are often not heard?
