This movie is awesome for three main reasons. It is aesthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved it. There is a bold color theme throughout the film with unusual costumes and colorful sets. Shooting, which looks very expensive (and probably was) completes the look. I always love these stories about groups of losers / singles get together and become a family. Sometimes they fall into a clich√©, but this one does not. This group of actors really reflects well not perfect, but very likeable character. Alan Larkin is the best (between them, the van and the road movie theme, I could not help remembering my favorite film last year Little Miss Sunshine ??). I found Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and just got a tiny bit annoyed by the performance Til Schweiger at times. The first scene, all the scenes where they mess their tricks are very funny. There is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film. I love the end of the lot. And, of course, it's all about the Magician theme. A good magician pretends auditorium where he wants them to create an illusion. What is happening is exactly what makes a director, and that's why they call it the magic of cinema.
