Never heard of this movie, I saw it on DVD.Great film, a perfect example of a movie that has taken each member of the cast to make it work.No overhyped typical Hollywood film with the same old current overhyped actors.No quotation list "A" actor could pulled by any work in this movie.Brought memories of my own postage Vietnam war military experiences.It focused on those people who were sent to fight.As was portrayed characters who were the fears and emotions, even if some volunteer. they were ordinary people, too, some just were not cut out for the military life, I remember some of my experiences - to put it mildly, can not adapt to military life either, but I will never forget them, should have been left in touch.I highly recommend it and then think about those who serve today in Afganistan.Basic training is a trip, pay attention to these sergeants Sun morning people and perhaps they need a "sensitivity trainingÂ» HA! HA! HA!
