In 1996, "101 Dalmatians» Cruella De Vil was arrested by the Metropolitan Police (Met God bless them) for attempting to steal and murder of 101 puppies - Dalmatians. All mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in "tin". Now, 4 years later, it is, unfortunately, was released from prison. I say it's about 28 years old - in dog years !!!!! <br /> <br /> So, in 2000, Disney decided to produce a sequel to the successful live-action version of the classic film, and is now known as "102 Dalmatians." It has one hundred and two Dalmatian added to the family (Oddball this name, I think I should know this, as it has just been shown on television in recent years), and the puppy had no place !!!!! In addition, while Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) ran away again, she wanted more, better coats - made again with puppies !!!!! <br /> <br /> I especially liked the song - I am sure that everyone loves «Atomic Dog» song from the 70 or so. And now we hear it a bit in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> «102 Dalmatians" such a great movie that I keep wondering - If A is "103 Dalmatians ?? ??? »LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
