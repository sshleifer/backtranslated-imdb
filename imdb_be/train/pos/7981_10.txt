Lavash changes the behavior of cold Creasy, forcing him to live and smile again, and he feels great affection for her. If a girl is kidnapped and Creasy reported that she was killed by criminals, he vows to kill every one is responsible for the kidnapping. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is almost a masterpiece, and will, of course, a classic in the future. The story is great, never banal, and although the presence of 146 minutes of work, the viewer does not feel the passage of time. The cast is made up of prominent actors and actresses, their performances are outstanding, highlighting Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. The cinema has great moments, and the script has excellent line. I personally like it when a character explains Christopher Walken Manzano (Giancarlo Jeannine), which Creasey specialty with ' it is death, and he is preparing his masterpiece. I agree th user, who noted that "Man on Fire" is one of the best if not the best film of the year in this genre. My vote is ten <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :.
