This animation is a very simple and straightforward good versus evil story and all of the action. What distinguishes it from other animations as well human movements are animated. It was very nice seeing the current woman running across the screen from left to right and look around, her movements were so good. Why do not they use this technique rotoscopic more these days? It is quite effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice, in this prehistoric installation and barely dressed women, is clearly dedicated to showing excellent Woman in trouble in various sexual relationships, her voluptuous body, acting as a pure EyeCandy. Some of them may hate it, and see it as one more idiotic male sexual fantasy, others (including many women) will love this aesthetic quality. I'm not exactly against it! Bakshi just loves to animate lushious, sensual baby as well as you can see in a cool world, and I do not think he should apoligize, as it is quite a lot of animation for adults. But I also enjoyed this animation as a child, and I will never forget it. <br /> <br /> This one was just special, so different from the standard Disney fare or anime, and for this reason alone is well worth a look as it is arguably the most beautiful Bakshi. For those who love animation lushious women :. Try Space Adventure Cobra, as well as <br /> <br /> I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.
