This video rocks! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. Not only that he has class, he does some of the funniest observations on history and culture, which I have ever seen. Eddie is the original and most intelligent comic I've seen in a very long time. Tell all the other bench of the window to enter the scene, and let this "executive" reign!
