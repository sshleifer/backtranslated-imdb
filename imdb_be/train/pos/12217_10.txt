I went to the Ashura in 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. Man, that was a cool blow away. The director had to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but for health reasons, he was still in Japan ... oh God, I hope he is getting better and does a lot of other films. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly simple, but a few original ... demons roaming in the Edo period in Japan and Swordsmans called "demon" Keepers are killing them, and fearing the rebirth of Ashura, the demon goddess, who is asleep and supposedly very awesome. <, Br /> <br /> This brings us to ... Izumi some elite swordsman named Â«Demon Slayer" and his buddy Jaku, who is a typical cruel jealous asshole ... <br /> <br /> It seems , sad? well, now it thickens .... <br /> <br /> Izumi took his retirement from killing demons as he slaughtered a young guy on the "impression" that he was a demon, he never knew, but he did not kill her. So Izumi continued its life and recycled themselves in Kabuki theater. boat adventure on a good night, Izumi see the girl hiding on the bridge, and it changes your life and ne azapustsits to kill the demon ... for a good cause, the cause of love and ... damn ... the guy knows how to handle the ball and pull the massacre entertainment. <br /> <br /> Izumi carries the film as far as the game goes .. . you should never he complete package ... he knows how to fight (hell, he knows), he is witty, he's smart and he's got that baby shout. "no Izumi, it's a trap," The guy already knows he has that common sense. He really is the perfect hero. <br /> <br /> As for the movie goes, aesthetics quite interesting. This is definitely a film that looks most like mango. This cream full of special effects and nothing at all costs to prevent the film to look realistic ... it's pretty weird. Many colors are "unrealistic" images but ... it's pretty simple ... but as I said, the main character, who is the film A must see, leading the tale of skilful hands
