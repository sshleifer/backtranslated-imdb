Mirage (1990) is a very rare movie horror / chiller from 1990, released here in the UK on the «New World Video» label. <br /> <br /> This desert is based horror film about a young group of friends who hang out on the weekend, only to be killed one by one by an unknown force, driving a menacing black truck !!! This movie has some of the dreadful scene, and some gore here and there, but I have to say that the action was so lame, even low-budget! But the film was amazingly addictive and I loved it, and I never went to sleep or shut it down, it is always a good sign! I almost gave this film 6/10, but seeing how he built the ferry on the way, had a few good moments of gore and suspense, was some nice nudity, as well as the fact that the blonde in the female lead was a beauty too! I'll give it a 7/10.
