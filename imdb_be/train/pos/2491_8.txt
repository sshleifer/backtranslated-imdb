budget constraints, time constraints, shooting script and then cutting it, cutting it, cutting it ... This team is a group of good young directors; thoughtful in this scenario - so allegorical - smart in zero dollar effects when the time and the knowledge of all that is, relying on the actors and friends, and a good friend for their time, dedication, locations; and receiving the first function in the bank 1 in 1000 thing. These guys make movies. All right. Check out her collection of shorts "Heartland" Horror stories and see the development. And I can vouch for working with them about the funny thing is that I do in my business. I backed into a harsh, insulting criticism of this film, it is interesting when one reviewer did not even hear a single word of dialogue, thinking about one idea or concept, or, if all that was desirable that work was visual gusset scrapes and fray to meet some senseless kind horror should mean for the audience. Let "Empty Acre" bring ourselves to you. Do not imagine in advance that you expect it to be, simply because it gets put in the horror / thriller genre because of its supernatural premise. It is a drama with depth because of how you can insert the blade of someone with respect to posts that do not attack the visual center of your brain, but rather relies on his sensitive imagination to experience the suffering of mind and spirit. Mark Ridgway, Curtis, Â«Empty Acre"
