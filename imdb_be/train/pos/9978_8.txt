I must say that I enjoyed Vanishing Point. I have seen the original, and it is a very good remake of this. While that did not follow the original story (which is why I gave it an 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good, and this is probably the best story. <br /> <br /> As for the car, good DJ's comment at the end of the Bidder's going 185 miles per hour in the bulldozer's pretty unlikely (and if you look at the speedometer needle rocking in 145-150), but even if I did not see one on the engine in a starting stage, where they exhibit the engine, the original story was boosting the Hemi, so that it is possible. For those of you who say that the aerodynamics prevent this, the normally aspirated Chrysler 300C today can go 168 miles per hour, and if you look at this thing, going on the road with him is like a collision brick wall against the wind 70 miles / h. in addition, when tested in a wind tunnel, if you put the air dam on the Challenger is likely to be more aerodynamic.
