weird, twisted story of Terry Gilliam's devastating virus all but a handful of people across the world and forcing them to move under the ground, and a man sent back in time to gather information about it is fantastic, dizzying, and stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis' best performance ever. <br /> <br /> what distinguishes the 12 Monkeys from the majority of the time travel sci-fi movies, Bruce Willis character actually has to do with the fact that the psychological effects of time travel, that is to say, not knowing what is the actual reality reality: a place, a time traveler comes and goes. In addition, the film recognizes that the things that have the past, can not be changed, and that the prevention of catastrophic events, in this case the recovery of said virus, can not be stopped or reversed. Willis argues, "It's already happened," while he is in a psychiatric hospital, the main dilemma of the film is woven into it is not banal, overdone plot to save the world, instead of this internal struggle Willis just to survive yourself. This is a fresh, innovative concept and it works well thanks to a tight script from the peoples and unique brand Gilliam dementia. <br /> <br /> In addition, 12 speaking monkey completely nonlinear and instead chooses to distort and bend the way the story is told expertly includes a bevy of ro znyh time sequences:. flashbacks, dreams, memories, past, present, future, and even a scene that rises from Hitchcock's Vertigo All serve to envelop the viewer in his disturbing cacophony of madness and futility <br /> <br /> Visually. Gil is a master of the desert and the shadow of resentment competing Tim Burton in his surprisingly bleak landscapes and images. With a cold, wide, and dropping cinematography, Gil dive into a colorless medium and darkness of his characters. Scenes often bathed in amazing antiseptic, dead white and help serve Unlike often rolled-on-insane characters. <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, Brad Pitt steals most of the scenes, filling them with the patented crazy, off-the-wall performance that deservedly got him an Oscar nomination. As already mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, the sun returning to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead reflect Cole as a simple, touching, tragic man in the street. Stowe is equally good as a psychologist Willis. It has its own, injecting her character as a wild energy and force, as it collapses under the weight of what she begins to believe false "religion." <br /> <br /> expert Gilliam, overwhelming and complex processing that might be routine action / sci-fi film 12 Monkeys is a convincing vision of a nightmare, a futuristic landscape. Its rich, well thought out, tangled plot with bravura performances from all the cast and his descendants, gloomy cinematography make this masterpiece of madness. Rating in my top 10 all the time, 12 Monkeys is a lavish spectacle of a dark film filled with brilliance. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10
