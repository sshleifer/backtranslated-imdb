I first saw it when he was prime minister for more than ten years ago. I saw it again today, and it's still a great influence on me. She fought one of the girl, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), who raped Jays (played by David Lipper), a classmate who likes to graze girls. Caitlin in the popular high school clique, but when she reveals that she raped clique turns against her, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). <br /> <br /> This film chronicles the struggle against Caitlin entire city, including the secondary school, which essentially allows athletes to determine the social environment that allows them to get away with what they want. <br /> <br /> tees and green are the main performers, and there's a real chemistry between the two of them throughout the film. All the actors in this film, which was inspired by real events, did a great job. She fought alone accurately reflects the essence of what it is like to be in high school (at least in 1995), and which has its own self-image and reputation on the map. Recommended. 10/10
