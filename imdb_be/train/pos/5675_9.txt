Blackadder 3, probably, Blackadder series, people at least have heard - it has basically the same principles as that of the second and fourth of them and has nothing revolutionary about it. But it's still great - blazing the Duke of Wellington and thick stupid Dr. Johnson (author of the first dictionary in English) make this series one will be considered. There are even more funny jokes, which will be delivered in this series, and it produces a sense of humor in the less well-known era - in a historically authentic and enjoyable episodes. BlackAdder third output is not the most famous and well known from the party, but the role of Rowan Atkinson as the butler to bad prince is funny and efficient to make one, and Hugh Laurie at his best in this series. Very good! 9/10
