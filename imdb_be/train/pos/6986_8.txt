If you learn the facts about UFOs, then this video is very important. "Meat" video is the comments made by Buzz Aldrin. He is without a doubt the best of America. Trained to be objective, fair and factual in their reports. Many astronauts from America, of all ages reported some kind of contact, or the preservation of UFO and there is a video of some of these missions. In the most extreme case something happens that requires further research aim continues. I think that this is evidence of the Base Aldrin shows that it is possible that other worlds might be interested in our progress. Like all supposedly documentary video, this one may be inclined, but it provides additional information and opinion from experienced American hero. Those do not come every day. Therefore, the fact that some people are not interested in the details should not detour from your content on the Internet. If nothing else, it's not fun, and I recommend you to look with an open heart.
