Skip McKay (Widmark) pick-pockets kendo (Jean Peters) purse which contains important microfiche which is intended for the communist cause. She currently are 2 federal agents who are waiting to pounce as soon as she continues her contact microfiche. However, Skip steals a purse on the subway under the noses of all, and so begins the hunt for him as the police and Joe (Richard Kiley) and candy that want microfiches ago. Skipping can be traced only through the UIA (Thelma Ritter), who sells information on criminals. He made it clear to miss what he stole is important and both sides want to film, but he intends to stay at a high price. This leads to Joy hunting after him, and the conflict between Joe and Jean, who fell in love with Skip. Joy has a deadline to deliver mikroshisaet to his boss. <br /> <br /> His film acting is good, and it is a good start, which gets you involved immediately. Its a bit unreal, like Jean Peters immediately fell in love with Widmark, but this point is necessary because otherwise why would she later falls short of Joe. Its a good movie.
