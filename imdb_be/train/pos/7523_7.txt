I saw this film at the International Film Festival in Palm Springs in 2006, and it's a movie, not a film, since he apparently was shot by HBO will be shown on their cable network this year. This film is like a page of Kabbalah and discipline fetish Pinup and B & D stag film actress, who has had enough talent to become a real actress. Page has a little more than that, and the film touches on some of its other roles in the simulation, but not enough to balance career icon 50-movie star. This film is supposedly based on the book Â«The Real Bettie Page" Richard Foster. He was shot in black and white for this 1950s nostalgia feeling. I have a book called "Bettie Page Pinup life Legends", which has many great pictures that tell about the career pages, and I have to say that this film is played in the film, with Gretchen Mol as the Page, many of those known photo very precisely. Mol himself with a black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page Bettie Page. Not only that, it is Bettie Page look, but she has a smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect. And her body as close as possible to the replica of the page as possible. Terrific casting. The history of the fine and tabloidesque and, of course, could be much better. But it's a pretty good TV movie. I would rate it 7.0 out of 10-point scale, and recommend this view, when it comes on TV.
