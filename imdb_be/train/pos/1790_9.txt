I love this movie, and this is a fine example of the danger of family, romantic love story, and a very sad story of the plot. Everything was just so perfect and wonderful about this movie. It was such a great blend of actors and actresses, and with some laughs and a lot of this film screams deserves to get a lot of awards. At the mention of the beautiful script, and although I would have to carry the film to a laptop and The Family Stone, it was sort of a lot smarter, sad and shiny than those films. The evening is about a love story between an old woman's dream to return to her youth, and her two daughters to stay with her while she is not very good. History dated so much is said and well, I was sitting on the edge of my seat. You really get to know all the characters, and to the end, I wanted to watch it again and again. It is surprisingly boring and vividly acted and schedule the film, which is really one of a kind and should be seen by all for how great it really is. All performances and strange film grabs your attention right from the start and never let go. I loved it and I'm so glad I watched it it was really strange movie ...
