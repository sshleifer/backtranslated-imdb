While it was filmed on the site of Florida National Guard, «Tigerland» totally reminded me of Fort Polk, La., Polygons, maneuvering areas, water belt and all. The film was pretty authentic and the characters look like the same to my MTA in 1974. The difference between the year Tigerland, 1971 and the shaft 1974 appears all the sergeants and instructors knew they were not going to go back to Vietnam as it it was pretty much everything, so that the training was very quiet - no problem at all. It was the forerunner of all our troubles in the 70s and 80s, which I know for a fact as I stayed in until 2004. I never heard anyone mention «Tigerland», but the army had realistic study of the village in ' etnama at various bases throughout the United States to Vietnam vets tell me that before the 1972 Basic and AIT can be quite rough and rugged because the coaches have been there and was instructed to teach the people of Vietnam cover these skills to do it, though this is not always the case. Both drill in the regiment, and then one of my Vietnam Vet NGOs when we became an instructor in basic training brigade at Fort Bliss, told me that there was nothing that they could do to someone is ready and people just need to figure and the figure for themselves. This film rates high.
