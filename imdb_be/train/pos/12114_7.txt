This film is clearly a low budget and was shot in British Columbia, Canada. Obstacles that had to be overcome to make this film persuasive (set in California and the late 60's to 80's) were well conceived.I believe that this is the best and most accurate version of the Zodiac murders that plagued the city of Vallejo and the Bay area from 1968- 19? (He was never caught) .Edward James Olmos (Det. Dave Toshio) and Dunda (Zodiac, while believed to be Arthur Leigh Allen as purified DNA and fingerprints) to play a game cat and mouse revisiting the scene of crime together, each of which tries to call another emotionally revelation.Olmos die from some type of terminal disease and knowing Dzundza did it still completely obsessed to the point of losing his family and become a full-blown alcoholic way.Dzundza by not paying attention and self absorbed (like all serial killers) to massacre left he wake.The only disappointment was the "top", which ended in the otherwise fairly accurate you are tired of the typical Hollywood fluff, or have an interest in the case of Zodiac, check it out.
