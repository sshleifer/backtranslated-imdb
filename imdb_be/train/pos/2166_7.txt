I'm not a big fan of Tim Matheson, but I have to admit I loved it film.It was dark, and a little piece of interfering with some of the scenes a bit harsh, I do not know whether to classify this film it a little bit SF and horror slash thriller.I saw it is about 2:00 am or so on my local TV channel there was nothing on so I decided to see it.If you have not seen this film ID recommending it is not really so bad, the characters are interesting enough, but not really I explored to its full potential, which could make this film more better.I don, t know when this movie went to the movies, but he felt that it was done on television, or go straight to video, I for one would like to buy it when it is, with DVD is in good agreement with my type film and has a little piece of the history of The X-Files attached to it.Government enterprises or running corporations involved in the bizarre Shadowy dealings.Overall good film.
