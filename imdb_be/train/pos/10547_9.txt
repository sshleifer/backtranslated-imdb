I watched the trailer on DVD after watching the movie, and I think that anyone who has seen it before watching the film would be very surprised and perhaps disappointed. He made much of the fact that the film was "director cube" and made it look like a horror movie, when in fact it is an absurdist comedy (spelling IMDb in does not seem to think that absurdist word but) reminds Rosencrantz and Guildernstern dead. <br /> <br /> I like the way the story builds up slowly at first and then gradually increases. I also like the fact that no explanation is given for what is happening in the film. That and the fact that the story is played mainly in only one set is the only one that respects the film is similar to a cube. I recommend it.
