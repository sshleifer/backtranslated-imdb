I was surprised that "" The Secret Fury '' was a pleasant good film ...... Probably because I did not have any expectations for this film ..... While the film does have this plot holes .. ... I would say that you could not guess who is behind the whole scheme, up to the end of the movie ..... At first I thought it was Robert Ryan, using the same method as "" Gaslight, "" where husband tries to drive his wife crazy, but I was wrong ...... The main problem with the film, they go to a completely different direction, which does not give any hint of the beginning. ..... I thought, Robert Ryan and Claudette Colbert is well carried its parts ...... Plus is, Vivian Vance, a great character actress who steals the scene in this ...... Those who love the cinema, which keeps you guessing, it will be like this ......
