I went to Fever Pitch with my mom, and I can say that we both loved it. This is not your typical romantic comedy where somebody misses for the other, and blah blah blah ... you did not expect the climate or the first kiss for them to finally get together. It was more real, because you've seen them through relationships, not the whole movie is about them coming together. People could really relate to the film because it does not seem extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations. It was very funny, and I think it was the best performance of Jimmy Fallon. So ... I would definitely recommend it!
