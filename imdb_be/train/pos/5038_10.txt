Which is a real treat and quite unexpected. This is what a real thriller film everything. I rushed to the video store, grabbed a movie without reading the entire annotation on the back and hoped for the best. I was totally amazed and delighted. I really enjoyed the actors and their characters. I thought they all gave high performance and make their characters realistic. The site was well thought out, well written and directed. He keep you interested from start to finish and never get bored for a single moment. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie for those who love thrillers, especially thrillers that go well and those that hold your attention. Defined 10 out of 10 from me.
