The Micro fraudsters Puppets are better there. In this short trio are craftsmen working in the recording studio. They finally get a look at Alice Van Doren (Christine McIntyre) singing voice of spring. Strange voice. Curly in drag heard Mrs. Bixby (Simon Boniface). MOU calls Curly Senior Cucaracha. Three puppets ultimately going to party, where Curly was going to get out of drag. They play a recording of spring voices and all goes well until the MOU does not destroy the record at the head of curly art. They end up with the help of Lucia sexlet until baritone does not recognize them and turn it off. Alice Van Doren catches on the boy screaming and hides behind a curtain to help them. All is well until baritone does not ask how Curly sings without the help of a phonograph discovers Alice behind the curtain. Three Stooges revealed to be frauds, but Alice's father discovers his daughter's talent and agrees that it should become a singer. Puppet that pelted the room. Excellent.
