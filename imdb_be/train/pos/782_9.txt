This is a very moving film about three forty-something best friends in a small town in England. Finds love and a hot new start with a younger piano instructor, when tragedy and heart changed forever. Definitely a movie to have a box of tissues with you! A powerful piece of work. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler !!! SPOILER ALERT !! Spoiler !! * <br /> <br /> The main character takes her young, beautiful piano instructor and warm romantic colors. Her two jealous "friends" play immature arbitrariness, which quickly leads to tragedy. She loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop. In the end, an unexpected surprise pulls them together. (In my opinion, it is not guaranteed forgiveness)
