Terrfic film with slightyly slow start - to give him a chance to start cooking. History is built in the interest and complexity. Characters and plot to undermine the expectations and clich√©s at all the right moments. Excellent place New York City - gritty, real - fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of "Sex and the City" - in fact, the whole movie is the antidote to the HBO / Hollywood notion of New York, sex and relationships. This is a rare film that treats its characters as honestly and compassionately. I loved it! A large cast with well-known performances of Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and her love interest (I forgot his name!).
