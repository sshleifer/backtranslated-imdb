For me, there is something so attractive low-budget science fiction and nostalgia. As a child in the 50s, and that's all that was. In 1957, I saw the "first man in space" in the movie theater with my dad. It was Marshall Thompson in the title role, and some other poor slob who got the title role. It is also about the space mission have deteriorated, where the astronaut turns grizzly killer. Scared good & Plenty straight at me. The memory of that nervous excitement still lives in me. Incredible Melting Man almost only recreate in full glorious color ... that is where the scenes were well covered. You just need to love it for what it is ...... a little over an hour darkly lit scenes, disgusting sounds and spooky music. Bravo!
