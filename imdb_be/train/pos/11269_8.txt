Ever wanted to know how Hollywood can go out to the Hayes Code was officially put into operation? Well, unfortunately, the "Convention City" is lost, so good just watching "Tarzan and His Mate" to find out. In 1934, there is a great amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh. Just look at the nude bathing Jane. While Tarzan is often thought of as a would-adventure films made for young boys and no one else, this picture proves that the series was initially very adult. Over seventy years later, he is still just as sexy as it was when it came out. < br /> <br /> In addition to the envelope Pull taboo at ode, this is a great and exciting adventure story. I've always enjoyed the jungle movies that Hollywood released in the 30's and 40's, but there are a few of the genre I would call great movies. "Tarzan and His Mate" is definitely best film of this sub-genre are long gone. The sequences of attacks on safari or monkeys or natives still manages to create tension today. in addition, the animals are too steep (espescially monkey throwing boulders). Actions will not win any major awards in the near future, but certainly more than enough for this type of image. The film once again stolen the Cheetah, the most intelligent monkey in the jungle. One of the most interesting examples in front of the Hollywood code there.
