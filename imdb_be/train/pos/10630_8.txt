I think, unfortunately, that the leading comments for this film include the words "Clueless and the monstrous nonsense." I think this is a very funny film, and great entertainment. Man must suspend their disbelief that homosexual men and lesbian women can fall in love, have a baby and live happily ever after. But it's always nice to see, he played in the movie and have one heart warms. Is it really so impossible? There are far more improbable events described in other films. Act well, the script is funny. The only negative comment is that the story may well end when the family goes from its original home instead of extending to examine whether the residual gay person retains.
