What a fun movie experience! I was expecting a juicy children's film, and found that I liked it more than my teens. Take a cloth, it is not sad, just "moving" part by part. Finally, his "feel good" flick for the whole family. Note: This is 2+ hours, so consider leaving the house the smallest «squirmers» for it. AP
