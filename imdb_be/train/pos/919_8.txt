As an advocate of "Columbo", I was very disappointed in "Corky Romano". Although, of course, a funny movie, mob boss character Falk was far from pretty lieutenants he played for many years, especially with the onset of the language he used. After "Corky Romano," I honestly surprised and spoiled by Peter Falk. However, only that he had seen "Finding John Christmas" and its predecessor, the "City Without Christmas" for the first time within a week of each other, I have to say that the "Max", a wonderful character Peter Falk in both films, It is of course, as memorable and eye-catching as the «Columbo». While parts of the film are predictable, such a scene does not take away from the pleasure of seeing the story played out. I also wish I recorded both touching Christmas movies and I highly recommend them if you're a fan Falk, a Christmas nut, or just someone who enjoys the occasional feel-good movie of the week. This film could end up getting lost in the crowd, made-for-TV movie festival, so be sure to find the "Finding John Christmas" before it is too late.
