What I expected :. Pretty lame too stereotypical image of a sports-crazy guy, and the same lame stereotypical image gal who loves him still suffering, being second banana of his overly zealous support of his favorite sports team <br /> <br /> What I got: dispassionate story where both guy and gal will eventually admit - to themselves and to each other - that each of them has a passion in my life has anyone can forgive others, to save his love they share. <br /> <br /> Sounds juicy, but with unrestrained humor and terrific performances this story works! Barrymore Barrymore is a classic: that perfect blend of sweet, strong and charming. We expect that from her, and she delivered. <br /> <br /> But Fallon is a pleasant surprise in this film. He brings to the role of the perfect combination of sports nut in conjunction with the assessment of the normal things in life, like taking care of children and his girlfriend. Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection. It can be caring ( "You just ran across the field to me!") And in the same breath to be selflessly blinded by his love for the Red Sox ( «As the grass feel? Kinda spongy?"), At the same time. Drawing Fallon "made "movie. let's hope that this film marks the beginning of a better film career for to Fallon, then the outside babble over-the-top humor typical SNL alum (ie, Will Ferrell). <br /> <br /> In short, the film which could have fallen prey to stereotypical male vs. female characters rose above this limit and provided non-stop spot rubber line-terrorism, the majority comes from the brilliant subtlety of Fallon <br /> <br /> Hey, I've seen it with my wife, -. not a fan of baseball - and she loved it as much as I do not, "Guy Flick»,. nor «Chick Flick». This is a terrific make-up you-laugh Flick. Go it!
