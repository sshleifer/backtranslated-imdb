Tommy Jones and Matt Dillon to make the gambling world proud. Various movements with the wrist was to learn how to throw the bones of the skill itself. <br /> <br /> There are a few surprises. AS cynical as we are today, I fully expect that the "good girl" to cry over his grave, and his Buddy. Especially with his comments about "going to the funeral of his best friend" when she first meets Matt. And then, of course, you expect Matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in the face of Mr. Allen, blinding him (Bruce Dern interesting role). WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! some of the other Hollywood endings happen, but to write so well, acting as carefully wrought that you are blissfully unaware. <br /> <br /> And the music is out of this world. Taking us in the 50s, when our "family passion" were the first to unleashing the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even a little racism raring its ugly head in Chicago, but the club is fine, "Biloxi" with a Confederate flag to support up racist remarks. I'll watch it again to hear the music. Well, I have Factotum soundtrack, so that I can listen to in the car. Watch both of them together, and you will see how Matt has matured .... play bar in both the number of characters. Now he owns a bar in the Paramount Hotel in New York City, he probably has a great opportunity to do their research. Great actor just coming into his own. It shows the subtle nuances of the performance ... good and bad in his heroes. His "boy from the farm" is an excellent study made particularly acute because of his basset hound eyes. He makes love, convincing as well. Since he has been in several movies with Diane Lane, as a teenager, I wonder how that ... makes love to the actress like you grew up with. Adds a conviction, I will say that.
