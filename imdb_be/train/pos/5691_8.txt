It was very interesting to see this movie when it first came out in theaters, but I could not get around it. So, in the end, he got on the shelf, and I took it. Not knowing what to expect, I plopped down on the DVD in the player settled in for an evening of murder, and pressed play. What followed was one of the most attractive movie I've seen in the last few years. <br /> <br /> Some SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is the story about the murder of Wonderland, which led to the seediest side of Los Angeles, and right at the very beginning of the big porn 70s, John Holmes (Val Kilmer ). <br /> <br /> I was hooked from the beginning, and the feeling of the film led me all the way to the bloody end. I was surprised to find that the film is less focused on real murders and more about the events before and after the study. Apart from a few walls of blood spilled in the beginning, i present the show kills near the end, the film was more or less attractive show large Dialoge and more action. Val Kilmer everything but sell me as an addict porn star, and even "beautiful, but it is his" Bosworth was a joy to watch (and only for her appearance, mind you) <br /> <br /> I personally feel the best aspect The film was, as I said, pointing to the absence of direct murder. This was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so that you can not fully see the hard hitting bestowed APON sleeping four. In addition, the sound effects of these murders have been more than enough to whet your appetite. They were knocking lead pipes, there is not much more you need to say. <br /> <br /> My only real problem was short Carrie Fisher in Physical. Her portrayal overly-religious figure was, it seems to me, a little too cliché her appearance. Perhaps this man was in fact part of the story, maybe not, but I was not sold out, and for some reason, Fischer seemed to be a bit too «akward» in its image. <br /> <br /> In general, a great movie worth watching, even if once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
