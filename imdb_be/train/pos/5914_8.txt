MPAA: Rated R for violence, language, nudity and drug Brief. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> I saw Coonskin today.This film is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight.After watch Fritz The Cat, I would like to see more movies in Baska. I saw a cool world, and thought it was mediocre, and I saw this.When it was first released, the film was very controversial.It considered racist Al Sharpton and wanted the film banned, he even led protests outside the theater where the movie was playing .The film was only released on VHS under the name «Street Fight» .It is now considered a cult classic film and the African-American celebrities, t Akiho as a comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and the rap group Wu-Tang clan say enjoyed it film.I personally thought Fritz The cat was much better than the movie, but it is very enjoyable as watching well.Worth Baska or movie fans .The black actors of the film mixes live action and animation like the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit.I would prefer to complete the animation, but KH atever.The film begins with a nun and another man racing to save his two one prison.While prisoners wait older friend tells the story of three muzhch he Eun knew.The film then goes into an animation format, we see three black men who had sold her house to this man.They decided to make names for themselves in Harlem.So leader, black rabbit, killing a major player in Harlem, and he basically it becomes large shot.The film goes into the Italian mafia want him out.The mafia godfather includes his three sons, who are homosexuals and Italian clown.Coonskin this entertaining animated movie that is worth checking out, if you can find it.
