I must say that this is one of the best animated films I have ever seen. I liked it the first time, but in fact it is assessed on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago. I can understand why the sequel does a great business at the box office. Apparently, many people love this movie. <br /> <br /> beautiful color palette (man, it looks good), and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor makes it a winner. Opening 3-4 minute scene from "Skat", well, like the next interlude with him. «Sid» bummer (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the film. He usually has something funny to say, throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the great hero of the film, literally, while Denis Leary February a bad guy turned good toothed tiger <br /> <br /> It's not just the humor and beautiful colors , but a good, sentimental story about how a small child softens hard couple of characters. This is not interrupted with a large number of songs, or :. Only one short one and there is nothing offensive, language wise <br /> <br /> If more animated movies were this good, I would have more.
