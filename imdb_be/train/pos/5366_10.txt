I'm sitting here Nov 2006 and I still can not rave about this movie. The best films of Arnold came about a gap of 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All 3 are amazing. Cheese Arnold liners in this film will make you laugh more than once. I think acting in this movie is surprisingly good, as was the Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job of trying to make a futuristic scene, presumably, will take place in 2017, but you can not help but chuckle at the '80s hairstyle on men and women in the crowd of ordinary television monitors in the studio running man we all know, here in 2006, on his way with the advent of flat panel HDTV-x. Also, computer graphics in the "Running Man" game show intro would not look like that in 2017. However, the plot is absolutely fantastic. More than once I wanted at the time of this film to get up and do not care about the finale, which is something I often with today's films. I really think that the incumbent Arnold a lot better than he has given credit. Now I would not have elected him governor, but it's California for you. The Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero fantastic "stalkers" and I think that the manufacturers do not try Overkill fight scenes. If the stalker is dead ... he's dead. He does not go for 20 minutes each. Stalker scene quickly and interesting, but they do not try and re-evaluate it. I give this film 10/10, and that comes from someone who does not use a lot of movies these days. If you get the right actors and the right story, the futuristic graphic displays that you see are not important or necessary in 2006.
