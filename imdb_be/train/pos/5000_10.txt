Zhetsony in America were to be released on a different network, or at least been given the opportunity to have a full run of episodes. Unfortunately, it was not so. Given that American audiences (at first glance) have concentration mosquito when it comes to humor, which is not a member of profanity laced diatribes has absorption scatological functions (such as sound and smell), shows how it is not enough, and far from each other. One of the main problems was that however brilliant it was, it was made for a sparse audience, who knew what to expect, but was viewed audience and meeting rooms that do not have a clue on what they saw. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show, even if it was made for direct DVD release. Material and interaction between beings were rich context south and were different conversations only and is waiting to be were beneath the surface. But thanks to political correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
