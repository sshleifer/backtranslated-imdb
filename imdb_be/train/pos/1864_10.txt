I just watched Antwone Fisher BRAVO. What a strange movie, and incredible young man. This film is a must see for anyone who has to deal with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment, as adults. Denzel Washington poses an excellent performance, as well as the young man who plays Antwone Fisher. Kleenex alert - Convenience and whiny. The most heartbreaking moment when he finally meets his mother, he was taken away from the age of 2 months. And one of the most daring when it came to his abusive foster mother and sister. I saw this movie on Bravo in 2008, and only wish I had known about this years ago. Definitely a movie to add to my DVD collection.
