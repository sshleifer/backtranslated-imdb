I intended to honor the 10th anniversary of the death of Marcello Mastroianni unwatched with many of his movies that I own on VHS; However, given my constant carefree Christmas marathon, I had to do with just that! As it happens, it shows one of his best performances - and it was true Oscar nominated him (with the film also honor). It was also one of the 14 collaborations with the second most widely recognized star come out of Italy, Sophia Loren; as, incidentally, playing against type here - it is like a housewife unpopular, and he was gay! <br /> <br /> By the way, the film's title has a double meaning: the leading characters are gathered in a historic day, when Hitler came to Italy to meet with Mussolini (the event itself are specified in the long-term archival materials), but more specifically refers to the stars " brief encounter "in which they share moments of friendship, discovery and, briefly, a passion - even though everyone knows that the return to a normal existence is inevitable, leading to a sharp bitter end of the film, it is actually two lefties (with all the other characters - with the exception of the curious concierge Shema tkvaternaga house in which the story takes place in its entirety - which include rough and zealously patriotic Lauren's husband, played by John Vernon surprisingly, appear only at the beginning and closing sequences); nevertheless cramped installation does not contain the director Scola (for the record, this is his seventh film I watched, and possess more than 3 on VHS) and cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis, so the result - although mostly low. Key - far from unnatural: the camera is allowed to scour the various sections of a large building, watching the work of intimate or indifferent, as required by the situation, but always keenly <br /> <br /> the story, of course, entirely dependent on the performance of the two stars for In order to be convincing, and they deliver (their on-screen chemistry completely comparable); it is interesting, however, that while Lauren went with prizes in their native land, is Mastroianni moves yet unsentimental outsider (film, some hesitantly, appears to equate his sexual deviant with anti-fascism!), which are generally amazed international audiences!
