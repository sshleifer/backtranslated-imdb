This film is one exception to the rule that a sequel worser than the original. His comedy at its best. This film is a fast action slapstick comedy, where something seems to happen every second. On more than one occasion the whole room laughed loudly at the joke. <br /> <br /> Its great advantage to have seen the first film, but it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 also has the advantage that a parody of the last decade, the production of reality series such as survivors (expediton: Robinson in Swedish) is a Swedish film for a Swedish audience. Thus, do not see it if you are not familiar with Sweden and its language. Otherwise: Good luck! Johan
