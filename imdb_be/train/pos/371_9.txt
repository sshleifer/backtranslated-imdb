I remember when this film was an Oscar and not win in any category. For life, I can not remember what it was against, but one thing I can say is it was one of the best films I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film does not try to persuade me one bit. <br /> <br /> In fact, we are talking about the trials and tribulations as she grows up from a girl to a woman black women. There are a lot of innuendo, waves and monstrous, but they all need to see how this woman put up. Along the way we see other women who have had to put up with their troubles and go with them to salvation. Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance ever in this film. Danny Glover must also have received at least nominated for her role in this film. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely, and not as some SIDESHOW freak show as the later "Beloved" did. I encourage anyone of any race, to see this movie. 9/10
