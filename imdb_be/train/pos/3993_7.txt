"Mother" is a surprisingly low-budget film, touching at least two inconvenient topic, as a rule, are not studied in the movie :. Refusal to love a mother for her own son and daughter, and lust and passion in the third age <br /> <br /> characters terrible May hideous old woman, and I believe that it is impossible to feel any sympathy or sorrow about it. She admits that she does not love her son and daughter. She deceived her husband twice intellectual. She steals his beloved daughter, not to protect it from a guy without a moral that does not love her, but because she felt with him horny. She's trying to arrange his life after losing her husband in the worst way, killing her daughter nonsense. Paula, her daughter, is brittle failure, which takes her life as it is. Her brother Bobby a man who had lost all their savings because of his wife, who insists that his store, business is really terrible. Darren immoral interested moron who does not love anyone, even himself <br /> <br /> The acting and direction perfectly :. Actresses and actors are excellent performances and the direction is very accurate. I liked this movie, but I recognize that it is recommended for a very specific audience. My vote is seven <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "Recome√ßar" ( "Re-Start")
