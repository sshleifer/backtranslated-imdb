I believe that this is one of the best films I've seen, I'm senior man and the love of most westerns. I love movies based at least partially on facts, if I'm not mistaken, this is the kind of movie. I also love movies like place, it qualifies there, and in my opinion.Some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with whipping and a barn shooting scene. I felt like beating the paddock scene was a bit excessive, but does not affect how I feel about the full movie. I saw what I think it is a continuation of the film in an episode of gun smoke. I also enjoyed that.I recommends taking the time to see this movie, I'll watch it again. I also felt that the romance of this film were well played. I thought it was so out of character for Randy Travis, to play the type of villain, but I always enjoy his action.
