Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic in a room with views, cooked Irish thief in the Name of the Father, arrogant, cruel butcher in Gangs of New York (by ten times stronger than Adrian Brody in the pianist) and how blatant Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). Its role affects all one each, but each individual, and totally unique. He changes completely with every character he takes on. And I'm starting to believe that it can act arbitrarily. All. <br /> <br /> As he Cristy Brown staggering. He did not make fun of the character, and he's not pathetic character. Heavy achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. Intelligent man. Outrageous people. Man. <br /> <br /> This film, in spite of minor malfunctions of a scene, etc., is a source of inspiration. Yes, it's predictable. But it's nothing sentimental? No, I laughed. I cried. Not one moment of cheese. Proof that this is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when Cristy discusses artists from Eileen, Peter and her friends. That's where Daniel Day-Lewis acting reaches its climax. "I'll kick you in a single part of your anatomy that is animated." "Rolls out the cripple!" And his work will never slow down, never end, and beautiful. Just. He has a lot of screen time here. I look at him again again, and I never get tired of Cristy shrewd eye to twitch and guttural speech. <br /> <br /> A must see. Fo sho, yo!
