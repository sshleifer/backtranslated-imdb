It's an amazing feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their children removed. I felt that instead of a movie ticket, I had to be given NAMBLA friendship <br /> <br /> On the basis of a respected book by Thomas Rockwell, How to Eat Fried Worms begins as any children's story :. Moving to a new city. A new baby, a fifth grader Billy Forrester was once popular, but it has to start all over again. Make friends is never easy, especially if the only prospect Adam Poindexter. Or to Erica, who is 4 1/2 feet, a giant. <br /> <br /> Further complicating Joe bully. His boyish face and shirt jackets confused. He opposes child with Death Ring: CrackerJack in the ring, which is rumored to kill you if you hit him. But not immediately. Nope, death ring releases a poison that kills you in a class of eight. <br /> <br /> Joe and evil axis privetstvennoma Bili smuggling handful slippery worms in its thermos. Once found, Billy played it cool, swore that he eats worms all the time. Then he throws them in the face, Joe. Ewww! In order to win them, Billy reluctantly makes a bet that he can eat 10 worms. Fried, cooked, pickled in a spicy sauce, squeezed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich. Each meal dubbed exotic name like "Radioactive Slime Delight", in which children are finally live my dream microwaving a living organism. <br /> <br /> If you have ever met me, you will know that I have a hearty laugh uncontrollably. I felt like a creep erupts on the kid whining that his "feeble-minded member of the" sore. But Fried Worms amazingly disgusting. As G-rated Farrelly brothers movie, it's like vomitous and beautiful. <br /> <br /> The author / director Bob Dolman also a savvy storyteller. To raise the stakes worms have consumed 7 pm. In addition, Billy holds a dark secret: he has an ultra-sensitive stomach <br /> <br /> Dolman also has a keen sense of perspective .. With such precision, it draws on children's unreliability and tendency to exaggerate the worldly dilemmas. <br /> <br /> If you exaggeration of this movie as children make their plight, you will see that it is mostly about the war. Freedom fighter and freedom hater use pubescent boys as pawns in proxy wars, only to learn a valuable lesson in unity.
