After watching this movie on the SF Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to hear about how to obtain a copy. Jim McKay gave a presentation (Q & A) of the film after it, who presented his paradox: how to get distribution for the film, which paints a minority (woman, non-white) working to resolve disputes (teenage pregnancy, teenage motherhood , race, single mother families), and how to write the correct script on all of these topics being in the mid-thirties white male. Multi-racial, multi-gender audience-mostly adults raved fantastic storyline of the film, detailed characters and fantastic image of the "real life of teenagers." Most teens, however, left the building - leading me to think that this film is best seen with older children as a starting point for discussion, and not, as many adults there felt "movie, teens need to see because it's about them." Thus, the distribution of questions - how do we get our hands on it? Internet (retail) will be a long way - it is a film that will be buried as «Pups» or other radical modern teen movies - and McKay seemed responsive. As to his credits as a writer / director, McKay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in their work - allying themselves in the area of ​​Crown Heights, where the film is set, working with the actors to reflect the character of its own vision of what they think should be - with the results being disarmingly realistic.
