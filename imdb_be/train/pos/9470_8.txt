I am not a supporter of Steve Carell, but I like this film about the Danes, advice columnist, who goes to her parents' home to live with their children, and ends up falling in love with the girlfriend of his brother. Its history, it will have been said before, but not like this. There are just too many small pieces that make the movie better than it should be. Acting is great, and even if Karel is not my cup of tea, it's pretty good as a widower, which provides, to know everything, but he believes that knowledge of different feelings and sometimes life surprises. Sometimes witty and wise in a way that annoys Hallmark card can be, the film still has some how manages to grow on you and be something more than the run of the mill film. Worth a look see
