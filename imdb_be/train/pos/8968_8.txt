This film was like any film, Jimmy Stewart, witty, charming, and very performance enjoyable.Kim Novak, Gillian, a beautiful witch who wants to be a man, gorgeous, her subtle facial expressions, her every movement and gesture, all create a unique and Gillian more intrusive nature, she left us hanging on her every word.I not fail to mention Ernie Kovacs and very flattering performances of Elsa Lanchester as the Scottish writer who loves obsessed with the world of magic (Kovacs), and the second, as an attractive aunt who can "t, it seems to stop using magic Even if denied to.The romantic scene between Stewart and Novak beautifully crafted and great chemistry between them, but then again, if it's the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady bad!
