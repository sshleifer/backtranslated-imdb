An excellent description of one of the patients aspects of the era. I loved the visual -. Very suitable for stories related to the graphic novel <br /> <br /> I thought that Tom Hanks was really great in that it came across very well, as someone who has been hardened his job (which he did not fully choose for themselves), but still wants to have a normal life for my family. He makes every effort to see that happen. I do not want to spoil the story - but you have to see this movie, if you are a person who wants more from a film than a conventional Shoot Â«Em Up action / gangster format. (This violent, though.)
