I never regarded the movie and enjoyed singing and dancing on Cagney and other actors, namely: Dick Powell, (Scott Blair), who had a great tenor and Ruby Keeler, (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays a role as Chester Kent, who wrote musicals and eventually goes into production input that occur between artistic films shown in the cinema during the 1930s. Chester has a problem with people who are trying to steal his ideas for his show. This is a very interesting movie with a lot of comedy and a lot of laughs. Joan Blondel (Nan Prescott) gave a big supporting role, which was very young and beautiful. Dick Powell was as big as a singer and dancer, and only since his long and successful screen career. Enjoy.
