Any witness of our system of justice - or the lack of will to find this movie really satisfactory. There were not too many shades of gray in relation to the characters or the plot. Almost every character in this movie represents what is best and worst of our society. The popularity of this film, probably due to the fact that most of us have at one time or another had to deal with the thugs with a weakling, coward, unarmed necked bureaucrats who extend them in the name of "political correctness". <br /> <br /> performance in all areas have been convincing. I sympathize with the victims of rape - and the same, and found that it's nice to see her wipe the smug, arrogant vices on behalf of their former striker. In particular, I found that the dam is one of the ugliest characters in all the films that I've seen, so it was nice to see her former victim's mouth shut forever. Lead rapist and psychopath was as ugly as it was the way that he offed his Dirty Harry loud grotesque fashion in the end. This was the only sequel to Dirty Harry saga, part of the first.
