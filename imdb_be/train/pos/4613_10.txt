This film is one of the Cheesiest sites I've seen. For me, this is what makes it so awesome! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis is very good at what they have achieved in the original Munsters series. At that time, there was less of farce, they still worked perfectly together «comedically.» I would like Yvonne De Carlo, and Lily, would have a more active participation of the site. She showed that she could do comedy in the original series, but it was largely wasted in this film. The film also stars great Sid Caesar, but, unfortunately, it does not have any cooperation with Guinea and Lewis. I think that some of the best work could come out of this.
