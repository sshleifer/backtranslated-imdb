This is an amazing classic monster movie from the 50s! I like to just watch the '50s as a whole as cars and music. Anyway, I love how the blob looks. I love it when everything is on the late night horror movie in a movie theater, and a blob comes and crashes the party. Another thing I love about it is that it happens all in one night, just like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> If Steve and Jane kissing, they see a meteor falling from space. Inside meteor blob. Every time a person uses a drop, it is becoming more and more. They are trying to convince people of the city of Blobby monster, but nobody believed them until later. Can Blobby stop this creature? I highly recommend BLOB !!!
