The title of this film is one made me want to see just what it was all so I taped this film in the first hours of the morning. If you ever wanted to see what the miners were to be held during the first days and really see the dramatic scene when mine is shatters in on men. This movie clearly wants to show that Germany and France can work together and be friends after the First World War, and the Germans came to the aid of the French miners much disbelief French citizens. The actors were outstanding, with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a young boy who worked in the mine. There is an old old retired miner who Manges descend into the mine on the stairs when the elevator breaks down. If you are a movie buff, this is a film you will not want to miss.
