Every time I see, Nicole, I love her more. I love movies like this. Women just do not give up, but she continues to break your heart. The first film I remember how it was Of Human Bondage, Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey version. In beef cattle the correctness of Russian spoken in this film petty, it was good enough to deceive me, or someone who can not speak Russian, I'm sure. It's funny how people miss the point. In non-goodnik Russian guys are well chosen, too. Finally, I have to tilt my hat Ben Chaplin, as someone pointed out that he was playing the juice with great dignity, and it was determined a little heat between him and Nicole. I think the guys are paying for it, stunning.
