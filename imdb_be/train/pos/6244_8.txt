Every country that has a working film industry has some dignity (and perhaps some insane) group, which make the movies that you can only fully understand, if you are part of this country. I think this film Hundstage. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level of society in Austria, dirty, disturbed, strange stink. But they still have enough money that they can afford to tuned cars and big houses. And they certainly do a lot of amazing things here, maybe it seems to have a "normal", because they make it through all his life. From the point of view of a normal person now you can easily keep track of the film and to be indignant or captured and watch a magnificent piece of art cinema in Austria. <br /> <br /> But if you live here and you know, people, you see the characters in the tumor Hundstage society. A society that will be more crazy every day, creating their own rules, which no one can understand, the cave inside the social system. And you see people. Sitting in the park, standing on the opposite corner of the street, turn in one and the same line. Maybe you meet him in a bar or in a disco you can visit. Maybe you even work with them to work or live near your home. You begin to hate them, without knowing exactly why. You will try to get away - but you can not. Maybe you'll end up like them. But it seems "normal" for you because you make it through the whole life now ... <br /> <br /> Life is not so bright, while Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. It has beautiful people ... but some of them also ugly. There are many hard-working people trying their best ... but there are some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that Austrian folk built so far. <br /> <br /> It is very pessimistic film.
