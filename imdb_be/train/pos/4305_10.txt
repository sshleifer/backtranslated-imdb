The Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. This is quite a unique piece of the city, where it joins the whole story would not be able to pass a lot. <br /> <br /> this is the central theme seems to be inherent uncertainty of life has a place for people of all races, backgrounds and stations. But to announce that the theme of the film is badly underestimates the scope thereof. Similarly, in order to classify it into a specific genre is useless. <br /> <br /> The film has volumes to say, though probably different volumes for each viewer, and say that everything is in a non-didactic way from many angles. that, in the end, I can not even determine its basic idea for yourself <br /> <br /> nevertheless, he does it deal with the laser precision; each leg, line of dialogue, as well as a bar background music contributes to this pervasive mood and a strong signal that I was pleasantly surprised to come out very thoughtful after each viewing. Nevertheless, he does not feel at all stuffy. Brilliant film with a great cast and it works.
