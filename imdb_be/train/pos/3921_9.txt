In Carmen, Saur again seeks to establish a dynamic relationship between reality and fiction, between the real passion of people in the dance training of choreography for the dance part of the opera Carmen and the scripting of passion from the history of the fictional Carmen, known fatal combination of a free spirit (read disregard for loyalty), and its ability to control men with the mind with desire. Sauro used the same car fantasy / reality in the earlier black-and-white ribbon, portends de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But, while tensions between the dancers rehearsing Blood Wedding showed an advantage as they have evolved into a fictional character stories to pass through directing their emotions in their roles, Carmen, a parallel between the small, libidinal intentions dancers squad during rehearsals and spirit forgings to do with the mythical Carmen never comes even close to probable. It remains a gadget and, for this reason, a bothersome distraction. One really needs to see Blood Wedding Carmen near to evaluate the comparison. However, this has a special significance, melodrama Saur trying to impose their karma, because flamenco guitar music with rehearsals_ which 95% _by film some of the most famous flamenco dancers and musicians, more than repays the cost of entry. An imperfect film, and no wonder: are ideal for drilling in the "negative capability," Keats, perhaps?
