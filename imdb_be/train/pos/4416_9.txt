Best Harvey Keital execution still new century. Very beautifully photographed, beautiful snapshot of the vast Castro in Cuba. The story revolves around a nephew of the local minor criminal, to develop friendship with the US with Hollywood connections. It's really about the moment when the boy wakes up to the fact that a small circle of people he knows, in fact, live in a much larger, much more complex world, it is not yet understand.the script strong and filled with humor, crisp direction. Overall, a very professional work, which fits well with the tradition of Latin American Cinema. One weakness of the decision to shoot in sync sound of the English language, not Spanish - likely to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately, this only makes the movie a little less convincing. But if you can see beyond that, you will find a hearty journey to another world. Recommended.
