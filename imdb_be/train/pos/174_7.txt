Solar, a cocktail waitress in the region PT, slightly dim, put in mildly. She drives an old clunker and rents a small room with a gay couple. However, she saves the life of a prominent Arab, taking a bullet in the back, which was for an officer. She captivates the national press with his idiotic remarks and her sweet looks. Sniffing an opportunity, aides to get it installed in the department of protocol for the US government. Even then, it spoils things from time to time, but she tries hard and learn a lot. She even captures the romantic attention of State Department officials. But there is another sinister plot in the making, with the participation of an Arab man, who wants to take a second wife? The blond one? LOL, LOL, LOL. This feature film Gold as pretty as a picture, and how dumb "as a fox", as they say. Sunny learns his way around the jungle of the US government is very, very good. She even has important things to say about the honesty and the absence of its surroundings protocol. Perhaps the Arab communities will be less than enthusiastic about this work, but also for anyone who loves to laugh, rent it today.
