I do not even know what to say about this film. it is one of the few films ever made that I would consider romantic. discourage the plot or the performance or technical details about the film will be in the words of Frank Zappa's "like dancing about architecture." it absolutely affects the nail right on the head as she picks up these fleeting moments in life that move us, and then run away from us never to be experienced again. it looks like a film version of the character Charlie Kaufman in the film adaptation of wanted to write. the ending is left open and ambiguous, entirely happy ending here, just a mystery. Sun profound life lessons, only a couple of horny and smart kids, who are investigating the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic feelings of romantic love ....... Sun <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 to watch it with a special lady, and recommend it to a stranger ................
