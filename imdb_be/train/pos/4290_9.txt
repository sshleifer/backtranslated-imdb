I think that Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. I can not understand why some people say that it is not so. Sad .... ??? Maybe someone who said she was bored because he / she is boring. She is a wonderful actress and the film was excellent. It has lots of great ideas and very good singers. The direction was great. I'm rendering themselves in the French environment with all the complexity and perfume, flowers, church, problems, etc. When she goes to the store's sister is just amazing. Everything is fine. We have a very good actress, beautiful, for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont perfect. I love him more than his next film LA SCIENCE DES RÃªves. And Eric Lartigau did a very good job. <br /> <br /> Ana
