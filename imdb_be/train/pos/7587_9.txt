I must say that I was impressed by the cinematography was strange, people, close to perfection because it creates tension around the object, which sounded more like a nightmarish hole out to be. <br /> <br /> The film is about two narrators, one saw, one invisible. They both try to explain a significant series of paintings, which caused a scandal for a long time ago. The film is all about the theories and explanations of views, but the conclusion is quite shocking, I must say. Definitely a film that deserves more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> With only 66 minutes to play the film's plot is still felt full operation. Fantastic destination! I must say, much better than the blood of a poet, he, for some strange reason, reminds me a bit. <br /> <br /> I guess you can call it by its slang word "pretentious". It's pretty much just a lot of talk about various professional theories and stunning visuals, but the crews and Ruiz did pull it off. At least for me. Amazing movie.
