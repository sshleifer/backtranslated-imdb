James Stewart and colleagues Sallavan play in the gift shop of Budapest, which is not really like each other, not knowing what they are really loved by correspondence, which has yet to meet. <br /> <br /> A very charming romantic comedy, a lot of fun playing this two cute stars and very eager to please, the support cast. The story is well written, and the film has romantic innocence (I do not know how to explain it), today movies simply do not have. This, obviously, can be compared with the recently you have mail, and original victory in all respects. <br /> <br /> Be sure to check it every Christmas, I can not think of a better way to jumpstart the Christmas feel, than this little gem.
