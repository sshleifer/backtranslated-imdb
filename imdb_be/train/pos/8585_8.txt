Dillman, reprising his role, unmistakable as a doubting the defender, whose courtship sometimes deviate to personal distress supportive, but some remote Riker's wife, played with aplomb Vera Miles. Rounding out the front line is Peter Graves for the prosecution, and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key supporting roles. <br /> <br /> nature interpretation Marvin Paul Ryker is a balanced way of simple, but is a dedicated person usually laid so the behavior challenged in desperate circumstances in which it is placed. Marvin switches different from humble indifference to hot determined, giving a convincing, often intense performance, which is the highlight of this otherwise small series drama. It was this work that should raise the film to the platform, where it takes place in the best ever list of court dramas. <br /> <br /> However, despite the seeming obscurity, "Sergeant Ryker» remains taut and exciting expertise as a book that you just can not put down. Highly recommended.
