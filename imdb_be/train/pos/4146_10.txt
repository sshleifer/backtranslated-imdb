Anyone who lived through the age of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpower appreciate this film. This is one of those films that deliver everything you want in the "spring break movie" Plus it makes fun of the movie genre college. It's funny, it has a cast to die (Amy Pohler! Sausages!, Sophie Monk!, Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Missi Pyle!) And it is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. Author / Actor sausage comic genius and Sophie Monk a great villain. Wilson Phillips! OMG! (I'm just repeating myself now ...) He will live with girls who like Miranda July, but I feel like eating an ice cream and pretend that they are stupid.
