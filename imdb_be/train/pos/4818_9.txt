I always have a little distrust, before watching British films of the period, because I usually have fresh and boring scripts (such as those, for example, Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl), but with a great design production landscapes of Europe and the thick British accents that make films to offer artistic value which they do not really have.Fortunately, excellent film the Young Victoria does not fall to this situation, and it deserves captured recommendation because of its fascinating history, excellent performances with Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Brough bento, and costumes, and locations that suddenly makes the film very rich in view.And I say "surprisingly" because I usually do not pay too much attention to these details. <br /> <br /> «Victorian era" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key moments in the modern civilization, not only on the social aspect, but also in the scientific, artistic and cultural ones.B in, I honestly did not know the origin of that era a lot, and perhaps due to the fact that I liked is the simplification of political and economic events that have prepared the landing of the modern era, so much.I also liked the way in which depicted Queen Victoria, who as a young and intelligent monarch, whose decisions were not always good, but they are at least Nathu nonyya good intentions.I also found a picture of a romance between Victoria and Prince Albert is very interesting, because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects and emotions he evokes.The not only I found on this film is that the script writer Julian Fellowes has used some of the clichés of romantic movies on the love story, something that feels a little silly on his scripts. <br /> <br /> I like the Young Victoria very much, and I really made a very pleasant surprise with it.I hope that longer period grind films ivatstsa example of this film: the costumes and scenery should work as support for an interesting story, and not as a substitute for it.
