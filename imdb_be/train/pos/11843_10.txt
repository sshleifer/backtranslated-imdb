Spirit prairie is common excellent film. Mixing types of animation is unique, the plot is amazing, and the music is wonderful. <br /> <br /> drawn animation special thing about the numerous animations. As they develop the characters, especially horses, through their animations are spectacular, especially. While the way horses communicate using body language is easy to understand, a lot of small children and people who have not studied the horse could not understand. Without a word, I would suggest that it would have to be challenging to express them using functions. Because of this, I understand the "eyebrow", they added to the horses (while the real horse does not have the thick lines). One of the few things that I noticed about the horse habits that could be painted surprising that the Spirit guides the flock of his mother. In the wild horse herd, leading stallion usually chases the young foals with. <br /> <br /> In addition, while some people may think, drawing white army officers as "bad guys" in the stereotypical, think of all the movies in which Native Americans were portrayed as. Sometimes then; they treat the Mustang very bad. For example, in the real history, the Appaloosa breed was almost destroyed because of military officers. Imagine what would happen to one of the worlds most loved horse breeds, when Native Americans have not kept them. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how realistic Sun subtracted, making horses communicate with each other, a sense of the spirit manifested little narrative, but mostly through music (Bryan Adams). The songs express the story very well, and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams did a great job of telling the story with the help of melodies and lyrics. <br /> <br /> I got emotional while watching a movie, whether it's the first time or twenties (yes, I have observed that a lot), you will not believe. Some of the scenes are breathtaking, while others seem to get tears in your eyes. Opening sequence showing the home spirit, puts you right in the exciting action immediately. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why some people are so hated by the brilliant film. Overall, I rate it 10/10 - need to look at.
