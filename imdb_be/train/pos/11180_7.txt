Creating the book in the movie, following the pager page of history is never a good idea. When people read the book, they will automatically begin to make their own "mental movie" about who the characters look, the place they exist in how the progress of the situation. And the mind's eye opus of each of us is different, so when the "real" film, finally comes, you'll always have a tick-off the current segment of the movie audience, who are disappointed that he just does not measure up. <br /> <br /> All the screenwriter and the director can hope to achieve, regardless of their own vision of the film, and hopes that it comes as close as possible to the fact that their audit oryi expects to see. <br /> <br /> There's no better case for this situation than in a movie based on the novel by Stephen King. If the filmmakers to capture at least the essence of its history, the results can be spectacular and really scary ( carrie, «Salem LOT, dead zone), or they may be what fans consider to be Gawd-awful mess (version Kubrick with SHINING, miniseries for iT and TOMMYKNOCKERS). <br /> <br /> Despite the that it is not even close to the ideal king adaptation Pet Sematary has so many moments just skin and bones and-deep embarrassment that seemed to be blood on the screen directly from the book, you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings. To do this, we have a music video directed by Mary Lambert turned to thank him, (she also directed a siesta, it is not a horror film, but another mad-as-hell must-see, you should put on your list), works with scenario "People-ster" himself, and probably one of his best. <br /> <br /> As most of you know the story, I will not put you to sleep too much detail. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) moved his family to the perfect house in the country. Well, almost perfect, except for the two nasty little items, except: dangerous occupation area of ​​the interstate road ahead, and a great pet cemetery in the woods again. Since Louis veterinarian and young small for his son ... well, even if you have not read the book, do frickin 'mathematics. This is the story of the king, in the end, so it is not a mystery where it's headed. <br /> <br /> This is not a place that is considered here, but terrible stop along the way. Some scenes are so familiar with the books brought to the break-up, shout induces life here Rachel Creed (STAR ​​TREK'S Denise Crosby) a horrible memory of her terminally ill, lame sister; Louis meeting of fatally injured runner Viktor Pascow (Brad Greenquist) both before and after his death; a trip to the "other" outside the cemetery pet cemetery. And the third act ... if it does not give you a few nightmares, maybe you should check your pulse. <br /> <br /> Good performances all here, especially late Fred Gwynne as a well-meaning neighbor, Jud Crandall, who gets the best line in the history that summarizes it all: "Sometimes, dead is better." <br /> <br /> On a single problem with the version of the film is the casting of his son Louis, Gage (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be virtually impossible to get a hell of a performance required by small that age, to seal the deal on this, Lambert and crew still did everything they could, and, unfortunately, at the Hughes time was just too damn cute to "sell" a certain role as an evil, possessed zombies. It takes you out of the film, when it appears, at the stage where it is still featured elaborately staged, (especially the scene in Guinea's death.) <br /> <br /> Apart from that, everything else is still so as good as it gets. CARRIE still holds the title for the best adaptation of the King, as I understand it; Sematary but right up there in the top five. <br /> <br /> However, nothing will be adapted for the screen based on the book of the king as bad as reading a story? BLOODY nya ... probably today.
