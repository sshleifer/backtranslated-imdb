I did not feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed, thought that it was, but still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This is the original, but reminded me a little bit about the other two French films, Vidocq and the City of Lost Children, mainly for painting, but also for the quality of acute characters close the window. <, Br /> <br /> Set in a prison cell, but do not let this put you off, this film would seem to go further than a lot of multi locationed blockbuster. <br /> <br /> It is always interesting, with many years of «Black Arts» and in the foreground and a very good characteristic makes some very plausible! <br /> <br /> A terrible with a gusset is well worth viewing.
