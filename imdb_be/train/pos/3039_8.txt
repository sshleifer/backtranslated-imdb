Frank McCarthy, produced the Oscar winning biopic Patton follows it up with a strong tribute to other military generals of America, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characteristic of the man, his genius, and his self-esteem. With MacArthur, you never know where exactly one began and the other ended up too many times and they are mixed. <br /> <br /> The whole story would be MacArthur's six o'clock movie or mini-series. It will cover it from days at border posts with his family in their time at West Point, where he still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved by a cadet. It will talk about his service in the Philippines, as a young officer, his legend building courage on the battlefields of the First World War in France. In addition, one would have to say about him fire on demonstrators Bonus veterans of World War I in 1932, it is likely to put the final kabosh on any chances of President Herbert Hoover in getting re-elected. In recent years, he and MacArthur Hoover penthouse at the Waldorf Astoria in New York. This should be the subject to avoid them. <br /> <br /> This film focuses on the years one thousand nine hundred forty-one by 1952, and it is said in his memoirs. The film begins with MacArthur addressing students in 1962, as he says the word famous speech Duty Honor Country, MacArthur mind goes back to World War II and his desperate struggle against the advancing Japanese on the island of Corregidor and Bataan region in Luzon. The film takes him in his fight to win back the Phillipines, Japan, the occupation and the first 18 months, culminating in his help President Truman team. <br /> <br /> MacArthur, as the film will not work at all if it was not for the images Dan O'Herlihy and Edda Flanders as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman, respectively. This part of the movie I enjoyed best by seeing MacArthur and his relationship with both of these people. <br /> <br /> FDR on O'Herlihy captures aristocratic squire and extremely treacherous man, who was president of our thirty-two. Roosevelt was a man who got his glasses on an unusual subtlety and dexterity. Sometimes he liked to intrigue a little too much for his own good, but he was a master politician of the last century. Notice how he is dealing with and MacArthur as commander on the battlefield, and a potential enemy, at the same time. <br /> <br /> Truman Flanders as people remember him saying stupid people from those who did not like the arrogance of MacArthur gitgo, of course, in the history books as Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was insubordinate, no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> However, I could write a thesis on relations Truman-MacArthur. Along the way, he does not ever come to a crisis. I always felt that FDR would have dealt with the whole matter in a much better way if he was still president,. <br /> <br /> MacArthur was also magnificently eloquent and Gregory Peck captures some of this rhetoric in some speech that made him as much a legend as a victory on the battlefield. Listen Peck in the surrender of Japan, MacArthur's farewell to the nation before a joint session of Congress, and of course his performance cadets in 1962 to watch newsreels and see if you do not agree.
