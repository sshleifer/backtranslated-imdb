Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some people come to the ivory and take Jane back to civilization. But Jane Tarzan loves and refuses to leave. One man falls in love with Jane and decided to take it back ... even if it means killing Tarzan <br /> <br /> This is a rarity. - continuation of, that is better than the original. "Tarzan, the ape man" 1932 was good, but had some awful special effects and if pulled. This one has a much better effect, and much more adult. There are tons of blatant racism (the black man shot point blank with death - and no one cares), but it was 1934. There is also a lot of blood, blood and violence (1934 film) and directing Jane prints make a long underwater swim fully nude! There's also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane are wearing next to nothing, and (it means) they sleep together and sex - without being married. It will not bother anyone today, but in 1934 it was pretty extreme. <br /> <br /> That aside, the film is accurate, very fast moving and full of adventure and risk. Seeing Weissmuller in this poor tissue Lion is definitely a treat for the eyes and Jane outfit pretty revealing as well. I still think that bad Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane, but Weismuller perfect, like Tarzan. Everything else is fine <br /> <br /> This is easily the best Weismuller. - O'Hara Tarzan there. Worth seeing, but not for children!
