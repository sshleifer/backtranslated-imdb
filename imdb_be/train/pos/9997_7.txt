Life Stinks (one thousand nine hundred ninety-one) was a step below other industries Mel Brooks. He stars as a rich man who is crazy bet with his "friends". Brooks argues that it can life as a homeless for a month. It shocked and entertained friends to take this unusual bet. During his "stay" in Bauer, he meets a strange bunch of homeless people, one of them catches his fancy (Lesley-Ann Warren). They strike a friendship as she teaches him a lot of tricks that she had learned while living on the street. Mr. Brooks can survive on its own without the luxury of being filthy rich? Will he win this extraordinary pledge? Who his real friends? Find out when you watch LIFE stinks to find out! <br /> <br /> This film was unfair slag. Of course, this is not a classic like his earlier films, but it's still nice. I liked the way Mel Brooks gives Charlie Chaplin in the film. If you watched the early silent films of Chaplin, then you will get the humor as well. <br /> <br /> It is recommended for fans of Mel Brooks.
