Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Even before I knew this film was about, these names were enough to make me. Beautiful, talented and popular, these artists to watch. <br /> <br /> So, where do you start. We already know that the film. Five beautiful girls be targeted by "romantic" serial slasher, the guy they all turned down at a school dance 13 years ago. His trademark includes thin deaththreats disguised as Valentine, maggots swarming sweets and nose bleeding. His weapon of choice: Well, take a pick - ax, knife, electric PowerDrill, bow and arrow, the hot iron, etc. Okay, so basically this is a horror movie with a good sense of twisted sexuality <br /> <br /. > Horror movies do not have to be Shakespeare, but I will not go there. I love horror movies, but not all of them. This one I love. This is up there with some of my favorite. It's funny, sexy and scary. Mask killer child badly and seeing the cupid's bow and arrow as a sacrifice is really crazy. There are first-rate: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton, David Boreanaz and a lot of fun. I would really like to see a lot more Katherine Heigl. I am one of her biggest fans and wanted to see what she was doing some major work in the near future. Kepy very capable actress, and Jessica Coffey gets done ditzy blonde role, she concluded in Urban Legend 2. The smaller pieces were also good; Hedy Buress was a hoot ( «bleedmedry.com»), and a younger version of Denise Richards looked frighteningly like it <br /> <br /> Features :. Each scene of death was much difference to him. Creepiest be the opening scene in the morgue. Hottub scene, while funny, was well done. And audio-visual labyrinth was ominous. The soundtrack is excellent, with terrible music and some fine tunes alternate <br /> <br /> Lowpoint :. I felt that the killer had not been shown sufficiently, we just saw a mask and it was not represented at all the time of menopause. I also thought that the climax was really focused, but fun nonetheless. <br /> <br /> Turn the end, is not that a big surprise, but I am very happy that the filmmakers decided to spare us that the whole "explaining killer" routine. <br /> <br /> I do not like to tell people what they need to see movies, but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie, which I thought was really worth a look, then Valentina will. it <br /> <br /> My rating: (! Bulls) 10/10
