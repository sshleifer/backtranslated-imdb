I tried to find out about this series for the ages! Thank you, IMDb! I saw it as a child and was never fully able to get it out of my mind. The 6-year-old, of course, I was particularly surprised by the episode of the Cyclops, which was absolutely terrible (I talked about it so much that my older brother gave me a Cyclops with a plastic caveman figure, which I still do), I remember, though, was the atmosphere, which was unusual at the outset - the mysterious, strong and very authentic. When I read the original for many years, I felt the same feeling. This is a very difficult thing to capture - and probably impossible in Hollywood. Each "Odyssey" I saw, as it was a huge let down. Characters in this series seemed to be real, real people - the ancient Greek people - and not some Hollywood stars are wearing suits. This is a true masterpiece! But - why is not known? And why is it not available on VHS or DVD? I would just like to be able to see it again!
