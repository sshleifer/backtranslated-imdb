Like a drunken millionaire playboy Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is ideal as an adult trapped in a kid. As it turned out, the role suited Moore so great that trapped him as an actor as well. Many disappointment soon followed (including the pale for this film), but this does not detract from the charm and appeal of this painting, which skillfully screenwriter and director. Some of the drunken scenes Walls forces, parts of the film are fragile, but the cast performs as many relishes a heavy film to resist. It has a very big heart and gives an Oscar-winning John Gielgud tricky, dryly funny role as Arthur's valet Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport. Liza Minnelli (as blue collar love interest) is arrogant in restrained and Moore is cocky, but agile and lively; he never shook off the shadow of Arthur's, but at least we have this document a career-high points to cherish. *** from ****
