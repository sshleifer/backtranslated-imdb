One of the best kung-fu movies, but not as flawless as I'd hoped, given the glowing reviews. The film begins well enough to be quite visual jokes that they translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you'd think for that era) and make the dialogue without a fight sequence passable (for kung fu movie, it is a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action films, which have always been objects of antiquity or (as a result of Police Story Jackie Chan I) police dramas, Pedicab driver gives us a look at today's rural China. Unfortunately, in the last third of the film, he takes a peak in a dark melodrama tragedy, I thought that there was no need. <br /> <br /> The campaign as a whole is good, showing a fight between the summit and 1/2 Shaw Brothers' only 2 stars to Lau Kar-Leung, and then fight to the end so that the higher the guy who always plays the bad guy Jet Li. There's only 20 minutes of battle here, which is the standard, but what annoys me is the obvious forcing of the camera frame. I understand that they have to shoot half the speed, so as not to hurt each other, but there is a smooth edits, and then eat it. It really takes away from the contractions, when it is obvious that the footage had been messed with. <br /> <br /> However, if you want to kung fu movies, my opinion here is not to discourage you, and if you do not, you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this.
