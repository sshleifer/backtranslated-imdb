Vivah in my opinion, is the best film of 2006, based on the director who has been successful throughout his career. I'm not too interested in romantic films these days, because I see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable. However, I have seen this movie three times in a row ... and believe me, it's an amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Vivah goes back to the traditional route, showing the simple symbols within a reasonable and realistic story about the journey between betrothal and marriage. The film is entertaining in all manners, how can it be reflected what we do (or will do), when it comes to marriage. In this sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya done his homework well and painted a very realistic story in a well-made film is very exciting <br /> <br /> A few sequences in this movie to catch your interest immediately :. <br /> <br /> * If Shahid Kapoor comes to the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way he tries to look at it without making it too obvious to him and her family. The song «Do Anjaane Ajnabi» blends well with the mood of the scene <br /> <br /> * the first conversation between Shahid and Amrita, when it comes to her. - that is, Shahid shy, not knowing exactly what to talk about, but pull out a decent conversation. Also naive character of Amrita in limited eye contact, shy characteristics and quietly answers questions shahid. <br /> <br /> * Emotional distress Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) if it feeds him at a party in the form of foreign Shahid daughter, not his uncle's favorite niece. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the film belongs Amrita Rao all the way. Actress Poonam reflects the role with such conviction that you can not imagine someone else instead. She looks beautiful throughout the film, and reflects an innocent and shy girl traditional fine. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor performs brilliantly too. It provides a promising job and shows that he is not less than Salman Khan when it comes to filming Sooraj R. Barjatya. In fact, Shahid and Amrita make a cute couple on screen, without a shadow of a doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (excellent), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (very good) <br /> <br /> In general, Vivah delivers what he promised, well done and realistic story of two families. . film has a top-notch presentation, great story and great music to suit the film, as well as being aimed at the fabulous Sooraj R. Barjatya. This is a must see!
