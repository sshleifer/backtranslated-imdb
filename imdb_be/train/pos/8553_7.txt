I just watched the film, I was afraid it was going to disappoint me. I was very surprised in the end though. American Pie franchise is still my favorite movie franchises of all time. Yes, it would not be fair if I say that I enjoyed it as mush as I enjoyed the original. Beta house together with the previous two pies determined lost something that the first two pies had.it not going to become a classic, the first two have already done. but what the hell, it's still funny with a lot of good points, and I think it should be the first to choose a movie, if you want to have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school. Beta House deserves a 6/10, but I gave it a 7/10 only because another piece of cake.
