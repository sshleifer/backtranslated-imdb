Visual creative epic inimitable style. <br /> <br /> This film can neither be the most alternative drama, nor the most artistic effect. But who would dare to say that this film is not art? I do not support the idea that an important film should be a serious, non-profit or bother me questions. Even there are a lot of movies, appropriate to the attributes that I like. <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey, probably not one of these films. What you get clear, excessive work very positively charged, children's energy. This film does not reflect reality. Its friendly naive and utopian. Imagine the future of the world, described Rufus - for me it would be a very nice combination of time, place to live! Except for the music; -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus is very well done on the road. I've always loved cinema and landscapes of this film. Especially in this time of Bogus Journey atop its prequel far. Also, the effects are good, and I think most of them are very done without computer graphics. I generally prefer the good old effects of large budget films. Of course, his "just another Hollywood movie" with some people watching. But I think it is a very charismatic way to <br /> <br /> short word for the soundtrack :. All band and orchestral music fits very well in the film. In addition, the sound design is not lacking. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I had to get this track Winger of "stations" of the scene by building and Ted robots in the van. . I love the unorthodox camera work at the beginning <br /> <br /> In conclusion, let me say this: <br /> <br /> This film is very naive and very creative! This is much better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, The Godfather, gum or Aguirre - the wrath of God. It is absolutely superior to Citizen Kane, apocalypse now or Chris Marker SANS Soleil ... ... it's even better than Total Recall ... No way! Yes way! <br /> <br /> Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is just the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Who would dare to disagree makes himself guilty of Â«artsie-Fartsy behavior" or the likes Terminator Salvation (which is a more self-defamation) <br /> <br /> PS: Part 1 is not better film. Bogus so the road is an excellent sequel. Even without Terminator 2 is the perfect sequel! It's not!
