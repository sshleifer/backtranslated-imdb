I love the way this game can make you literally jump out of his seat, while you play it. So that the jumping screen and flashes when you get hit, it is very realistic and at the same time you have to remember that it's just a game, and you're not really there. Sound effects and sound amazing. There are a lot of weapons and a variety of spells to cast, and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not. You get this stone, which can upset the enemy until you restore mana to blast your enemy with even more magic. The best part is that all this time you play it you are really nervous and afraid of what might be lurking around the next corner or may jump because of you. If you want to get the full experience, try to play it with the head phones on.
