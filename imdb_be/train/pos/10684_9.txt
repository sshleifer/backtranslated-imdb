Watching this early work of Demi, he was once again reinforced to me that sooner DeMille is far superior to the end of DeMille. His attention to the use of light in the scene is remarkable. His pacing is very good, allowing you to tell a lot about an hour or so. It is a pity that he was not intuitive style of his later sound films, he appeared in his silent films. <br /> <br /> It was the first film in which I saw Cleo Ridgely. She was beautiful, very discreet and at the same passed wide range of emotions. <br /> <br /> The ending is great.
