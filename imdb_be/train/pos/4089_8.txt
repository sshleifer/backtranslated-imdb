Oddly erotic gothic schlock horror film that will be loved by the Hammer House of horror fans around the world. This appears to be an interesting take on the "Beauty and the Beast." It is definitely worth a look and a surprisingly well acted, taking into account the genre and era. <br /> <br /> corsets, castles, rutting horses that rage artificial fur monsters in the woods, is proof that no one was Brazilian in the 70s, and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick that more could you possibly want? <br /> <br /> This, of course, cleared my Sunday afternoon!
