Pegg had several hits in the past few years, starting with «Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, a film on the «Hot Fuzz 2007", at the beginning of 2008, he came out of the «Run Fat Boy Run» and now goes for it, " how to lose friends and Alienate People, "which in many ways, one of my favorite comedy's per year. <br /> <br /> film about Sidney Yound, the person who writes a failing magazine, which makes fun of celebrities, mainly because he is not one of them. Anyway, one of the most successful magazine owner (played by Jeff Bridges) invites him (because of nostalgia) to work in his magazine. Sidney, of course, excited and moved to America, where he meets a girl, she is currently writing a book, and hilarity ensues. <br /> <br /> This film is great, and I hope more will come out like this in the near future. Pegg once again gave people around the world still a good movie, and I can not wait to see the third part of the Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy "Paul." I rate this film is 81%.
