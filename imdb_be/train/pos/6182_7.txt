This murder mystery with musical numbers for a long time in the atmosphere and character, but rather short on suspense and credibility. Based on the stage play Broadway showman Earl Carroll and others, he combines the whodunit plot with backstage atmosphere (murder investigation going on at the premiere of the theater where the musical revue currently staged). <br /> <br /> in the roles of impressive and varied: hard-stupid Victor McLaglen as a police officer leading the investigation and will not fail in a rail idiotic that the statistics is in sight; Jack Oakie (Jack Lemmon ?? pre-war or post-war was Jack Lemmon Jack Oakie?) How worried director who would coordinate the work staged, as well as the chaos behind the scenes; Hard times nondescript Jessie Ralph as a wardrobe mistress with deep dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, which has a stunning close-up of a monologue near the end, as a timid maid madly in love with the male role; Carl Brisson, Danish star as the same male lead, trills classic "Cocktails for Two" not once, but twice; Kitty Carlisle, operatically delivery "Where do they come from and where they go" and other songs Johnston-Coslow; Nice Gertrude Michael, who was separated from us too soon, as a mean-spirited dancer whose love for Brisson will be rejected; usually funny Toby Wing, which is at least the center of the breakdown of laughter running joke. <br /> <br /> If the plot complications get out of hand there is always interesting artist or a fun and melodic musical number, in order to distract the viewer. the most famous film sequence is the number of «Marahuana», headed by Michaels, but aside from its controversial history, it really is one of the smaller musical offerings. All songs are treated as if they could actually fit into a standard proscenium theater space, in contrast to the cinematic fantasy setting in the style of Busby Berkeley.
