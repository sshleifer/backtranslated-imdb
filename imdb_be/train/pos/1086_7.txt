This film is a bit unusual in that it has a very thin plot and the film is made at a very slow and leisurely pace. While this makes it very different from the average film Grant, he is still very watchable and entertaining. It's like someone said "let's just stick to Cary and watch as it gets perturbed at all the little problems that occur if you have a house rehabbedÂ». Given that it is a fun actor in the movie, and a lot of support it receives from the Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas, the film works very well. Although the film has a rather modest claims, it does most of the material. This is a great movie for those who like Cary Grant or for the whole family.
