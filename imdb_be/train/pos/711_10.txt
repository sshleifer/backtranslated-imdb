"Rock 'n' Roll High School" will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate breakaway party Flick. Drawing bunch of high school students using music The Ramones', as an inspiration to revolt against their despotic principal (Mary Raven, with "Eating Raoul "fame), the whole film a mile a minute. This is basically a great excuse to have fun, and I'm sure you will. Scoff freshmen? Check. Dumb music teacher (Paul Bartel, as well as from the" Jerzy Raul "*) ? Check. What explodes mice? Checkmate. <br /> <br /> In any attack ku, it's kind of the stuff that makes life worth living. Even for someone like me who does not know the music of The Ramones', it is a pure pleasure. With the production of Roger Corman executive, and Joe Dante together direction, how could we expect anything less? . it is a pity that the director Alan sheet later turned into a tariff, such as the «Caddyshack II» <br /> <br /> also starring: PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (appearing in each of the Joe Dante film, and many of the Roger Corman), Don Steele, and, of course, the Ramones. A real treat. <br /> <br /> It seems that Barthel and Ravens have always acted. They are also one of the main roles in Joe Dante's "Hollywood Boulevard" and the chopper click "butcher Mall" (also starring Dick Miller) ... in which they fulfill their role with "Jerzy Raoul."
