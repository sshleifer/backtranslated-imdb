I'm shocked. Shocked and alarmed that 428 of you IMDB users voted for me did not give this film a rating higher than 7. 7 ?! ?? - a C!. If I could give FOBH 20, I'd love to do it. This film has a prominent place at the top of the pantheon of modern comedy, along with soggy and Mallrats, as one of the funniest movies of all time. If you know _anything_ of rap music - you have to see it !! If you do not know anything about rap music - learn something and then see it! Compare «Spinal Tap» unable to assess the inspired genius of this unique film. If you like Bob Roberts, you'll love it. Careful and vote him 10!
