This is a great stand-up DVD! Izzard is the funniest person I've seen in years. His routine is fun and makes for a great conversation with those who saw him. I highly recommend this. Part of the history of Europe is a bit slow, but the ending jokes in French quite well, because you do not have to speak French to get it (though if you do, it's still fun). In addition, details about a transvestite pretty good. The first scene (near San Francisco), is not great, but funny the first time. Skip it if you can. It's almost not worth watching. Nevertheless, it is really funny, funny stand-up show that everyone should see. "I was dead at this time!"
