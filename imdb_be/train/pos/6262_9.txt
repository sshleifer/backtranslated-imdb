It was incredible, it means that it was hard to believe that "the forgotten tribe" would have made this amazing migration of twice a year, as well as the fact that the creators of the film, Cooper and Schoedsack, will not satisfy some of the scenes and frames. But what frames they are! Cinematography, while mostly in extreme conditions, is brilliant, and by Iranian music videos added to this release provide a memorable documentary added wealth. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching it and "Kon Tiki" on the same weekend, which was a thrill, and, of course, made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be, for primitive survival or the need for adventure, or in the name of science.
