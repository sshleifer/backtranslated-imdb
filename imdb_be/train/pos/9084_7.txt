So, some people say that this movie was a waste of money, but I like living dragon / World Finals / holy crap thriller fan. <br /> <br /> But if you take it from my stand point, this film had some of the best sences actions were pretty dang good. But that such a film is that everything just fell more tightly at the right time, or just about when the evil was trumph had fallen, to keep them at the right time. Although there were some funny lines and bands throughout the film, which surprised me. <br /> <br /> 3D-graphics are pretty damn good. I have in mind for this kind of movie 3D-effects were great !!!! The great battle, which has been shown in the trailers is living up to some kind of deception was a movie. The struggle between good and evil at the end of it was, I must say, there could be more and a little better, it was still pretty good. <br /> <br /> Currently, the parts that I think could be better, the beginning was a pretty good show details that lead to big fights. I mean, if you really do not want to go see this movie in theaters, then at least it DVDer ... <br /> <br /> Overall, I loved the movie, but the plot just stood on their seats to quickly and meet stringent simply good.
