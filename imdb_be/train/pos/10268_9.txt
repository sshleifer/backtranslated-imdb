This is a typical Mamet film provides a quiet, evenly paced understanding of what makes people trust (Joe Mantegna) is good. Explored as a psychological study of a noted psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), he slowly pulls her into his world with the usual unpleasant consequences. The cast includes a number of players found in several movies Mamet (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Sule Allen, William H. Macy), and they make their usual good job. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this film, and often wondered why she did not become a noted player than it has become. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places! <br /> <br /> film proceeds at a slow pace, flat dialog, but it maintains the voltage level for which logically leads to a bang-up that ends. You'd expect a real let down in the final, but I found it to be uplifting and fun. I love this movie!
