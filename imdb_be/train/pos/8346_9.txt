I just watched I. Q. again tonight and forgot how much I love this film. It is surprisingly interesting and leaves you feeling all right with the world. I love Mozart hints throughout the whole of the opening with the "Einstein" play "is flickering, Twinkle Little StarÂ» on the violin he sang Little Night Music at the time of IQ testing by Ed Walters. I love that woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, especially a unique position for the 1950s, a time in which the film is set. (I myself was a teacher, but stayed at home to raise their children, so please do not think I'm some staunch feminist women.) It's amazing how a person who "only techie" finally see how important and worthy, as a bridegroom Catherine, clinical behavioral researcher. Message me that we are not what we do but who we are defined so much more - with no labels. There are so many little tricks and jokes that are almost disposable if you do not look and listen carefully. <br /> <br /> I catch a few things in the film that are not listed on the page inconsistencies. In the scene where Ed Walters speak at the symposium, there are 3 tools (protractor, ruler, etc.) hangs to the right of the chalk ledge. In the next shot the camera, there are only 2. In the credits at our video, he lists the character Shalhoub as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti, he introduces himself in the film and are listed here on IMDB. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film. This may be a piece of fluff to some estimates, but has much more substance than many give it credit. Not only do a large cast assembled here. Watch and enjoy!
