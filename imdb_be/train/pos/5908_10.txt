This is one of the most brilliant films I've seen lately. It goes way beyond even any international film any reputation. I am very surprised, why it has not received the recognition it deserves. Sonali Kulkarni wins National Award, perhaps the only comforting fact. Renuka Daftardar is simply amazing, as it says a lot about her eyes. There are a few scenes that stand out: If Gaur returned from the wedding to Krishna, and Krishna is found for the first time in many years. Krishna Gaur notice changes, but no line of dialogue, as saying. The whole range of emotions passed through fine manners and eyes. There's another near the end, when Krishna prays Abhay Kulkarni marry Gaur instead. If you are not touched by this scene, you have no heart. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie for pure cinema shine solutions and operating capabilities.
