. As Dr. Alan Feinstone, Burns makes strange impaired performance in "DentistÂ» <br /> <br /> Since it has obsessive-compulsive tendencies in high gear, the IRS hounding him, and very suspicious actions wife; Dr. Alan Feinstone loses his health more and more every day. <br /> <br /> If you really Doc realizes that his wife has to deal with a local swimming pool a boy, he sets off a string of events that lead torture, murder, ant total chaos! "Dentist" is a solid movie! Bernsno makes the character Dr. Feinstone Relatable and hateable simultaneously. Despite the fact that it is completely out of his gourd, viewers still have sympathy for him. These are my friends ..... it's a damn good game actors. <br /> <br /> A nice supporting cast of actors round out this gem of the film. Great area, good murder and blood, and effective stimulation will keep you entertained throughout the movie work. <br /> <br /> RECOMMENDED!
