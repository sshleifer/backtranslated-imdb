Original Barbara Stanwyk stored only in the performance Stanwyk. History and other performances too sickly sweet and the film itself is also very much dated today. Bette Midler version is much more interesting. She Stella Claire, independent, free spirit of a woman who became pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) and her friend (John Goodman underrated performance). She picks up her daughter Jenny played so sweetly by Trini Alvarado ~ d, and then comes to the conclusion that the father of Jenny can do better for her, and ultimately decides which changes life. Through the film, there is a lot of laughter, tears and unforgettable moments in the ground between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason co-stars as Jenny potential stepmother, who though rich are very good influence on her. If you want to Midler, Goodman, or simply a good movie with a lot of emotions you will enjoy a version of Bette Midler in Stella.
