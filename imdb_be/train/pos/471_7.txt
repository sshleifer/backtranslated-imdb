The film star Emily Watson Breaking the Waves fame. This film is about one man's obsession takes place in the resort where the chess tournament takes place. Chess Master comes, and soon after falls madly in love (at first sight) with a woman, played by Emily Watson. It falls on the person eccentric who receive chess. It's all in trouble her mother, who is far more interested in the fact that its another young gentleman; the right gentleman. Her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy for a young woman, as she tends to take the odd animals and the like. What follows is basically a journey through the human psyche. She talks about how his past is closely linked with its present. Emily Watson strange in this, as well as the actor who plays the main character. This is certainly slow, but well worth watching. The ending even satisfying. :)
