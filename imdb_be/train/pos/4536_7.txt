Author writer who wrote a remarkable series Murder Rooms, chronicling the adventures of the UNP Dr. Joseph Bell, I'm looking forward to it and I was not disappointed. It was pretty slow moving, with greater emphasis on Doyle's disappointment in Sherlock Holmes, who was very precise and perfectly painted. It was an interesting character study and a very good shot (on digital video, unusual for part of the period). Action was perfect from all sides, in particular, Tim McInnerny and Brian Cox, although the actor portraying the ACD, whose name I can not remember impressed me to no end. Excellent character study, which has about the same amount of twisting, like any normal case of Sherlock Holmes. Does it feel when you get a chance
