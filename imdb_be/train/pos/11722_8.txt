To be honest, I watched this movie just because of the need Pubert. I mean, I could not get the woman of my age (I was 9 or 10), so I thought, watching splitting Elvira closet thing was sex. <br /> <br /> I ended up having a great time with this cult classic of the horror comedy, halloween party, brash humor and some sexual evils, show Elvira. <br /> <br /> They just do not make movies like it anymore ... it was a feeling of amateur effort, mixed with a type of late night cable talk show. <br /> <br /> The truth is that it has generated a lot of fans because of his humor and the ability to perform Cassandra. <br /> <br /> This is a classic that reminds me of the good USA Up All Night recently.
