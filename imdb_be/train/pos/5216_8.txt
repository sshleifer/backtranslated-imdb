Errol works Department of Public Safety and his job is to check for sex offenders. Sometimes he pushes the line on their work and effort on sex offenders. I do not blame him, but his boss is ready for him to resign, so swim Allison. Errol is now training her to do their job, and this is a job shadowing. Allison somewhat naive about the work in the beginning, but she does not realize the danger she actually, and it's only fault in Errol. He begins to touch with his obsession to find the missing girl, when his work should not be a police officer. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the boundaries and operates outside his "scope of practice." Errol doing a good job, but in order to Allison security. It has some good puzzle for him, too, and only when I had found out there was more to it.
