I liked this movie, because it's basically done more with less. It could be made more interesting if they had kept him confined to the studio even more (although some of the plot elements would be difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The guy plays DJ did a good job to show someone frightened and haunted his memories. I also found his dialogue with callers pretty funny. <br /> <br /> While the film you can see coming a mile away, and other parts that you do not expect it to turn out as they did. <br /> <br /> I thought it was pretty minimal ghost story, for the most part, concentrating more on the live side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes were pretty well done, all is revealed. <br /> <br /> While it was a short film, he felt that he was about the right amount of time to tell a story. More and we would have started to drag.
