I almost did not go to see this movie, because I remember the penguin march was not much exciting. I went mainly because Disney has promised to plant a tree, when I go to look for the weekend, but after I went to see, it was just amazing; the fact that photographers can capture the images can not be just your money's worth. You can also see a variety of habitats, other vegetation, animals and natural phenomena that will not only shock you - simply because you never have to wait for nature is so magical and dynamic - but also to touch your soul and raise the issue of humanity in relation to the world, as our life has deviated from the nature to the extent that we take for granted the natural beauty and wonders that the quintessence of our biosphere. You need not be a lover of the earth or a tree hugging environmentalist to appreciate just amazing this documentary. You just have to be curious soul, which casts doubt on the value and wonder of life. Enjoy!
