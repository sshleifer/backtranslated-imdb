I really enjoyed the '60s. Not being of this generation (I'm waiting for "80"), it was interesting to see the unique four o'clock capsules of the era. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems in the film, however, as an unbalanced film has been in the family image. According to the promo, I saw a movie on NBC, the story was mainly about two families who are struggling with the problems of America in 1960. Now, maybe I missed something, but I think that we have learned about the white family than African-American family. <br /> <br /> I really think that the 60th use music to describe the scene better than any dialogue that might come out of the mouth of the actors (all of whom are very talented.) This is very evident at the end of the first part ( about two hours) in the mini-series. <br /> <br /> very good movie!
