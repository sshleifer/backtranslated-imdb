I love and admire horse-drawn animation, so I did not expect anything but a surprise from Dreamworks new animated image of the Spirit: prairie. I guess you could say I was a little disappointed. Do you have a great animation in the first, it seems a perfect story. The story is about absolutely nothing but horse in nature. Animals do not sing cute songs or even speak - a big plus. Unfortunately, the film has an absurd story Matt Damon; luscious soundtrack Bryan Adams; and enough scenes to compare it with the production of Jerry Bruckheimer. If the filmmakers just stayed with simplicity, we have a masterpiece here. This is not a great film, but it's good fun for young children. I would recommend this film family, because it has its heart in the right place, and only one out there right now, is not offensive to young children. Not bad, but it could be much better. Very beautiful visual effects, though.
