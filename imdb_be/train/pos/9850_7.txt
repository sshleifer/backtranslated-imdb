Interesting animation about the fate of the giant tiger, a sloth and a mammoth, who saved a child who was about to be killed by a group of tigers during the Ice Age. The moral of the film shows that good behavior with others can benefit in the end. One of the tigers in the group received an order finally to captivate a child who barely escaped with his mother, when the Tigers attacked her community. The child was then rescued ribbons and mammoth, but the tiger joined them with a view to finally pick up the child. They went through a very troublesome track with lots of obstacles, and immediately the tiger was falling down and saved a mammoth. Eventually a group of tigers trying to capture the child, but incredibly mammoth helped his tiger colleagues have overcome this attack and to give the child back to her father and the society to which he belongs.
