This is the biggest film I've seen in 2002, while I got used to the mainstream film. It is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act of the 11 short films. From the technical information (elected directors), I was afraid that it will have an anti-American basis, but ... it's a kind (11 times) personal tribute. <br /> <br /> soft spot comes from Y. Shaheen: he did not have time to "swallow their pride", and considers the event as a well-deserved punishment ... it really is the weakest part of the film, but it is indicative of a real freedom of speech for the whole piece. Strange is happening on the Mexican almost conceptual-art film ... I'm still not sure what he meant Alexander González Iñárritu. In 9 other committed (K. Loach, S. Peng and S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or near perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me or smile, or cry, or even left me stunned. I still do not know the fable S. Imamura is really connected or not to the September 11 disaster, but it is so beautiful that its final place deep "make it."
