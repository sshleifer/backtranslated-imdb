I really liked this movie. Action by the adult actors were healthy, although I found the main little bit tight. But he behaved very well in order to be new talents. Humor is very elevated, but not in your face like most Hollywood comedy stuff. ie Nutty Professor. If you have a short duration of attention and concentration are used to the typical Hollywood things you probably would not like it, because it's a little slower pace. I picked it up on Blu-Ray, and I must say that the image quality at the highest level. Probably one of the best looking Blu-ray I've seen so far. The extras were too cool. They are removed quite a bit, but it's probably a good thing, since most of the remote scenes do not really add anything.
