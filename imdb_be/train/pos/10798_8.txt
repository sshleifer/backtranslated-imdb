First seen by Joe Sarno this gem way back when, and I have to say that after seeing it, I could never forget Jennifer Wells. At first I thought that the film is moving a little slower than I would have expected for a film Sarni, but when Jennifer made her entrance, the first time I've ever seen it somewhere, I sat up and took note. Her presence in the film is difficult to avoid, and correct each scene, she participates. I saw most of the other films Sarna and other movies starring or featuring Jennifer Wells, and I must say that this was the Sarna and Jennifer in their team better. Sarni direction in this film the national adult drama is excellent, and Jennifer showed (literally and figuratively) acting prowess that make it a must see. Co-star Brooke Rebecca (aka Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan as often co-stars Mrs Wells and work of the stars Sarna, included in believable performances as a couple of adventures, even normal housewives. This film is a classic of Saren.
