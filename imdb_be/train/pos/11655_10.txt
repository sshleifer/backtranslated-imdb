There are too many questions, escaped to the cinema and eating disorders is one of them. This film shows how to eat. Nha glamourised for viewers to enjoy shows with the real truth, which makes it all the more powerful. I only saw him once, and it was a few years ago but I still remember everything about it and how it made me feel. This is a very powerful film, and good support for those suffering from an eating disorder, to give them the willpower to stop. This is what the movie should be o they should be there to help people, not glamourise things that are wrong.
