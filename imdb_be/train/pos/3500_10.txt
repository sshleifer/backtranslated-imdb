This film works because it feels so sincerely. The story is simple and realistic, perfectly capturing the joys and concerns of teenagers love and sexuality that most / all we experienced during our teenage years. <br /> <br /> Cast as naturally as a figure in the documentary, but persuasive and as charismatic as seasoned performers. The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and, fortunately, not the top with links mannered pop culture. In addition, the cinema once gritty and beautiful, with the result that the Lower East Side setting to life in a very tangible way. <br /> <br /> On the artistic level, I love this movie, because it reminds me of the great Italian neo -realism films like Thief of bicycles and La Strada. Movies rarely feel like a "real", as it does ... or bike thief did. And the only other film I've seen that refers to adolescent sexuality with the same level of seriousness is Elia Kazan Splendor in the grass. Writer / director Peter Sollett deserves huge praise. This film is a great achievement. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I'm always happy to see the film, which treats members of ethnic America with love and respect. As an Italian-American, I hate how my people come off in a movie (as racist, sexual immorality, criminal geniuses annoyingly popular epic), and my aggravation of this bill makes me very sensitive to other groups and their terrible silver screen presentation. Hispanics and Asians, in particular, seems to be cursed to play villains in westerns and action movies. (Well, that Gong Li Sun was trying to become famous in America!) <br /> <br /> Of course, thanks largely to the growth of the indie-paintings, as well as the influence of Miramax, we see a few more pictures of ethnic symbols here and there. .. but Raising Victor Vargas is easily one of the best. Although I am very fond of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, it's a refreshing change that the increase in Victor Vargas played directly (with less exaggerated and well-drawn characters) at the same time very funny in its own right. Finally! Latin characters, worthy of attention. I have a feeling that this is a film that will be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, now that he has made this wonderful picture of the family from the Dominican Republic, I hope that Peter Sollett gets around making a film about Italians in the near future! :) - Mark DiPaolo
