Bette Davis turns to cold amusing performance as Mildred Rogers in the film in 1934. The film seems to be quite dated now in 2003, no doubt, is worth a look at movie lovers and fans of Bette Davis, but may not have as much appeal for the average film Watcher today. It was strange for me to see how a young Ms. Davis looks in this movement. The actors turn in performances that are basically sound, and the story makes sense and is interesting. Leslie Howard well chosen, Philip Carey, a club foot medical student. This is a film with a strong message that we choose to love and why. Nevertheless, "Of Human Bondage", it does not seem to have a strong influence on me mentally or emotionally. I felt a little indifferent and off of the movie after watching. I have intuition that this may be a reaction, that the director was going for. You be the judge! <br /> <br />
