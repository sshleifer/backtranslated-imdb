Billy Wilder co-credited for the story, and his sentimental touch evident in this rather original tale Ghostwriting songwriters, and that works for the burnt music legend Oliver Courtney. Obvious misunderstanding out of the way quickly enough, thank God, but that is witty and fresh broth with some beautiful songs (and some of the more forgotten them), Crosby in his most charming, a great twist on a Broadway legend Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant providing high cynical barbs (Levant in rare form and dated studs Sun at all). A wonderful surprise, and is recommended for all fans of the genre.
