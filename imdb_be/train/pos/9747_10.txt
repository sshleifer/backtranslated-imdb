I remember this film when it first came out in 1982 and loved it then. About 4 years later I had the honor to see Luciano Pavarotti singing in the house of the Metropolitan Opera in New York (in Tosca), therefore, to see the end of this film is very similar to the big night. What's not to love about this film? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Feeney) was his best and still looked great. The story is actually very funny in parts and in «Food Fight» scene of another one of the funniest I've ever seen. Hot air balloon flight above Napa Valley was beautiful and so was the song he sang "If we were in love" (one of the few occasions when Pavarotti sang in English). And when he heard of Santa Lucia is gorgeous duo. Get real people, it was a movie about opera singer named Giorgio Fini, who just happened to play Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold and Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> I am very glad that I still have almost worn videotape this film, but I would like it to be released on DVD, especially now, is not Pavarotti is no longer with us, because I think that it includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma by his another film today!
