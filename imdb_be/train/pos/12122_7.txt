The film can be great. I just watched it last night, but do not feel able to give an honest opinion about him, because I read the book first. The book is much better than the film that I was disappointed with the film. If you plan to watch "Of Human Bondage", not read the book beforehand. On the other hand, the book is so good, and contains much more than a love Philip Mildred, you can still enjoy it after watching the film. I do not make this statement easily. I read a book on average every 4 days, and read such diverse writings as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Human Bondage" gets my vote as one of the ten best novels ever written.
