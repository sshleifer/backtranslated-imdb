I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found it to be positive, and largely true image of LDS faith. I think this remake of the epic journey across the plains would be beneficial, as many people today are not familiar with trials and persecution faced in the beginning of the Mormon Church. It's an incredible story of a strong and dedicated people. <br /> <br /> As a member of the church, the most troubling aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies do not bother me much) was a picture of Brigham Young, as that which "deliberately deceived" the members of the church, believing that it was intended to be the successor Joseph as a prophet. While I understand the reasons for this dramatic story line, it creates the impression that his doubts in this respect historical fact, when in reality, as the Brigham and most of the church members understand and firmly believed that he was called to lead the church. Brigham entirely consciously deceiving the saints; and he led them confidently for inspiration. The fact is, it is important to Mormons, because on it hinges is an important aspect of our faith that God really speaks to prophets today, and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith was an inspired prophet of God <br /> <br /> or. or you do not believe this statement or not, just know that the film does not accurately portray what is considered myself Brigham.
