Speaking of depressing film is not necessarily a bad thing. I really want to see a depressing film, if there is a point to make and it is definitely one there. This often harrowing story of the Chinese people and their families, as they have for many years as the difficulties and many. BUT, I have to warn you that it may be just about the most depressing film to come out of Hollywood in the 1930's - because the peasant life in China TOUGH, to put it mildly. Be prepared to watch segments of famine, death and disease. <br /> <br /> About the only negative, except for the constant tone of suffering that lead played by Paul Muni. Despite the fact that he was an exceptionally gifted man, it's just a real shame that Hollywood always reject people of European descent to play in Asia is in this era. If you pay attention to everything, it's pretty obvious that Mooney is wrong for the part.
