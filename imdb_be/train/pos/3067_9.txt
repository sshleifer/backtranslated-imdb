What is surprising treat to come across at the end of television. If only I had read the short story is worn on the TV to view the listing before the movie, I would have passed. The idea of ​​the film hits packed with seeing-man wants to leave-to-business-and-fall-in-love .... sounds corny. But the film works. From the very beginning of the film, it's clear the man carries the weight on his shoulders, before he even said a word. Appearance of the film perfectly. dark, but not offensively so. <br /> <br /> In addition to the hit-man family aspect that provides a link surrealism, character Mace is engaged with his marriage and his father's control. Macy shows suppressed grief, and his bedtime talks with his small son strange. A young boy shows acting skills far beyond his years, and the interaction between father and son so very natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films I've seen in a while, and I can not believe I stumbled upon it by accident late night TV.
