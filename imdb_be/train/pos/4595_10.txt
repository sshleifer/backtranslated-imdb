Name Jackie Chan synonomus to tricks. This movie will never let you down.The discoveries best chase scene and the last roll-down scenes from the pole so risky than one wonder if he knows what the meaning of fear.This film is very close to Jackie, who is the best PROJECT A. but the main difference is that the PROJECT and has three stars, where, as in this film, Jackie carries the film entirely on his shoulders.This, perhaps the main reason that this film did Jackie's largest martial arts star Bruce worth Lee.The film has good comic touches as well. What makes this film work is the ability to Jakie, to show their venerable party that its in the contract for the typical martial arts action film hero.This followed by a sequel, which was nice, but was quite tame compared to its predecessor.
