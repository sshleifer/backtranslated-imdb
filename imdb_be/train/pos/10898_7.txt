This film is not as bad as I've heard. It was nice, funny, and I love that revolves around the holiday season. She did me in the mood to Christmas shop and listen to holiday music. If this movie comes out on DVD it takes place the Christmas holidays in my collection. This is a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best season of the year. I heard that the character of Ben was a little crazy, but I think it just adds to the movie, and why so serious all the time. Take it for what it is, a Christmas comedy with a twist of love. I enjoyed it. No, this is not the Titanic, and it does not make your heart pound with anticipation, but it will bring a laugh or two. So laugh and have a good time :)
