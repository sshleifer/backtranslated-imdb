Not that a lot of things going on in this movie, but many meanings. The woman thought that everything she can in life, but it was not actually the case, and she found herself when she met the man who carries out some research for his future work. There really should be more types of movies like this, it is not even that old, are considered "mature" (im 13 by the way), and I still have the idea and the point of the film. The main thing on my mind :. I do not think there can be no better life, because now there is one <br /> <br /> Although I must admit, I thought I watch another movie, but after reading all the reviews and saw the trailer, I decided to this, even though I knew it was not much action will appear in the film. I recommend everyone to watch this film, as it has very good moments in the film, and it's really a good end.
