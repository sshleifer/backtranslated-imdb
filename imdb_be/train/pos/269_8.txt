I'm a fan of television films in general, and it was one of the nicest. The cast of speakers for all were pretty hard and had I not seen twists comes before each commercial. For me, it was kind of like responsible Medium CSI. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else think that in some lights, the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? They are connected in some way? I definitely look Aginsk or rent it, if it ever comes to video. <br /> <br /> Dedee was great. I have not seen it in a lot of things, and it is very clearly did the job. <br /> <br /> If you're in a TV mystery movies, check this one out if you have a chance.
