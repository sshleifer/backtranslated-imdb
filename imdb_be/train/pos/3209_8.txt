An interesting mix of the comments that it would be difficult to add anything constructive. Nevertheless, I will try. It was a very good action movie with some great set-piece. You'll notice, I have defined a genre. I do not snipe the lack of performance and I do not blame the current. Enjoy, if that is the people, well above the average action movie. I could go on, but I made my comment.
