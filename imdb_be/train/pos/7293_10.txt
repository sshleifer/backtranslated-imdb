What can I say about this absolutely beautiful movie? I saw it in Atlanta, Georgia DragonCon, given that this is my main city. I have a lot of sci-fi movies and enjoy a supporter type of action. I found myself all night and was almost ready to call it a day, when I saw the movie played in the first half of the day. This is not a sci-fi thriller, nor any kind. Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of any Witchblade Eric Etebari looked a few episodes (his speech that seemed stale and robotic). But he was able to really beat me in this performance. I mean really win me. Seeing Cellular, I do not think there was much in the way of action for this guy. But his performance as Kasadya was just amazing. He was very convincing as the evil demon. But there was so much in depth detail the character completely surprised me. Later I looked it up online and found that Eric won the award for best actor who deserved considering his best in his career and gained my respect. Now I keep reading about this FX and production of this project, and let me say that I did not pay attention to them (sorry Brian). They were very well done, but I was even more impressed with the story - I think that the more his goal (seeing films such as Godzilla with a huge effect just really turned me off). I could not sleep after this film, thinking over and over again in my head. The position of an abusive family is never easy. I showed the trailer for my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her as having lived with abuse. This is one movie that I think about constantly and highly recommend.
