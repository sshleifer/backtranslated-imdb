This film is one of my favorites because it makes me think about all the choices that I made, and how my life would change when my choice was different. He plays right into the Â«Multiple Universe" theory. <br /> <br /> The only thing that does not ring true, as Larry Burrows (James Belushi) has such a hard time understanding what is happening, that all of my change. <br /> <br />
