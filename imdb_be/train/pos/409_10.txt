Legend of Zu, perhaps the most exciting film I've seen in recent years. It surpasses all expectations, and it is really a work of art. With unsurpassed visual scenery and history of divine proportions, Legend C continues to blow over his audience with his majesty. This film was created through the use of high miracle He CGI technology, which allows fans of the fantasy genre, and see their vision to life. Action is ideal for this type of film; if you were immortal with supernatural powers, I think you would have to keep more to themselves. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the comments of many, the story is actually very easy to follow, while maintaining a fast pace, which adds a sense of urgency. Anyone who can not attend just have not for a variety of characters to look for, one way or used for such levels of complexity as titanium. Engagement portion and layered with themes so epic that will leave you gasping for breath. Legend of Zu is on the greatness of so high a level that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur. Allow yourself to be completely absorbed in his fantastic vision, and you will love this film.
