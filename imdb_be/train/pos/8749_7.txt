I loved the movie, but, as everyone says, there were some bits that were not sufficiently developed. I thought personally that the girls were very fresh, before they landed in prison; Of course, they had to be innocent American girls, but still ... I felt that they did not have that relationship, best friends, is supposed to have. For example, in the installation where they are sightseeing as they held each other in the picture it was very uncomfortable looks. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some details that were very mixed. I think it's pretty much understood that the nature of the Danes did not do it, but I can see how this could lead to confusion. Also, why the camera is live on Manat bearing very grim expression after he put the bags in the trunk of a taxi? I thought it was something to suggest, but it turned out there was nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was great. I cried when Claire Danes took the blame; She's a great actress. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to see that bitch Thai prisoner get her ass. Talking about the absence of closure ...
