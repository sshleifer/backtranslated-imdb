I really liked this movie. Of course, the idea is pretty much out there ... the federal government organization to have a tracking device implanted in the jaw of a small-time thief, to lure the dangerous thief / computer hacker from the shelter. But Alvin Sanders, a man who feds were "voluntarily" to be implanted with the device is a very nice man, and it is a lot of fun to get in his head with him for a while. Alvin even in the end, turns out to be so much more than good-natured, but a passive one-dimensional character or when it shows that it is not as easy to manipulate as it may seem. Definitely worth a look.
