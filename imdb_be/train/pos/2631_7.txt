If The Lion King is a serious story about a lion who grew up to avenge the death of his father, The Lion King 1 and half of the complete opposite, full of imagination and joy. The Lion King tells the story from the Simba is a lion, 1 and a half with Timone standpoint and Pumbaa, less-than-perfect duo, made up of Meercat, who ran away from home because he could not dig tunnels, Sun burying her friends and neighbors and warthog, who has a problem with the smell. The film is a little bit short in essence, but Disney does a good job in time with various sketches starring Timone and Pumba filling as they "watch" movies with us. My favorite sing that occurs halfway through the movie, make sure that you see the error Jump! Disney touted the 1 and a half, as the "rest of the story", although in fact it is not. It's just a different perspective on The Lion King, not all serious stuff that soaked most of the second half of the original Disney classic. Credit Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella Timone as FUIB for their voice work, without their efforts, the film may not have worked. They sing, they entertain, and they make us laugh. They also give us reason to avoid hot baths warthog.
