Ah, 1970 .. The time when it was to be a swinger. Honestly, today also a good time to be a Swinger, but it just felt more daring then. <br /> <br /> Joe Sarno offers a pretty good soft core film. In fact, just as today, some of the actors well-known actors hardcore. Unlike today, these people are good actors and the films had the plot and character development. <br /> <br /> This is pretty much what you would expect from a roller SWINGER in. Two pairs of open relationship reignite a passion for travel with the MILF one of the women who came to visit. Not much more to it. <br /> <br /> Of course, if the MILF Jennifer Wells, it's a different story. Not too many 40-somethings look so delicious undressed as Ms. Wells. It is worth the price alone to see Mr. Wells to look at myself in the mirror, as if she were Aphrodite. She did not "Stifler mom." It is a way sexier. <br /> <br /> I also dug Anna Chris Jordan. Jordan looks and sounds just like Elaine Joyce, I thought it could be her "separated at birth" twin or even the Elaine. Anna always eaten, but must have an incredible metabolism. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the soft core porn 1990s, 70-rag porn preserve realism (something hardcore movie that the 2000s brought a soft core, in some cases, instead of 90s music and canned orgasms ), and it is here in full force. It's not real, but it feels real. <br /> <br /> For those who enjoyed the Quebec manufacturing «Deux Femmes En Or», you will enjoy it. Another classic film only on a disk in the classics, the best $ 2,50 CAN per month you can spend.
