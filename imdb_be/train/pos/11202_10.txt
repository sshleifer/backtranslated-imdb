At first I thought that the ring is greater than the normal film with his usual story. How surprised I was! Of course, the plot is simple - a girl in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter, with laughter and fear, compassion and pain. The way in which it reflects the popular exhibition of the crowd, the force of attraction of the girl as a man, the tragic elements that come along with the techniques that open the mind of the majority of his greatest films (North by Northwest, rope, etc ..). Master did it well before the thirty!
