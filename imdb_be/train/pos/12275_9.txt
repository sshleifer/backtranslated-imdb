I had never heard of the book, nor care to read it, but the film, which I will probably see a lot of times. <br /> <br /> This film is perhaps the most memorable images of the rich, which I saw in a movie. It was as if I was looking at the pictures many times, I think, it was the idea. <br /> <br /> Awesome movie, story, cast and cinematography. Full of deep emotion from every angle. Although I am not particularly fond of love movies, I loved it and was deeply moved by the plea Winona Ryder her father until the end. <br /> <br /> Mr. Irons earned the award for its work and close it never has been better. <br /> <br />
