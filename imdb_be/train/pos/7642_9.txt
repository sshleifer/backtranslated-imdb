Not a very big box office draw, but I was surprised pleasently <br /> <br /> with this film. James "I've done some things Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> <br /> co-wrote and directed this film about an ordinary, average guy <br /> <br /> named Larry Burrows, who thinks that his life was b <br /> <br /> incredibly different if he hit a home run in the key game of baseball <br /> <br /> when he was 15. But thanks to the mystery and magic bartender <br /> <br /> Mike Larry gets his wish, but he soon realizes that his new life <br /> <br /> not exactly as he had hoped it would be. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this film really struck me. Critics gave <br /> <br /> it is mixed, and I have to say that the concept is really interesting and <br /> <br /> elongated well. Yes, it is a bit standard, but packs enough <br /> <br /> funny moments, drama and excellent acting, to make it really <br /> <br /> well. James Belushi (I think) was worthy of an Oscar for his role. John <br /> <br /> Lovitts perfect, and Linda Hamilton plus Rene Russo shine <br /> <br /> their roles. Michael Caine is perfect as a bartender. It <br /> <br /> just a good movie with a good lesson. If you've never seen, I <br /> <br /> it is strongly recommended to check
