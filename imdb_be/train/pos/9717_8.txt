How to lose friends and alienate people, by all honesty one of the best comedies I've seen this year with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. This is not one of those "rough" of comedy, which relies heavily on fart jokes and toilet humor, but instead moves in a friendly pace, and you will easily attach to the unfolding of the narrative. Simon Pegg nails in his coffin with his cheerful pattern of fish-out-of-water character and fast separating himself from the stand he had once belonged to his back in England (the other two would be Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Getting yourself in the top of the Hollywood food chain a hard thing to do, as we can clearly see Pegg, his first hit in the title role was a comedy by David Schwimmer, Run Fatboy Run, but he received warm reviews from critics and audiences alike. His second attempt this film was quite positive feedback from the majority, but was a flop at the box office. For example, I still have not lost faith in him, and I'll still be there when he wants to take the third shot to fame. <br /> <br /> The other characters were well cast of Jeff Bridges, Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst in my view, fared well in this film, as the angle of love for nature Pegg, however, the spark that I saw in an interview with the vampire still lost. She had to find him quickly, or it may suffer the consequences of the loss of the land "rom-com" forever.
