I thought it was a great film for children aged 6-12. Bit juicy, but the story is uplifting fresh. This proves that the teenager dreams can really come true. I think it's a great story for any child who is feeling down or feeling as if trying to juggle too many things, among them. Very "cute" movie. Bravo.
