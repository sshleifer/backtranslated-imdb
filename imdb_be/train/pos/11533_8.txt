The film, which begins with an interesting opening two hot blondes get it on the back of the driver behind the moving vehicle, has a rather quaint little personality to boot. The cast of seven (though one girl did not hang around for Bodycount that unfortunate, because the number of victims is already so low, that is) are all super-hot, as our story centers around a teen partying way into the desert (an odd but effective choice of settings) that hunted terrible man in black gloves and jeans, who rides a black truck. He even before many cars have inspired slashers today ( «The Trip», «Joy Ride», «Jeepers Creepers"), where the killer car itself is an evil antagonist. Sam killer pretty awful, and we find comfort in the most sympathetic heroine Jennifer McAllister (look at an interesting symbolic contrast of evil killer in all black, while our friendly character sport all white outfit, and miserable, and Stonewashed, as it may be). Directed by Bill Crain doing some really great things with his camera, some neat tricks on the screen, and cast tries their best. There is enough gore in low Bodycount please gore fans and sufficient T & A from several girls to cater T & A fan. Overall, this film is strongly undervalued and is widely found in the slasher movies of the world, as it was quite rare to find on video. Highly recommended.
