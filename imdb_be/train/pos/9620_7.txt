There are so many «Hollywood» movies made now, not only to watch the torture, but have no relation to human life in general. Of course, the films do not always have to have a deeper meaning, but it's nice to know that there are still filmmakers out there who care about say "human" history. I'm not going to give this room a brilliant film, however, the scenario is certainly one of the most challenging and memorable ones I've ever seen in my life, and I'm a 32-year-old movie buff too! Fixed ranks the top ten on my list of favorites, which includes: the embankment, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, to name just a few. This "movement" film has become one of the favorites also- that is, if you have a heart!
