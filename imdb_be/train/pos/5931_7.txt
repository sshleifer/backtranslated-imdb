Although written by Stephen King, writer overpriced, if ever there was one, it's actually quite interesting B-movie. Vampire, incestuous creatures that live in the candlelit house and drain the life force of virgins, a large cemetery decoration, a heroic cat and a very beautiful virgin. The soundtrack even have Enya's music, an idea which I found very ... nice. I am sure that the king of this little disappointed in the film, although he has a bad dialogue and ideas, all of them from the true king of schlock and tiring. (Albeit a lunatic when I understand correctly, it is a script, without any novel or story behind it). However, these risks sewer odors to show that he did not use ghost-writer, after all ...
