Believe it or not, Inspector Gadget in the last case that I was hooked on the whole thing Gadget. <br /> <br /> My name is Miriam and I am twelve years old, so, obviously, I was not there when Inspector Gadget was on top of his career. Of course, I heard about it, but I do not know him. <br /> <br /> During the reading, note that I have never seen the original series (I would, if it came on!). It's just about a single Gadget thing I ever looked (although now I'm obsessed) and I will be focusing on what I loved about it, because everyone else is so negative. For all you pessimists, I have some downsides down there too. = P In the first place, for the children's sense of humor, you might find this film is pretty funny. I thought it was, so I have dishwashing. I also thought that the animation and character designs were good, and I'm also happy there was more Gadget in it, because he's my favorite character. (I do not like Penny.) Then there was a claw (his voice was terrible, though) and Madcat; I thought they were done quite well. Nuts idiocy seem pretty good on the ground, if not a bit exaggerated (ie, sucking the thumb of his hat-hand thing. It will make a nice screenshot, though. = P) Oh, and I liked the song that was in the credits. Yes, I'm weird. <br /> <br /> And, like all movies, there are some negatives as well. <br /> <br /> Speaking of cars? What to do? You can say that it was aimed at young boys. It would not bother me so much if it was not for the fact that cars are basically saved the day. I would have much preferred if Penny and Brain have taken their place. And, apparently, the gadget loved his car more than can be called natural. A little strange, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Yes, and the chief was just the same there Gadget. I mean, Sheesh, yes, he was not always the most cheerful person, but he does not HATE Gadget, from what I read. As an inspector, his identity has been exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Well, it's pretty much all I have to say about this film. I thought the animation, made up for the car in the center of the plot, and it was generally pretty decent; larger than gadget live action movies (butchered, butchered, butchered!), at least. Maybe I'm just biased, because this is what I have in the gadget in the first place, or maybe my mind is twisted, or maybe I'm just weird, but I really liked this movie, even though I am the old recommended.
