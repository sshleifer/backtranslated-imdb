It was the first regular episode of Columbo movie shot, but it is still on the air, the second after Steven Spielberg's «Columbo:. Murder by the Book" is also at the same time, among them one of the better <br /> <br /> Bernard! L. Kowalski was a big creative director! it is not surprising that later they asked him to send three more Columbo movies. film has some real sequence of creative and innovative, and shot the film in general is also clearly made with style, passion and attention to detail. Every shot It connects and is the reason why this movie is better and better Vaglen gives just about every other medium is made for TV movie. This is definitely one of the best films directed Colombo. <br /> <br /> is to throw the original entrance to Colombo for several reasons. Killing more or less by accident, and was an impulsive act. So killer this time there was no time to plan the "perfect murder" in advance, and to clean up any of the following and then must dispose of the body. killer in this film is not only treated as a person who has committed a crime, but more like a man rescued Lieutenant Columbo resolutely s murder. This makes the character more interesting and layered one, but also helps to break Columbo solves all the crimes, seems to be much more interesting, and due to this. Of course Columbo begins to suspect him quite early and, as always, he concludes by making yourself vulnerable and look sillier than he, of course, and really gain the confidence of the killer. This is obviously not a spoiler, as is the way everyone gets a Columbo movie setting. I liked the story of the movie and how it has progressed. <br /> <br /> It also helps the movie, he's got such a great cast. During the film, Peter Falk Columbo really made the character his own character and it had already fully developed. Robert Culp is really big, like a hot-tempered Brimmer. The funny thing is that it again later, and one episode of "Mrs. Columbo» star in three different movies Colombo, but in completely different roles. He even played the killer in a few of these films, as well as once again. Incidentally, he was not the only actor who did it in other later films Colombo. In addition, a large Ray Milland makes an appearance in this film, as the victim's husband. <br /> <br /> In general, this great early film Colombo and among the best of the long-running series of films. <br /> <br /> 9/10
