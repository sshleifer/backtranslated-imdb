Huge Ramones fan. I do like the Ramones, and I believe that if you hate them, then, in addition, that an ardent Bush supporter, you might not have this classic. <br /> <br /> This is very better than juicy teen movies and John Hughes as littered with '80s. much better than the American pie that plague us now! <br /> <br /> There are some other great films middle school :. Switchblade Sisters, fast times ..., Class 84, Three O'Clock High, and cheese until the capture (not possible) On the banks of the river. But RnRHS will always be my favorite, because it is very funny and interesting, plus you can get up and dance with him. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> 10/10
