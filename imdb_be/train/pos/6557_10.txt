I am a 53-year-old college professor. I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is original, witty, fast paced and absolutely charming. The site was easy enough for the 10-year-old to follow, but enough winding to an adult interested. I thought that Emma Roberts did an excellent job and the rest of the cast is just fine. My only criticism is that the sets of Los Angeles is not as exciting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were excellent. Overall, I thought it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult males) was brutally attacked on the film. Apparently, they have something against movies that depict strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their works reveal more about their own natures sexist than anything about this wonderful family film. I recommend it strongly to each child and each parent.
