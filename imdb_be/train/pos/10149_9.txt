Sweet funny story 2 paths crossing of people, as they prepare for their wedding. Ex-policeman writer and public school teacher fall in love with each other in this new environment York, despite the fact that they are married to other people. Maybe a little trite that "partners" are both type A personality, whereas our protagonists are much quieter. Nha something heavy, but it made me smile. And hey for guys - sell corner Henstridge, and a gallon - to sell them a juicy romance wins it all!
