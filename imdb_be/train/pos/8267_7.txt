Brown of Harvard is a cruel film press. We expect a lot more from our films these days, so it helps to remember that the audience in the 20's were a little more innocent. William Haines magic as a crook who should stumble through the pain and humiliation, to find success and even fame. All relationships in the film feel very unnatural EXCEPT homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, urban botanist. The film has all the romance, tears, love, death, and even sports ... This is a good education in how society has changed in the 20th century.
