I saw this movie twice in the space of one week, both times in the movie in Orpington, Kent, United Kingdom. The place was packed both times and people had to be turned away. From the very beginning of the film with Henry Winkler to get "injured" on the football field, the whole audience was in an uproar of laughter, laughter that lasted until the loans. <br /> <br /> For those who love the American wrestling this film should, but be prepared to see Henry Winkler, as you've never seen it before. Also note the very well-known actor, whose trademark fight head-on but a step! <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to see this movie, and it's a family comedy entertainment at its best!
