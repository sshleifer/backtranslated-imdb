Hello everyone my name Larisa I am 13 years old, when I was about 4 years old, I watch Curly Sue and knocked my socks off, I watched the film for a long time, actually about 30 minutes ago, I had just made his view, Alisan Porter really a good actor, and I love that movie it's so funny when she has to deal cards. Every time I watch this film at the end of this I'm paying it said so I know what I'm only 13 years old, but it is such a touching story of his truly amazing Thats Alisan 25 years now. Every time I watch a movie, who are always young, and the film comes out as a year after they do it, and if they watch it and find out, as the old man in the film really wounder how they can move from one age to the next. Harry Potter. This film was also great, but still Daniel was about 12 years old in the first film, and I was about 11. So he could go from 12 to 16 for about 4 years and I have only 13. I'm not sure if it 16 Now, I think he's almost 18, but that a little strange, if looking at one movie and the next there for about 4 years, and when they were only 1 in last.I'm not sure that I I have a great imagination and I would like to denounce it.i I kind of human computer, but I would like to make a lot of kids stuff too. I am very smart, like Curly Sue in the film, but one thing I do not like in the movies when the guy calls the foster family and Curly Sue does get taken, I would kill this guy if he really did it in real life, Well, I'm going to stop writing, I know a lot of writing, but sometimes children do have a lot in there mind that you need to go out and not if they are not the children never get to learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
