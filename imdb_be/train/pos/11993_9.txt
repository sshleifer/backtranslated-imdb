Along with Darkwing Duck is unjustly canceled. Disney has been in decline, as Tarzan, and we need to show how to get Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings was ideal for voice and Louis Bala (sound familiar?) The theme of the theme tune and catchy. Of all the scoundrels who are increasingly on their own merits, Tony Jay stands out as Sher Khan. Louie and Baloo actually sound very similar to the voice-over in the Jungle Book, which is not bad at all. In fact, it's quite inspiring! Animation was in place, and the screenplay was a lot of wit, which was seriously lacking in animation over the years. Please, take this show is BACK! 9/10. Bethany Cox
