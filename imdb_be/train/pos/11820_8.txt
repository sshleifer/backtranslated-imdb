Heh, if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18-year-old comic-adapted movie rated 5.9, you call me with the mind? That's just to get your attention. Every day I meet people who complain there are no good movies that seem to know only the latest blockbusters. It's never a bad thing to look for and explore old movies, especially with good artistic value. Dick Tracy is one of those who can not easily be obsolete in terms of technology. <br /> <br /> The negative reviews primarily complained about the "messed upÂ» DT history. But it seems to me that the story is very clear, and I have not had any problems since. I have not seen comics, but I'm not a big fan of the US comics, but I appreciate the shooting and top-notch performance. Perhaps most people's expectations were too high, it would be said about the history. But if you see a movie casting Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what would you expect. I had some scratches on my head, and can not help but wonder, did we really see the same movie? The main role, though not as competent as it sounds, was still able to pull it out and captivate the audience. Madonna has been more rapid or less "choked" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun in history. Al Pacino was a fun and Prodigy to her. Apparently, he was brave enough to go on his sarcastic previously successful roles. We can see a hybrid of a scar, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro to punch our stomachs, to make us laugh. And many thanks to make-ups. <br /> <br /> This is not bad for me. Surreal feeling really me.
