Unfortunately, this movie has long been absent (as noted by other posters), but it is one of the most important drama of the Great Depression, lyrical and touching drama of love, set in the slums of-town. It shows the performance Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young, who have just about the best of his career, and this superior example of how the director, Frank Borzage, managed to create an almost fairy-tale aura around poverty elements of crime and monstrous social inequality, which proves once again that as a truly romantic and spiritual his talents were. This film shows how love survives amidst poverty and desperate need, and it is absolutely life-affirming. This is a true masterpiece of the period, and it is a film that deserves to be more widely known.
