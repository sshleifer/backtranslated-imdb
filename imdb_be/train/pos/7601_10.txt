Lost one of its kind ... so charming and full of suspense, thrills and emotions, all in the same time.I never seen TV shows like this before. It is full of thrill jungle and has a good script. Actors emoted life on the island such a natural way that I feel lost on the island itself while watching it.it is a great part of the work handed over at a very reasonable series form.The, as the film depicts the life of the survivors lost on a desert island.I afraid to watch one episode after another, and I highly recommend this series for all the TV shows lovers.Watch see this magic is lost in nowhere.
