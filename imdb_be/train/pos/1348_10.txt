Thank God for Martin Scorsese and his love for the cinema. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect introduction into the consciousness of the most talented American artist who works in film today, and I could not recommend it more. I felt an extraordinary through it all, and you will too. Just relax and let him take you on a journey through their world, you will love it.
