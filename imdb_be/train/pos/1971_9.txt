I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday, and I really liked it. Stone has once again made a lot of character. She was as good as it was in the first Basic Instinct. She still has these clever but cunning responses. Though Sharon may be 48 years old ... it looks amazing! I do not care if it is a fake, like Barbie. It looks good and it is. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Sex, violence, and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for a few hours! Half of the people commenting on this film did not even see it. So do not listen to them.
