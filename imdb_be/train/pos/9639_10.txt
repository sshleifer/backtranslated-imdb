Very close and acute described bubble dynamic and emotional world of a 18year old man in a special way, making his first experience in his gay love for another boy, while relaxing with a part of his family. <br /> <br /> I liked this film because of its extremely clear and surrogated narrator, all this Â«Sound-close window" and quiet moments, which were full of intense feelings. <br /> <br />
