I do not want to spend a long time here to ramble about the site you've seen the trailer, and if you do not have it on the Internet. I recommend not to see it though- it was poorly designed and do not pack any of laughter or the magic of film. Thus, avoiding this film because of its lousy trailer should give it a chance.

Each gives better performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are some really great moments throughout. I personally plan to see it again when it is only for the streets to capture all the details that I who laughs at the first viewing!
