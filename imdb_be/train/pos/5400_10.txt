This film is a brilliant lesson in the history of Japan is set at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate, shortly before the shogunate lost a great battle against the loyalists, who wanted the emperor on the throne to rule Japan. In fact, I had to read a lot of history to get the entire background. <br /> <br /> Katz (also known as the original Datoiti) gives an excellent performance as Izo Okada, one of the four hitokiri (= people of Slayer) in bakumatsu. It is simple Samurai, who loses his entire fortune. In order to have a good life, it becomes a vassal Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuo Nakada = Ryonosuke of the Sword of Doom). Hanpei is an ultra-nationalist policy, which allows his group hitokiri kill a lot of high-ranking pro-Western politicians to achieve their political goals. Izo Okada worth it for the leader not really ask what they are doing. As long as he has the money to go out and drink and spend it on the whore. Okada murder are becoming more and more stringent, in the course of the film, and he is proud of the fact that reputation is based on fear, wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful portrait of the lives of ordinary samurai who finds himself involved in political affairs, and indeed to the naive to understand what is happening. Firstly, after the faithful and torture, and always have talks with Sakamoto (who is a samurai who reject violence) it will change their ideas and views on life. But too late .... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end Of Okada ... <br /> <br /> Katz and other staff give a brilliant performance. Each actor reaches a role. Sword fights are very unique and fast ... probably faster than a few movies in our time ... <br /> <br /> Check it out if you have a chance !!!
