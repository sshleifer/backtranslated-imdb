Well, first I have to mention the fact that when I first saw this film I was 9 years old. If I saw this one two weeks ago for the first time, I probably would have said that it is simply cheaper production of cable-TV horror film with some well-made scenes. But if you're nine, you just do not care about the facts. It scared the hell out of me at the time, especially those mentioned above Zelda- scenes (and they still do). Currently, I'm kind of hooked to this film. I have to see it, maybe once a month, and every day, I watch it with a 12-pack of beer and a bunch of friends. It's like an appetizer for a good party! I kind of agree with those people who say that action here is pretty unintense. Midkiff and Crosby look like I wanted Louis and Rachel look, but one can not see a lot of devotion or feelings on the faces of these two. Hughes and Guinea largely keep scenes "on credit" underplay. What I really want to say about this is the fact that in reality there is no other movie that has some semblance of Pet Sematary, and I do not mean the zombie stuff here. The atmosphere of the film, of course, the novelty and one of a kind. Honestly, how many times you've seen the movie, which at a superficial level looks like a cable television alone, but leave you with a chill in comparison with only the best horror coolers out there? Well, I broke some of the cast's balls minutes ago, but I have to say that all the parts of this level is also generally applicable to hone to perfection. But hey tell me if you know exactly what kind of film, which is similar to Pet Sematary! I really would like to know ... And I do not mean the night of the living dead ... here is one way of comparison intellect as compared with the material.
