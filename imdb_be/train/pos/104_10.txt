This film was an interesting cast, MAT he had a list of actors, but the actors that were in this movie did a good job. Im glad that we have a B class movies like this, the story is the main actors are the main and the way they do it, you do not need a budget of a million dollars to make a movie just the mix from the list would be the usual actors and the main story. I like the way they had the street to themselves and there was no one around, and what I though it was interesting that they do not close the cafe to install gear there and that they did it all from the police station. WFFL and Michael Madsen did a great job in painting there in the role of hostage situation. It was a great movie, and I hope that I will see more like it in the near future.
