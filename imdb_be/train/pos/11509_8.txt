It's a real shame that this spin-off television series inspired by the Mother Superior for television picture «The Night Stalker» and «Night Strangler" lasted only one season and twenty episodes, because in the best of this program was to undergo frequent victories and very interesting combination of acute cynicism humor (energetic verbal sparring Carl Kolchak coincides with the ever-irritating and long-suffering editor Tony Vincenzo always fun to watch and hear), in writing clever, graceful supernatural threat (must love ordinary and original creature in «The Spanish Moss Kill", "guard" and "horror in the highest", plus you can not go wrong with such a fright tried'n'true elected as zombies, vampires, werewolves and witches), colorful characters, living, acting on a raft of cold stars reviews (legendary biker movie icon William Smith got a rare chance to address the heroic leading role in «the Energy Eater» while other episodes of large signs veteran character actors, like Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Diener, Severn Darden, William Daniels, and in juicy roles), effective s genuine moments of suspense (sewer set the culmination of the "Spanish Moss Kill", in particular, was really harrowing), and, best of all, the one and only Darren McGavin in peak piquant form as brash, aggressive and excitable, but basically decent , courageous and honest small-time Chicago newspaper, Illinois reporter Carl Kolchak. <br /> <br /> Kolchak was the quintessential 70-everyman hero, a cunning and clever guy with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and failed a knack for getting into all kinds of problems. In addition, sometimes confusing Kolchak was nothing but a superman; it is usually either tripped or stumbled, running away from the deadly threat, but has a certain inner strength and courage that allowed him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of supernatural mortal enemies. Kolchak was surrounded by a handful of nice supporting characters: Simon Oakland was perfect as is chronically ill-tempered boss Carlo Tony Vincenzo, Jack Grinnage as the prim Ron Updyke made for a perfect komicheskoga foil, McDevitt, Ruth was just a great as the sweet Miss Emily Cowles and Carol Ann Susi was also a lot of fun as plodder debut Monique Marmelstein (which unfortunately disappeared after only appears in three episodes). Of course, the show was suffering from lackluster makeup and special effects (the titular werewolves in "werewolf", unfortunately, resembles a Yorkshire Terrier!) And final episode boasted a few ridiculously silly monsters (headless motorcyclist in "Chopper" Is Cathy Crosby, Elena Trojan in «The Youth killer"), but even second-rate shows redeemed trading program mark shamelessly quietly caustic wit and boundless vitality and fun McGavin scrappy presence.
