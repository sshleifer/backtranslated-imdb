Paul Greengrass Bourne defined saved the best for last! I've heard a lot of people are complaining about the way he was shooting the film, and some of them even compared the style of the camera to project Blair Witch. All I have to say that this ... are you kidding? Well, it was not so bad. I think it helps the scene feel more realistic, I would have preferred a stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the film, I really did not even notice it. <br /> <br /> You can say that Damon really got comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes it can be a bad thing, but in this case it is really a good thing. It really becomes a Jason Bourne in this game. Damon also has a great supporting cast Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Stiles. Strathairn has been a great addition to the cast as he added more depth to the CIA's secret organization. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is filled with great car chase and non-stop action, they were able to promote a sufficient number of characters in them with all that was going on. This film is much higher than the other two Bourne movies, and definitely one of the best films of 2007 summer season!
