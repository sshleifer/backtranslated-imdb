... head, hands and feet - is a group of the past, just as Strange Fruit. Triple whammy there. Those who professed not like this film or heartless or under 40 and have not had any experience of the real thing. Sad for them. It is well observed aching a little picture, which is a great way to pass an hour or two, and probably not even much fade on the second display. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as thick drummer (in many respects, very very fine figure of all), and Bill Nighy - the new name for me - as a neurotic singer and frontman of all turn in super performances and Juliet Aubrey have excellent DOE eyes to go with some sharp, acting as Karen, who is trying to keep the group together, they effectively self-destruct. <br /> <br /> Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson echoes loud and clear, Moto Hoople hind legs in front of one in all its absurdity inflated, and the script is never mawkish more than a minute. Do not compare with Spinal Tap or Rutles or Full Monty - it is unfair to all of them. The closest comparison obligations and it is not bad. And any film that can conjure up memories of Blodwyn Pig - it's a group that I do not remember ever seen, but the name lives on. - Well, it shows someone in the team knew that they were about <br /> <br />. small joy, and thanks for the memory <br /> <br /> Yes ... and I still have one - Stiff Little Fingers; and-and-and about Steeleye Span ... Spooky Tooth ... Ten Inch Nails whom? (You have to see the movie, or were on the road)
