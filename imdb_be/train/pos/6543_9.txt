I have read all the Nancy Drew as a preteen and collecting books as an adult. I loved the effect used in the end (and a little bit in the beginning) of the film, where the line drawings in the style of the books turned into a scene from a movie. It was a neat way to show the relationship between the situations in the movies and books. For example, the scene with the dealer eastern antiques were very reminiscent of many scenarios that I remember from the books. I thought that Ned was completely thrown, and Emma Roberts was great interpretation of the 21st century Nancy Drew. (Just as the picture of Betty Crocker, it keeps up with the times!)
