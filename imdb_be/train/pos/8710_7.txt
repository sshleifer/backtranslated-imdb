I remember this show from the Swedish television. I was only seven years old, and it scared me beyond belief. <br /> <br /> I would like to return to this series and see if it was as beautiful as I remember, although I suspect my taste and requirements changed. <, Br /> <br /> Although it was released to someone else, and many other space thrillers I suspect that it has its roots in horror movies from the 50: the political climate of s- and 70: a. When I think about it, it was a real science fiction, the film tries to discuss scientific and policy questions about who we are and what we do. The term of science fiction since become dark and be a term for any film that has spaceships in them.
