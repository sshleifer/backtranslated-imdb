Daniel Day Lewis My left leg gives us one of the best performances ever actor. He is brilliant as Christy Brown, a man who has cerebral palsy, which is then learned to write and paint with his left foot. Deserved Oscar for him and Brenda Fricker, who plays his loving mother. Hugh O'Connor is terrific as Christy Brown Jr. and Ray McAnally as big as a father. Worth a look for outstanding performances.
