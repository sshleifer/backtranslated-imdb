Before I begin, let me tell you how great it is worth special sounds when you play in Sonic Adventure DX I: Director's at the same time (the level of Red Mountain, in particular). Thus, while watching this stand-up special, I suggest-- NO, asking you to do it. <br /> <br /> Mensah takes his stand up to extremes in San Francisco, California. There he makes fun of all with absolutely no regrets. <br /> <br /> I largely thanks to God here that Carlos Sun has done his work, in which he uses the same joke again and again and again and again and again. He does a great job mockery of everyone, and at the same time be true about it; I know that a couple of times I said, after Carlos said jokingly: "Damn, this guy makes a good point!" And then the Game Over screen came up my TV, because I forgot that I played Sonic Adventure DX I: director. My bad :) So yes, there is nothing to complain about this special backup. If you have a TiVo or something like that, please do yourself a favor and save this historic hour.
