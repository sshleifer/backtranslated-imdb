Kurt Russell at his best as a man who lives for his former glory, Rina Hightower. Robin Williams is his opposite in a rare low-key performance as Jack Dundee. He threw a great pass in more than one. <br /> <br /> You will find some of the most quoted scenes ever caught in one movie, and Jack hisses in the rat, Reno posture, and the call goes Caribbean. <br /> <br /> do not miss this classic that is not afraid to show the football in the mud as it should be played.
