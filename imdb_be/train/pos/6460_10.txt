If the writer and director is going to open the heart to the film, the music wanted to make music out of it, they were able to with me. Banal human situation became an original, personally and directly, so personally I felt touched every situation. I believe that I can credit to the power of music combined with the point of view of the person who wrote the movie. Without spoiling, I can say that I was very touched by the film's approach to life. Were there actually screamed with joy-what? empathy? only deep emotion? for a very long time. I would like to find a way to show it to others. I saw it on the Seattle International Film Festival.
