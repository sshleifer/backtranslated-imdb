Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when people (at least the people who would do such a thing) to sit and talk about the film noir. <br /> <br /> However, some of the best films of the genre "Since last», «The Killers», «in a secluded place," "Night and the City," to control the level of complexity that increases their smooth for catch phrase and capricious its connotations foreboding shadows, felt and piano sums. <br /> <br /> «Where Sidewalk Ends", is quite difficult to find film - perhaps the only copy in the best-stocked video store in Manhattan was a rough butlegli on the AMC cable channel - belongs in the category of these classics. <br /> <br /> since the black cloud of the opening credits to pass, the curtain draws around the world collapses single rogue detective Mark Dixon, and in moments of passage, he inches closer, threatening suffocation. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is a sign that "the police with a dark past," but Dana Andrews gives Dixon gloomy look and restless intensity that makes you so uncomfortable as it seems. And yes, he was smacking around suspects too long, and again appointed chief (Karl Malden, in a typically strong and commanding outing) warns him, "for the last time.» <br /> <br /> However, Dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now. And the boy did not they were his closest? <br /> <br /> «Hood, cloths, cups, drain nickel rat," he spits, when that tough boss nut lowers it and deploys all complaints bureau received the correct hook Dixon. Council for it to cool for its own good. Instead, he takes matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> And the world he finds problems, he relies on his instincts, and falls back to nature, which may or may not be passed down from one generation earlier. <br /> <br /> As soon as he was in deep with the police, syndicate, his own partner. doubtful part Dickson of murder "investigation" threatens his job makes him wonder whether it is just as a basis, such as those he vowed to bring. Like Bogart in "a secluded place," he can "to avoid what he is?" <, Br /> <br /> If he has nowhere else to turn, he discovers that it is almost doomed his unexpected connection with the seraphic beauty (Gene amazing Tierney), who seems as if she can turn his barren existence bachelor should be to come home to. <br /> <br /> pacing of the film is excellent and tight grip. a group of authors who have contributed to the production script polish to a high gloss - instant dialogue entirely disintegrate burlesque of food, hot, sun becoming melodramatic or juicy. <br /> <br /> And it's all top-notch and the direction of the action is not too smooth or polished to ease the emotional grip of the film. angelic, soft focus beauty Gene Tierney to use with great effect . it shows itself to be an actress, a significant range, and its gentle, kind nature is limitless here, as well as her psychosis "Leave her to heaven." The scenes between Tierney and Dixon Andrews grow more intense and moving closer he seems to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> At the end of his rope, cut, bruised and exhausted Dixon misses him a lot, "Innocent people can get into terrible traffic jams, too .." he says. "One wrong move and you're in over your head.» <br /> <br /> Perhaps what makes this movie so completely convincing that feeling that things can go wrong wildly for almost anyone - especially for those who are trying to so hard to do the right thing - with one slight shift in the wind, one wrong decision or stroke, or, most frightening, due to factors that have no control over. Noir has always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. "Where the sidewalk ends" does so in a realistic manner. <br /> <br /> (One nit-pick with the side: It's otherwise sterling film has defiantly bad dubbing blonde model that would not sound out of place on Mystery Science Theater How strange.). <, Br /> <br /> But Noir fans - bracket, ANY film fans - who have not seen this for a tremendous pleasure.
