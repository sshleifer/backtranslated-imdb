On first viewing of the film, it is difficult to know exactly what happened, but the next view, it becomes more clear. I enjoyed this film. Dean Cain was very rich in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig character was confusing to understand at first, she was out to catch Bob, but I really believe that she landed, loving him, although by the time she broke his heart. Dean Kane's performance was perfectly ordinary. He's getting better with every film he makes. My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camille and children. It was left to the viewer to decide
