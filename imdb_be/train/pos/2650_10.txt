In addition, my list of favorite filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighty 3) the rest ... this film is actually better than the books (and miniseries, although it is an easy feat, considering the director). Flawless filming layer by layer, and acting (Kubrick constantly the number one skill) music - make it a masterpiece of horror. I watched the TV miniseries several years ago and loved the story, and I had expectations about it, when I got a hold of it. IT blew me away !!! It's much better than I ever imagined. He starts slowly (Kubrick's trademark) and has a lot of downtime, which accumulates in limbo. Intro scene is a classic by all means, and I watched it about 20 times just to shift the atmosphere it causes the entire film. In addition, the film does not offer a lot of gore (it is quite simple, and it does not in any way tasteless) tendencies that I hate in the last day of horror films. Just watch!
