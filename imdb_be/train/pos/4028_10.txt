I came to Pinjar from a very different background than most other browsers that are located here. I'm relatively new to Bollywood films and was born and raised in the United States. So I do not have a broad basis for comparison Pinjar other Indian films. Fortunately, no comparison is not required. <br /> <br /> Pinjar stands on its own, no less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In the same line, I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important films to come out of any studio, anywhere at any time. On a scale of mass appeal, it * could * be the Indian equivalent of "Crouching Tiger," if it had been properly promoted in the United States. It may very well have been a movie that put Bollywood on the US map. American movie-going public has a long love affair with the "Gone with the Wind", and whilst Pinjar Sun borrows from this site there are some common traits associated. Last but not least it is unusual (by American standards) 183 minutes operating time. <br /> <br /> On the background of a grungy background of the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947-48 urgent human drama of a young woman held captive circumstances and shove into trouble she did not have power in the making. Put into a difficult situation, it is some way it is possible not only to survive but also to develop. - and even thrive <br /> <br /> If the story is not enough, in any case, it is on display. Puro (in the protagonist) growth as a person will better illustrate - at least for a Western audience, unfamiliar with Indian culture - when the "prehistory" his character was more fully developed in the beginning of the film. But that would continue the 3-hour movie for 3 1/2 hours, or perhaps even more. Because not one minute of the film is lost, and none of that made it out of the editing can really be reduced for the sake of time. . It is better that the public needs to fill some of that was before the exit of some of what is <br /> <br /> I could use a lot of words to describe Pinjar: Â«acute", "disturbing" "coercion," "heart-wrenching" come to mind immediately. But the "uplifting", apparently as Apropos, as any of them. Any story that shows up the indomitable human spirit against the worst odds to be considered such. And triumph in Puro - while perhaps not immediately obvious to those around her - not less than inspiring. For the strength of only a story that I can not recommend this film highly enough. <br /> <br /> No less inspiring is a picture of Matondkar Puro. Too often overlooked among a bevy of young, new actresses, Urmila has the unique ability to deliver very trustworthy character in every role she plays. It does not just play the role of Puro, she breathes life into the character. Choosing Manoj Bazhpay Rashid was inspired. He directs too little Indian movie characters can be: subtlety. His team and nuance of expression is essential for the role. He brings more of a threat at the beginning of the movie with his piercing eyes, than any sword that hold in the hands of the rebels, together. <br /> <br /> If you see only one film of Bollywood in your life, make it Pinjar.
