It's a good movie. Something fun about watching money being blown on the super speed, especially from the point of view of the baby. Take it for what it is, funny film about a dream come true baby, and what the child can do with $ 1 million dollars. I do not like, do not watch. They make films for the observers, and not people who have nothing better to do something to complain about in their lives.
