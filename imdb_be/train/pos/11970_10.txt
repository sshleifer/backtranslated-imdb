Full House came to me when I was about 9. I remember the reruns of America's Funniest Home Videos by Bob Saget, and one day my mother told me that he was in a show called Full House. One day, I was lucky enough to catch an episode while visiting family. It does not seem very interesting at first, but as I looked more and more as the night at 9:00, I would just like it. <br /> <br /> This show really makes you want to be there yourself, hang out with the girls, go places with them, and maybe even join their small family "sing-AlongsÂ». <br /> <br /> what I like most about Full House is that it is a great show for both children and adults of all ages. There will be some parts that are more for adults, the parts that are designed for children, so that the whole family will enjoy. No matter how cheesy it may be, it's still a great show, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
