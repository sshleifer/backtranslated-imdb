First of all! This is not a thriller, although there is a lot of action in it! I think you can compare it with the American sports movie! If a team is very bad players managed the unthinkable by winning the game or tournament beyond expectations! In this case we are not talking about football or baseball, but taekwondo! At the beginning of the street thugs seem to be no good! But we soon learn that they do not want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life! Nice to see that they are fighting and training! I was surprised how funny this movie was! From beginning to end, you'll laugh your pants! Young Korean actors are very convincing! Go this great feel good movie!
