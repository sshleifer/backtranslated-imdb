Without a doubt, Private Lessons II is the biggest film I've ever seen. Japanese imports (badly) translated into English it a joy to watch. Not a lot of it makes sense, but it does not matter. This is the biggest comedy about never being intentionally funny. <br /> <br /> The film is a rare and unavailable on video, but I caught him a couple of times late, late at night on the card cables. May taped copy of watching dozens and dozens of times, as I slowly, a person-to-person, enter this film gem in the world. <br /> <br /> Joanna flour plays a tutor / lover Ken, our hero. (She apparently worked just to test it.) Ken plays Goro Inagaki, the Japanese pop group SMAP, giving it his all and has great hair through out the film. Stacy Edwards, with "The Company Men" fame, appears in the film as well, probably happy that she had found another job in a movie then. <br /> <br /> It takes at least three screenings to sorta figure out the plot. Repeating the view you can enjoy features such as an abnormal number of vases Ken has in his home (at least 50) or that Ken dressed in shirts with embroidered corn husks in the final. <br /> <br /> Movie film predictable, but very quoted. My friends and I act out entire scenes. Yes, it sounds like a lame we lost, and we are ... but we lost to a lame, who saw "Private Lessons II.Â» Be one of the ten people in the world who have seen this movie. You'll thank me for it.
