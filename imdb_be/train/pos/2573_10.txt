When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends get together at a movie night, there is one film, they insist on watching again and again, you guessed it, K-911, the third installment in the hugely successful K-9 franchise starring all your favorite TV dad, Jim Belushi. <br /> <br /> The people, I knew that it was possible to wear out a videotape, but DVD?! It has been played so often that he begins to miss; NO joke! But, of course, you'll have that if you have a movie so wonderful, so brilliant. <br /> <br /> Of course, we should thank one and only Tom Hanks for introducing us to his favorite genre Cop-Dog with Turner and Hooch; However, even this film does not measure up to a clear advantage, represented in all three K-9 movies. <br /> <br /> Some Nai Sayers says Belushi plays out with this third film in the series. Bullshit, I say. While you might suspect that the third installment - direct-to-video, in this case -. It may not seem to be something worth watching, you would have to prove to be wrong after watching this movie as <br /> <br / > I will not give away land, but I will say that Belushi and his heavy breathing partner to give their best performance yet - one that will have you howling with laughter! It's a shame, John Belushi among the living, to see what great strides made by his brother in the acting world. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend your teenage daughter to enter this film to her BFFs at its next sleepover party. Do not forget to puppy chow!
