In the near future, ordinary people above any suspicious suburban Morgan Sullivan (North) hired Digicorp, a huge corporation to be named as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors, Sunways. In his teaching, Morgan brainwashed, Jack takes a new identity thursby and sad lectures rides. In one of them, he came to a beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), who tells him that nothing is as it seems. Morgan recognizes the new reality in which he does not know who to trust. <br /> <br /> The Unknown «Cypher» was a big surprise for me. This film was not released in Brazil, but attractive and exciting plot is quite complex, with a large number of plot points, and with a great scenario, direction and performance. In the last corner I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger "Total Recall". This film definitely deserves to watch more than once, and I do not want the last scene, when an independent spy a controversial drive to the sea. The only know the director Vincenzo Natali from the fantastic "Cube", and this is the second work I see is also stunning. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. not available
