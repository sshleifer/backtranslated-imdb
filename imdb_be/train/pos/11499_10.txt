So as soon as the baby when the show originally aired, I just recently picked up a set of DVD, and I wish there were more episodes filmed. This show was 70s version poplular 90 show «X-Files» - but with a little more comedy / light-hearted approach. But do not get me wrong, some of these episodes have the full on horror themes, many of which have some pretty greuesome areas (left representation of course- it was at the beginning of the 70s television). <br /> <br /> Some of the areas where a little silly, as well as actions, but it is the charm and attraction to this series. If you like mystery crime drama, comedy, and science fiction / horror theme, this series brought together. Each episode with a frequency of about 50 or so minutes (1 hour with commercials), and that 50 minutes is fast always leaves me wanting more. A great classic show, which is undervalued in my book!
