James J. Corbett, the world champion from 1892 to 1897 year, proved to be a favorite role of Errol Flynn. Perhaps because he does not wield a sword or be a Western. He is tired of thugs, and he said in his autobiography that he felt that he was in Westerns miscast and could not understand why people love him in them. It's a nice film, but this is unlikely to tell the real story of James J. Corbett. <br /> <br /> As drawn Corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division, the man who used brains and speed over brute force to win. He defeated John L. Sullivan and Bob Fitzsimmons lost the heavyweight crown. He was also a compulsive womanizer and that was very much like a man who shows it. Of course, it was not shown on the screen. The character, who plays Alexis Smith, the daughter of a banker, who falls in love with him, has no basis in reality. Corbett was actually married twice and was outrageously cheated with both of his wives. <br /> <br /> In addition, although after he lost his title and after the events of the film concluded he suffered great personal tragedy. His father at the time of depression, probably over the finances, because he lost a bet heavily on his son beat Bob Fitzsimmons, shot his mother and then turned the gun on himself. Murder / Suicide little squares with a happy clan, Alan Hale presided. <br /> <br /> One thing, though, that I did like about Gentleman Jim. Ward Bond's career got a role in the game of his life, John L. Sullivan. Directed by Raoul Walsh was a great performance from the Bond as a raging, but attractive Sullivan. Even allowing for some bad moments Sullivan, who did not make it on the screen, like a rabid racist, portrayal of Bond is the quintessential John L., and the best thing about Gentleman Jim. <br /> <br /> Speaking of racism, one thing that has been said, was the fact that while champion Sullivan refused, regardless of race, to meet Peter Jackson, who was black and from Australia and probably , the best heavyweight of his time. I say probably, because as a candidate Corbett met him and fought with him over 61 rounds in a draw. It's a fight more than any other has created a demand for the title match Sullivan-Corbett. Of course, if Corbett was a champion, he refused to give Jackson a title shot. Maybe he does not want another 61-round marathon with someone who may have been better in that day. <br /> <br /> Gentleman Jim Sun Stories Jim Corbett, this film Errol Flynn playing James J. Corbett. But to Corbett he was alive in 1942 would certainly have loved movies and loved drawing Flynn of his life. This is how he would like to be remembered.
