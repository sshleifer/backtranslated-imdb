Tom Hanks, you've never seen it. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, the "Angel of Death". He is the killer of his surrogate father, John Rooney (Paul Newman), an elderly Irish mafia boss. Sullivan's young son (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses what his father does for a living, and both soon on the road for seven weeks to rob banks in order to avenge the murder of his wife and another son Sullivan. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer ready to kill Sullivan himself for the opportunity to add to your collection of photos of dead mobsters. Filmed beautifully catch the drama of life in the 30s. Sometimes bogs down the pace, but then an explosion of graphic violence supports the story. Directed by Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and bonding secretive man and his young son. Other famous actors include: Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks is excellent in a very memorable film again. Make room for some Oscars!
