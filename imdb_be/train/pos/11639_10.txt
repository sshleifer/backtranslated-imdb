I saw an advanced screening of the film tonight. I absolutely loved it. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night. Cillian Murphy as a very terrible villain. For those of you who saw Batman Begins, his character was much more frightening in this film. He played very well the character. Worse than "bad guy", I've seen in a while. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the room laughed, gasped, and welcomed at the same time, as if we were on cue. The suspension passes through the exit of the film. The amazing part is that the end was not an anti-climatic. I was not disappointed in the end. I was pleased. The trailer does the film justice. The film is much better than the trailer specified. Do not wait for this movie to come out on video. Go it. Although I do not have to pay to see this movie, I'd love to give 10.75 to see it. Enjoy!
