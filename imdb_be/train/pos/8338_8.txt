This film is so great. Its set back, probably in the 40s and the character of Meg Ryan struggled, to be known as "smart". Plus, Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie. And all of this has a magical feel to it. Everytime I watch it I feel happy. This is definitely a girl movie, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I also love music. The violin is amazing. but other than that I think it's a cute story, and everyone should watch.
