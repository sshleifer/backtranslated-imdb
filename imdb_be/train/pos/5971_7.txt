Skippy by family ties are cut from pure metal to the baby in this pretty bad movie. The film seems to be that this was done in response to all these frustrated father, who said metal turned their children harm or causing them to kill themselves - except this one dead satanic metal star trying to return from the grave (using Skippy to help). And although the plot and hackneyed clich√©s, the corniness (eg, an evil green mist removing clothes from the girls) and the sound that makes the movie so the paddle (or more). And, of course, there's nothing like Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher who asks what happened to the love song :). Definitely a movie for what a few friends for a good laugh. And while you're at it, do a double feature with a bachelorette party Massacre 2 - is "an evil rocker" (as shown in the video box) driller killer in black leather w / fringe. A must see for lovers of cheese cinema.
