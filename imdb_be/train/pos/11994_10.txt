As for many here, I can not praise the cast and crew who developed other signs on bends, they made during my childhood, I, like everyone else, who commented here thoroughly enjoyed not only the quality of the animation, but the quality the story lines and characters. <br /> <br /> to a class of this work of art as a "cartoon" can never do justice Miracles on bends, in fact it is an insult to class it as a "cartoon" Miracles on bends has an animation and nothing less, this is obviously Much work will be a genius at Disney today, when Disney "pulls" it from the air or little do they realize what they have done, and I am confident that their souls were tortured regret until now. <, Br /> <br /> I'll take the time to explain, from the first, which DuckTales to the last, I think, a black cloak, Disney plagued with failures due to political correctness and took a quantum leap backwards, because they prefer quantity over quality at the moment, not to mention a room full of monkey for the story, I could not have my kids watch heady "Cartoons" they throw right now in fear, that they are Homer Simpson for some time in the future, and 50% of guilt it would look at me for permitting them, I could not let this zda dig, so I have all the show since the late 80's to mid 90's on solid so one day my kids can not be spoiled «Cartoon Crap» with today and gastronomy childhood last piece I have and to hold, and I must that's all. Miracles on bends <br /> <br /> Miracles on bends me, without a doubt, the best animation ever created in the world due to this depth, charm, wit, compassion, emotions and lack of truly poor quality and subject lines, many of which have today, you can see any of this content, say, "Ed, Edd n Eddy, or anything else you can think of?, waste produced today can be compared with any 3-year-old in Hyroglyph deciphering depicting Picasso. <br /> <br /> the next time, when you look episod e Miracles on bends; Look at Woodgrain on any wooden object or a building, such as higher employment, and saliva of workmanship and the effort put into the animation, even one shot backgrounds were made as if they would use them again and again, building look precise movement Art Deco, which was popular during the period, drawn Even cars real life, well, not all episodes have been fantastic in the animation, but the lower-class scenes were closed by superior scenes, so all in all it is leveled all this before the end of the episode and you probably will not even notice it never at all if you are not focused and have attention to detail. <br /> <br /> One thing I love is what I like to call "deliberate mistakes" or "the alleged error" in each episode, and some of them two, for example, in a short deep where Rebecca is "You to something Bala "and Baloo answer:" Who, me, I'm innocent as a schoolboy "look in Rebecca's eyes, I won 't spoil the rest Baloopers but just keep an eye out next time. <br /> <br /> Everyone ELSES comments are drumming and 100% correct, I do not have anything to add that others have not already said here, Disney, Wake up and smell the coffee, you slept for more than ten years, to cease production of the garbage and return the quality of animation and stop the production of "Cartoons", we have seen proof that you can do, and we want him back as soon as possible.
