This film is one of the best American B-movies 90s. If you are looking for a serious film, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for some action, a lot of laughter, and tongue in cheek variation on the traffic cop fighting gangster, it is worth a look. Each chew the scenery a little bit, but that's really what the film is all about, and it's all pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and have to do another film together.
