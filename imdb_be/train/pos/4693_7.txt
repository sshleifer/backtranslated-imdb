Johnny Dangerously completely falls into the category of random gags with his inflated and the complete absence of a comprehensive script or story that makes sense. But this is true <br /> <br /> Starring cute; Michael Keaton great comic artist before he took himself too seriously, as the years. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me. But complete scene stealer here Richard Dimitri (sneak word «Iceholes» in the history of cinema), as a gangster who fares best in the murder of the English language. <br /> <br /> I attribute a lot of childhood memories with this film, as I watched it often enough, so maybe I tend to enjoy it more than others. Johnny Dangerously, at least, completely innocent gangster film parody that even well-intentioned relays some messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like, but it's hard to recommend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
