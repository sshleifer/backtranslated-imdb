I do not agree with those who done't like this film. <br /> <br /> Earlier, I love this movie when I was little, and I still do. It's cute, funny and heartwarming. And it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And even if he did not have a lot of history, it was still fine, I give him a 10 and two thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, and it proves that your heart's desire-x and dreams can come true. (Tear, tear) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, personally, if someone says that it sucked, what I'm going to say "Shame." Because it was a lovely little film, and I'm glad that at least some people loved it.
