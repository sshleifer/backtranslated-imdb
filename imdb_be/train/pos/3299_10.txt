A great movie that requires an acquired taste. If you are at work, boo BAM movies and hate serious love story, it is not for you. Otherwise, if you want to sit in front of a good movie intelligent now and again I recommend it very highly. Easily the best film produced in Bollywood in this century. <br /> <br /> The only other Indian film, I would give it 10/10 for Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even if it comes second to this masterpiece.
