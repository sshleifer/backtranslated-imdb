"War" is actually one of the funniest movies of candy I have ever seen, period. Of course, this kind of low budget, but it's non-stop comedic tour-de-force. There are tons of memorable quotes. For example, if it is fast to be father in law asked how much he earns, the Candy says, "Oh, I pull down somewhere between thirty and ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir," Oh, of course, is the delivery of Kendo. who sells it. Just classic stuff. Eugene Levy also turns into a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker. Clip it horrible low budget movie "Kung Fu UÂ» will have you rolling. <br /> <br /> So if you Candy fan and want to rediscover the forgotten stone, I can not recommend this film enough.
