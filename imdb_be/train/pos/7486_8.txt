For example, I really like this movie for some reason, I go to the end, but I want to touch on why I think that people do not like it. First, there are people who just love to hate Tom Cruise. I do not understand it really. Second, Cameron Crowe, I think successfully p *** es on two groups of moviegoers with this film. Casual, relaxed, "without looking too hard to think of" a group of moviegoers are confused, if the site has a complete 180 at the end of the film. And a deep, philosophical, mystery-lovers devastated if Crowe has one of his characters fully explain the mystery. <br /> <br /> it's a good movie. And Tom Cruise is doing a very good job at it. I think that this is probably his best result of the fact that I saw it all, although I have not seen all of his films, or even the majority of them probably. The supporting cast is good as well. Penelope Cruz gives high performance and Jay San Lee was enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I love this story, and I think that's what Vanilla Sky more than anything. It's a mystery, adventure and romantic comedy, but it's basically just a good story. And it has a lot of philosophical nuances to it, and many of these ideas and stories, as in the philosophy of history. David Aames (Cruise) is a man who had everything he wanted, more or less I lost it a second chance was given to catch to return everything back, and at the end, facing his demons and fully what is going on, selects a reality, simplicity and n rmalnastsi to see if he can finally find the one thing he could never gain control of :. happiness <br /> <br /> A lot of people were disappointed that blood put complete secrecy in the end. I think it is necessary. The audience knows without a shadow of a doubt that David is aware of his circumstances, and this makes the choice in the end, all the more powerful. <br /> <br /> And the music in the movie is great. This is probably what makes the film enjoyable as it is. In particular, «Njosnavelin» by Sigur Ros, which is an amazing song. <br /> <br /> In general, I'd give it 3 out of 4 stars. This is a film with some substance for those who like to think about it, and a great story for those who want to relax. This is a "moderate" approach is probably why people do not like it so much, because it is not a full-scale mystery, or a full blown love story. He mixes and matching of different elements and genres.
