One of the best films I've seen in the last five years! The cast is universally effective in the tale of young love and bravado on the Lower East Side of New York City with two leads to be a superstar in the making. Funny, charming, sad and inspiring, this is quite a refreshing take on the urban youth, which often puts a sickening Larry Clark's chip into the gutter where it belongs ... although I must admit that the bullet was a head taller than his usual fare. Raising Victor Vargas one film you will push yourself for missing ... so do not miss it!
