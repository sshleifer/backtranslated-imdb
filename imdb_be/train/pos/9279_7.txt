Panahi in the comedy-drama "offside" reflects some women trying to enter the arena in Tehran, from which women are banned. The official reason: a lot of foul language, and the players have their feet display. But, of course, it's really a case of discrimination based on sex. Thus, much of the film consists of a soft comic as a woman trying to ask serious questions about the men why women are prohibited from the stadium, and one woman even comes with its own scheme to challenge the men. <br /> <br /> As I understand, all the films Panahi (this one included) are forbidden in Iran. The real tragedy is that the CIA's 1953 overthrow of the prime minister and the subsequent support of the hard Shah Khomeini gave an excuse to use it a narrow interpretation of the Quran to establish a chauvinistic society, and that the current policy of George Bush towards Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gives a reason to act and cowboy tighten censorship. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a neat look at the people coming up with ways to challenge the system. Not a great movie, but it's worth a look. Given that all the films of Jafar Panahi is prohibited, wondering how he was able to even make them.
