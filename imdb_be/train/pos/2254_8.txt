Fox epic telling of the great pioneering effort of America comes to DVD with some really outstanding «Extras». BRIGHAM YOUNG (The «migrant" was added to the European release), telling great leader history pioneer, who, under the influence resulted in a member of the Mormon faith (the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, after mobs murdered their prophet / leader Joseph Smith (Play Vincent Price), was brought to the screen in 1940, just as America is about to usher in the second world war. It was a bold move on the main Fox, Zanuck and it was a breath of fresh air for the Mormon people, as it was the first attempt to film favorably to show their faith on the screen. Now Fox is working with James Arc, curator of Motion Picture remarkable archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, brought the film in DVD format in outstading edition. Mr. D'Arc, who a few years ago did his doctoral thesis on the subject of the film, and gave one of the most in-depth commentary track ever made for the DVD. It separates fact from fiction, and allows listeners to understand why this movie is so highly valued by the church leaders, while embellishing the truth to run throughout the film. One of the fun bits of information has to do with Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the main role. Many years after the movie, he married last holy woman and was eventually converted in the LDS faith. There is a lot to be learned from the Arc of knowledge, and it is great to have this as part of the DVD! There are more than 100 photos from the Fox & BYU including files on the disk, as well as newsreel footage of the incredible premiere in seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks for another outstanding FOX DVD - and thank you, James D'Arc for the great comments!
