As someone who has never been in the sport, it seems that it will be difficult for me to get into a football (or, as we Americans inexplicably called football) -themed «Bend It Like Beckham». But I must say that it was one cool movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder heating) and her friend WASP Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I'm going to say that the British - and international - the way), and just like footballer David Beckham. But traditional Sikh parents Jesminder does not support (her mother offers really whacked-out football at the beginning of the description of the film). Okay, so maybe it was a kind of cliché, in this sense, but you have to love this movie! And if, like me, you go to this movie, not knowing the definition of "bending" in football ... do not worry, the film explains it (I would have never heard of David Beckham for this film). And we all know that Knightley hit it big: after a few months after the «BILB» came out in the States, she starred in an equally steep "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."
