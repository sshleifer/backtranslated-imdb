I saw the film, and in fact could not stop my tears. His tragedy is that India has no such freedom when leaders who dared to do justice to their children if they do not behave properly .. The current generation of politicians bring their children into politics, not by measuring the caliber and skills .. I remember dialogue with Gandhi, "what kind of society we want to create / make with these people (about Harilal)? Not surprisingly, this is a dream that India is unlikely to be a leader in this or the next generation .. Einstein was right when he talks about Gandhi that "could be difficult after 50 years to believe that a man with the body, soul, and mind (Mahatma Gandhi) have ever lived on this earth. " I sincerely wish to thank you very much Anil Kapoor, Feroze Khan and all the film actors / actresses for this remarkable film about the great man and the relationship with his son. All of a father and son should watch this movie once and take a few lessons for both roles.
