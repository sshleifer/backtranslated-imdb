I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I believe that she is the actress who is best not to operate the camera, and just be yourself. She did it, and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, it does not try to add more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, so it was more like a sober editor. While in the second half, it is completely set itself back in their daily path, and I just could not tell her to be an editor in any way. Thus, its performance is entirely shifting in this film. <br /> <br /> The film, in general, attracts and inspires. Young character is complete and valid. Anyway, the film tells the story of a large and complex. <br /> <br /> The only big flaw is that he showed no fracture of the hero and the heroine's love story. I am quite confused when they kiss at the end of the story, because it is quite unclear, for two people.
