A great movie, especially if you like horses, WWII films and harsh Hungarian Plateau.A story of courage, compassion and dedication that goes beyond generations. Horsemanship is exciting, as well as the main characters of the horse in his training. <br /> <br /> I'm going to buy this movie and watch it again. This is a family movie and I recommend it highly.A good "," film "Family" Nite. Although there are some scenes of violence, it was the Nazi occupation Hungary.The native people were very interested in how they stood in their places, even in the face of imminent death by a Nazi officer, who had his own personal reasons for hunting Brady. hauntingly beautiful film.
