A must for any punk, this is the film that made The Ramones par in the early 1980s (when he first appeared on the premium cable stations). It was one of the first and the best films of the American punk rock with a cult status there with Rocky Horror Picture Show. Initially the producers wanted to Cheap Trick, like the stars, but the release of «Live At Budakon» album only made them superstars and too hot element to be in the budget of the film. Very good luck for the Ramones, with want to break out of the underground world of punk rock in the mainstream market (which, unfortunately, did not happen until after the collapse of the band). Group, Dee Dee especially, has always disliked the film through the '80s, but the fans have always loved, and be able to read most of the film, waiting to get to the Ramones show. This film, like most of the classics, it's silly fun with some classic Ramones staff in its heyday. Do not wait any longer, you will not find it. It's really fun, so enjoy. Another Alan Sheet classic film in the same vein, it is get mad, featuring Lee Ving with legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
