"Cinderella" is a film about a young girl whose mother died and her father remarried. After her father died, the stepmother of Cinderella was very stingy her and made her do all the worries about the house like cleaning up after her two stupid stepsisters. One day the king sent a message to all single women to attend the royal ball in honor of his son to find a wife. Of course, Sun Cinderella get to go, but her stepsisters did. Cinderella was very upset, and thought there was no way that she could attend the royal ball, until the appearance of her fairy godmother. So she did some magic and made a Cinderella into a beautiful woman, but she had to get back before midnight, because if the magic changes ago. While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses track of time, and the clock strikes midnight, so she runs away from the palace and lost glass slipper. Then the king ordered the duke to find women who wore this shoe. Duke searched every house, but in the end found a woman who it belonged to, Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Clyde Gerona, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Lasky sent one of the best animated films of Disney in 1950, a film about a fairy tale. At the beginning of the movie Cinderella servant to his family and there was no one to love her, but with a bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing "Cinderella" is the music. If there was a fairy Cinderella makes her magic, she sang a song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house, so that I will never forget. I also loved the part when Cinderella and Prince singing the song, so it's love, while they were dancing because they realize that they love each other. Overall, this film was my favorite movie when I was a little kid, because every little girl wants to live a fairy tale.
