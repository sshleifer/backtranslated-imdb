Well, firstly, I would like to clarify that Kaakha Kaakha is part of a prayer Tamil and roughly translated it means "to protect". Khakhee on the other hand, refers to the color of police uniforms (which Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> In addition, the film industry of Tamil adequately purely commercial enterprises, or any Rajnikanth Vijay film will be a testament to this statement. <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha a great movie with a great soundtrack. Certainly very stunning in the final scene, is particularly fond of the ending (which, of course, surprise!). Gore rather too much time, but of course it's a great movie!
