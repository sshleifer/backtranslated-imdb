I do not know who could find fault with a man and a funny movie, as it is with a lot of pleasure to your heart. I enjoyed every minute, and guessed the ending halfway through the movie - but it did not disappoint me. This will not only touch your heart, but it's such a good family film - we need a lot more like it!
