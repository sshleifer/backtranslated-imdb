My mother and I were on our way home from a trip to the north-east (mainly MA), when we decided to take a short detour visiting film festival in Boston. Now, I do not know much about the film, so I thought it might be a little informative. The first film we saw this, ROMEO DIVISION. Now, I do not know about you, but I thought it was great! I'm from Texas, and where I come from, we do not see too much video so it was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted that it was too strong, but he said that I knew nothing about what she was saying, but it was a great picture. I was shocked by the fight sequences, they were great. Also, I'm a big fan when the good guys win, so I was thrilled when Romeo home killed all the bad guys. It was exactly shine. I'm not sure if it gets released on video, but if you get a chance you should check it out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. A word to the wise though, it's pretty brutal and there are many CUSS words, so you can not allow your children to watch. This is more for adults.
