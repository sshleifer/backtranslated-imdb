I loved the October sky. The thing I liked most was to be music. He worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, he gives the viewer time frame. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. At two o'clock, the instrumental evaluation takes over. Music is currently fits the mood of the film perfectly. <br /> <br /> I do not only enjoy the music, I thoroughly enjoyed the actors. Jake Zhillenhol Homer Hickam was especially for me as a surprise. He gave the first performance of the class, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I've seen this film about escaping life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed.
