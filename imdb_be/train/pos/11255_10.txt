This is, without a doubt, my favorite Le Carre novel, and he turns to the silver screen with all the love and care one might wish. I read the review on this site, which seems to find symbols disgusting, but I believe this misses the point. All the history of Le Carre, in fact, love stories, and this is no exception. This is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is installed. Treason is the key to all benefit anyone. Pim education so close to mine, I find it horrifying observation. Peter Egan in his best role and the late Ray McAnally incredibly well. Even the smallest role played by such as Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis spot on. This roll dream theater impresario in. History should not be spoiled by ill-informed description, but suffice it to say that for the young men slowly but inexorably destruction and descent in espionage and treason. All my sympathy Magnus Pym and his only (not sexual) love for Mack (RÃ¼diger Weigang-so-great, as always. His only true friendship, but also, by definition, one in a long line of changes. OUTSTANDING! Rent, buy it. I love it.
