Alternative name of ecstasy, a Symphony of love; a name that adequately describes the mood and feeling of the film. Ecstasy is an early Talkie, and might very well have been a classic film that will be released during the silent film. This film is a visual pleasure, and deliberately paced, so the viewer can enjoy its sensual lyrical quality which is represented in art restrained manner. Director's style is clearly European. Subject and approach to sexuality was much more complex than what is produced in Hollywood at the time. Consider the code of censorship in the United States during the 30's, that pretty much sums up. Hedy Lamarr, one of the great beauties of all time, was the perfect choice for this "Love Symphony".
