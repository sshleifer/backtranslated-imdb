This film was a disaster at the box office, and the reason is that the innocence of the film, The sweetness of history. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of the story is very good, the director tried his best all forces. Abhay is beautiful and impressive, and again he shines in his role, he did his best in comedy or in an emotional scene. Saha looks so sweet in the film. The rest of the star cast was just fine. Music and lyrics are good, like Singer Himesh impressive here. Do not miss this movie, its a great movie and feel good one for us. Abhay best performance to date. I'll give 9/10 Ahista Ahista.
