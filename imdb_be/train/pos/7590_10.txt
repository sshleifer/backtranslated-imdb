I do not care if you do not want to my comment or not, but I think that you, who wrote that the film is not good..you're so obsessed with Hollywood movies, that you can not see how well it's a movie I did not fan of Jay Chou, but I love the game and not only him ... and maybe you think it does not make much sense in the idea, and maybe you think it's not so interesting, but look deep there anymore, than action films, more than love and passion, and tears have more than the United States in the world, and it's good :) very well. And it costs a lot to do so, please do not criticize the actor directors because you do not know how hard they work for you, to be happy in this half hour to look at them thank you :)
