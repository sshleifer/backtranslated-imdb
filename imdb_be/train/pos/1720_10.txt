This is an early Biograph short it was so much fun to watch. The second disk in one of D.W. Griffith "Years of DiscoveryÂ» DVD set (strongly recommended), it has three excellent performances main conclusions, and it is interesting to see, Henry B. Walthall (Little Colonel, Birth of a Nation) as the mannered musician gives the countess's eyes (and other things). <br /> <br /> husband countess goes berserk in the treason of his wife and her walled up in a small room with her lover. It's kind of unbelievable that they would not hear the wall goes up, but hey, maybe the wine was something to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (father is silent Raymond Hackett player) gestures boar and this adds to the melodrama, but surprisingly fun. The best moment comes at the end. As a lady coming out of shock and fear, when she realizes that she is doomed, Henry picks up his instrument and the "supporter", he on it. The way he did it was so unexpected and strangely kind of sex, and I just lost it, and laughed my head. The expression on his face! From that moment on I was fascinated by Henry B. Walthall.
