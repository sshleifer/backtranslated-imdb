This is not a typical Mel Brooks movie. It was far less slapstick than most of his films, and in fact was a story that was followable. Lesley Ann Warren made a film, it's so fantastic, underrated actress. There were some things that could be fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes that could probably have been reduced to make room to do so, but in general, it is worth the price of rent and see it. The action was good on the whole, very Brooks did a good job, is not peculiar to him to speak directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the film, but "fume" and "by Sailor" both played their roles well.
