Gedeon and Jules GCD wanted to shoot a documentary about a rookie New York City firefighter. What they got was only the frames of the film inside the World Trade Center on September 11 <br /> <br /> Working with stairs by James Hanlon to Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair gas leak, while Gideon stayed in firehouse if interesting happened. The aircraft flies low above the city distracted Jules and it showed up chamber, the second to the plane hit the tower One. <br /> <br /> Jules asked the captain to follow him in the tower. The first thing he saw was two people in the fire, that he refused to take off. He remained on the ground for the next few hours, removing the reaction of firefighters and others who were there. <br /> <br /> Brothers Naudet took great care in not doing the movie too strong, gnawed and mountain. But the language of a fire a little rough, and CBS showed a lot of balls airing it without censorship. Brotherhood of Nod mixed footage filmed with one-on-one interview, so that firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during certain moments of crisis. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the film of this name, most of the money from the sale of DVD go to 9/11 related charities. Very well done, emotional, moving, and totally devoid of political propaganda, the best documentary varieties today.
