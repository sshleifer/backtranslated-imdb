Much has been written about Mamet's "House of Games"; most of them are good. I decided to return to Flick, to see how it holds after 17 years, and was amazed at how much I enjoyed watching it again. The film's success and longevity, probably has a lot to do with the two main components, which are always fun on the film; a good story and a good scam. Mamet was able to bring his signature moodiness and overt theatricality of the film, and scamming us, the audience, and sign at the same time. Then he explains the art of cheating just to do it again, etc. constantly build history. "House of Games", is now a freebie on the cables, you should pay attention to the first timers and well Relaying for Mamet fans. (B +)
