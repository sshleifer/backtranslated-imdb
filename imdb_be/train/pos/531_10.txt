This film has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I saw this movie for the first time a week ago, and since then, every day I see the opening and every time I feel as excited as I felt the first time I heard David Niven uttering the immortal words of Sir Walter Raleigh's Pilgrimage: <br /> <br /> Give me my scallop shell of silence, my personal faith, to go on, a bag of joy, immortal diet, my bottle of salvation, My gown of glory, Gage exactly the hope; And so, I will take the pilgrimage (??) <br /> <br /> Do you know why it would be a truism to say the life of Michael Powell Emeric Pressuburger and fully justified in order to create such a remarkable discovery? . Since they have already been admitted to Paradise Poets long before they made this movie <br /> <br /> I can imagine both of them before the court at the time of the Last Judgment and says blithely to an irate God: I am sorry, sir. So you want to know what we have done throughout our lives? Well, you'll see: We wrote the director and producer: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, red shoes ?? Do you think that enough sir? It is quite obvious that these two great artists have done their duty to God, the nature of the muse or whatever you call it, when they shot a matter of life and death. The fact that the lives of other people would be justified for their actions may not be obvious to all, even though I feel that my life will have meaning only I had nothing, he would see this film made. <br /> <br /> Of course, the old-timers would be tempted to say: they do not make movies like this anymore. They will be partially wrong; . They do not make movies like this in the old days, or <br /> <br /> I have already quoted Keats here, but I will repeat his words: a thing of beauty is a joy forever.
