Eva (Hedy Lamarr) has just got married to an older man and a honeymoon, she realizes that her husband does not want her. Her frustration with the marriage of love and hardship, making Eva returns to her father's house on the farm, leaving her husband. One evening, while swimming in the lake, her horse runs away with her clothes and reeling young workers and gives them back to Eve. They fall in love for each other and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and seeks to Eve back home. Eva refuses, and the state leads the trio to the same place, to finish the job in a tragic way. I just watched «Extase» for the first time, and the first comment I have a relatively bad quality VHS released in Brazil, the Brazilian distributor network video: the film is only 75 minutes of work, and it seems that it has been used in various film reels. There are some parts completely damaged, and other items are very damaged. Thus, in the beauty of the image is not reached Brazilian spectator, if he has a chance to find this rare VHS to rent or for sale. The film is practically a silent movie, the story is very old and has only a few lines. Thus, the characters are poorly developed. However, this film is also very bold, with an exhibition of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for these standards of beauty. Another fantastic point and poetic metaphor to colors, symbolizing the unity between Eve and her lover. The way in which the director holds the stage to show the need and deprivation Eve is very clear. Or not convincing end is also very unusual for the 1933 movie. I liked this movie, but I hope that one day there is a chance to see 87 minutes of the restored version. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "Extase" ( "ecstasy")
