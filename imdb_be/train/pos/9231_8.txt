FLAVIA heretic countries belong to the genre nunsploit - equal parts. Cheap, feminist travel, and "history" as we go Flavia on her amazing journey <br /> <br /> We start with Flavia in the monastery .. .It is not too happy there because she does not believe in all the male-dominated " rules "and Ishmael macho world around her and runs away from the convent with his Jewish friend, Abraham. They both eventually caught and Flavia returned to the convent, where she joins other "unbelievers" nuns in the acceleration of the Muslim invasion. Flavia hanging out with the Muslims, who take over the monastery and get "busy" with the nuns in a strange set of scenes. In the end, Muslims withdrawable and Flavius ​​was punished as a traitor of Christianity in other unusually hard scene ... <br /> <br /> This one has a lot of things that I would like to see to use the film in the 70's era - some good gore including the removal of the nipple-and good I leg-skinning scene, some decent nudity - including the need for full front and a decent storyline, and I will say that it is sorta dragged in several places, but not enough to get really bored with it I would definitely recommend.. this to nunsploit / 70 use fans ... 8/10
