Poor cast a terrible script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive, the evil scientist has serious trouble mustache, one person takes over the platoon trained in shooting and is the winner, horrible special effects, they solve the problem by blowing the head of the monster ... wonderful. The only thing missing was unnecessary graphic sex scenes during one of the murders. Haha. Well butted up fun filled with predictable twists and ridiculous liner. I really liked this movie, but before you watch it, make sure that you are in for a good laugh. I recommend this movie for people who can watch movies, and do not take it so seriously. I can not, in my mind, I think that this film was made for people to take it seriously. However, if you can watch and sit back and just enjoy, I really think that you can enjoy this film is how it should have been filed. Very simple. So popcorn and a couple of beers and spend the evening with friends, and this film is fun. He brought joy into my life.
