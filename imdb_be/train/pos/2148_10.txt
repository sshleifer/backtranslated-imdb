I always look forward to this film when it on TV. Have to get the DVD, I think. A range of different types of people large. He tells me that everybody can be a dancer when they try hard enough. My favorite character has to be Mr.Aoki. It is so quaint, but so full of emotion. This is a great movie with a beautiful dance. Unfortunately, we never get a chance to see them go to Blackpool. would make for a perfect sequel, if they were. But I believe that it leaves it to the imagination of what could have happened. <br /> <br /> It is very simple and innocent story. He remains faithful to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the Hollywood remake. Not sure if I want to. I do not like Jennifer Lopez. I think that Richard Gere is more consistent with the original than Lopez. I have a feeling that a remake is not as simple and innocent.
