Deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, sleep Vincent, Matt Craven and Diane Lane), who are invited back to spend a week in Tomawka, Camp (Ontario) Canada their former consuelor (Alan Arkin). Writer / director Mike Binder drew on his experience in the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding of the yarn, which makes sense. In addition, the film has a lot of funny moments, some of which are absolutely amazing, my favorite one involves the use of adhesive tape ,. Newton Thomas Sigel ( "The Usual Suspects," "Three Kings") provides the film with some impressive images of the Canadian wilderness. Among the actors, Sam Raimi, director of the film "Evil Dead» and «The Gift», appears here as an awkward right hand Arkin in. Another thing, this film reassured me that the camp should not be a place of bloody murders.
