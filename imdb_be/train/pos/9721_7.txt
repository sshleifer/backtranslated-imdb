How to lose friends and alienate people decent comedy with a bit of a romantic approach. <br /> <br /> This is actually a story of Sidney Young (Simon Pegg), a breakthrough in journalism and magazine writing business, which is interpreted in a funny way. Simon Pegg did OK appearance, a little worse than his usual. The film is not fun or funny all the way or anything like that, but it does have its moments, and those moments, really fun. <br /> <br /> I recommend this fun and worth watching American comedy with English cream for all people just want to sit back, relax and enjoy the movie for what it is. If you are going to watch this movie with a critical approach, then you have to go, if you do not want to be disappointed and begin to smash it.
