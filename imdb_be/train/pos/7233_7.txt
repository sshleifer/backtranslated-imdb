I have not read all the comments, but at least one poster noted that the 30 minute version may possibly be reduced. I wonder that myself because the later part of the film just does not make sense to me, even if I rewatched them. 30 minutes seems a very short film in 1917, too. "Poor Little Rich Girl", which was the next film Tourneur is 65 minutes and the "Pride of the clan," which was his previous feature was the length of 84 minutes. So I was relieved to see that I am not mad, to be part of this movie is not enough, and so the decision does not make much sense. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see or comment on the film, which you can only see half ... but I would recommend this film anyway because really breathtaking view that it gives us the guts East Coast studio time. This is the earliest film that I personally saw that this is based on the film industry. The protagonist of the movie star played by Robert Warwick, which was later supported a Hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all the films of Preston Sturges. He plays Western actor, perhaps vaguely modeled on William S. Hart, which Warwick really looks like several. After a really exciting sequence set in the studio we see them on the site of the shooting, where he discovers a village girl (Doris Kenyon) and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a screen test, which is very bad. After this point, the film seems to have no large pieces in the form we have now. <br /> <br /> Again, I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history of cinema for documentary value, but in the form we have it does not hold a lot like a movie and not a particularly good example of the work of Maurice Tourneur in .
