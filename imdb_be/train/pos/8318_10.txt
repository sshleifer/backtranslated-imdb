Great movie. Superb action of Mary Alice, Philip M. Thomas, and the young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role as satin. This film was one of the last largely "all black" movies 70s, in contrast to "black actors" films of the era, this film really was a plot, and it was very well done. Movie soundtrack performed by Aretha Franklin, has been popular in the R & B charts at the time.
