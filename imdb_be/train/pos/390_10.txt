The first thing I thought when I saw this movie was: It's actually not a film, at least, this is not what we think of spontaneously when we hear the word "film". it is quite symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. So, if you are not used to express things in a symbolic way, you find that surprising if you are not familiar with the philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think that this is just a fairy tale ... and even a strange one, is chaotic. For me, "The Legend of C" crystal clear. And I love it. He tells us in pictures the story of the struggle between light and darkness, a struggle that is as old as mankind, and anyone who is in search of Sanz faces with him in this life. The film is clearly made by Buddhists. I am not a Buddhist. My religion and vision of the world and the human is different. But as far as we are all human and have the same human nature, we are sure the overall experience and can understand each other. It really is a beautiful film! And I, that we were more films like this - movies that make sense. There are too many empty stories that are only good to spend time more quickly.
