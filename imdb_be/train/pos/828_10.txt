I noticed that the new HOPE and The Empire Strikes Back in the Top 10, but this one is not even in the top 100. <br /> <br /> This film has a bad reputation because of the Ewoks, but so many reasons to love this film? <br /> <br /> -The rescue Han Solo from Jabba: This is the official wraps Han Solo's debt to the south of the site, which was created when we first met the character in the New. HOPE <br /> <br /> -The Emperor finally revealed: Well, it may not work, and now that is a prequel, but it was the first time we have seen the emperor, as the children <br /> <br. /> - The Speeder Bike Chase: Okay, so it was a special effect time. But it is certainly one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the movies <br /> <br /> -The 3 Parts Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (headed by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Confronts Father and fall of the Emperor 3) the destruction of the second death Star (Moment Lando) <br /> <br /> -The Final Celebration with our heroes: Like I said, this film gets a lot of shit because Ewoks but I think it's cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire, our heroes with their own private party in the woods together. <br /> <br /> as a whole it was a great finale to the head of our heroes and suitable end of the story of Star Wars.
