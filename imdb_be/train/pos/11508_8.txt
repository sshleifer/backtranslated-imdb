I would give a higher rating to Kolchak, but the show quickly went from a scary / suspense, that's stupid. Malfunction of the FAA. They moved the show on Friday evening at 8:00 pm, then known as "family time." There should never have been, on Friday, in the first place. I was a sophomore in high school and loved the early episodes! It was the first against police woman on NBC. ABC had a huge problem on Friday night. Bad season for them as a whole, while Barney Miller, Baretta and SWAT Sun debuted in January 75. Kolchak was a hit. Darren McGavin asked to get out of his contract to the end of the show. It is a pity that the letter was not to Matheson's original telefilms. However, Kolchak McGavin made his own, as the actors can do. Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Carroll O'Connor as the Archie Bunker come to mind. It Ins set with a manual typewriter, and a clatter of teletype seems strange and ancient today, but it was part of the appeal. They were very lucky that Simon Oakland reprise «Vincenzo» of television films.
