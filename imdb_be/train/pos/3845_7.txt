Offbeat, develops slowly, entertaining erotic thriller with lots of graphics and "blasphemous" scenes that will surely violate some viewers. However, it will be difficult even for them to evaluate multiple creative sequences of the film contains, or to ignore the performance of first-class Crabb. Verhoeven supports the intriguing ambivalence throughout the film, playing with a sense of vision-a sign of character. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes, everything turns into a spot, and the unsatisfactory ending, of course, is not as good as the rest of the film. (***)
