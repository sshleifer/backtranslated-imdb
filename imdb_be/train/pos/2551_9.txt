It is almost unknown stone was based on a French farce - showing, and I mean that as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is currently courting wealthy Argentinian (Roland), who asks his father's hands. But Caroline was already married Anthony (Coleman), who had just arrived by plane and runs directly into the audience targeted memory of the last time Caroline decided she was in love with someone else: a dilettante-ish sculptor (Gardiner). The film is the story of Anthony playing strategy separation Caroline from her sculptor, and this experience helps him with her Argentinian <br /> <br /> He was perfectly cast :. Ronald Colman is at its most complex and magical, Reginald Gardiner is at its most sensitive, Gilbert Roland at its most exotic and Anna Lee just magically legible. The film wonderfully directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced); all production feels a labor of love. There are great touches, such as the violation of Coleman frame and addressing the camera and the exclusive use of the bar cabinet sliding doors. It is a sin that he has not been released on DVD - is a kind of film, which alone can create interest classic film.
