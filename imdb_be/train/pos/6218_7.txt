79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had nothing but great films did not do together. Despite the fact that this is not one of the best, it's great music. There are some great musical numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Two well-known performances, Grable and Lucille Ball commemorative make early appearances on the screen. Ball particularly well, and blonde, as well. "Let's look at the music and dance of the eyes" is one of the best numbers of the musical duo ever. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson "of Ozzie and Harriet" playing sister Ginger Roger. The main plot is quite familiar, but with a cast is exceptional, it works. Excellent direction and evaluation.
