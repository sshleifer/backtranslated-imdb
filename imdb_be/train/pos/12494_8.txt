Finally, an indie film that really delivers some great horror! I see most of the horror films coming out ... Theater, Straight-to-DVD, cable, etc. ... and most of them suck ... some of them even less watchable ... really good ... Dark Remains is one of the nicest. I caught a screening of the film at the South Padre Island festival, cinema ... the audience loved him ... and my wife and I loved it! Not having an actor's name, I believe that the budget for this film was quite low, but you do not know ... the movie looks fantastic ... acting completely works for the film ... a good story ... and scares great! While most of the filmmakers to focus exclusively on the panic, they often forget about the story and character development, two things that help to more effectively deliver the scares. Brian Avenet-Bradley needs to know that the nature and history are important. He develops as to the point where you care about the characters, you know the characters, and, thus, more scary when they are in danger. <br /> <br /> View of horror films that cost anywhere from $ 80 million to $ 5,000 to make, I think, «Dark Remains», to be one of the gems there. Check this movie out!
