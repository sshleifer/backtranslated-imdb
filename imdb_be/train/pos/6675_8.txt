The guide for this movie was fantastic for comedy. Many scenes seem out of comics and much darker (visually - not the story of the wise) than I expected. Of course, this may not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you are in a very crude sexist jokes, as it has very little that (compared to other like Something About Mary and American Pie). How do you rewatch it, a few jokes to stand out and get funnier. If you ever read a comic book or watching a comic book-type film (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and liked them, you will probably enjoy the subtle humor, which continues throughout the film. If you do not like them, you can, as a respectful mockery that this film for anyone. If you did like this movie, DVD-have some interesting extras. (8/10)
