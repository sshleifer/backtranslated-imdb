This is a film that gets better every time I see it. There are so many nuances in the performances. William Tracy, and Pepi, is a delight, resulting in a sharp comic. Joseph Schildkraut in Vada≈°, is the only "Willian" in the film, and his oily charm of a well used here. Frank Morgan, lovely as the owner of this store, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar image is well used here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressarta how Pirovich. Very true in every aspect of their role. <br /> <br /> The two wires are equally met with Margaret Sullivan does an excellent job drawing a little desperate, neurotic, but charming and attractive woman. <br /> <br /> This film belongs to Jimmy Stewart, though. The film is presented from his point of view, with the action revolving around it. Mr. Stewart is more to the problem of the film, with astonishing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart when he was dismissed from work because of misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so hurt the causes of events, so cool. In my estimation, James Stewart, without a doubt, the greatest actor in the history of the medium. There is no one that has ever been captured on film, which is able to so fully convey what he feels to the audience. At the time he made this film, he still had most of his career ahead of him, but he is fully master of his craft. This is one of the best films of Jimmy Stewart, as well as one of the sweetest, the most enjoyable romantic comedies you'll find. I highly recommend this movie, especially for those who appreciate the work of Stuart.
