Simple-minded, but good-natured drive in movie about simple enough, but good-natured high school graduate, has dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to use as your "point." <br /> <br /> Bobby, our hero, spends all his savings to buy a car of their dreams. Collaborative sharing and love makes a quick start with the girls to pick up Bobby's local pizzeria, but he finds a lot of responsibility, danger and pain came to be the owner of such a mechanical marvel. <br /> <br /> Van guilty pleasure of mine. It captures a relaxed mid-70s and the mood is quite unintentional humor to put it in the "so bad it's good" category.
