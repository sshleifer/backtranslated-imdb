this film is so complex that it can be given any description and continue to roll with it. you have a dangerous, exciting and restless protagonist (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud), which is captured between the two (not three) women. we listen to its social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in endless monologues, we see how he works his magic around the three women he loves. this may be a prerequisite for the bird movie, full of hard, cold, uninteresting comments. Eustache until the director manages to keep it fresh, ironic and witty. being such a long film, one can not help but burst into laughter when, after 2 hours talk politely, Jean-Pierre Léaud all suddenly screams over the phone while he remembers the cheese line from the film. such situations are purely cinematic and can not be fully restored in the comments. no one can restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue Françoise Lebrun until the end of the film. 3 and 1/2 hour, and every minute Worthing.
