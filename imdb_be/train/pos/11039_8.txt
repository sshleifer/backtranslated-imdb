Now this is what I would call a good horror. With occult / supernatural undertones, this is a good low-budget French film caught my attention from the very first scene. This proves that you do not need a lot of wild FX or gore to make an effective horror film. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the 4 inmates in prison, and each of these characters (and their motivations) gradually becomes more interesting as the film builds tension before the final. Most of the actions that we see eye Carrera, who had just entered the prison, and must get used to living with these three other prisoners. <br /> <br /> I will not talk a lot, because this movie really deserves to be more widely considered. There are a few drawbacks though: FX are not as good, but they are used effectively; the story leaves open some of the mysteries; and all becomes very confusing to the end, but Malefique redeems itself until it's over. <br /> <br /> I thought that it was a very good movie, 8/10
