My daughter, her friend and I watched it literally dozens of times. I bought it twice, and some little girl friends fled from him. Over time, I rented it so many times. He just never gets old !!! Blockbuster did not even have it in their lists anymore, and I tried to buy, find, rent it for more than 5 years. Without a doubt, this was my favorite childhood movie of my daughter ... it has it all! We laughed, we cried, we were discussing the real life and how hard it is for some children it is in the world. There was nothing pretend about this movie. We are associated with each of the second and each line, Bill! Thanks a million to restore our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. Canada, as well !!! :-) <br /> <br /> updated August '07: <br /> <br /> Who are we to judge when a rich woman falls in love with a poor man; or a person who has a love wants to raise a child who is not his own. This can not be my or your life. This is not only true, it happens every day. Thank God! Keeps my faith in human nature live !!! celebrate !!!!
