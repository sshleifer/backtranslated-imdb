Being a supporter of the art of Andy Goldsworthy while now, and have some of his books, I had expectations that I would like to see. What I got something quite satisfied, and quite a bit more than I expected. Being an artist (I work in clay), finding inspiration from our surroundings to make good art is a must, and this is what Andy Goldsworthy mastered. Behind him in the course of the year, the director captures the spontaneous energy, skill and dedication to the mix of artists with nature dratic inspiring atmosphere. Music is set in the film embracing and intoxicating. If you are an artist in need of inspiration, or anyone else in need of surging experience, and then to see this movie. For example, I am pleased to learn that Andy is out there. Create, dancing, fighting with the forces of nature, to make the world more beautiful.
