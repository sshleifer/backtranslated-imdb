A beautiful story about teenagers, executives, high school football "stars". How far would you go to protect your friends? Or to kill? How much can you lose if you pin on an innocent girl? Can love to beat the odds? Can you beat the small town of narrow-minded people? If your friend points and you "lose" you do everything in your power to make her pay for it, or you'll be a man about it and respect her right to choose? You rape her and show it as a victory over the "problem" girls? You can be the one who only sin is to have an opinion of their own, to be able to make their own decisions, to choose for themselves? It made me think twice before giving their opinion about who was right and who is wrong, but one thing is for sure - a very disturbing movie and the theme as a whole. Thumb up!
