I saw it for the first time at the festival of foreign film. This is a beautifully paced nail biting about a plot to unload the Estonian treasury of a billion or so of gold. All this is a shot in the rough, grainy style that rarely uses Hollywood --- but it captures the atmosphere again liberated the Baltic states is beautiful (note: Tallinn was actually looks far less bleak in 2003, when I was there). <, Br /> <br /> There's a lot of humor and some romance too. I do not want to spoil a number of strange yet logical surprises, so I'll just say that this is a robbery film starts with a great script and directing, and performing at the highest level. Darkness in Tallinn is simply the fastest and most annoying example of its genre --- I would put it against RAFIFI, Topkapi, and is miles ahead of the new OCEAN'S 11, although the (deliberately) not as glossy. RENT OR BUY NOW.
