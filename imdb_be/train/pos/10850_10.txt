What is a good movie! On the last picture revealing the unknown side of the rock: the illusion of glory. Well-known rockers grow old and forgotten, but not music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced to Rock Around the Clock by Bill Haley? <br /> <br /> Anyway, still crazy, perhaps the best film of the rock 'n' roll I've ever seen. Far better than Spinal Tap, for example. Why? Because Still Crazy, elderly people. They have a different point of view on the rocks, about love and life. They want to catch up with their mad youth, they release so much. In addition to the story, we see characters with their own personalities, weaknesses and dreams. Like any of us. <br /> <br /> a good time watching it (listen to an amazing soundtrack!) And, finally, think about your own future. <br /> <br /> Good-bye!
