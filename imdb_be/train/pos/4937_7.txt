This film actually appropriate even today, given the threat of bioterrorism and the threat superbugs, West Nile virus and SARS. As thriller, the voltage is sufficiently intense. Widmark and Paul Douglas more serviceable in their roles. Domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a good interlude to the main plot. Actor in this film, which is the most left his mark Jack Palance. Its well-defined features and seemingly calm appearance always wither way to reveal a mean and cruel man, beneath the surface. Chase scene through the meat-packing plant is impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.
