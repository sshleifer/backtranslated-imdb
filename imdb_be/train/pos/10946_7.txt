Do not listen to prudish critics who probably bitter gamers still suffers from roasting Silverman shamefully gave them on the Spike TV Video Game Awards a couple of months ago, "Sarah Silverman" surprisingly enough, surreal, immature, funny and will fit quite well in the Adult Swim composition . If Silverman tones down the juvenile "Doody" jokes and emphasizes dark undercurrent of the show angrier still only hinting at, we could have one of the biggest cult comedies since canceled "Strangers with Candy". But from watching the pilot, it's just hard, not outstanding, offbeat dark comedy / musical, but with a huge potential. <br /> <br /> Silverman has created a cheerful child, a woman of character - beautiful, younger, Jewish American Princess version of the late great Jerri Blank, and show the features of one of the most unique, non-stereotypical portrayal of gay couple I've ever seen on TV. Early reviews suggest, the next pair of episodes overtake the pilot, so I can not wait to see how the show unfolds.
