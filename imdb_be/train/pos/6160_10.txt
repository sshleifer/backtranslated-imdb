SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I just watched the extended version of the knob and a broom. Although I like the enhanced version, I want them to leave the original version on DVD. <br /> <br /> portabella road could be reduced to the original length. It was too long, and drag the movie together. While dancing great, it would be much better to leave on a DVD as a Deleted Scene. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great movie. My 5 year old loved it. It is very good that the movies that I enjoyed as a kid is now passed to a new generation. This Mary Poppins added to my collection. <br /> <br /> Just as I remembered! <br /> <br /> *** with **** <br /> <br />
