Spoilers -. As far as I describe the characters and their relationship to the story <br /> <br /> This is a quality film. The subject is both grim and seizure. Stubborn determination of the character Stephen Rea in Burak simply captivating. With any of apology to him, blame him, constantly resentful expression is good character. He is, as we say in England of the nature of the television series Inspector Taggart, is sure to be gloomy, because he sees three murders a week. Well, that's not quite true, as Chikatila works for a number of years ... <br /> <br /> You get a real sense blankwall resistance of the bureaucracy of the USSR, brilliantly portrayed Ekland (which often seems to be made for this kind of role). <br /> <br /> key character (and I write this as a remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers indicated on BBC1) is a character Donald Sutherland "Mikhail Fetisov." His quiet support Burakou is resistant. And who can endure through the restructuring and drives the FBI participated profiling. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> This is a must see, as far as I'm concerned.
