Excellent show. Instead of playing the same old type of sitcom shows where it's the same old thing, just different "stars", it refreshes the show gave an incredibly spectacular view of office environments. We were viewing any TV within 2 years, and after returning from all available shows, we look forward to watching this show on W. Shame on Global for pulling the plug on it. I thought that this one will be the winner. Let's be realistic about how several Canadian SHOW do it. Everyone I talk to loves the show, and I think it was silly Global, to leave. I believe that they want to stick it to the typical mind staggering show of states instead of pulling the Canadian with the show, there were a lot of promises. Do not get me wrong, I love a lot of shows on television, but come on people, let's keep variety. This unique show provided very comical kind of slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships, unique characters that you can not see on any comedies today or in the past. It is a pity that the global to say no so, stupid mistake.
