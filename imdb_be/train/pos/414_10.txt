DeMille knew how to create a classic, and after 7 years of his Western comes as the Real McCoy, exciting, interesting, exciting; by no means obsolete. <br /> <br /> As a true fan of the TV dead wood, I'll tell appearances Gary Cooper as Wild Bill Hickok and Jean Arthor as Calamity Jane is much more on target. <, Br /> <br /> We have no giants in Hollywood anymore. Plainsman is only one of dozens of classics from the decade 1936-1945, which saw the shifting of commercial life decade by decade: released, reproduced, republished again and again. Filmmakers like today Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer, the kids play in the sandbox. None of the contemporary films will not be sought in 7 months let alone 70 years.
