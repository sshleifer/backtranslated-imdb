If this film makes fun .. despite the feeling that I got a lot of time that this film was almost copying Monsters Inc. There are already quite a few things that are very similar between them, the relationship between animals / monsters, and a young child, other animals trying to break these relations, etc. It seemed that pretty much throughout the film, for me. <br /> <br /> One of the redeeming features, though, it's Scrat :) very very funny character, even if it serves no purpose :)
