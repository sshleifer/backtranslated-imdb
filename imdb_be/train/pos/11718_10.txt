Loving Elivra as I did in my late night movie hostess duties will love this movie - it's just cool - it great car, and it's a little Transylvanian Dolly Parton - she is so innocent and naive at times - and sexy all the time - plus, more than a touch of Mae West - <br /> <br /> many well done as well, and the comic cast large, Makklorg it is usually better - plus Sally Kellerman as Patty cheerful. Every time I have to chew on something for the topping, I will think about how Elvira crunching potato chips - <br /> <br /> This film is one to watch over and over again - just for fun. Now I have to get a sequel to it, Elvira's Haunted Hills, and see if it lives up to this one ----
