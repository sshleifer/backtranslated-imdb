Farewell Friend aka Adieu L'Ami / Honor Among Thieves is not perfect, but it is neat and exciting thriller that sees a mismatched demobilized French Algerian war veterans Alain Delon and Charles Bronson in a trap in the same basement storage, one to return stolen bonds, another to clean two million salary sit there over the Christmas weekend. Of course, things are not so simple, even after they open the vault, which leads to some neat twists. On the debit side, there is a very strange striptease scene in the parking lot, Bronson has a very annoying Fonzie-like catchphrase he uses in the most inopportune moments, Brigitte Fossey, sports, perhaps the most ugly error hairstyle from the 60s (it makes her look like a bald woman wig blown back from the top of her head in a strong wind), the responsibility ?? her "I'll cook the spaghetti! I'm going to learn to make good love! I will read Shakespeare! "These tantrums in all the wrong ways ?? and it's a shame about the terrible last line / shot, but otherwise it's a surprisingly interesting and unpretentious hotel that is worth checking out, if you can find a decent print. <br /> <br /> DVD film club in the UK offers the only English soundtrack, but since Delon voice themselves and other actors very well dubbed this is not a big problem, the more that the transfer of wide-quite good quality.
