Considering it was made on a low budget, the day ended up unable to make the most of your budget with some surprisingly good special effects work. <br /> <br /> The story involves a family who is going to move in them is given a sunny house in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in the south-west of California, only to find it trashed - Vandals on a motorcycle, they think. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) began to see mysterious things - green pyramid, strange humanoid figure, etc. And just recently, the light from the stellar explosion called Trinitarian very unusual glow to show up in the desert sky. Thus, the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, considers himself face to face with strange alien forces that put them in a time-space misalignment <br /> <br /> The mixing in elements of 2001 .: A Space Odyssey and Close Encounters of the third Kind, daily COMPOSITION, despite its obvious flaws and uneven actions are interesting due to the excellent special effects work of David Allen. Installing the desert is very suitable for close encounters of the film; and while the film can not be accurately compared to any Kubrick or Spielberg films, daylight ends much better than many other 2001 / Close Encounters knock-offs. I give credit director John Cardos «Bud», whose 1977 thriller spiders Kingdom made for an interesting arachnophobia predecessor, at least try to - and, on this basis, I give the day-ending 7 out of 10.
