I liked the film, primarily because she told an interesting story, but the story as it is told in the film felt like it condenses with such a long history. Since the book is over 400 pages, it makes sense. It covers the period from 1920 to 1970, in a fictional South American countries, as well as a lot to fit into the time available. I think it would be much better, as the six-hour mini-series than it turned out as a 140-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it is rushed, the story does not pass so much that it becomes confusing. What is said is said quite good. One mistake that Clara supernatural forces are inconsistent; or they must have appeared more evenly over the course of the film, or they had to be omitted. Two more errors (which may be spoilers): Esteban possible return to the good is some very suddenly, and the curse of the ferrule, it seems to wear off, even though tons of the story suggests that it should last forever <br /> <br />. It works perfectly. Glenn Close as a virgin tormented ferrule is excellent. Jeremy Irons as a brutal self-made rich, too good. Meryl Streep, as the protagonist Clara, great though it is often even better than it was in the movie. There were a lot of well executed small role too. The biggest mistake is that the film did not seem to have enough dialect coach; every actor seemed to speak in a different kind of focus.
