Riding Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary traces the history of surfing and is worth three well made and acclaimed surfer movies, Dana Brown, Endless Summer, its sequel Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, son Dana, and step into a liquid (IMAX ). I saw the first, but not the other. <br /> <br /> While surfing footage spectacular, I appreciated most of all historical perspective of the film-maker. He takes us back to the origins of this sport for almost a hundred years ago, and shows how it has evolved into its current form. This includes extensive interviews with leading individuals and artists such as surfboard designs have changed over time, that the beaches in Hawaii and California were the most visited world-class surfers, and that incredible adrenaline rush sport provided them. Athletes lived for a few months at a time on the beaches, moving from dawn to dusk, camped at the rudimentary bunk, fished for food, and returned to their boards on the next day. That euphoric way to spend the days of youth. <br /> <br /> We see how the media discovered and contributed to the sport after a slow start. What was the biggest boost for the sport? Believe it or not, it was the film Gidget, although I suspect that copyright issues can prevent Beachboys lending 'songs like surfing and surfing Surfer Girl USA. Surfing Magazine and Surfing Encyclopedia (who knew what folio) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see comments from the sport pioneers, members of their families, as well as the current generation of benefits from its origins in the 1960s. One of these stories, like 40-year-old Laird Hamilton, who are now considered the greatest surfer associated with the previously leading surfer, introduced him to a single mother, whom he married before becoming his step dad. <br /> <br /> incendiary musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story. I fanned the appetite? Excellent. Have a great trip.
