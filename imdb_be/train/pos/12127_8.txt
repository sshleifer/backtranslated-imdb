The history of a few stilted that a sudden reversal of fortune of the protagonist, but Leslie Howard and Bette Davis images Philip Carey, naive obsessive lover and Mildred Rogers, an unworthy object of his love, to raise this film is much higher than the standard melodrama. <br /> <br /> The sensitive, cultured Philip, who for most of the paintings in bondage his first passion, and then his pity for Mildred does not differ from the character Howard had to play a few years later - Ashley Wilkes, southern gentleman too refined and honest, to make it in the rough reconstruction era. Philip really seems resigned to the disappointment before Mildred enters the picture ?? he did not even particularly surprised when his art teacher told him that he would never make it as an artist. Perhaps this passivity, these lowered expectations, making it tolerate selfish Cockney waitress until he does. <br /> <br /> While Leslie Howard memorable, today, "Of Human Bondage" is mainly thought as a picture of Bette Davis, perhaps because of the well-known story about how she had to fight Jack Warner, to get some of Mildred and perhaps, too, because the audience in the cinema, as a rule, prefer symbols of its kind brash energy. Mildred could have slatted voice, but it also has the unearthly beauty of stained glass angel, which makes it a little bit understandable why Philip allowed himself to be strung along for so long as he did. Although the man is Mildred can sometimes seem like a one-dimensional, it does elicit sympathy from the audience from time to time, like when she gets sick and belatedly realizes that Philip is the only decent person who ever cared about her. You can also think that it is on to something when she accuses Philip look down at her for not "fine" enough. (The scene in which Philip and Norah reject romance magazines like garbage for kitchen maids, seems to confirm this). <br /> <br /> Most of the secondary characters are also effective, especially Norah clever novel writer who loves Philip, but she knows she will never be able to compete with Mildred and Sally, whose beauty and decency Mildred Nora and acts as a worthy woman Philip rewarded in the end. The only character I found was an eccentric hollow, sipping ale aristocratic father of Sally, who appears as the stock character of an earlier era. <br /> <br /> A classic that deserves its reputation.
