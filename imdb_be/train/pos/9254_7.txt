NO film with Dennis Hopper, Busey, Eleniak, Tom Berenger, Stockwell, Merrill Henner deserves a rating of 5 here. This is a bad version of women in films such as 16 blocks north or timeless perspective, in addition to the prisoner transported is very easy on the eyes Ms.Eleniak. Meanwhile Berenger plays another rough Maverick type well military and William McNamara played his rookie is going to be discharged foil well. The plot at first glance absurd, because I lost track of time Eleniak should have and could have been avoided, but it is an entertaining film and well-being are good cameos of all these actors that keep the film rolling. This is not really a family film, because there are some bad words and rarely Eleniak nude scene, but it is much better than some of the other guff, released at this time.
