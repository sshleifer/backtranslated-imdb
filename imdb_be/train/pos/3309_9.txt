This is a great movie. If this is any indication than Hong Sang Su indeed "the best kept secret of Asian cinema." It is very similar in style to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and covers much the same ground as their subjective, but I think I actually like it more as a whole than any one of his films. Outdoor minimalism slightly less pronounced than in his work, though it still fits this style (the camera never moves even once), and somehow I found the film less shamefaced "slow" than Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Xiao -hsien, which I think is one of the reasons I liked it more. In addition, he does not hold it exactly as separate items, as does Hou. I felt that the film was also somehow more "full" and less open structure (slightly) than some of their work, although this is not to say that it was a little reminiscent of the outgoing forward the plot. I would not believe that Sofia Coppola was not directly influenced by this film for "Lost in Translation" (scene of a young woman traveling alone, and suffers in her hotel room wearing punk panties can not help but seem familiar).
