As converts to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to soak up as much as I can in the history of my new religion. I was invited to a screening of this film with my sons and other young men and women and their families of our parish. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring evening, we went to Kirtland, Ohio, the historic village church located there. We had reservations at the Vistor Center to view this movie. Since my viewing of the film was limited to only a few church documentaries, I was intrigued. The only "full-length movies" out of the church I saw were the "Heritage" and "My best two years", and that I thought were very well written and in advance. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the missionary interpreter felled fabric, which state that a few people were deeply moved to tears by this film. I thought, "Okay ... but it takes a lot to move me to tears," Imagine my surprise when I found that the weeping.! It's really very touching and inspiring testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> Look and believe in this powerful message!
