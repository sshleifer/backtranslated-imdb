«Kalifornia» is one of my favorite movies, and it could easily be called one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90s. The film has a very stylish surface to it, but for a lot of anxiety and honest image of death maniacs and terrifyng violence they inflict on others. One film`s strengths is it`s performances, Brad Pitt has a surprisingly large, psycho garbage trailer called Early. Pete potrays his terrible character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis is equally as good at playing his naive girlfriend, her innocence almost heartbreaking. «Kalifornia» has a very simple story to it, which is continuously and slowly forward for about an hour, but suddenly immersed in a harrowing murder spree, and Pete unleashes his psychotic person. There are many shocking scenes, and all that is attached to the extent of menopause home that will haunt you for days. «Kalifonia» is a film that should be really watched it `s intense look at how horrible a human being can be, not only ono` s violence and blood.
