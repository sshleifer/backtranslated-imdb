I do not care how many bad reviews purple rain gets this movie rocks! Great movie, has it all, great music (Prince gross!), Romance and Drama. <br /> <br /> It's really very sad film, very moving. I do not want to say much more, I, m not giving away the plot, but I will say this, the film is very realistic, there are so many romantic relationships that pass through these problems, so many Familys similar to the one depicted in the film. I see it as very realistic and to be so real, makes the film that much more moving. My generation loves this film grows, so many of us loved the prince, and there are many to refer to any young person who has been through similar issues. <br /> <br /> However, it is definitely not just a movie for teenagers, Id recommend it to all age groups. And that's not all so dark, the film has a lot of music, performance, stage band, funny and sexy scene between the prince and Appelonia.
