Compelling, honest, brave, and unforgettable psychological horror film that touches on the painful experience of pain caused by rape - "Descent" is a movie that came out from under the radar due to the lack of distribution, because, frankly, the film is so rigid in their figures that if he were released theatrically, he may have met myself in some strong partisan hatred. <br /> <br /> the movie deserves to be discovered for not only its darker themes, not only for his amazing destinations and authentic style - but most of all for his performances. Chad Faust absolutely incredible, causing enough of illness and enough vulnerability to make one, it is not related, but to understand the broken man with a twisted view on his sexuality to not only women, rapes, but also gentle insecurity deep inside himself, This The upholds a performance that is so complex, bold and emotional part of Faust. And it is hard to forget. <br /> <br /> However, the standout is Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is absolutely open. Tour-de-force of realistic drama ticks, and one of the most subtle, but loud as can be performances in a while. While Dawson observed in some good performances in support to some of the big bad movie, she proves that she's here is what it takes to deliver some broad and emotionally moving performance, believable and thematically. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of its year (and in 2007 was strong) - it was undervalued and intelligent film got a theatrical release, I would shout praises for it, and Dawson and Faust. It is a pity that it was too blunt for a wide circulation. Films like this deserves better!
