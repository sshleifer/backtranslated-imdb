The only part lacking in this film is part of Shue as the daughter wants to follow in his "aunt" steps as daytime soap stars. Otherwise it would be perfect 10. <br /> <br /> It seems that every actor enjoyed their part and replays to fulfill his own pleasure as well as a script - I have to wonder if a little ad lib ' ing WASN »m occurs in parts. He was well matched, and there are some classic lines that will stick with you. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic film, everyone must see at least once. I would recommend anything that would sting goes nose to drink. <br /> <br /> You'll definitely want to follow closely the last scene, "Nurse Nan» has a little secret, she would not have shared with you. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the daytime soap or despise them, it makes fun of the movement in all the right places.
