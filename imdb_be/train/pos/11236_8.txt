For the record, I am not associated with production anyway. <br /> <br /> The Hidden Frontier, probably Star Trek watching films with the highest number of episodes produced to date. During 7 seasons (this last one), they produced about 50 or so episodes. <br /> <br /> This is no mean feat virtually no budget, and all volunteer their time and energy. <br /> <br /> by their own admission, the earlier seasons are not as good production qualities, as the later, but as they progress effects, green screen work and function better. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult, "swimming in the" so-started from the beginning and watched all the way through. High-benefits of story arcs as well as all the best Sci Fi and adjusted well in the Star Trek universe, in which it is installed. Symbols and "relatives" from the original series were shown in many stories and add a sense of history, sometimes improving the character of the original. <br /> <br /> Total experience includes excellent network site, blooper reels, high friendship forum, which was visited by many of the actors and production staff, and weekly chat. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for high-definition, high-budget production, it is probably not for you. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a continuation of adventures in the Star Trek universe with stories that make Star Trek loan and makes you think that this is one.
