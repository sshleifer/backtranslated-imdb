If you have not seen this movie, Mary-Kate and Ashley, all I can say is: "What are you waiting for." This is another stunning and beautiful film fraternal twins, who we all know and love so much! This is a fun, romantic, exciting, and absolutely spectacular (scenery-wise)! of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main decoration here anyway! Will there be any true fan wants to be different? Of course not! Anyway; this is a great movie in the full sense of the word, so if you have not seen it, then you simply must now, I mean now, too! So what are you waiting for? I promise that you will not be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
