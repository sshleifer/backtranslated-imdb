I just finished watching the first drive in the collection of 4-disc (26 episodes), set up jointly with the UCLA Film & Television Archive (S'more Entertainment, Inc.). Until now (except for the 1st episode), the image quality is quite good. DVD box is displayed on the front page here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> «Mister Peepers» as charming as the first time I saw him (5 years old at the time) and Wally Cox really wins in this role. If you are in the mood for a quiet comedy that sneaks up on you, as opposed to the blow to the head, you'll appreciate the chance to experience all the interesting characters that you might remember from childhood. While some of the gags a bit banal, most creative and well-executed ... and even banal ones fun. This is one series that lives up to my early childhood memories of him.
