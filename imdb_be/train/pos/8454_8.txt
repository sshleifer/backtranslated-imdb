A second alternate universe story of Gandhi (G-Gandhi being the first), Gandhi wing yet another look into Gundam poem. Familiar elements are found, but Gundam Wing is actually different then his colleagues. Which is the biggest Gundams is nothing more than terrorists fight a single organization. In fact, the series really will not show on the war to the episode 7, but in truth the real conflict, on the eve of the war, not happen until later episodes. <br /> <br /> The biggest positives of this series is the characters. All the main characters fleshed out within 49 runs of episodes, and you can really sympathize with each role they put in. Another big plus fantastic character and mechanical design series. Design to put some of his other Gundam colleagues to shame. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest criticisms of this series as many die hard fans UC claim, rip off the original UC saga. Why Gundam Wing gets the rap, when more and more obvious clone UC Gundam Seed is there for me. However, there is a lot of points, but they said, raised in a new way, and there are various differences. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, customary comparison Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs a pariah in the Alliance and how to OZ, and, while the comet was bright red Zeon symbol. Another big difference is that, Zechs loses a lot of the soldiers under his command, hence the nickname he gave the other at the beginning of the episode: ". The murderer of his people," The cup is given this label. <br /> <br /> The problems with this series is not a philosophy, but a fetish two problems. First, re-animation frames Gundams attacks. Of course, it is a pleasure to see the heavy weapons to attack tanks, MS, and planes for the first time. But this is the fourth re-use of the stage, as do age. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the whole series should take place throughout the year. If you really think about all the events appear in the series, a lot happens in just one solitary year. <br /> <br /> But I think you can easily dismiss this fact, ignoring the first line in the intro every so often. As the ranks, this is probably the best of the tales alternate universe Gundam and a great introduction to the world of Gundam. In the end, it was the first Gundam anime air television in the United States.
