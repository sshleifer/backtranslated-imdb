I've never heard about this film, despite the relationship with George Clooney (whose company has made and it appears in a very funny bit support) and 11 director Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's it. To make matters worse, we have chosen is in the discount bin for $ 4.99 (Canadian dollars for it!) What a great and pleasant surprise. But I am of the opinion that if William H. Macy in it you can not be disappointed. This is very reminiscent of the Ealing comedy from England in the 1950s. Well, with a lot of profanity. It's eccentric, and sometimes gut hilarious film. Currently Robbery made me laugh so hard I cry. Perhaps the most amusing use of the pants in the history of cinema. Maybe it's low expectations, I go in but I saw a group of people, and we had a blast. Best $ 5 I've spent in ages.
