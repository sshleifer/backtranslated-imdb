After «Beau suffering", everyone was waiting for Claire Denis to take the next masterpiece that never comes. Now he has. Denis makes a quantum leap in this film, an orgy of beautiful cinematography, editing and elliptic willfully vague narrative of events that feels strange, and applies even stranger. There's also a nominal portion (based in part from the book by Jean-Luc Nancy, of the same name) on the continuing human in need of a heart transplant and looking Tahitian son, whom he had long been abandoned; but basically it is the idea of ​​an invasion of personal exploration and cultural. It takes only a few reads to fully understand the problem and walk close to the end, but it is still more advanced and exciting than anything else I've seen this year. Miss it at your own risk.
