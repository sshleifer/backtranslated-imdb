Stardust is a beautiful story written by Neil Gaiman (author of the Mirror), and it really is a good story. I think that it would apply to any of the Labyrinth, The Princess Bride or The Tenth Kingdom fan and yet it is quite unique and stands on its own. And I feel that the film version of this story is much better than the end of what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I will not spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), the son of mortal and magical servant holding a witch in the kingdom of fairies. The story begins in a city near the wall that separates the magical world of the human world. If there is a falling star Tristan promises to return it to the girl, which he captured. He does not know that the star took the form of a girl in the fairy world, and that there are others after her, too. Three old witches who want to use her heart to become young again, and some bickering princes. <br /> <br /> This is a really good story. He has a sense of humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visual effects. It's magic, and I feel that it is possible to observe the children and adults of all ages. It's just magical. This is a real classic tale the likes of which I have not seen a movie since 1980.
