Saving Grace a good movie to view a sad day when you are looking for something different than the usual scripts and want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​the film and all the marijuana it is madness! It was the first movie that I saw with this topic (drugs / marijuana), which is actually not criticizing him, just kidding about that. Grace Trevethyn widow, who lives in a small town in the UK and has a lot of financial problems due to her late husband, who committed suicide because he was full of debts. The problem lies in the fact that Grace, who imagined have the money saved up for it, know that it has to pay for all of her husband pounds in debt, so as not to lose all their belongings, especially her house that she loves so much. It never worked, and in a tragic situation as Matthew, her gardener, who really found a pot smoking, decides to cooperate with it in the sale of marijuana on a large scale.
