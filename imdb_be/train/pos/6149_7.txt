I just bought a restored version of the film that I remember with great affection since childhood, and it certainly did for fun curious afternoon. Bedknobs definitely makes sense in its entirety, deleted scenes (especially McDowell) link together the event fairly accurately. That is a bit confusing the way the scenes were remastered. Obviously, the soundtrack for these frames has been lost or damaged, so some bright spark at Disney decided to re-record the scene with a new dialogue. That would be great, except that half the cast was not around to do it (some better than others reasons) and it all has a pretty poor quality to it. Some lip-sync is quite poor, and the voice of David Tomlinson was duplicated on a guy who does not sound absolutely nothing like David Tomlinson (there is actually an allusion to the German language, I think). However, it is nice to hear the full versions of all the songs (although the "step in the right direction" is still missing) and moments of magic in this film still shine. And I urge you not to giggle when young Paul looks so innocent Angela Lansbury and cooing, "but what it has to do with my pen ??"
