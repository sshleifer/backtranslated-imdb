Charming romantic comedy. The plot is a bit too complicated - I have tried to summarize it three times, and I can not. Suffice it to say that it's worth a look. funny, beautiful film - the plot is completely unrealistic, but it works. Everything in the film is so beautiful and everything looks so cool - it creates a sweet, romantic feeling throughout the film. <br /> <br /> great action - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd in the best shape and enjoy every second. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson just okay, but okay. If you are a lover of good, sweet sentimental films (like me), catch this. Downey also looks great in underwear <br /> <br /> Additional bonuses - the name of the song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song «After All» by Cher and Peter Cetera.
