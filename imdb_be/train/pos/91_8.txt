Actually, it was a good movie with a perfect ending; the action was spectacular and characters entirely deviate from these persons. I particularly liked the story, but you knew that was going to happen, that there is still an element of surprise gave way out of the film. Nevertheless, I believe that we have to conclude it might be a little more (possibly extended) - I thought that it was taken a little bit; as if the author is trying to take linens outside the lines before the rain fell. For instance- What happened with his brother Tristan, Hayden? We all know that he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one that the installation of the whole thing? Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? Maybe? If there .. I can not wait to see it.
