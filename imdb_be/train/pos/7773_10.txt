An incredible movie! I put on DVD recently and was killed this beautiful piece of work. Sirko was a genius of the movie, and he gets a performance with Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert the Stack (Oscar nominated), and Lauren Bacall, which means not describe. Paul Verhoeven brilliantly paid tribute to this film, with Dorothy Malone play which kills inspire guru Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct her. What a big joke! <br /> <br /> By turns funny movie, riveting, campy, bites, poor, compelling, and eye rolling! It's definitely Grandaddy each tasteless big and-small screen soap opera, but none of them had a dazzling style, as you'll see here: the camera work is smooth and polished, the use of color is breathtaking, the opening montage set to the name of the song goes memorable, one-dimensional characters are unforgettable and the final image will have you scratching your head about how censors then let it do the final version! <br /> <br /> while the majority of the elderly, highly regarded films can sometimes be boring to sit sick, wind Written contains so much and is so fast that it really is a shame when it ends. Thank you, Mr. Sirk for crafting and Todd Haynes to draw attention to-what has now become one of my favorite movies of all time! See this movie !!!
