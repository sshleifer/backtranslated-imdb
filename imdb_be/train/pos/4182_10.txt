I saw this Australian film about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it. The film shows the horror of war in such a way that Hollywood usually silent. The relationship between the soldiers of two warring countries highlighted the differences in culture and in the end, knowing that in the end we do not really differ from the internal. If you can find any type of copies of this - to buy or rent it. You will not be disappointed, just in awe.
