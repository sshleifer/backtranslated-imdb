I saw a special preview of it today. I must tell you, I'm not a big fan or Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I do not really have any expectations that go with that. In the end, I enjoy it quite a bit. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life story of a widower with 3 daughters, who goes to spend the weekend with his family. While in the store, he meets the woman of his dreams, only to find out that it happens to a friend of his brother. <br /> <br /> This film is very well made- soundtrack, cinematography, and acting all top-notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem with it was mostly what appeared to be a lack of character development, mainly to the nature of Dane Cook in. We never get a closer look at the relationship between Dane and Steve characters, and I felt that it might help a little bit to show that the internal conflict De about being in love with a Danish friend was. In addition, though, Dan in Real Life certainly solid, sweet film defined a nice break from all the horror and action films we received this year.
