If you are T-Rex / Marc Bolan fan, I recommend you check it out. This shows the bizarre side of Marc Bolan and Ringo Starr, apparently, having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that are not part of the concert, but it is interesting to see, leaving you with a sense of recognizing them are just people, and when a talented concert shows musician as playful and professionally, that the rocks and seems to impress the girls scream. Watching him in a concert, you never know what being a rock star, it's work, but just having a great time playing some great songs with good friends like Elton John and Ringo Starr, resulting in some of the live performances. However, there are a few songs that were not enough, I would like to see there, but, like every album he can not have everything. I just bought it in 2006, but if I have to know, it came out in 1972, I would have definitely bought it years ago. It is sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars, would never learn to drive and would have died in a car accident!
