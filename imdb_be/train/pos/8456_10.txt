I watched almost all the anime Gundam / fur, which was shown in the United States, and it certainly has a better story. The way it twists already rivets. Gundam Wing is the series, which is mainly focused on politics and war. The series follows a group of five 15-year-old boys who were trained to pilot advanced mobile suits known as Gundams. Gundam pilots were trained to fight a powerful insurgency, known as Oz. As things begin to heat up between WHO and the Gundam pilots, new political groups will be formed and old will be scattered. Old conflicts will end and will be new. In order to achieve peace Gundam pilots must come to grips with the events that are happening in their world and to put an end to all hostilities. But how far people are willing to go to get their goals. I recommend this anime for those looking for a show that has a deep plot.
