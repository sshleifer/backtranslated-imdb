It was such a pleasure when this show, because it was so fresh, innovative and original shows. This makes all the show I've ever watched a boring plain sight. At that time, the first episode aired, I was fascinated, and I became attached to all of the characters so easily (which usually does not happen, because I have always hated a few characters). It is a pity that this show will not be a third season, because he has to be one of the best shows I've ever seen, and what is not exaggerating her feelings for the show at all. Nothing can replace Pushing Daisies, because ABC can possibly find to replace this show? This is easily the best show on television. <br /> <br /> I came to Kristin Chenoweth and I stayed, because I fell in love with the whole show.
