Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. The magnificent ensemble cast, tight installation and excellent direction. Caper film that does not get caught up in the standard tricks. <br /> <br /> Not much can be said about this film without spoiling it. The tag line says it all - 5 guys. 1 Safe. No brains. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Sam Rockwell are in an amazing cast. George Clooney to be congratulated for producing this gem. <br /> <br />
