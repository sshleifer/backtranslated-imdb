In 1983, director Brian De Palma set to make a film about the rise and fall of the American gangster and that he did-- with the help of a great script by Oliver Stone and some outstanding work perfectly cast. The result was `Scarface» Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles. The story begins in May 1980, when Castro opened the port of Mariel in Cuba to Cuban citizens to join their families in the United States. 125000 left Cuba at the time, for better freedom in America, and most of them are honest, hardworking people, grateful for the opportunity they were given. But not all. Among `Marielitos', which flowed into the state of Florida, about 25 thousand had been convicted and were no less than waste jails-- Cuba considered criminals beyond redemption, who just wanted to get rid of Castro. And they, too, have seen America as the land of opportunities, as well as the Al Capone of Chicago examined about fifty years ago. And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana (Al Pacino), known to his friends as a `Caracortada. . Scarface <br /> <br /> Now that he was free from the yoke of communism, under which he grew up, like Montana, he felt, would come to him, and he wanted right now; and from the moment he stepped off the boat in Florida, he was determined to have it all. Wealth and power--, that was the dream of Montana, and he would get it, doing what he did best, since the benefit of the person who lives in Miami named Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). Lopez seems to have had a brother in Cuba, who met an untimely death at the hands of one of the thugs Castro, the man who, having survived its usefulness Castro, was unceremoniously dropped and is currently held in the `Little Havana, 'along with Montana and all Cubans very close to the boat, where they were waiting for their documents from the government that would implement their transition into a new life. And in the short term, Montana traced to a brother Lopez was avenged, and it paves the way for their own entry into the underworld of America. <br /> <br /> Lopez, a wealthy businessman with the right connections, in return for the benefit of Montana and gets his friend Manny (Steven Bauer), released from the holding camp, and put them to work. At one time, Capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to align its boxes with profit, but Lopez is the modern equivalent of the day, and it is even more profitable: Cocaine. Lopez takes Montana under his wing and taught him in life, but as soon as he has a taste of it, Montana is not satisfied that the baby Lopez sees fit to throw his way, and he sets the course, which will take him to where he wants to be: on the `top. With seasoned, iron will, Montana decides that he will not do whatever it takes to get there, no matter what the price. but before he could finish, he will understand the price for my dream, and it will pay; but a short time, perhaps, he will know that this is going to be a man. And he will also know whether it is really worth it. <br /> <br /> In step with the vision of De Palma, Pacino plays Montana larger than life, and he does it beautifully. With emphasis he influences (which he researched thoroughly to make sure that he got it right-- and he did), body language and attitude, he has it all, and it makes Montana convincing and very real. What he brings to the role of nuance and style, so that a few actors (De Niro would be one) can. This is certainly not a symbol, which is sympathetic in any way, and there is nothing about Montana is that you can easily relate to on a personal level; but the presence of Pacino's screen is so strong that makes it quite a fascinating character, despite the fact that it is difficult to become emotionally attached to them. It is quite simply a dynamic, memorable performance. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer gives good results, but also in the role that set her on the path to glory. As Elvira, the woman who has become an integral part of the dream of Montana, Pfeiffer is subtle and understated, giving the feeling that something is happening at the bottom, while the effect on cold and distant outer face. She, like Pacino certainly makes its presence felt as it glides across the screen quite a stoic, mysterious and passionate behavior. <br /> <br /> supporting cast includes Mastrantonio ~ d (Gina), Miriam Colon (Mama Montana), F. Murray Abraham (Omar) Chenard (Sos) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein). Great precursor to more recent and very famous 'movement' and 'Strike', and also having a climactic scene that resembles Peckinpah in` The Wild Bunch, «De Palma's" Scarface "was originally made by critics, it has since been cited by many as the ultimate American gangster saga. Most of the violence is implied rather than graphics, but this film still has the advantage of realism to this that many people can find a few anxious. But if you stay with it, there is a lesson to be learned in the end. And how many lessons in life, the most valuable, is often the most difficult to accept at the time. But the reward is always worth it, and that the way it is in this film. I rate this one 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
