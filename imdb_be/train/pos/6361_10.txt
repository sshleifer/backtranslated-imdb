I'm looking forward to the opening of the film in a few months. Being a big fan of Jim Carrey, I easily saw how he could transform himself into a Seuss Grinch and make the character his own. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This film was pure magic. Curry is a master of his craft, and no one could play this role to perfection, as he did. There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children, and this film is sure to become a timeless classic for everyone to enjoy in the coming years. I already have a vision of my little daughter, sitting down year after year to see this remake of the video, and I will definitely be watching it and laughing, as I did the first time I saw him. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is Jim Carrey movie written all over it, and I do not believe that he would have come together without him. However, the supporting cast was charming and interesting in its own right, in the first place simply magical Taylor Momsen, who was the perfect backdrop for the antics of Curry. Set design, music and costumes all lent their hands in the magical, fairy-tale finished product, and I believe that all participation can be proud of. <br /> <br /> This is not an easy feat to convert 22 minutes of animated classics in full length live action film, but Howard was able to honor. For those critics who do not agree, maybe it's your heart that are 2 sizes too small.
