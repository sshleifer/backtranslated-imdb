I would almost give it a 10 out of 10. However, there are some confusing parts, and sections that are reversed leading touches the flow / continuity of the film. The storyline is a large and well-built; you definitely want to look at it quietly, to fully understand it. The characters are complex and, therefore, storyline, expect to be given just enough information to stop scratching your head, this is a movie where everything is explained in the end. Animation and great mix of rock by rock and film noir in a big movie, which is unlike anything I've ever seen in animation. This black and white film, and his soft dark in a few scenes, so it's worth it to look good or plasma T.V. Voices of the characters do to keep this film in its English version, but it would be more convincing if there were some French accents to emphasize that it takes place in Paris, I liked, in French with English subtitles. One whole it should be to buy on DVD or BlueRay, if any! And personally, if you liked the movie, you might as well; Waking Life & Ghost in the Shell 2 Innocence, it's just a personal suggestion.
