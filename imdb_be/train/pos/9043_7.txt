I just stumbled on this movie on TV one day. He was featured in the middle of the day on the channel is not quite known for airing good movies. This one, however, was nothing less than good. <br /> <br /> October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy, inspired by the launch of Sputnick become a scientist. He and his friends begin to build a rocket. His father is not pleased with his sons found a new hobby, and would prefer to see him become a miner, as he himself or to go to college on a football scholarship, like his brother. <br /> <br /> The story is well written, A little too predictable, it may be, but that's okay because it's not too much attention to those parts of the story. This is an important part, but where it is obvious that the internal action, the action between the characters is focused on. History is good. It has some cliché, but that's okay. It is based on a true story, so you kind of can not just drop these clichés. Characters very well. Where history downhill characters are removed and unable to maintain the effect and quality of the film high. You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. They are well written and believable. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch. Sets and 50s style is thorough and well-drawn pictures and a well-lit All of this sets the mood of the film very well. <br /> <br /> To act very well. Jake Zhillenhol provides great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is good, John Hickam. As for the other actors, they are also good. All together it makes a pretty strong cast. <br /> <br /> In general, I'm glad I caught this film. It was the first after seeing it, I learned that it was based on real events. If I knew that, when he saw him, he would probably just be even more interesting. October Sky a good and interesting film. This film, I believe that everyone can enjoy. It is a kind of well-being of the film. Not bad at all!
