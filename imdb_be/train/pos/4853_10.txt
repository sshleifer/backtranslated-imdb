I have something for old black and white films of this kind, the film testament Hay and Abbott and Costello, especially those that are my favorite. I chose this film on DVD, it uses the same idea, as will David Haye "On Mr. Porter," which is one of the best comedies ever made. I just finished watching this film in less than ten minutes ago (the film is over at 12:45 am). I believe that this kind of movie to make ghost trains, etc., are best viewed at night with the lights off. So you get into the story more and night view works well with this movie. <br /> <br /> jokes in the film may seem a bit from some viewers, I think it depends on the viewer. They are not of me, though. I'm 28 and even if I'm not old enough to be around when the movie was first released (my father was, though). I still have a lot of opinions for some of the older kind of films. I am sitting in the room watching television with snacks and drinks and legs back and rest at night while watching these films, few things can beat the feeling you get by doing this. These escapes from reality for a while. <br /> <br /> I have noticed that one of the men in the film (he has a black mustache), he appears for about three-quarters of the way through the movie after his car accident, and he was looking for the woman he followed to the station. This man was in Will Hay classic "The Phantom of Easton" as well. Just I thought I'd show you that in case no one noticed :). <br /> <br /> plurality of pieces in the film is very atmospheric. Outside the abandoned station looks good, and as though not a soul for miles in either direction, and inside the station is very comfortable looking up from the torrential rain that outside. I felt that I would have loved to have been there in the film with a cast. The atmosphere in this film is that it is not a lot of movies nowadays. It keeps you hooked from the moment the film begins until its completion. <br /> <br /> We need more of this type of film in today's market. But, unfortunately, it may be more looked at the benefit of movies with nudity and swearing and rude humor. This kind of film-making era (The Ghost Train, Oh, Mr. Porter, etc.) for me it is the golden age of cinema!.
