Really sweet movie that has some similarities with the 2001 hit «My Sassy Girl», but is able to charm the most of the time. The biggest applause must go to the two leads. Ha-Neul Kim sweet and nimble, Sang-Woo Kwon attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between them is very good. <br /> <br /> Director Kyeong-Hyun Kim uses some CG-paste pepper to visual as well as offering spectacular battle scenes in which Sang-Woo Kwon can shine. I liked it much better than here, in the very overpriced "Volcano High". And this boy has a future - these views, these methods of combat, and romantic lead. . Not bad <br /> <br /> Well, I can make it short: Good movie. My rating: 7/10
