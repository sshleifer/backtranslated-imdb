First of all, I would like to say that I am a big fan of Sarah Silverman, and who have other people say and then rag on my pilot. Everything in the pilot was in typical form, Sarah Silverman, maybe just not funny, but the situation and the delivery that counts. <br /> <br /> If you liked Magic Jesus, I do not see how you Wouldn Â»t like it. It has the same stream and the same rhythm. However, this is only for real fans, but if you do you will be happy. <br /> <br /> Again, only true fans, there is no way around it. If you are not accustomed to its style, you do not get why it's funny. Nevertheless, it is, and I hope you think so too.
