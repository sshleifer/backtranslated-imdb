My personal opinion is that this film had no real storyline vampire first by John Carpenter, but I still I liked it. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this movie. He's really mad me believe that he was a man, you would never have thought that he was a famous ROCKSTAR. There were some bad things about this movie. As the storyline, there should be more to movie.there should be a continuation of the film, which went for a movie plot, and they have kept the same main character in all three vampire movies. I really liked the clothes people wore, and they pick up the setting in Mexico. I liked it, it was the old Mexico, not New Mexico. with clay houses and old churches fashion. I was a bit confused with the vampires, and how they were able to walk in the churches, but it was cool, they do not follow the rules of the vampire Dracula.
