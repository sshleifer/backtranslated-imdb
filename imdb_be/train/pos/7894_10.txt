This is a great show and make you cry, this group of people really loved each other in real life, and it shows, again and again. Email me and let's talk. I was in Australia, and they are real to talk like this. <br /> <br /> I want to enjoy the Five Mile Creek and pass these great stories about good and evil, friendship and your children. I have all 40 episodes on DVD-R, I've collected over the last 5 years. See my Five Mile Creek Oil www.mikeandvicki.com and hear extensive musical theme. Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are so cool!
