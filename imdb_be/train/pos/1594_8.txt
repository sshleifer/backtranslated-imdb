What I like about you is one of those series that you want to see, but not sure if you can see the beginning of it's cool and it sucks you into a series just for fun, the second part of the season I was 2-3, which are more stale they come and go in what you want. what happens with many series is that they do not end up with something special, because the second part of the series always goes down into the sewer, it is also a few did, the third part is the one to spoil and destroy a number, usually, but it is not, this ending is perfect for this series, it fits perfectly, in fact I was very angry with all these guys in life Val, actually I wanted to end with Jeff in the end, but later he changed, they Vic decided to take a series after almost 3 ezonav without him, and it was a big surprise, and that made a series comes from the top. <br /> <br /> see a lot of time series is actually pretty cool just don "t expect that the second part is that it's good, no, but the third part does what you need, and made a number of other, that It was worth it all, I'm pleased to say that I was pleased and happy about the series and now I'm going to see two guys, a girl and a pizzeria, where I saw a series I will be back ...
