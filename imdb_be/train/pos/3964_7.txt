I found the history of the FBI much entertainment and appropriately upbeat for my New Years Day holiday viewing. His drama and action-packed scenes are thrilling. Hardesty's character was well drawn and admiration. In general, photography, script and direction was quite flattering. Instead of the film to be part of a nefarious propaganda, as some might, I liked how well the mounted image need brilliant minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime. Again, the family picture that holds together even under the weight of her husband's obligations to his (possible) important work, I have not found to be elegant, but the representation of the ideal and exemplary.
