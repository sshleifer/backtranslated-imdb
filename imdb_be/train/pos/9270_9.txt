I should point out, before you read this review that in any case, this statement against the Iranian people ... if you really want something to read in it than, I hope you see that I am against politicians in general .. . but if you want to be offended ... I can not help you! <br /> <br /> not in Iran, like the film it is prohibited (see IMDb trivia for the film). Which is a shame, because the movie is great. It would not be for "Grbavica", this film would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin. <br /> <br /> Rightfully so (it was the second or the second place, if you will). Why? Because this is a film about the oppression. It's not even that it is a complete issue of women. The concern is that the government is trying to keep people down. The analogy is so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But forbidding him nothing will be solved, and / or they can make this movie disappear! <br /> <br /> Another reviewer had a great final line: "The comedy of the tragedy", which sums it up very well!
