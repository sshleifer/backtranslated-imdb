I could not believe that the comments made about the film. <br /> <br /> As I read the horrible thoughts about the film, I actually wondered if you really consider the same movie that I made. <br /> <br /> What I saw was unbelievable! I think actresses and the director has done a fantastic job in the film. <br /> <br /> I have not enjoyed watching as an actress before, and I could not be relegated to the incredible work that they have, I would have to say its a credible film I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> What I do not see why everyone has such a problem with the choice of Diana on drugs in a suicide attempt scene of the comments made by the sound of you, as it was the choice of the actress and her stupid choice. What I do not understand, it was written by someone else and sent to someone else, as it may be, I do not see an error actresses. I think it was a real believable film I would like to see again and recommend. Opinions are that there is, and it's too bad that so many of them are so close to nature. I hope that I will see all of the actors soon, I think, that all play a large role. <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps is the highest paid actress, ever, and I hope that she can laugh in the face of everyone, he criticized her! You Go Girl!
