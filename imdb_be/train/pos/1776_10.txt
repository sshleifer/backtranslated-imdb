I hated the first episode of the show ( "protesting hippies") so much that in 1999 I missed the rest. However, when he came to «The Paramount Comedy Channel» I watched it in its entirety and, to my surprise, found it absolutely hilarious (motto: never judge a sitcom in the first week)! <br /> <br /> Set in 1969, "Hippie" stars Simon Pegg as "Ray Purbbs», editor of «Oz'-like underground magazine called" mouth. " His friends Jill feminist, laid-back Alex and Hugo moron. Back in the late '60s, there was a feeling of incredible optimism among young people that they can change the world through the press no one read magazines. Rather than mock naivety Hippies "Hippy" gentle to her. Arthur Mathews script blatantly parodied a number of icons of the era - "Hair", "Woodstock," "The Graduate", even the notorious "Oz" obscenity trial in the early 70s. Excellent performance from the cast; Julian Rhind-tutti on the "Alex" strangely put me in mind of the character of Richard O'Sullivan «Man About The House". Its a shame that there was never a second series, probably because of people like me. If you missed the "Hippie", give it a try. Once you get past the heavy blade, you are in for a treat!
