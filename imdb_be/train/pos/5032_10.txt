The film "Fragility" is actually more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie. He has all the attributes of a horror movie, but it's not. "Fragility" a film about the perception of religion and knowing the difference between right and wrong. <br /> <br /> In «Frailty», elderly father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons argued that doing God's work. It turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killer called "Hand of God". We are seeing the father kills the "demons" in some ways quite hard while to convince their sons and themselves that they are doing God's work and that they do it correctly. He claims that he had received a message from an angel, who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons that dwell on the earth. God gave him a list of names, and in response to his "services"; he and his sons would be given protection, which basically means that the police will never be able to capture them. We see it all unfold before us in a very disturbing way. But what is really disturbing about all this is the effect it has on the two sons, especially the eldest son of Adam. Adam himself seriously doubt the existence of higher beings, that is, until his father, and a week does not change all that in the cellar. He knows that his father apparently lost consciousness and I am sure the same thing is happening with his younger brother, Fenton. Fenton, the other half of the puzzle, take everything as if it were his own religion. It seems that he is trapped in the world of God the father and the demons. I suppose it's because he's so young and easily impressive. But everything that happens with these three very convincing, in fact, very convincing. <br /> <br /> The events in the film can be seen as bright hallucinations that are currently faced with three main characters. I say this because each of them respond to the situation differently, and at some point in the film, each of them claim to see God. Dad for the first time sees the murder of his mission. His "mission" in the end destroys it quickly turns into an obsession with destroying demons. In fact, it is the primary hallucination. His "orders" and a list of names that he gets all the parts of these hallucinations. Watch the scene where the father finds an ax in a shed in order to figure out where I'm coming from. Fenton, the youngest son, is easily impressed by all this talk about demons and destruction. Because he was so young, it's easy for him to fall into the trap of his father. Adam, on the other hand, is very skeptical about the actions of his father. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> In a sense, the hallucination ends when his father was killed at the end of the film. (I will not say how and under what circumstances). But I say that do not like it. After his death, it is fast forward to today. (History speaks through memories, as seen through the eyes of the eldest son of Adam). In reality, this Fenton, who tells the story, and Adam was not as originally believed. History says he took it, through his actions and those of his brother. Fenton went mad and continues what his father started an FBI agent lured into his trap. <br /> <br /> Since religion is the main theme in this film, the film is also playing at how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those who do not have a full understanding of it. Before Dad opened his extracted mission, he did not have a clear understanding of the religion, and he did not fully believe in a supreme being. His sons Fenton and Adam are often innocent children singing hymns, but it probably did not have a clear understanding of what is meant lyrics. After opening extracted mission Dad, they both starred in separate directions - Adam remained in doubt there be a supreme being, and Fenton gradually absorbed into the father's madness. <br /> <br /> A very good thriller that will creep the hell out of you, do not watch it alone.
