I agree with all the honors, I went through a box of tissues, which have seen the film. It was a gritty authenticity and rang accurate in all respects. <br /> <br /> The question that I am going to raise is the current sensitivity in relation to the treatment of animals. I had a very difficult time since the beginning of the slaughter of sheep and goats, as well as the one who is dying deer with his throbbing neck and blood as his life drained away was disgusting. <br /> <br /> This is the age of "no animals hurt in the production of this step." Iphigenia was made in the late 70s to the emergence of the computer simulation. Is it possible to fake the death of animals? Alternatively, these animals are slaughtered for art?
