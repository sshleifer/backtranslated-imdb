If this film was made just a few years, I would have brought down the cost of a point or two, because the sound quality was quite poor. Sometimes the movie was a silent film during the intermediate stages (normal environmental sounds are absent). But given that this is one thousand nine hundred thirty-one and French film, it is quite excusable. Especially, it also occurs in the later French films - until the sound problems have been fully developed (for example, in L'Atalante from 1934) <br /> <br /> Well, except for some minor sound problems . this cute little film about a winning lottery ticket is absent and a long list of people who are trying to get it. And, during the search there are many glib little songs that you can not help but please. Good magic film all-in-all.
