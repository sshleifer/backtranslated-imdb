This film is surprisingly undervalued by IMDb. Like many other films, this is not the Shawshank. But it's good enough, if predictable, dance competition / personal film growth. If you want to spend half an hour watching a kind of 8 Mile for female step dancer than I think you'll like. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb ratings, I think this film is closer to the top 250, and the "voice bombed" with many 1s, as it does so many films that are not about the crowd, do not have the special effects , or include a non-white or non-straight characters. <, Br /> <br /> is an American film, but it's not the US film. Set mostly in Toronto signals are subtle, and some viewers may think that it is completely installed in the United States only because the final competition in the border city of Detroit. <br /> <br /> I loved the music. I liked the dance (but not sure it's worth $ 50,000 ... but what do I know). The characters were easy on the eyes. <br /> <br /> I agree the name sucks. I do not remember anyone in the film, saying these words, and he must have «S». (No, this is not a foreign language). <br /> <br /> There's not much to hate about this movie (and let's be honest, one vote means that you hated it), so I can only assume that this is an expression of hatred to mean the people in it, and it's sad.
