Sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullavan write love letters to each other, not knowing any, someone else. Naturally, that they work together and can not stand each other. You can guess the rest. He was well acted throughout the cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), a witty, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning. It takes place in Budapest and was filmed in Hollywood, but I found the belief I saw in Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and sleeping like. One of a kind film. Do not miss it!
