After his classic noir respect Chinatown Roman Polanski back to those who gave him his greatest hits in the 60th year of this terrible psychological terror, which is repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, it has to do with paranoia and claustrophobia generated apartment life . <, Br /> <br /> claustrophobic environment are those that Polanski is best to create, and it should be the most suffocating and dated the painting he has ever created. Emphasis on the side walls and distant points of convergence is greater than ever, and even in a small amount of external scenes sky rarely glimpsed. The employer but is not limited to space, but also the rate at which it focuses on his hero. Trelkovsky, he played Polanski not only in every scene, he almost every frame. If it is not on the screen more often than not the camera becomes Trelkovsky view. And, of course, almost everywhere he looks, he sees his own reflection looking at him in the mirror. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any film that is more about the internalization and solitude of the same sign. Some psychological thrillers as M or Peeping Tom, to manipulate us into feeling sorry for the mentally ill character. Others, such as Psycho, attempt an in-depth scientific analysis of his mental condition. Tenant fit into any of the categories ?? he simply immerses us completely in the experience without demanding Trelkovsky we really understand and appreciate what is going on in his head. We believe his paranoia and obsession, even if he always showed us that they are irrational. <br /> <br /> Polanski was also a master of the horror film unfolding slowly. Often in its horrors ambiguity exists as to whether there really is something sinister going on, but they are among the most effective in scaring spectators. Why? It is because they develop very slowly and invest so much time in setting up situations carefully, they lowered the viewer into paranoia. Much later, Polanski horror Ninth Gate bit of a mess of plot wise, but at least, still manage to achieve this creeping fear. <br /> <br /> This is a rare chance to see a very large role in Polanski. His talent in front of the camera was as good as him, and he is absolutely perfect as gentle Trelkovsky. Another outstanding performance is that all too often forgets Shelley Winters, concierge. In fact it is rather a star cast, although many familiar faces look ridiculous in this wonderful, gothic European cinema. In addition, unfortunately, many of the French actors in the supporting roles are badly dubbed version of the English language. <br /> <br /> The tenant more polished and less pretentious than the repulsion, but it lacks suspense and character, who make Rosemary's Baby so exciting and interesting. Tenant well, without serious drawbacks, and Polanski was really in good shape as a director, but this is not one of his most exciting works.
