I should start with Ed Furlong on it. You should. God bless this child. $ 5 bucks, that the character he plays in the film that he really is, as in real life. He has a one-liner or two that made me almost blow the snot out of subtle humor in the script. You know all tests, this guy has gone through in recent years, and it does not even seem that even acts Furlong. Maybe that's why his performance was good. Same with Madsen. You keep thinking, "I bet this guy is really like this in real life." Do Madsen even act? Just natural. Vosloo clearly moved from a type-cast Mummy Man.

These guys are twins. <br /> <br /> As I watched, I wondered why some actors were foreign accents, and what they did in this small town. It made sense, after all, that these men smuggled the material in other countries / states so that they can have these accents. But most are disclosed in the bonuses that some manufacturers want to make this film to an international audience with some of their stars, we could not hear. And some of them smokes. Moncia Dean? Need I say more.
