Last year, we looked at in two films about Truman Capote wrote a book with which this film was made. - Capote and Infamous <br /> <br /> I can not imagine the film, as is done in 1967. The stark, powerful and terribly cruel drama; elevated to the status of the classic film the workshops led by Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Professional, the Blackboard Jungle). <br /> <br /> It is interesting that Robert Blake, who starred in the film, there were so many problems in recent years, which may be associated with his image killer in this film. <br /> <br /> This is a film that stays with you after the show.
