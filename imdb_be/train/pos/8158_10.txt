"Fear Of A Black Hat" is all (much weaker) "ST-4" should be. Satirical eye Rusty Kandeff is ruthless as he is, spindle, and mutilate every aspect of trends and culture of hip-hop. Is there a "FoaBH" reminiscent of Spinal Tap? Yes, a little. Whether it is a derivative of the Spinal Tap? No, not really. The goal is a more focused, satire better focused, and to be honest, it's funnier.
