It's really more of a drama, and very grim that ... I remember some emotionally intense spiritual voice-overs. <br /> <br /> Pitt plays a perhaps not-sexy movie ever with an amazing talent. Who started out as a bad husband still harmless "white trash" was understood as a strong who violates an alcoholic with a broken mind. During some of the last stages in the film, I found it difficult to continue to watch it - it was unpredictable and frightening. This proves a very good writing and acting. <br /> <br /> The entire film is filled with strange, sensational scenes that made me hold my breath at least once, and I do not mean the scenes. I mean a dialogue scene so brilliantly crafted in fact I shuddered and gasped from what I've seen. It was like a rhinoceros and a lion caged and watching how they bite each other to death. Again, I am very impressed with the writer (s); who they have done the impossible :. mixed oil and water <br /> <br /> I also really enjoyed the performance of Juliette Lewis. It's so rare it's a talented young actress, to make it appear that these days when she does it's such a joy. Some of her moments in this film brought me to tears. I mean that. Emotions, this girl can awaken mind is incredible, and I distinctly remember how blurry eyes several times. <br /> <br /> I almost feel like I'm cheating quality filmmakers skills were displayed only gives «Kalifornia» rating ***. But the dark feelings, it prevents too strong and depressing to pick it up. I believe that everyone should see this film, though. I really do.
