The first two sequences of this film created two conflict: in -thematic- conflict between Todd and his soldier depressed humanity and -physical- conflict between Todd and his bio-engineered replacement. Both sequences are quite exciting in many ways. <br /> <br /> The script stumbles several peoples by addressing the first of these arcs halfway through the film, which means that the second half a little more than simple action romp. <br /> <br /> However, the prestige of the founders to create a piece of the action genre with heart and even a bit of soul and especially Kurt Russell, who carries a lot of very little. <br /> <br /> Or is not a great movie, but one worth seeing.
