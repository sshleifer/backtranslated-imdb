photography was beautiful, but I could barely understand what's going on ... there's a lot of symbolism ... 2 goldfish - they mean something in the Thai culture? there is not much plot, not much happens, and it's just bent along. there is no real start, no real middle and no real end. rather unsatisfactory indeed. <br /> <br /> It was hard to get into the character, you never felt that you should know them ... it was hard to know which scenes were imaginary, and which were real. This step could feel chaotic and incoherent. I do not know that Pang brothers hoped to achieve. Maybe if I was a Thai it would make more sense ...
