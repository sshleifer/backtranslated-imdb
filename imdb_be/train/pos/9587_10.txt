Fifteen years later, and Paris Lights still burning. This is a classic black gay movies, right up there with other honorary black gay movie, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This pioneering work captures the underground and the lower layers (ie "insufficient degree) black and Latin gay culture and society, like no other before or after work, including all sentimental retrospective of gay and visualization Harlem Renaissance. They are good, but this is the best (dare I say only "real") film you will find on the subject. this Relentlessy Cunty (classical music at home invention) comes to Hollywood, non-stop, fun camp (as soon as we do so), and the dead of social criticism. this white female director, I og go on, but I think you get the point now (which, obviously, should be, or sister Gu Mizz matter in a former life.): I love this movie!
