The reason why people say that this movie scared them, because it did !! This means that the aim of the film felt a bit, who has seen it. When I first saw this movie that scared me and made me think about life and religion. It's not blood and blood scary type of film, but the kind that you think that it may be possible for things to happen, that the film was written. Of course, the non-believers say it is only a science fiction film. However, this film is a must have for your collection thriller, even if it has a religious concept. If you're a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc) is one of them, and it should be. I've never seen a continuation (Distant Thunder), but I believe that it picks up where the movie ends.
