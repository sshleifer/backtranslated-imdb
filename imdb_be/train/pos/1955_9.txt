Just the kind of movie I love. Some very good British actors, as well as the one and only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) masterfully manipulates a well-educated group of people's lives, playing on their weaknesses, to gather experience to write a book, a murder mystery. She plays a female psychopath pretty good, using it enough sex appeal to convincingly portray what can be considered one of the ultimate Black Widows. Tramell is to use in dark places in society and freely relishes in sadomasochistic throws in "never visit after dark" side of the city. From the very beginning, not other than the R rating here just because of the dialog box. Stone can also be characterized as a kind of female Hannibal Lecter, indifferent femme fatale without a meal plan.
