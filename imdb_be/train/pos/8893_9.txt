In the 60's a well-balanced mini series between the historical facts and a good story. In four deliveries, we go to the North American family with 3 members. But we do not just see them. We also follow the story of several characters as Black Monk, the leader of the extremist students and soldiers in Vietnam. Filmographies just unusual. In the first chapters, we see some shots of the Vietnam War scene. In the next section, will not start when the latter had finished, she starts some time after giving us a bit of mystery about what happened. In general, the 60's mini-series is a must see, and not just for hippies fanatics, but for everyone with a bit of curiosity about the topic.
