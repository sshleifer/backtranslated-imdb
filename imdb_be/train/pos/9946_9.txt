Dream Quest was surprisingly good film. There were some notable inconsistencies, but what can you expect in the film, as it was done in such a short time. I did not feel the desire to advance in the movie, and I found it quite interesting. It becomes a kind of silly at times, but overall I recommend it. They probably used all the glitter in nearby stores, and some of the designs the costumes were pretty good.
