Show old ???? I'm 15 and watched the show since I was 12, recoding it to my Sky + box every day from Hallmark and BBC 1. I really want them to not cancel, they will not even get a proper farewell. But it's an adventure, all these episodes, I think I've seen them all, and does not come to mind that I did not like, and enjoy. <br /> <br /> It's a shame BBC keep the exchange between the diagnoses of murder and Â«Murder She Wrote'- never looked at it and did not intend. In any case, it is the characters diagnoses of murder so in depth, and the chemistry between the actors strange. It really was a sad day, when they canceled the show ........
