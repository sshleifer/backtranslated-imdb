I liked this movie reminded me of the kind my marriage. It is very clean, you can see it with my family. Very nicely done. Songs also normal. I think that the director is great writer. The film shows how the marriage progress through time. They have a pair at different stages of life and relationships in their lives the film perfectly draws quite a few steps in parallel in the same story. Some of the dialogue is pretty good. The film reflects the complex human emotions, not very nice with more than a hoax. Also shows the perfect in the end is not so perfect. It shows very well the dynamics of an arranged marriage, when it is new. The film is very well written and directed.
