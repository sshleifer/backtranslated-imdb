If it is action and adventure you want in the movie, then you would be better advised to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with the mood, check «The Straight Story». <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth put on a convincing performance as the gentle and gentlemanly Alvin Straight, in this true story of the journey of Alvin on these mowers through three states to see his former brother who had a stroke. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is perfect in this role, as he travels his long and winding road, I got to know other people and doling out a lot of grandparents type of family on the way councils. The story moves so slowly, like riding mower, but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching, waiting for the next life lesson Alvin is going to offer. <br /> <br /> Stretch out on the couch, sit back and enjoy. This is the only way to see this is a very good movie that rate in my book on 7/10.
