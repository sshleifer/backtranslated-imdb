I waited a few years before the film finally released in England, but in many ways very nice when I finally saw it. There are many good things for the film to start the action. It's not something that I have all that much need for a horror film, but the people in this film all put in a good performance. It is constantly exciting and interesting scenario, with a good variety of Lovecraft feel to it, give the film a real solid foundation. Add to that a dose of surreal nightmare imagery and sometimes disgusting gore films and winner. He has his favorite kind of gore and supernatural and splattery. In addition, by Marcus characters, malicious bodybuilding transsexual and Daisy, his mentally retarded lover / toy genuinely bizarre and care from time to time and give away everything is feeling sickly grown madness that works well with frequent Freudian overtones, is one of the most impressive modern horror movies, much more shocking or is there anything Hollywood could produce. My only gripe was that I wanted the ending to be darker in tone, but it still works, so all in all I would highly recommend it to serious horror buff.
