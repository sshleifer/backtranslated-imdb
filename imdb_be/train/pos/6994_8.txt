Bel has 9 photos for monograms, but it was only on this, 4Th, that all began to come together. All the others in the series will use this as an important template for the production of writing and character development. From this point on, for better or worse, the series will also have to deal with one important theme: scientist (usually Bel) conducting experiments in a basement or an old house (sometimes in the basement of an old house), which leads to things that go blooey. It was also the first time that the art director Dave Milton got the chance to spread their wings. He came on board for Black Dragon, Flicka before, but this is one where he gets to do his craft to start clicking. Lewis a great atmosphere for a song, and has been around for the rest of the monogram. Casting is a key in them, and this is a very good B movie-wise, here. You get Barclay and Harley (also from the black dragons), along with Russell, who will play a major role in Lewtons' CAT PEOPLE movies..and Rosetto, from the ghosts run wild ... good slice of the poverty of his talent. If you have limited time and budget, start with this ... sums up all that they have learned up to this point, and gives you something else to compare. The plot? White steals the gland juice to keep his young wife reverse. They both like to sleep in coffins. If you can read that and smile, the rest will be easy.
