Red Eye is a thrilling film maker Freddie Krueger, Wes Craven. Wes Craven reflects the history of the ordinary hotel employee Lisa. After he attended the funeral of her grandmother, she decides to take a red eye flight. While waiting, she meets the man named Jack Rippner, (fffrreeaakkyy like this?), And they sort of became friends. Oddly enough, both sitting next to each other on the plane. Then it's when the horror begins. This film is exciting and weak heart people who do not like movies excite / horror, but lets say it is possible that they can urinate in his trousers. This is an excellent example of a dice shaker production. Wes Craven has done well with this film. He chose the right actors as Rachel McAdams, intelligent, sexy girl who knows what she is doing, and carefully of all, if it works in the movie. Cillian Murphy, dreadful and terrible actor who can chill your bones in his brilliant acting to be a bad character in this film, and his face can really expand your eyes. Wes Craven has done an excellent job and I hope he does more movies like this.
