I saw this film tonight in New York at the Landmark Sunshine. I did not know what to expect, I would not read much about it, as I knew that I did not see it no matter what. In general, it is very well done. It does not focus on the generalization of the statement "anti-war", which to me, to leave politics out of it. Soldiers mostly talked about their awareness of the toxicity in their training camp, and it was difficult once they returned to civilian life. It was really good to see Paul and Camille Riekhoff bellows talk about the complexity in living not only war, but abandoning the team to come back when he was against personal morality. Make no mistake - this is not an anti-war film. Anyone who says it is not seen or is not living with the scars of war on the soul.
