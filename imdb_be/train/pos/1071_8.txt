probably need to do some work in season 2. Such as the virus between Max and Logan, and Ames White, with his ancient, super cult. In the second season, however, the only thing that kept me watching could see that Max and Logan ever get rid of the nasty virus that infects Max. Very good drama in two seasons. But, of course, like all TV shows, if there is something a little wrong with this TV takes off into the air. I'm seriously hoping for a third and final season. Season 2 leaves you hanging if you have not read the book by Max Allan Collins, then you'll know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Dark Angel should be returned to the air for one more season, even though it may cost a lot of time to get all the original actors again. because the sky carrier Jessica Alba took off after the show. If this were so, then there has to be a film, to complete it. as well as the show Firefly, which, of course FOX canceled as well.
