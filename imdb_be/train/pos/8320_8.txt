Farrah Fawcett spent most of his career, his post-Angel confounding us with a rare speech noted actor sandwiched between her mischievous antics Playboy and Letterman. But when it comes to this, there is no doubt that this girl can act. Away from the history of epic proportions, it is well made TV movie gentle, quiet and sometimes moving. Fawcett plays a wayward daughter, the black sheep comes home only to discover that she had missed the last days of her mother, as well as for the funeral, unfortunately it more stable and probably more sensible sister. Brad Johnson plays the love interest, and the story unfolds with all the typical elements of a television movie, but then the drum there is always confusing to watch Tara, and she, in fact, are still eminently watchable. (And, yes, I admit it, I have something to Farrah poster on my wall, way back when). Silk Hope takes three and a half stars (out of five) at Corkymeter. Bosley would have been proud.
