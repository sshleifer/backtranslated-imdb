I just watched this movie by mistake. What a little gem. This film, shot in 1956, looks and feels like the end of the seventies film. And it's actually better, more moderate and more correct than, say, the blue soldiers. Ecological, anthropological half a ton far ahead of its time. Film is the ultimate understated and very realistic. Much more than the Dances With Wolves, The Last Hunt was able to convey the look and buffalo "killing" off the end of the 1800s. Probably because those in the film were real fields murder. The film was shot during the judicial forest buffalo culling directed, so that the animals that you see is actually removed, the actual bones. In conclusion, a very underrated Western masterpiece, superbly acted, directed and shot.
