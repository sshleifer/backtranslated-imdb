Dear readers, <br /> <br /> In the final battle between the Empire and the uprising. The second Death Star nearing completion, and when it is completed it will spell doom for the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi Knight returned to Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia is now open as the twin sister of Luke! They agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of Endor, and Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star. Little do they know that the most ingenious trap was laid for them, and the Emperor Palpatine personally overseeing the construction of the second Death Star. <br /> <br /> Return of the Jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy. It is action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic action, strange fight scenes, and amazing music of John Williams. Mark Hamill fully matured now in Jedi Knight, left a naive farm boy, and his place is calm, relaxed Jedi decided to save the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this film, as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Feeling fulfill its role in T while James Earl Jones is still the biggest villain of cinema: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid as great a villain as twisted and tightly ruthless Emperor Palpatine. The action sequences of this film is amazing and exciting sword fights are serious and rough. Cost of John Williams is still cool and strengthens the film on several levels. <br /> <br /> Signature, The Constant DVD Collector
