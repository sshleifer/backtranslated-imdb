I, too, was on hand for the premiere in Toronto. This film was a kind of consolation, when I thought I could not get to see my first choice. Well, I was completely blown away. By the time I got to the theater I could remember nothing but the basic plot of the film (yes, I actually forgot who even then.) Wonderful performances by the entire cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in this departure from his days as the Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I think, not so much as an actor Chaplin played brilliantly with no lines, what-so ever. The children were also great. Definitely check this one out if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> And by the way, I got to see my first choice anyway-, and it was much better.
