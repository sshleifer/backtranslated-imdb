The film was very moving. He was gentle, and funny at the same time. The scenery was absolutely beautiful! Peter Falk and Paul Reiser gave a reward winning performances. Olympia Dukakis was great. I understand, because the storyline of it had to be short, but I would like to see her more, she is a real pro.You will be able to recall the experience of his own, hopefully in a positive way after seeing this film. We were lucky to see Paul Reiser in the Q & A after the show. He's a wonderful man, intelligent, eloquent and "real person." It was a really enjoyable evening! This is a must see film. You will be very grateful to you to go.
