What can I say about this movie that hasnt already been said? well, to tell the truth about it ALOT looks very fake, like some of the slaps and kicks. Charlie Sheen, although it was real, I do not know. I am sure that they will be hitting the hands and feet of her a lot harder when it was. but the scene with the pinching and hot oil look very real. and the final stage of the needle in the eye and amazingly made probibly only on a film that has ever shocked me.
