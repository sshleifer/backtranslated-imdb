I love Monte Carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this film. I thought that everything was very good. I was not familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought he did his character (Julian Peters) very personable, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good, as the rejected embarrassed girl with a heart of gold. George Hamilton was magical and perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a field day as a bon vivant. James Belushi tantrum like a complete moron. Cybil Shepard gave a very sweet job like a good housewife vulnerable ignored. The magnificent ensemble cast. A lot of talent, a smart script, a lot going on and a beautiful place. Just nice to take me to a boring day. Especially in winter, when a trip to Europe is not anywhere on your horizon.
