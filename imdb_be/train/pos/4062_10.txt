I just realized that I use IMDb for many years, and I have never considered my favorite movie. By favorite I do not mean that I do now, I mean, this movie is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animation experience will touch it. This is obvious, because I was never going to be a child again; I saw this movie on ITVAH in the early nineties. I was 12, which is the age group, this film is aimed at, I, too, am a man, sex, this film is for (the vast majority of the protagonists of Miyazaki female). Thus, this film is inspired by my childhood indelibly psychology and I am forever obliged Karl Matsko (sp?) For the English dubbing of the film, which significantly exceeds the production of her $ Di, which is not even funny - I have never even been in will observe that one - of course the subtitle is the only way in the long run, however Matsok version is so good (voice almost exactly matches the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD! It is not available on any distribution in English speaking countries. Go figure it out. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of competent review, so I'm going to put some stuff here, not that I categorically archive information for this movie. <br /> <br /> First, I would agree with the reviewer who said that you have 20 out of 10 for inspection of Miyazaki films. - they are so in their own league, they do almost the entire directory on the IMDb combined pales <br /> <br /> The fascinating story of this film, Miyazaki based the countryside around the ravine slag (town square grooves in) mountain Welsh communities. He visited Wales for a few months at the beginning of the 80s (maybe the end of the 70's) only after one of the greatest rock bursts. As an ardent supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight. The struggle between the citizens and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man. Countryside and the cloud, especially in this film reminds me of where I grew up, as he fantasized version of the film reflects the hilly Middle West of the British Isles. <br /> <br /> The island, of course, from the genius of Swift's satirical novel of the eighteenth century - the story of the book Swift has consciously ridiculous. The castle in the sky, Miyazaki weaves myths, such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel - I think that architecture is in addition based on the Peruvian ruins, although I'm not sure who told me that <br /> <br />. anyone round gets to read this review, and who love this film really wants to see Miyazaki's epic series Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - on the basis of short science fiction novel «The Incredible Tide» Alexander key (the novel is available on the Internet). Conan basically the prototype slot and SHITA Laputa. In addition, you may not be familiar with his previous work for Masterpiece Theater - some of its key frame animations. He also made a keyframe for Sherlock Hound - this is one of the most remarkable background I have ever seen, too. Also check Miyazaki and Takahata first feature film Horus Prince of the Sun (1968) - amazing by today's standards really. What else ... Gosh cellist and Flying Ghost Ship - though they rarely <br /> <br /> This film is a gift, I do not know what would we do without it all. this other crap speaking around, it's like an oasis. Arigatou Miyazaki-sensei!
