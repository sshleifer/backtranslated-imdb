I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and, moreover, to be a full-length movie (real supporter wants to see how little is left as possible, and that can only be achieved in a mini-series) it was really cool. Gwyneth Peltie really captures a bit clueless, but well-intentioned rich girl and Mr. Knightley North with his poise and nobility. I was not thrilled with Ewan McGregor, although I love him very much, as an actor, but I do not feel that this spoiled the film at all. As I have said, as a supporter of Jane Austen were things that I would like to see that were not included, but it would make it much more than acceptable for a feature film, and how it was, I felt that they really encapsulated story well. I've seen every adaptation of the book, and I felt that this is the best!
