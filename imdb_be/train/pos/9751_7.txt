One day, there are different types of films. These various films coexist, although each of them something else to offer .... <br /> <br /> This may seem obvious at first, but I thought I'd show it in the time of this review, because it seems a few people can forgotten. It's just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans. That's all. It does not pretend anything else or anything grandiose. People who make fun of it as something that did not meet the promises, without seeing the whole izobrazhe- literally. After all, Hollywood makes movies all the time, which are shameless means of transport for people (Bodyguard or preacher's wife w / Whitney Houston 2 examples that come to mind.) <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to refer to the film as a vehicle for Pavarotti. There are worse things in the world-- and worse films. Singing a fabulous selection of arias and pleasure. The film begins with Schubert's Ave Maria, and then Leoncavallo Matinatta. Pav sings arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also singing folk music, such as "I Left My Heart in San Francisco" and a song that was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe, "If we were in love" w / music by John Williams and lyrics of Alan and Marilyn Bergman- all 3 previous Oscar winners. <br /> <br /> the story is not so bad. It was built for Pavarotti, yes, of course, it will not be something that is deep or universally applicable to the average viewer of the film. This story of a famous opera singer, who was injured a bad night at the opera years ago. When he was asked to sing again in the same place, «MET» in New York, he loses his voice with fear. Dr. Pamela (or Pah-MAY-la-Italian :)) plays Katherine Harrold- gives him an injection to cure it a psychosomatic reaction. He offers her a chance to have an affair with him, and she reluctantly accepts. <br /> <br /> They embark on an affair, she knew he was married, and promises not to fall in love with him, and he thinks it will be just another woman. Despite all this, they fall in love (so that song, "if we were in love") and with its help, he overcomes his fear and rises to METAM where he wins. I will not say how it will end, but it is quite predictable. But it's not always a bad thing. <br /> <br /> This tour is not so bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if you expect a performance Spencer Tracy and Tom Hanks, you are mistaken, Sun Pavarotti. He knows that he does not thespians. The fact that he's cute, charming and charismatic. He's fun yourself, and if you can just let yourself have fun, too, it's not so bad. One line of funny when he says Pamela (Harrold), that it is a "drink factory, Feeney can water you!" And, of course, she says, "I do not want to be watered by Fine!" Kathryn Harrold very sweet and It does a good job as a sex-anxious woman who learns from this extravagant person to live a little. One of my favorite lines in the movie: "Life should never be the size of life." And Eddie Albert, who does his usual good job as manager Fini. There are a few "do" real cameos conductors, singers, etc., and it is filmed on location at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like opera, if you like Pavarotti ~ d, or if you can just let yourself go and enjoy the "small affair" as well as it offers in film, you can get enjoy this film for what it is. I know that every time DO-. :) <br /> <br />
