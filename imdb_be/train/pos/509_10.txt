"Broken Bow» takes us back to where it all began. Set 150 years in our future, and for 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This "Star Trek" franchise fee, in my opinion, the first series, as "TOC" to regain a sense of wonder, danger and excitement "Going the Where no one has gone before." Scott of the perfectly cast as Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first «Star Ship Enterprise». He and the whole cast really show true respect for the Star Trek legacy. John Billingsley is Brilliant as a stranger doctor phlox and Blelki very juicy like a tempting, but the logical Vulcan science officer TPola. Broken Bow, in my opinion, the best of any of the main episode Treks, and I think Gene Roddenberry, will no doubt be proud of.
