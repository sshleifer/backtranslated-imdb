I remember watching this film on Saturday in the second half of the day to TV in the 1950s or 60s. It was well presented, but I remember there was a message of hope from the broadcast transmitters are secreted in lamposts in one of the last manic punishment for the impending release. I'm not sure that squares with the facts. <br /> <br /> However, the film is well made. The German High Command says wryly without emotion "Russian advance down the Fredrich StrasseÂ», as if everything was going according to plan. <br /> <br /> It was my impression that this film and the later American made-for-TV knock- on based on the value of the British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper of the same title The Last Days of Hitler. I was surprised not to see the credit Trevor-Roper. <br /> <br /> I agree to the latest German film on the collapse was as well done as a classic. American knock-off was a bit flat. <br /> <br /> Few figures attract much attention from the movie, as Adolf. Nevertheless, I find it interesting that none of the numerous films and books that have come out ever saying Hitler twice referred to the way in the beautiful historic part of John Toland. <br /> <br /> Was lumps?
