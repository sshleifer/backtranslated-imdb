TV series of the 1960s Witch owe this idea of ​​this film. This is a film that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak did immediately after they were cast together Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as intrusive as one-on-one, but Novak also exciting. <br /> <br /> It was Jack Lemmons tenth movie, and it's good to support here, and Ernie Kovacs. The film has a lot of good things about it. Hermine Zhingold very well in this film, almost as well in support here, as it was in The Music Man. The cast is very hard. <br /> <br /> This film has a late-1950s New York feel and a cat, which is cursed, as any cat in any film. It's worth a look, as it is a love story with all the emotions of any, and also a little bit of magic trunk. <br /> <br /> This is not the Vertigo, but I think because it was followed by the film, the audience did not rate this as good as it deserves - I am sure glad that William Asher saw, so that in the 1960 series was created. I'm not so glad that Will Ferrell has made it to the big screen, this film is much better than that.
