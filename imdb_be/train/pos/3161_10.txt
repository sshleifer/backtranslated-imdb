I actually did not start watching the show until he went on FX. I was bored and there was nothing to see, and saw that repeats in the show was the premiere, so I decided to look at. I was so upset that I did not watch the show when it first aired on TV I loved the show so much! Finally, a show for all to enjoy. I remember the full house and family issues, and step by step, and they were OK show, but just not funny enough. They make silly jokes and laugh at the things that were just silly, but not 70s Show. This 70th show was fun, smart and so real. I think it was the best show ever made, and I'm sorry that it ended. Despite the fact that I love this show, I think it should have ended in the seventh season, when Eric and Kelso get away. Last season was just not right, Eric was the main character and the show should end when the character goes. I still love this show, and I hope that the TV starts to do more shows like this.
