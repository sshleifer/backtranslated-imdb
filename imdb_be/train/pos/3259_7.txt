This is not the best romantic comedy ever made, but it is certainly very pleasant and watchable. It is aimed at old-fashioned way, and that works fine. Cybill Shepherd as Karin is not bad in his role as a woman who can not get over the death of her husband. She has sexual maturity. But I can not say much for Ryan O'Neal, Philip, because he is, at best, ugly. It may be appropriate in this role, but it's not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, I feel that some of the characters, especially Alex and Miranda, are not written with sufficient thought in depth. We have nothing about them do not know, because minutes after they appear the story thickens, and the authors do not tell us much of what is happening. But this problem has been saved, because Mary Stuart Masterson is fresh as a daisy sweetness to decorate it, and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming that it melts the screen. Even his smile is contagious. And it so happened that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for déjà vu and historical scenes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a light and easy, and if you like them that way, why not give it a try. <br /> <br />
