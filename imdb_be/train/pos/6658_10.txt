Mahatma has been portrayed as a man who neglected her son in this film. Do not get me wrong, I do not blame the film; this is a great movie and left the theater with a lump in the throat. We need to understand the spiritual condition of the Mahatma, he is a true spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened person could wrest themselves from their loved ones. People with this caliber are his family and followers, for example. According to the movie, he turned to his son and try to make him understand where he's coming, but poor Harilall with so little intelligence could not understand his father. If something went wrong with Harilall, Mahatma could remain calm and accepted that his son is a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> If any of the other parents, they would be a threat to their values, to help his son get on their feet. Mahatma did not do so, he is a true leader, which gives an example.
