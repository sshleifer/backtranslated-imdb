Given the fact that this film has many fine qualities of entertainment, I think it should have been given a few more points than it is on IMDB. <br /> <br /> This is your basic "who did this? thriller with sex and murder, but it keeps you guessing until the very end. I like these kinds of movies, and I certainly think that this is one complies. <br /> <br /> For me, it was worth watching more than once, so I'll give it an 8 on IMDB.
