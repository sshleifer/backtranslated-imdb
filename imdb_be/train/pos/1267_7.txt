Just Cause is incorrect, but a decent film held together by strong performances and some creative (although very predictable) writing. Sean Connery is an anti-death penalty crusaders brought to rescue a seemingly innocent young black man (Blair Underwood), the final sentence. To set things right, Connery on a scene where he has to contend not only with the passage of time, but with the intervention of the sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). Twists and turns and reversals role galore - some strange, some of them - like aging crusader trying to solve the mystery. Naivysočajšij ending is a bit ridiculous, but Just Cause is worth a look on a slow night.
