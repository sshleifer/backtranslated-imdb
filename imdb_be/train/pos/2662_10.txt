* !! - Spoilers - !! * <br /> <br /> Before you begin, let me say that I have had as an advantage to see this movie on the big screen and those that saw the "authorized version" this film, converted by Stephen King, who himself in 1997. <br /> <br /> Both benefits have forced me to evaluate this version of «the Shining» more. <br /> <br /> in addition, let me say that I read the book of Mr. King's "the Shining" repeatedly over the years, and while I love the book and I'm a big fan of his work, the presentation of Stanley Kubrick's story is much more attractive m ... and scary. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to convey the horror of the mind directly on the film. The film direction and script writing, he gained the title of «Magus» out of the question. Kubrick's genius as . magic world of cinema has lost a great director, when he died in 1999. Among his other outstanding loans are: strabismus 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975, A Clockwork orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968 Spartacus, 1960, and more <br /> <br /> Torrences (Jack, his wife Wendy and Danny and their son) live in the Overlook Hotel for the winter. Jack was hired as a watchman. It's his job to keep track of the contents of the hotel within a few months of hard snow, until spring, when the Overlook opens its doors. It seems there are a lot of rich and oversaturated with tourists who flock to the snowy mountains in the Colorado summer vacation. <br /> <br /> The hotel was a big part of the architecture and setting. He lent to the atmosphere, with the dark, but at the same time, "friendly" atmosphere itself. Furniture and furniture was the entire period (late 70's - early 80's), and filmography terrain approaching the hotel, in the first scene is brilliant. This not only allows you to enjoy the approach to the Overlook, he also captures in his mind, like a desert hotel and isolated from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Wendy and Danny's character had a stroke of genius. You get the whole story of his past, the "imaginary friend" Tony Denis, and the story of Jack's alcoholism all rolled into this beautiful, neat opening scene. There was no need for stretching the past two hours of the film; Obviously Kubrick saw that from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> On the closing day. Again, the picturesque road to the mountain to the hotel (this time with the family), the interaction between Jack and Danny was funny, and drawing very disturbing exchange. <br /> <br /> The initial tour through the Overlook completely breathtaking, even as a "staff" moving things, you get to see the majestic fireplaces, high ceilings and cathedral expensive furniture, dormants and crown moldings in architecture. "They did a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors. "(Wendy Torrance) Even" staff wing "is well designed and beautifully built. <br /> <br /> In the maze was a lovely touch, resembling a labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was a keeper. When Jack Nicholson stands on scalable models of the maze and looking at the center, seeing Wendy and Danny entrance is a magical moment; one that tells you right away, there are heavy energy in this house; There is something seriously wrong, it has already begun. "I would not go there if I did not have at least an hour to find my way.» (Manager Hotel) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, Dick Halloran, was present and open in its execution . His smile was natural, and his performance was great. You could actually believe that you were there at the hotel, taking a tour of the kitchen with Wendy and "dock." His explanation of "lights" Denis was very well supplied, as well as his conversation with the child about Tony and hotels. It was believable and sincere. <br /> <br /> Cut and pan scan of the hotel, with the mountain looming behind, the cold air swirls of mist that comes with a warm roof snow-covered hotel, adds so much to the atmosphere of the film. It also marks the point "halfway to hell", so to speak; a turning point in the film. <br /> <br /> image of Shelley Duvall Wendy Torrance was overbearing. (?! So what if she also played Olive Oyl It just shows its wonderful diversity) To be honest, before I saw the film on the big screen in 1980, I said: "What is Olive Oil * lol * (Popeye the was also? released in 1980), but I took it back, as soon as the beginning of the film. it's brilliant. in the opinion of the Fiend, is its best result to date! (Although I love her, Steve Martin, "Roxanne", 1987). <br /> <br /> After Kubrick set pearl bits of information that you, the viewer, it is necessary to be in possession of: Torrens in the past, a broken arm Denis, Tony, istoryya the hotel itself, the fact that Danny is not "mental" and clairvoyant instead, and the general location of the hotel, all of which you will receive in the opening sequence of 3, the film never ceases to scare you <br /> <br /> two killed daughters. previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (The girl was Denis several times, first by Tony in the apartment before the family ever went to an hour Otel) were icons from which Danny can identify and from which he was afraid at the same time. They were persecuted (and the ghost) by itself and showed Denis ~ d, how and where they were killed in a rather graphic and material way. <br /> <br /> Tony Kubrick was written as a companion of the spirit, as the spirit of leadership, which he acquired as a result of his hands almost ripping his body was his own father. He was ... "the little boy that lives in my mouth." He will appear at the end of the finger Denis and physically speaking through Denis to talk with Denis. I do not like the book, I understand where Tony was designed by Stephen King, that the projection of Denis, as the eldest boy, trying to save his father. Kubrick left that a little twist, and it somehow made it worse when Tony "Dany took ... ... again." The idea of ​​the old self Danny stands back to his younger ... I'm not scared. <br /> <br /> «A woman in the shower" scene made Lia Beldan (which I can not find any other credits to have done nothing, or at the time) as a young woman and Billy Gibson (who also, seems to suffer from a lack of credits on the performance of work before or after), it was tempting disgusting and thoroughly disgusting. It was a dramatic and frightening. Disgusting and scary. If Nicholson is looking in the mirror and sees that it is decomposed flesh under his hands; External view of horror on his face was so full and real. <br /> <br /> Jack quickly embarks on his campaign of «jonesing» alcoholic certified mentally ill. The deterioration of the mental state of the character thoroughly and carefully documented Kubrick. instant friendship with Lloyd the bartender Jack (once alcoholics who want to be mentally ill and drug addicts do) reflects its vital need an atmosphere in which Lloyd Avails it; namely, alcohol ... "dog's hair and bit me." (Jack Torrance) In the case of Jack, it's bourbon on the rocks for free Jack. "Orders from the house.» (Lloyd the bartender) nice play on words. <br /> <br /> If Wendy found in the "script" Jack is no more than page after page of the same line, dialed again and again, although 8 or 9 different artistic styles. ..when he asked out of the shadows, "How do you like it?" Wendy and whirlpools and shouts with a baseball bat in his hand ... so badly. This is the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation ... how messed up Jack. It's very scary, dramatic, and provides a strong presence. This, combined with the vision of Denis filling in the hotel lobby with the blood imposed on the scene between Jack and Wendy, and a confrontational end to this scene, do it, perhaps the most powerful scene of the film. <br /> <br /> "Redrum" scene. Wow. What can I say? What mother would not be completely riddled with awakening to find them a young, troubled son, standing over them with a huge knife, saying in this bizarre voice, shouting «Redrum» again and again? Even if it did not matter, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of blood pressure. It was something that everyone can (and should) remember (ed). Speaking of memorable scenes ... <br /> <br /> last Nicholson assault on his family with an ax was probably one of the worst scenes in movie history. His on-libbed line «Heeeeere Johnny!" Was a stroke shine and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. He also enters the history of horror film. <br /> <br /> In the end ..? Ending Kubrick was perfection. I felt that it ended beautifully. Many serve, entirely banal whine plaintively entirely idiotic ending of this film. Just embodiment of perfection. That's all I'll say about it ending. <br /> <br /> Who cares that the learned? See what Kubrick put IN. Rent it, look to buy. This is a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason. IT RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> I, being Me * ... Take this film and sitck his collection of Stephen King, and take in 1997 "authorized" version made King and paste it down to the children's section. That's where it belongs. .: This film fare from 9.98 Villain :.
