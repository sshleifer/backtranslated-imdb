As I was always looking for something new and unique, I watched this movie online. I thought it would be just another «B» film speed, but I was amazed that there are two main characters. All the actors in this film have been very capable and well directed. The plot was a wonderful and unique, as well as a great moral of the story. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp, "Dumb and Dumber" or blood and guts. It's amazing spicy film shows some of the grim realities of life, combined with the kindness of the human heart, and just enough levity to keep it interesting. <br /> <br /> I would have preferred this film many "A" film speed I even saw a large number of high profits with office box. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film.
