I must say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I was bored and re-TV and found «Home Room», and it was about 5 min., but I got hooked. It was so interesting and moving. This shows what can happen in a person's life. I give him a 10, more if possible. Director / writer and the actors did an amazing job. I think teens should watch this film and learn from it. It was cool, drama, mystery, and much more. I cried for a few hours! I think that the director / writer should write more movies like this. I loved it! I did not even know about this movie, which is sad, because it was so good. I wish it could go to the movies for more people to see.
