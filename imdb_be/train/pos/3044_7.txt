For those who may not know that a film actor was like, what is the best example. This story is ridiculous, and does not really make any sense. He is full of cliched situations hackneyed lines, melodrama, comedy ... you name it! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan could do anything conclusive, and this film is not in any case is no exception. Everyone turns in a decent performance - Highway Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash Patil ... But it Megastar, who steals the show with his towering presence. Without him, the film would not be a starter ... The history of the separation / mistaken identity / misunderstanding / love / hate relationship / loyalty / good vs. evil - all, in fact! Amitabh is a brilliant performance on all counts, otherwise silly movie! And did I mention that it's funny funny?
