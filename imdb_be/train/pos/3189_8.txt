This is one of the best ensemble comedy / musical film «B» that I have seen (and since I am now in my 40s, and only seeing it now, I'm no expert, but I saw all the well-known movies there). If you have a ton of actors get their advantage in a matter of minutes, while, as a rule, interfere with musical comedy bits, and often comedic music interrupted the flow. Call me crazy in this frame of mind, but when I saw it on TCM Europe, I laugh with pleasure! So who brought laughter for me? Without a doubt, Mischa Auer brought me tremendous gut-busting laughs, he even steals the end, it was great! Speaking of which, I think, why this film works because although L & H are points of sale (and why I sat down to watch it (and their Hal Roach), I like them at the beginning of Hal Roach things), it holds they, at least, and is right on the adult fare (by the standards of the 1930s, and not too far from modern standards, if you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also great to watch, I'll admit that I only know it from the W O cart, and I loved it there and I laughed it is a waiter in a little show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" £ 30 films that really turns me (something tells me that she was irascible in real life); and musical numbers are a real professional production (Busby Berkley'ish) quality that blew me away from what I was used to in this genre. I could go on and on, but rest assured, I really enjoyed this movie. 8 out of 10 I saw it on TCM Europe and record it to watch again with my wife to the United States TCM. Good stuff!
