We looked at the VCR and found it fascinating. nothing about the true history, not knowing, I thought, "Oh, no, P.Brosnan as an Indian (" red "Indian in the film), which is a bad choice," until I discovered the truth about the Great Gray Owl The film does a good job. demonstrating the dignity of indigenous peoples and undermine the racist myths about them. and Annie Galipeau, WOW, what a beauty, and very convincing as Indian (I think that it is a French-Canadian, she is sure to return all too familiar voice of) . Although, detached, grunting style Brosnan, in the end, it comes time convincing as hot, dedicated people. The plot is weak in demostrating its transformation from hunter coservationist animals. A good movie, highly recommended.
