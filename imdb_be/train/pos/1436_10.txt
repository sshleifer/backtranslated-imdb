Having worked in the heart of Manhattan, and often ate her lunch in the summer days in the park at City Hall, I would like to see the mayor comes and goes. It was great to be able to walk out the door of City Hall and see how it looked in the foyer and through out the entire building. Al Pacino (Mayor John Papas), "Gigli," "03, gave an excellent performance through out the whole picture, and especially when he gave a speech at the American Church of Africa for a little boy who was killed. John Cusack (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun ), «Runaway Jury», «03, was a devoted servant of the mayor, and worshiped him in everything he tried to do. Bridget Fonda (Marybeth Cogan), begins to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and gives a great supporting role. And last but not least, Aiello (Frank Anselmo), «Off Key», «01, played a mafia boss who had some very difficult decisions to make towards the end of the picture! Great film with more action and fantastic photos New York!
