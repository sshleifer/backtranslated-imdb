This is one of my favorites. It's so simple and sweet - definitely a chick flick romantic comedy. I enjoy a film full of good quotes, and this is it ... one of my favorites when Albert Einstein said Ed Walters, "Do you think I mean" and Ed says: "Now, what are the chances of that happening! "In my opinion, the film is incredible, when you can watch it again and again, and get the same amount of pleasure from it, and with it, you can too !! I liked Walter MS, method of drawing Einstein. I think that all characters fit together very well, and the story flows nicely. There are so many times that I find myself smiling s right along with the film and to quote my favorite line, as I look at it, I would recommend this film to anyone who has a heart and enjoys feeling serviceable romantic comedy now and then!
