I watched the "Speak Easy" one night and thought it was appropriate, but there is something missing. Maybe Buster Keaton strange words threw me, or difficulty supply line leading lady. The next day, I kept thinking about the movie, though. I could not get the song out of my head Durant, I tried to better remember the first scene of Thelma Todd, I thought that, perhaps, Keaton did make funny falls and physical comedy. The next night I was watching the scene from Thelma Todd, how insidious the choir, trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. Very funny scene, the actors are excellent, their faces, their eyes, their silly expression. So I looked at each stage of the show opened on Broadway. Buster in his blessed innocence fails every action. Again, I laughed out loud when evaluating clowning and acrobatics Keaton. So the next night I watched the entire movie again, and I see this time it was for the first time: This is a huge! This sensational! This Sublime! Three great comedians! Todd dancing! Durante sings! Keaton says! Of course, this is not poifect ... but there is a lot of laughter in this picture.
