I first saw Jake Zhillenhol in Jarhead (2005) some time ago, and since then I have seen every one of his films, which comes on my radar screen. Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and it even reminds Owen few), that just flows from the screen. I am sure that when he lands some meaty role, he will crack the Oscar one day ... <br /> <br /> This is not to denigrate the movie at all. <br /> <br /> It's a fine story, with very believable people (well, it is based on the early machinations of the author with the rocket), more shots ?? Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern are always on my list hours ?? with the appropriate compound of humor, pathos excitement ... and a large track with as many rock and roll oldies to receive feet touching. <br /> <br /> But this film had a special significance for me in 1957, I was the same age as Hikogo homers; like him, I looked at the stars of the night to watch Sputnik as it swept black; Homer, too, I experimented with rocket in my yard, and even use the same chemicals for fuel; and Homer, I also had the majority of my efforts to put an end to an explosive disaster! What was funny ... <br /> <br /> I have not reached my big (metaphorical and physical) height, though. But, it's what you learn when you see this film. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the basic family film, but it is dying breed these days, it seems. Take the time to see the children: you'll have a lot of good laughs.
