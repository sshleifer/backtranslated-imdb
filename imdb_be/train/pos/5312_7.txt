Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are a lovely couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma signs in this film. <br /> <br /> This is a typical "alternative" or indie film with a plot that shows a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important. <br /> <br /> Packer an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby to photograph exotic resident of the small town where he lives. Suddenly alternative artist draws attention to his work and hires him to expose his work in some important festivals and many others. <br /> <br /> But Pecker life changes dramatically as it is now, and the glory of the state seems to enrage the people, the city, which are the main source of inspiration in the beak. Even his sexy girlfriend is angry because now he does not pay "adequate" attention to it. <br /> <br /> Well, it's Indy film with an edge, but not for everyone. It may seem sad or pretentious for some people, but still, I think it worths the clock because he offers something "other" than the usual Hollywood standards <br /> <br /> in order to describe in a few words is a typical :. Christina Ricci and John Waters film. This is how. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that the "highly favored" line really annoying. Geez.
