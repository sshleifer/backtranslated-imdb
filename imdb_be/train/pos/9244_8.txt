If you only read the plot synopsis, the movie will sound fairly typical one from the 1930s. History might seem quite far-fetched, the subject of sentimental. The strength and beauty of this movie literally earthy performances cast.I display rarely seen Jean Harlow a range of feelings, rich and subtle nuances come up on her face. If you look at their faces during a wedding ceremony in the chapel, there is a clear sense of depth between the main characters. Raw emotions so sincerely portrayed so accurately. The final sequence is almost unbearably poignant when Clark Gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son, picks it up and says proudly, I could not remember that his own son, Mr. Gable was born, "My baby!" His posthumously. This is one of the most remarkable examples of Depression-era movie.
