I love this movie, "Spring and port wine. I was born in Leigh, place about 7 miles from Bolton, I moved to Bolton in 1965, when I was 20. My job was daily through the lever through Farnworth, sometimes by bicycle, but later on the car when I could afford it.The film returns all the memories of the working class neighbors, who were almost always broken, but who will always help you if they can. Fred Dibna was around the corner from St. Bromwich was may studio was. If you have not seen the film when first released, you can be forgiven for comparing it with the washing m, such as Coronation St, so I agree that this soap, but then it was called Â«Kitchen Sink Drama! Watch this movie for talented actors who soon became well known in the frequent roles on television, I look mainly for the shooting area and feel feel good factor of people to be poor, but happy!
