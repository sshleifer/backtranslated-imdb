This series could very well be the best Britcom ever, and that's saying a lot, considering the competition (Fawlty Towers, good neighbors, to name only two). <br /> <br /> What did the butterflies are so much higher, even for the best of the best, that it is not just illustrate the great, classic, stylish and smart comedy, but also to expand horizons, reflecting - smoothly, gently, and in every detail - a great social change that was taking place in the UK at the time. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of it all. Lifestyle reflected was remarkable in itself. It was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones. And all the characters wardrobe was far from guh seventy outfit have seen so far in North America at the time. Then there were the decoration, shop windows, cars. These people - even a slacker sons to their philosophical approach to life and caustic humor - were complex. They were examples of "new Europeans" who have come to have an impact on the life and style around the world in the coming decades (1980). <br /> <br /> Of course, the room was strange and fantastic. The idea that someone who is living the suburban dream can be so discontent and unrest was revolutionary, especially North Americans, for whom happiness is always defined as money and possessions (is confident that the situation was portrayed in American movies and television, but not with the intensity butterfly or movie Montenegro). And if the room was not quite surprising that the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme. A potential deal that is not really about sex or romance? Butterflies blinded a lot, but it must have left some people puzzled spanking foreheads ... while, anyway <br /> <br /> Butterflies appeared. - in many respects - prophetic. This is documented, ahead of its time - the postmodern melancholy pervasive way of life, the concept of emotional infidelity and separation of generations of men and dissatisfaction (if it detects different from the father-son relationship strained). It's too bad, this series has not been re-opened in a big way, and all participants were given a loan to build a large image a certain place and time, and anticipating all the smoothness and the longing that was to come.
