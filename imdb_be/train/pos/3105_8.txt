The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final for the super spy Jason Bourne, a man who wants to kill the people who made him into a killer. Bourne series is one of the highest consider trilogies critic (Ultimatum has 85/100 on Metacritic.com, which means that this state is a "universal recognition) and for good Reason-martial choreography is very good and deep history can It is very exciting. <br /> <br /> First, I strongly advise to watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, two fancy name prequel to the ultimatum. There can be three different film, but in fact they are a continuation of one another: no one leaves you stranded and confused, just as I do not care about will enjoy the action and battle scenes with an ultimatum, if you missed the first two, but then the story will certainly lead to some confusion <br .. /> <br /> If you were lucky enough to see the prequel to this film, you probably have the pleasure of watching Bourne demolish your enemy and look for people which is screwed into it from the Supremacy. Jason Bourne played by Matt very well? ? Damon. Damon does not do anything to deserve an Oscar Nod, bu t it work here well enough to keep it on their own. Bourne adventures take place in many different cities; the city is changing enough to keep the film become stale at times. Agency tracking Bourne uses every technological tool known to mankind, to find him. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the details of the characters, because they are extensions out of the first two films. However, it would not hurt the film to spell a few things for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher, who can pick up on every little hint of the plot development. The ultimatum was not damaged at all, when the story was a little more front <br /> <br /> It seems that most people agree that the ultimatum was the success of the film :. The film opened to $ 69 million, and - cash total is now up to $ 216 mil- currently still is very much a film that was in theaters with 3 is the best action movie I've seen, as well as live free or Die Hard in August. <br /> <br /> Good) Damon tough, but not spectacular, very smart movie Bad) history, as well as many other
