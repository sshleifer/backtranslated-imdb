This film has a rotten foundation of flexible morality, yet quirky sense of justice. So many of the ordinary Joes among us would like to "stick it to the MAN». «MAN», in this case represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, who tells Carl to her office. Later, Paul had 70 great Mr. Marshal club owner. And then there's Parole Officer Paul. There seems to be so much the question of the side stories of the last character. Observers note it as a weakness, but otherwise well designed underground game of ping-pong between the two protagonists, escalating tit-for-tat, until their lives will not change dramatically. They owe each agent «MAN». One or both may be fired, killed or imprisoned if they do not, as they say. <br /> <br /> There's a sense of relief at the end. Charles finally gets laid. Her boss is displaced for a moron. Mr. Owner of the club is a meaty mess in his own bathroom. They receive $ money $. And ... they do not have to worry about making statements in parole officer, because his moral weakness leads him to collect his wandering wife in the basement (or any other police officer found to arrest him). This is a critical subconscious trigger lock tumbler that wound us so tightly. It does not matter that someone can get Paul's file later to monitor its release; at the moment they are free! They can even get away with it! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> They stuck to the man!
