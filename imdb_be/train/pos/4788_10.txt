This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen I am the light for the entire film. Music and Cinematography held spell when little is happening on the screen. The slow pace was set driving mode (lawn Riding mower with a large trailer) and maintained on a background of sights and sounds, and slowly changing the lives of other characters. <br /> <br /> In the history actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76 years there has been no action; it was quite real, as if the actors were actually converted into characters. Sissy Spacek gave a touching work of several disabled daughter who was suffering a lot, but pulled ahead, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was cast perfectly, and it became perfectly Alvin Straight, stubborn, but he likes older man hiking in Iowa to visit his estranged brother Lyle, who suffered a stroke. Alvin learned a lot of wisdom in his life, and that seemed to bring out the best in people who met on the way. <br /> <br /> The film emphasizes the importance of family to this person, and I hope for all of us. I can not wait to see it again and again. Director David Lynch, this movie proves his directorial skills. Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; at 79, he was the oldest candidate ever for this award.
