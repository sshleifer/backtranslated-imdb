Tintin and I recently aired an episode P.O.V. BTS series. It is based on a recorded interview with Georges Remi AKA Herge, the creator of Tintin, from 1971, in which it discusses the different experiences of the publication of his popular character, first in the Catholic newspaper, in his own comic book series. Superb sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images in dreams Erzhi. I first encountered Tintin in the pages of a children's Digest in my local primary school library reading Secrets of the Unicorn. My mother later received a subscription to a CD, and I read all the treasures of the Red Rakkhe each month in 1978, I remember some books of Tintin comic books at the local bookstore after that, but for some reason I did not get any, perhaps because I was 12 and I thought I had outgrown them. I have released a book, which was written and portrayed J. Daniels, published in 1989, six years after Herg√©'s death. No longer read. This film also covers the personal life of the artist, as he left his first wife after his affair with a colourist in his service (he later married). Her name is Fanny and her interview here. If you like Tintin and his creator, this film is definitely worth seeing. Update 9/4 / 07-I've now read released. Tintin and Captain only regular characters that appear here and they are adapted to the anti-capitalist views with Mr. Daniels-Tintin portrayed as black Rouser with a chip on his shoulder, which nevertheless takes care of the captain, he was staying with. Captain there just trying to make ends meet with his wife and daughter that he loves dearly. They and other construction workers vow to strike after Staff dies of faulty equipment accident. All this is happening in England working-class Cockney accent intact. No such thing Herge approve, but interesting read nonetheless. Ah, yes, Snowy the dog will only appear in the upper left corner of the lid (which Tintin working on the police!) And on the dedication page.
