Much drama with all the areas covered EXCEPT screenlay, which has been too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes as a character Pitt interview the president or Pitt getting killed instead of just having it described us.Scenes as if they keep the audience awake. Cutting off several futile minutes could make more room for more heartpounding scenes as those.The passion for film kept from the all-time greatness, though Pitt see here makes the film so worth watching.Also, big fans of fising, early style of the 20th century and Montana exactly abaetstsa as well ........
