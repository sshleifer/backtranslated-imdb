It is actually a trilogy of three short stories of Somerset Maugham. Origin laid paper, which is about 15 minutes and very pleasant. After 17 years of Albert Foreman fired from his church work, because he can neither read nor write. So what does he do? Opens a tobacco shop, of course! <br /> <br /> Secondly, Mr. nerdy, which was actually a story I read in school 6 years ago and immediately forgotten, until I heard the familiar introduction. Another 15 minutes alone, but also very good. He has worked better than the film in the book for me, but maybe it's because I was only 14 the last time, Afterall. <br /> <br /> 3. one summed almost down. Almost an hour in length, it just pulls. It's not all that bad, but not as fast and quick as the last 2. I watched the first quarter of an hour it, then passed forward to the last quarter of an hour, and found that it still made sense, and I do not really I miss a thing! <br /> <br /> I generally give them 8, 9, and 6 out of 10 respectively.
