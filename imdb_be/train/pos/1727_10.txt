The wooden horse is very intelligent film about a very intelligent and successful escape plan developed by British prisoners of war during World War II. He superbly acted with a sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by acid languages ​​Leo Jenny. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) strange as the two heroes. Direction tight and fast-moving everywhere. Highly recommended.
