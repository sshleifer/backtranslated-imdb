The wooden horse was one of the first "big" escape stories from World War II, it tells the true story of Eric Williams and others in their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943 I really like this film, but I had to for this on VHS from Amazon in England and get it transferred from PAL in the US format, I read the book when I was in Hight school, after I saw the film in the early '60s on TV ridicule drama Peter and John are trying to flee Germany during the war, a more realistic than Treck from shoots depicted in the Great Escape. This film is a lost treasure that should be made more accessible to American audiences.
