This film really woke me up, it wakes up the main male character of this film boldly different from his dream life. <br /> <br /> This guy John (Ben Chaplin) is a mediocre bank teller safe life in a small provincial English town, yet stunningly gorgeous, wild girl on euthanasia of Nadia (Nicole Kidman), ordered by e-mail Russia is not part of his life to become his beloved wife, by Jones plan. However, a glitch - Nagy does not speak the language, John. Although calm and emotionless outside, John became so interested in the beautiful Nadi, instead of using the policy of full compliance with the service return, he buys her a dictionary to begin the process of communication. <br /> <br /> What happens later in the story really poor track John from his slumber decently paid secure feeling of a clerk in the decision-making decent thinking figures, giving the viewer the subconscious message "you would probably do the same." <br /> <br /> Kidman, Cassel and Kassovitz make a great team, the existing Russian and they are almost indistinguishable from the present, "almost" only in connection with a slight accent present in them Russian dialogues, but small enough to Russia hit home made of hard work to get the words sound right. Nicole Kidman once again proves his talent, playing a character quite different from previous roles, at least from the cultural background. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is very fast and exciting, and you certainly are not ready to quit smoking, watching the end credits appear when you feel more that you are in the center of the plot, and remained with the desire see continued as soon as it comes out. <br /> <br /> My advice is to go out and get this film right away and watch and enjoy. To summarize, it has an unusual story, great action, and ideas below the surface. Like the idea of ​​a "rude awakening" with artificial secure everyday life wheel the car society, whose life Fight Club members were so keen to get out and the machine from which the Pet Pink Floyd ( "Welcome to the machine!"). I bet that in the end, John was soon away from Sofia on the road to the unknown than not finding it at all. <br /> <br /> Thank you, writers, for a great story, and all the others for this great movie! Please make a sequel! And you can put it anywhere and call the place that you like, because the authenticity of this place has nothing to do with 99.9999 percent of potential viewers, I'm sure of it.
