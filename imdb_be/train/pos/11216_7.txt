The story is very unique.It is about the 2 pilots to save the Earth from alien beings, but they have to use a special rate, which makes everything around their age rapidly.The total number of pilots who deal with the loss of time, friends and teachers. <br /> <br /> ending was fantastic.It could start to finish for a total down a note and leave the real trail, but instead ended super happy Disney notes and annoys me very badly. <br /> <br /> decent animation to 89, but can not be compared with nowadays.I also I heard many complain of cheesiness to nudity.I actually been several decent.The nudity for the most part been justified, except for episode 2, where there was surplus. <br /> <br /> as a whole, it deserves a look, but the ending keeps it from classical.
