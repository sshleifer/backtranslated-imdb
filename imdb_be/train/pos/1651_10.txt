I watched this presentation on PBS in the United States, if it was originally aired in 1988 (?). Assuming that the miniseries was available on DVD, I bought the first edition of the three books in the last year. Since I was looking at a series of sites online movies. Today I found this site. I give up the search <br /> <br /> I would also like to buy the full. - 26 episodes - miniseries. Once your DVD-ROM drive, I would read every book, then watch episodes for this book. This is what I did with Karla trilogy le Carr√© and Texas Ranger trilogy McMurtry in <br /> <br /> Does anyone have any suggestions for great books or series of books that became very good miniseries -. Or a series of films - that are currently available on DVD?
