The old man, who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and lose your cat. He wanders through the woods witnessed the murder, but he saw the killing or he was going mad? Is it just getting old? The film is so great, because the viewer must make up their own minds about what is happening. There is very little dialogue in this movie, but it does not need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. You knew what was going on, and I liked it. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I liked the shots were from the forest in the late fall and winter. It was pretty, but the only thing I did not like was the kind old man in his underwear. He could have tied the robe a little tighter, but in addition, it was a pretty deep film.
