Brilliant on the action Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I've ever seen, and love scenes in the clothing store are unsurpassed. Corn on the face is a classic, as well as all in Blazing saddles. To take on lawyers too well. After the accused deserter, sell her boss, and dishonest lawyer Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently, "I am a lawyer," he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite of the late Larry Sanders Show, here is fantastic, like a mad millionaire who wants to destroy the ghetto. His character is more evil than usual. The hospital scene, and the scene where homeless people to invade the site wear, all-time classics. Look at the scene of the legs and two large diggers fight (one edge). This movie gets better every time I see him (which is quite often).
