Cinderella is one of the greatest Disney movie, one of those movies that I think you appreciate more than the older you get. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic tale. I believe that the film was the biggest of his films at the time of its release. Characters become more measured than in the previous films, creating greater depth to evaluate the character more. Cinderella herself, in my opinion, one of the greatest Disney characters ever created. With kindness and shooting range of dry humor, it is very nice; However, this inspiration, it provides that makes it memorable. Like many people, it is an endless dreamer, and she keeps on her dream, never give up. Even in the most adverse situations, endure her dreams, and she will not allow anyone to take away from it. Her example should serve as a source of inspiration for all, and fostering never let go of your dreams.
