Well, it's been a long year, and I have to review the final film in 2004 Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call The River) took second place in the recent Festival of Metro Manila Film. As expected, it's not so good at the box office, as it was too pretentious for ordinary moviegoers, and especially since the time MMFF season where many families go to watch movies. <br /> <br /> It was very intriguing to see the film, which was not in Filipino or English play on the screen. I thought that Cesar Montana has done a good job, and as the star and director. His great vision and creativity really helped this film. He was also very effective as the leading stars and was able to express a wide range of emotions, which is required for the film. Also performing well was the young actress Rebecca Luster. She did a great job, which shows Bikay, younger sister Duroy. I hope that I would see it in many other film projects in the future, possibly venturing into other genres. I think the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her. <br /> <br /> Some of the images in a film camera were done very well. Decorations were made exciting, although I feel that if a little effort would have looked very different. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, I feel that the authors could have delved further into the life of the smaller characters in the film. Of course, I'm not going to rave about the history of the film.
