You use IMDb. <br /> <br /> you gave some hefty voice of some of your favorite movies. <br /> <br /> This is what you enjoy doing. <br /> <br /> And all this because of this. Fifty seconds. One world ends, another begins. <br /> <br /> As it can not be given ten? Interestingly, those who give it seven or eight ... really like the first film ever made better? For the record, the long, still opening shot of a beautiful sight, great news, is perfect for the situation. And the dog on the bike excellent contact. All this for fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The word genius is often abused. <br /> <br /> it's brilliant.
