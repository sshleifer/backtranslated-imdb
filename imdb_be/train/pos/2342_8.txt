I watched the Pie-Lette last night, and the word that comes to mind is the "original". This word is not used a lot on television, as they all tend to copy any other network is doing, and you end up with seven nights of criminal show, unfunny comedies and reality shit. <br /> <br /> The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those who are not familiar with the British «Carry On ...» series or those who did not listen to the Harry Potter books, may not be familiar with Dale. I'm not sure whether to add his presence as a narrator or distracting. I have to tune in to more, but it really gives the show "Harry Potter" atmosphere. Maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Pace (Infamous, White Contessa) has nothing. He never explains where he got it, but it can bring someone from the dead for a minute. He teams from Chi McBride ( «Boston Public," Roll Bounce) to solve the murder of using this talent. All good and funny, until he comes across his childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! The dream begins, Timeline) and things are really complicated. It can not send it back, and he can never touch her. Boy, would that make a relationship difficult. <br /> <br /> I'm going to set up, to see where this series comes in the hope that it will continue to entertain.
