One of my favorite "home" movies. I do not know if people are in our country, who has not seen this movie! It's funny and sad at some point ... I do not know how people around the world (who had the opportunity to watch it) to accept this film, because you have to know some moments in our history and the character of the Serbian Serbs in the first half of the 20th century, to be able to figure it out! But, as I see it, there is someone from Canada, who had been watching him ... and he liked it. <br /> <br /> I think I'm going to try to put all the good quotes from the film on the site, but the first to learn how to do it ... <br /> <br /> Cheers.
