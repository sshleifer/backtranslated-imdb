First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take the most of his films you will see that the symbols are times when they are the same. His character in the film far beyond each one so far ... and counting. The story begins in the (not so far) future, where a person is sent back in time to find the source of the virus that has gripped most of humanity from the earth. History, it seems, are going to SF, but I think it's closer to the drama of the slow rhythm of the story. About it. Movies are usually faster and slower at certain points and to develop more before the end than at the beginning, but as you see this film, you'll know about it the constant rhythm of history and revealed the facts, do not speed up or slow down. St. same speed, the current soft and pretty good. But this does not mean that the end of practice to pull the nerves, cause it is pretty good. As for the direction goes, it's the prefect. Films as such are easily destroyed due to bad directing, but this was much better. Thus, if you are getting ready to watch a movie Sci-Fi, or at least something to do, you'll miss it. B there should be more movies like this.
