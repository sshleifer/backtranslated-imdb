It's been a while since I watched this movie and TV series, but now I am refreshing my memory! It was a very funny film based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott have fun together. After all, and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in General Lee. If Boss Hogg forces Dukes their farms, Bo and Luke to sneak around the local construction site Hogg and found samples of coal. Soon they realize that Boss Hogg is going to strip-mine Hazzard County, when the Dukes could not stop him with the help of his beautiful cousin Daisy. Has only two problems with the film that Burt Reynolds was not right on the part of Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was too serious. Also, I highly recommend the Dukes of Hazzard !!!
