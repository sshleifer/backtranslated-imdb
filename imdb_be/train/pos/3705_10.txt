I do not understand the low 5.7 rating for this film. It is a pleasure for those who love strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics. Tons resembles Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, up to the area (Savannah). Acting is strong, and I was struck by the credibility of the southern accent of Kenneth Branagh. Famke Janssen great Robert Duvall is effective in a small part, and Davidtz is the BOMB. Most full nude scene from it, too. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty standard, but carried out effectively.
