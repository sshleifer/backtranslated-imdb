This production of Oliver expertly show layers of evil in the human soul. What makes the plot wonderful brilliantly bright invisible nature, that pierces the darkness, he is an innocent boy through a serious security risk in the hands of his own relatives. Yes, although Oliver goes through the valley of the shadow of death, he is not afraid of evil. The rod and the staff is there to comfort him. In the end, he was saved from the scum of humanity. At the bottom of Fezhin, the most evil of the party. Fezhin contemplates repenting of his way not once, but twice, but declining, because he does not want to pay the price. Fezhin worse than Bill Sykes, because it raises a few pickpockets who become killers. In the middle of Oliver. His innocence is clean, but under investigation as well. Better Nancy. Lacking in court, it ignores the violent Bill Sykes with her deep need for love. However, unlike Fezhin, at the likely cost of his own life, it is to repent of their sins, keeping from Bill Oliver. All is not as it seems. In my opinion, it is the quality that makes art worth - unpredictability. I would give this film "10", but his "70s because television soundtrack and atmosphere were distracting. Overall, a great parable and thoroughly relevant stories for all audiences.
