When I was a child, 8, I always watched movies and television, that I should not have, and it was one of them. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it should be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life, acting fine, they do not do comedy like this Anymore these days (movies, which is really funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or vomit induces some type of body fluid, in these backward films Apatow starring unfunny non-actors Seth Rogen, vomiting). <br /> <br /> This is a classic film with actors who can actually act, and they deserve all the awards.
