Daniel Day-Lewis Christy Brown was the victim of cerebral palsy, which uses the "My Left Foot" to write and draw in this incredible 1989 film. The film also stars Brenda Fricker as a mother Christi, Ray McAnally, Fiona Shaw and Hugh OKonor. Their brilliant performances, a great script and a great direction of Jim Sheridan helps paint a vivid portrait of Christy Brown, an artist and writer who died in 1981 at the age of 49 <br /> <br /> Brown was born in a lower middle class Catholic family, where his mother was constantly pregnant (22 children in total, 13 of which have survived). His father thought Christy mentally retarded and physically handicapped, but he would not let his son go into the house. Children in the family will say goodbye to him every day as they went to school, and then his mother would feed him and talk to him. <br /> <br /> In Fricker film conveys a sense of a woman who, although surrounded by a huge family, you need someone to talk to. Christy entirely rude. Eventually found a stroller for him to go to, and the neighborhood kids, all of which are known to him since he was a child, to include it in all of their activities. The only part of the body, which works very well, his left leg, and when the kids find out how well it kicks off, they put him in the game of football for just this purpose. One of the most beautiful parts of the film is a relaxed way in which other children relate to it. <br /> <br /> There are many powerful scenes, but none as powerful as write Christy "Mother" on the floor, holding a piece of chalk between his legs. "He's a Brown," his father says, lifting his shoulders and carries it to the pub. Walk into a pub, he declares, "My son is a genius." Everything changes when Christy gets older, because he has the desire and the emotions of the young boy. He develops the grinding, is rejected and goes more into himself, turning to painting. In the end, he goes to therapy to the nearest clinic and works with the therapist, Eileen (Fiona Shaw) at home. He falls in love with her. When he learns that she's engaged, he was almost going crazy. But he survives to live, drawing, writing (three books in total) and to love again. <br /> <br /> Because it's a movie, some things had to be omitted and symbols together as needed. Brown was not actually diagnosed with cerebral palsy for some time, which was left out of the film. The therapist Eileen is actually a combination of three important figures in the therapeutic Christie life, and although we know that his mother said that he had a good mind, in fact, it is very difficult to work with Kristen when he was a child, teaching its alphabet, etc. . Also, before Mary, Christie had a relationship with a woman to whom he has devoted 12 years of "My Left Foot." And the typical Hollywood ending, nine years before his death, where the neglect of his wife may be a factor, did not finish the story. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, a biopic of Christy Brown is incredibly powerful, all the more so because of two performances: as a young Hugh OKonor Christie and Daniel Day-Lewis as an adult Christy. OKonor expression in the face and the way he pulls his distorted body is to turn out. One is low for him, and with a broken heart, at the same time <br /> <br /> And what about Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the greatest actors in the world. - it brings Christy fully to life, fully fleshed out with an intelligent man capable of abuse, angry, slides, drunk, energetic, naughty, funny and loves. Deserved Oscar win in the same year that Tom Cruise was nominated for "Born on the Fourth of July". I remember someone writing a letter to the editor somewhere that Cruz was so sensational that it was not so with the Academy? Well, nothing to change. Never mind. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker's amazing how mother Christie, who never ceases to believe in him and what he can do and who keeps her family and her husband together in difficult times. The cool thing about the performance Fricker is that the support, love and hard work seems to come naturally to her mother. Character never would have considered herself a heroine or someone doing something out of the ordinary. Fricker shows us religious, but not a fanatic woman who thinks that her duty on earth to be a good wife and mother. And no matter what, even if her husband from work, throwing her daughter out of the house for being pregnant, all she does not control. It saves money on a wheelchair Christie, she gets a photo of his daughter and the baby, she begins to build a room for Christy in the back of the house. All parts of the day. The performance is worthy of Oscar she received. <br /> <br /> Life Brown was more complicated than it is inspirational film, but it's an amazing achievement all the participants and a must-see.
