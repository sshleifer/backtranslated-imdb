David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, pretty good) is a lawyer more adept at handling corporate taxation (.. and suffers from a strange dream that bothered him to see these native people, shrouded in darkness), which is designed to take the case against a group of indigenous people accused of killing one of his own name Billy..we see that he is trying to steal the stones from the ritual of painting them and was killed when the leader of the indigenous tribe named Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula) uses a "bone death" to stop his heart . At the same time, revolving around David, whimsical weather effect of Sydney, such as the rain poured contaminated dirt and rock size hail during a bright blue sky (without clouds sights, such as the one that gets to school in central Australia) not to mention, and "deformed" rainbow, which splits (!) in the group. David pursues the matter, he believes that he is much closer to the amazing events taking place than he had realized. A native named Chris (David Gulpilil) appears to him in a dream keeps blood stone, and he believes that this person is one of those he will submit to the court! He believes that it is quite possible, after some strange encounters with Charlie and talking with Chris, he very well may be associated with a spirit named Mulkurul and that his dream of actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to come. <br /> <br /> absorbing apocalyptic drama is the story builds systematically and completely original and unpredictable. From Peter the Weir, in charge, the film is visually arresting, as we see these very compelling images possible death to the civilization, but the most compelling angle of the film, of course, the journey of David find this monumental truth that plagues him as he asks Charlie and Chris countless first to help their people out of crimes they did not commit, and ultimately to find out what he should do nothing catastrophic, that occur or may occur later.
