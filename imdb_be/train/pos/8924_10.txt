This film is excellent. What sets it apart from other '50s sci-fi is the fact that the alien does not have the capacity nor the face, eyes, anything, but he can not be killed. I especially like the idea that this film does not take place within a few days, this happens in one night, which lasts for allegedly passing midnight.It too scared that when a drop falls on you, you can not get it. you're stuck in it, because it dissolves your flesh, and slowly eats your body. My all time favorite '50s sci-fi movie, and what is sometimes considered a quintessential one. I can understand why it took off Steve McQueen to fame. All this and catchy song! How can you go wrong?
