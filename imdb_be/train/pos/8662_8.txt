I enjoyed it very much. In fact, when I see him again (and I plan to) I just love it. I echo other reviewers say that this film really grows on you as you watch. It begins a kind of slow, but the path is very natural in the covers and strives for it. You just get into it. <br /> <br /> I really liked the atmosphere in the Summery film and thought the film was very moving as a whole. The symbols have a strong element of realism and film very slowly and carefully weave a spell as you participate in various interactions between them, and want to know how it will eventually succeed, and what are the ways the characters will choose to take. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised that there are fewer than a dozen comments on this issue, there is a vague television films that have more comments, rich in love. <br /> <br /> One thing I will say that I missed the ending, which is driving me crazy, and I have to watch it again to see that. This is a film that may not be for everyone, but I feel strongly underestimated (even some of my movie buff purists friends who have seen almost every film, there have not seen it), and it does not even seem to be a big part of the board of the 'ads, but I liked it a lot, and all those who love family drama that the heat at the scenery, atmosphere and slow sluggish pace should probably take a look at it. Particularly worthy of note that this is the case in South Carolina, as well as for those who (like me) who love the south, and movies that take place there, it's a gem. I'll add my voice to the woefully few comments and recommend this little-known film.
