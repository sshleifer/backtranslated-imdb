This film really does not surprise me, as such, it just got better and better. I thought, "wrote Paul Reaser, no ... Well, we'll see how he does it ...?" Then I saw Peter Falk was in it. I appreciate Colombo. And although I've never been a big fan of the show, I always liked to watch Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> In the performances of Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They play each other so well that I was almost giddy with pleasure! ... And I do not even drink! <br /> <br /> This film was so well done that I would get right on the phone Paul and let him know how much I loved it! but I could not find his number. It must be unlisted or something. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that I had no idea it was going to be about and who it or anything. He just came in and I thought, "Oh, why did not Let's see if I do not like - I do not see it ..." ... and I'll end up just like him?.!
