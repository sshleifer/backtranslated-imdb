I can not believe that I just now saw this film - I think maybe I thought it was another film about slaves being mistreated, and I avoided Roots for the same reason - the same as I to this time to see Schindler's list - I do not want to be "entertained" the pain of other people, no matter how real or informative it should be. <br /> <br /> So I think the main thing that I noticed about The Color Purple was the fact that he was not about black people mistreatment by whites. Black people were quite capable of raping their daughters - or gives them to be treated as slaves of their "husbands". It was painful to watch, but redeemed himself in the end, and the effect was phenomenal! I could not believe that the nature of frames played at the age of 35! And I love Whoopie to begin with - it was amazing. I'm so glad that I felt lousy yesterday afternoon and Showtime was launched purple.
