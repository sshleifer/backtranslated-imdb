Cutting to the chase: This is one of the most amazing, the most intense film I've seen in a long time. The first film in years, which left me quite shocked. I could barely feel my way out of the theater, I was so impressed. <br /> <br /> I looked at the screen for fifteen minutes, trying to find some way to describe the effect of the film, and just can not. Selecting any one aspect of it - in a documentary style format video diary, unwavering eventful image, character strength - just seems to simplify it all. Some may find it ludicrous that any killer could be described as normal. But not all killer raving lunatics foaming at the mouth. Many of them are fairly regular, humble people. They just wired differently. <br /> <br /> And this is perhaps the most frightening thought of all.
