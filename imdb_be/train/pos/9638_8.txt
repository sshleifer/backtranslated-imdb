This film was a passage in the courage of one gay, and he has to deal with everything. His mother is depressed, his younger sister in pain, his older sister a few tricks. Look good relationship with her boyfriend / exhooker and he leaves his family to try living with that first boyfriend. Unfortunately, the new guy screw around on him and says that it does not really mean anything. Our young gay man goes bonkers and ends in the Looney bin and eventually goes away, dumping her new lover and start over. We stayed with him, starting back and watching, not participating in happiness. So, perhaps, it will go better in the future for him. The ending was kind of boring, but the whole movie was quite real, and so I let it slide to the real end of the meeting with the highest rating.
