I loved this film and also the audience that I saw him in Los Angeles. After the film, a lot of people crying, saying how much the film hitting them. I can understand why he has been such a huge success in his home country, Sweden. The film is masterfully directed and each character is brilliantly drawn, so that in the end, you know exactly these people and take care of them. The music is very natural and the main song in the film is quite heartbreaking but inspiring. Definitely I recommend this movie for all to see - even people who usually do not go to subtitled films. Definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for the film reflected the deep without claims in the small town community with ordinary people. This is a film that brings us together in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. MUST SEE!
