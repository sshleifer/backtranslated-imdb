"The Domino" was widely condemned on this site it possessed style editing and "sickening" pictures. It detractors cite its surface and criticize his deployment of "style over substance" I could not disagree more. I believe that the «Domino» is the absolute height set career Tony Scott. <br /> <br /> After the creation of the dominant Hollywood style of the film during the late eighties and early nineties Tony Scott moved progressively closer to a subjective film style. Already in the «Crimson Tide» Scott used his stylistic flair to reflect the inner world of its characters- and claustrophobic drama inherent conflict aboard a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses in conjunction with dutched angle framing. It was then brought to the "Enemy of the State" and "Spy Game," which visually represents the worlds of espionage and surveillance, respectively. <br /> <br /> «Man On Fire» was an extreme departure, a step in the more colorful expressionist aesthetic. Where Scott used the outdated hand cranked cameras and flash-frames to express the explosive anger of his character. Although it is not entirely successful, he presented the methods that had to find its full expression in the "Domino» <br /> <br /> couched in the frame of the device interrogation FBI "Domino" shows the life of the infamous mercenary through it narrated scattered fragments of memory. She grabs the memories we all DO- fragments, flashes and short passages. How Domino relays her story orally Scott relays it visually illustrates not only the events it describes, but also the point of view that guides them. It has "traces of mescaline" in her system, but her individual vision anyway Unusual -Here's a woman, escaped a life of luxury for headhunting. <br /> <br /> This is when Domino begins to associate the events that lead to her captivity that Scott really lets rip. Together with cinematographer Dan Mindelo and composer Harry Gregson-Williams Scott Orchestra postmodern painting of modern Americana. Gradually, we start to understand that uncommon, although it may be no more than Domino incoherent than "90210" of the culture she rejected. As she sneaks through this cultural mélange Scott makes his audience more aware of the innocence of which he kills by unprivileged child, introducing the story. In the end, Scott draws their rescue as the only salvation we have on this surreal trip. <br /> <br /> In order to criticize the film for being too stylized looks like Picasso or Pollock criticized for not presenting what is known to man. Like any big picture sense in «Domino» is on the surface and the surface of all. <br /> <br /> I do not in any way connected with Scott Free, but it has always been and will continue to be a huge fan of the work of Tony Scott
