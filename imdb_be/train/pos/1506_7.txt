Such films as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Suspiria" and "Halloween" changed the look of horror forever, was more gothic and much less turbulent era in the genre. Films such as horror series Hammer and "Rosemary's Baby" was what terrified and thrilled audiences during the 60s and early 70s. I can not tell you how many times I shot this film as a child, but I did it because there was something about it. I do not want to limit yourself to the chopper and zombie films 70s and 80s and films like these products from well-known, but, unfortunately, long gone Amicus film company had a good start <br /> <br /> Pros .: Grandiose , terrible music score. Strong performances from the stellar cast. Brilliant cinematography. A lot of good old-fashioned thrills and chills, especially in the first and the last vignette. Some memorable moments and images. Moving at a slow, but the pace of change. The house is a terrible, oppressive housing. Great production design and set decoration, which give the film a real sense of the old gothic horror. More depends on the mood and bloodless chills than a mountain, and it is gratuitous naked thrills <br /> <br /> Cons :. Some questions pacemaker in the first half. In addition to "cloak" rest of the story, they feel that they have been made before. Cliches abound. The second story, «Waxworks» has an excellent effect and it's moments, but is the weakest of the four in terms of panic and uncertainty. Low budget does show many times <br /> <br /> Final thoughts :. After watching this movie for the first time in many years, I can understand why I rented it so often. This is not a masterpiece any means, but it is a good example of when horror movies were made with style and class. Watch this with the lights <br /> <br /> My Rating: 3.5. / 5
