Although he had the misfortune to get into the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film) as well as we are tired of such things as Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, this movie deserves an audience. An inside look at the statement «The Scottish Play», as actors called "Macbeth" at getting it to avoid the curse, it's accurate, efficient and stylish treatment betrayal that befalls the troupe. With a surprisingly evocative account, and look and sound much better than a small budget would assume that it is a quiet gem, entirely of world-class, but quite satisfactory.
