This reunion, team, and a great episode of Justice. From fluctuations resolution, Clark took an important step by the unfortunate teenager who was afraid of fate controlled on Superman, which, as the Green Arrow, put aside his emotions on his few close, ready to save the entire planet. This is not just an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship; it is also about deciding what is more important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the series to end, but I hope that the following episodes will strictly follow what justice shows no "rewind" jolts and put a good end here Smallville --- Superman and a great start. <br /> <br /> In this episode, however, we should have seen a greater contrast between Lex and the Group. Nine stars have to give him credit enough.
