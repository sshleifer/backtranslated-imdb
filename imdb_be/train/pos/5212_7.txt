Star Rating: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night Monday Morning <br /> <br /> A particularly bad actor, having received from him (now fading ) looks rather than any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always been an interesting position in the American Hollywood, always a sure bet in the starring role, which still holds a significant presence today. But now he seems to have settled back in these kind of roles direct to DVD / Limited Edition, and as such, may be, seems to be more settled in his fort at the moment. <br /> <br /> He has to rely on some sort of karma thing here is tempered, cynical case of a service graph Babbage, one of these employees are assigned several hundred sex offenders in one of the areas of the US, who together with his new protégé Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) must take his last case, venturing into the kidnapping of a young woman trying to forgive himself for the case that not many centuries ago. <br /> <br /> This is a definite dip in the dark side of humanity, treading on the material, it is definitely not for the faint of heart or those looking for a light scan. And as such, it is quite strong, unique film, is adamant it is not limited to straight to DVD budget. The only thing that really pulls it back is used excessively nervous, quick camera cut sequences used in the more dramatic moments, which look a little corny in some time. But it's still some of solidest stuff I saw Gil, inevitably becomes darker and over the edge, as it happens. ***
