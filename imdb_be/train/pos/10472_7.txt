Anyone who loves music in Rheostatics' going to enjoy this film. I have some minor complaints, mostly about pacing and cast some of the actors (not Morita), who is not really convincing in his role, but I do not have time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn all those who have seen the movie or plans to watch this movie, as represented by CBC television in Canada: a theory that Aryans are the CBC, as a version of the Reader's Digest WHALE MUSIC --- not to look. He cuts out entire scenes and plots (if you can it is) from the film. CBC, which represents the majority of films untouched, took half of bowel WHALE MUSIC. I do not know why. It's terrible what they did for the film. Rent a video or watch it in the cinema, but do not look on CBC television.
