Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a film about a young prince (Simon), which is driven from his kingdom because of his father (the king) has been killed on a cliche "evil counselor." This film is about the adventures of Simon. Special effects, plot, action, and everything about this film BAD. Nevertheless, it is so bad that it's funny. You will continue to watch this movie just because it is so bad that it's funny, and, like other reviewers have said the film, it's so bad it's good.
