This film draws you in and gets you hooked to keep your eyes on the screen. Writer / director is brilliant with narratives and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives, which all add to the fascinating keep it on you. Insomniac's Nightmare is a unique and refreshingly different from any other film that you have seen. Is this a dream or reality? This indie you will discuss the ups and downs, he takes over the conscious and subconscious. He has a sense of the supernatural, with its dark interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan has indeed become insomniac. He's a wonderful actor, which is not hard on the eyes, too! He really poured his whole being in this role. From the plot to the road to shoot makes indie is one of my favorites. I highly recommend it and looking forward to see more from this innovative, creative writer / director / cinematographer !!!
