Well, there are many ways to ruin a political thriller. As a rule, they are derivatives or too ambitious, they often have a plot that is completely paranoid and unbelievable. But City Hall is not doing none of the above. The plot is artfully created, the story believable. As for the characters to go, I would say that this film is a solid average. None of the character does not seem absurd and Al Pacino is brilliant, as always. His portrayal of the charismatic mayor of New York is excellent and proves once again that Al Pacino belongs to the absolute top American actors at the moment.
