I too have just returned from an extended screening Redeye, and I must say that it was not so much fun in the cinema for a long time. Wes Craven is at its best ever. He brings us a wonderful late summer thriller I so desperately thirsty. It's a thriller about year..no doubt. <br /> <br /> All of the actors and the strange effect is realistic and fun. F / X were great. He constantly built suspense. I was on the edge of my seat most of the film. It's been a while since I heard the audience cheer and clap and excited at the theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for thrills, action and a good story this summer, REDEYE delivers. Go it!
