Better than the typical made for television film, an invitation to hell are blessed with a great cast (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy previously Murphy Brown, Joe Regalbuto, salts Moon-Frye) and update the high concept to the familiar Faustian plot, Urich cute as always and Lucci especially sampling and fiendishly over the mother of all roles Femme Fatale. Kind of a hybrid version of the Stepford wives, and they live, the film performs early in his apocalyptic vision Miltonesque and horror fans, probably does not have many complaints until sentimental sentimentality denoument. 7/10
