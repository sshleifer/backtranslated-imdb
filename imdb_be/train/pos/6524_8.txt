<br /> <br /> If you are at all interested in pirates, pirate movies, New Orleans / early American history of the 19th century, or Yul Brynner, watch this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it. Do not be intimidated by different dim reviews. My reaction to this was the fact that it's fun, well acted (for the most part), has some very witty dialogue, and he does an excellent job drawing charm, attractiveness and charm of the legendary privateer Jean Lafitte. Although not all of the events in the film historically accurate (you can show me any historical film that succeeds in that?), I feel that the film is accurate in his interpretation of the role played in the history of Lafitte in New Orleans, and the love-hate attitude between the "respectable" citizens of New Orleans, and this bandit, who was one of the favorite sons of the city. Do not worry about the fact that the film did not do, but look at what it is doing, that is, for its study of one of New Orleans, and the most intriguing historical figures of America.
