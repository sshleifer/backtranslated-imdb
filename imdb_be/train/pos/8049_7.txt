In general I would say that I liked the movie. Some of the action scenes are really good. Especially combating Leung Ka-Yan. One thing that really bothered me was the fact that they used to play Asian black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During the fight scene, you can see one of the men on the floor laughing. Otherwise, the struggle summit copy of Bruce Lee moves perfectly. 5 out of 10 stars.
