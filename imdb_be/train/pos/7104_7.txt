Los debutantes is the story of two orphaned brothers who moved to Santiago from the south after their mother's death. Confident and Silvio Streetwise, older brother, gets a job working for the owner of a sleazy club Strip after the naive Viktor there his 17 th birthday. <br /> <br /> As Silvio flourishes under the leadership of their chief, the two brothers are linked with sexual and manipulative mistress owner Grass. Unfold the film, the characters redefine how we begin to see the subtle and obvious ways that each of them handles the next. <br /> <br /> The film is well made, with a good movie and walk fast. It is also very sexy, with lots of nudity and some pretty explicit sexual scenes. He now uses a popular method of layering of different scenes from different angles, with a chronological sequence. Many people hate the movies like this, because they do not understand what is happening - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and many other remarkable films to use this device. The story itself is really nothing new, there are elements of Body Heat, Pulp Fiction, and many other good film noir. <br /> <br /> As the different layers are revealed, our understanding of the characters and their motivation to develop. Although the plot may be a little clich√©, it is also smart and interesting. <br /> <br /> I would say it's a nice movie worth watching, but nothing memorable. I have not seen a lot of movies with Chile, and it is always interesting to see the film noir from other countries. In addition, rent it out, if it is available, but do not lose any sleep if it is not.
