Six degrees made me hooked. I was looking forward to his arrival, and was totally disappointed when the man in the trees to replace that time spot. I thought that it was only on hiatus and will return at the beginning of 2007, what happened? All my friends have been very surprised, it was over. We could relate to the characters who had real problems. We talked about each episode and had our favorite characters. There was nobody on the show I did not like, and he felt that acting was superb. I Alway seeing how the program should be taped in the cities where you can define the local area. For example, I would like to challenge the cancellation of the show, and to ask you to bring it back and give it another chance. Give him a good amount of time, do not move him from that day on the same day, and advertise it, so that people will know what's next.
