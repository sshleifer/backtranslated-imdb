I like my Ronald Colman dashing and debonair, the guy that you see in movies, as if I was a King and Kismet. I love him as the epitome of civilization, as well as in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. Thoughtful Coleman is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> But the double life, precisely because part of it, as an actor Anthony John is so unusual for him, Coleman has been recognized with a best actor Oscar for 1947 was his most famous piece. <br /> <br /> Coleman is an actor who really take the method seriously enough. He just finished a successful run in the comedy of manners, and it is completely cheerful guy. For a change of pace now that the game has finished its Broadway run, Coleman brings a revival of Othello in New York. On the quality of the other part, as you can get. <br /> <br /> His leading lady in both his ex-wife is Jose who loved him dearly, but he can not take his mood swings when he was at work. Coleman loves her dearly, as well, and wants her back. But he sent for a mental disorder when he begins to confuse yourself jealous Moor Othello and Jose with its role of Desdemona. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Shelley Winters as poor waitress who picks depressed Coleman receives its path insanity, and it winds Desdemona like poor in performance. He was killed in the same way, and now the question for the murder of a police officer Joe Sawyer. <br /> <br /> Coleman performance is so good that one pretends surprise is an occupational hazard with the actors? I shudder to think so, were there any unsolved murders in or around Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles' Othello then they tried. <br /> <br /> I could never buy that story because of that, but I certainly applaud Ronald Colman and what he did with the part. I'm sure there was a tinge of regret in his Oscar win, though, because one of the other candidates was his good friend William Powell to life with the Father. Other in running this year are Gregory Peck for the gentlemen's agreement, John Garfield for body and soul, and Michael Redgrave for Mourning becomes Electra. <br /> <br /> Coleman gets able support from the rest of the cast, including Edmond O Â»O'Brien, which manifests itself in an unwanted part of cash in a jealous fantasies Solman. However, you will not find any equivalent in Iago double life, no one pushing jealousy, it's all in his own mind. <br /> <br /> And that one of the most cultured and civilized minds of the last century.
