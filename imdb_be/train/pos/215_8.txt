The word "classic" is thrown around too loosely nowadays, but this film is well deserving of all appeals. The combination of Neil Simon, Matthau (perhaps the best in the world of living comic actor), and the late George Burns to make a comic masterpiece. It is interesting to consider the fact that the film would be as if not death prevented Jack Benny played the role of George Burns as planned. As it is, the reunion scene Matthau apartment is likely to be surpassed as the sidesplitter not. Definitely one of my desert island films. <br /> <br /> «Enter !!!!!!!!!»
