I really like this film, because in Australia, Chinese movies, they never show in prime time. I must say that this is one of the best films ever serious that make the difference between people in Hong Kong and mainland China. It really shows that there is discomfort between them, but it can only get better as HK learn Mandarin. He also showed me how China's indie rock scene exists, and that the Chinese know how to strum the guitar and get a house funking! Who said that China is not ready to rock music? Daniel B is absolutely gorgeous, with its clean and clear voice, honest and full of action chick magnet. I recommend this movie for those who do not know much about the Asians, to clear himself from the typical Western stereotypes, and people who just like Chinese / Asian cinema, like me. Check it out!
