"8 Simple Rules ... for exploring my daughter Teenage," my opinion is an absolute classic of ABC! I'm not sure that I have not seen every episode, but I still liked it. It's hard to say which was my favorite episode. Nevertheless, I think it was always funny when the accident occurred. I always laughed at this. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked the show better when John Ritter was the lead man. If you ask me, his sudden shift was very tragic. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing has always been very strong. In conclusion, I hope that some network brings it back in the air for fans of the show to see.
