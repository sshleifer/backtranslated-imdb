SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the end was a bit harsh. I would like to see the team, adapting to life on Earth after their return. I believe that the authors of this alleged problem of "front loading" some Voyager on the sequence of the Earth at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, this time the line has been eliminated, so it's all moot.) I did like how Zheynuey Admiral died for the Voyager crew. Fans, we get to have our cake and eat it, having Zheynuey how to make the ultimate sacrifice and move on. I admit that the scene Zheynuey and her senior government, having conversations were strange and so could easily have crossed the line into the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew (s) removed it.
