Summary: Zandana is a young woman who feels increasingly trapped in her marriage with Thierry. Thierry himself struggling with his father's death last year and lost. He immersed himself in the work, made up of his letters, and desperate Zandana missed attraction between them. In this part of Johnny's old friend Thierry, who were once exiled artists together. But John kept in the picture, and just working day to rent. He picks up the next day as it comes and goes tomorrow his fate. There is an instant attraction between raw Zandana and Johnny, and they come into the business. But Zandana struggles with her thirst to be necessary and its conscience and love for her husband. But none of them Zandana, not Johnny, not Thierry can not end the relationship between them to spin completely out of control <br /> <br /> Note :. It is installed as a thriller. But perhaps more thriller heart than a conventional thriller, where we are talking about life and death, and the threat of violence. Not that thriller heart can not take the fatal proportions, but the threat comes from a different angle. And it is not really until the second half in Zandana until the thriller, and even if the basis for it is laid in the first half, I can not describe the genre as a thriller later. Much more romantic drama than anything else, but with the major trends of other genres. Paced thriller there, but it also has more than a little low tide sensual erotic kind. Because that's what it's all about what makes the characters and thus the entire story. Desire. The need to have, and need to be. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is very good, certainly much better than the current (4.1) score anyway. It takes time, but it grows a good sense of the unknown, and it handles the erotic part of a very good taste. It is always an integral part of the story needed to be there to give a history of necessary weight, and I have never felt that it was a chance to show his bare chest or anything like that. But, unfortunately, the culmination of history comes long before the end, and the end feels pretty flat, even if of a kind view dramatic. <br /> <br /> Cast impressive, headed by well-known actors like Nicolas Cage and Judge Reinhold. But the show is almost entirely stolen by Eric Anderson. Beautiful and very skillfully playing the sometimes delicate feelings of desire, it is superior to both the cage and Reinhold sometimes goes overboard larva and become a bit rough. Her career after too thin for the talent she shows in Zandana, I can only hope that it was due to her own choices. In addition, two personal favorites appear in small roles, which give some additional benefits in the film, is Steve Buscemi and Pantoliano ~ d. <br /> <br /> If you are in the right frame of mind, this is a very good film, it can use the other end to get the credit it truly deserves. <br /> <br /> 7/10
