Although this series has only spent a season, he stayed with me for 20 years. It was far and above my favorite cartoon is constantly ever. I would give almost anything to have it on a DVD or any other format, I can get. If you find any means of seeing this series, I suggest you take advantage of. This series was the first (in my opinion), it was a truly coherent storyline that spanned several episodes. This got me to really care about the characters and what happened to them. Heck character goose really scared me sometimes. He was just strange at the time. In addition, the leader of the band reminds me a lot of combinations of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has any way to contact the creator / owner of the rights to the series and may cause them to put out on DVD, please, by all means do so !!!
