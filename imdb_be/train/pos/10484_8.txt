Each character is very responsive and, except for the first 20 minutes or so, the film is a non-stop vigor. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if it means a blind eye to some pretty illegal activities. <br /> <br /> Effective at the highest level. Blethyn is one of the best actresses in the UK, and here's why. It turns what might caricature very much alive and breathing people. She's a good woman, but she is not stupid. Craig Ferguson as kind as Matthew. He lost a slacker, but he is so pleasant that it does not matter.
