If my current college-age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A & E 8-9 every morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we would not miss a minute of Jane Eyre, and our children were late for preschool every morning during the week. Good choice. <br /> <br /> I had forgotten how much I love this film, not yet got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very beautiful, but still perfect as Rochester. Dark, rocky face, overbearing demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats little scenery, I could not sit through adaptation starring William Hurt Wimpy or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in the romance. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what happened ZIL Clark. She died on Jane, quiet, formal, let those with, but the eyes. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers an idea of ​​the power and energetic character who helped Jane to survive the abuse that she experienced in her youth. Criticism of her performance as "wooden" inappropriate. Servant in proper English household to maintain just such a demeanor, but she says passionately, if overcome with emotion. Unlike many other Janes screen, it seems simple enough to be Jane still beautiful enough to allow the audience to buy her attraction Rochester. <br /> <br /> The dialogue Bronte big part of why the book carries the script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clark capture interaction between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane looks like a simple and sweet, like vanilla custard, she refuses to be intimidated by the dark, windy Rochester. Two wires to play off each other beautifully. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect adaptation of the best love story ever.
