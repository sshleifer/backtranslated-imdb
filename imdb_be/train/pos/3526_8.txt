Phantom Lady (1944) with Dir: Siodmak <br /> <br /> Production: Universal Pictures <br /> <br /> Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), after a nasty fight and split with his wife, looking to drown his sorrows at the local watering. There he spies a woman in such an emotional state, and looking at some friendships, asks her to show at the club to get their minds off their problems. She agrees, but only on condition that they keep their names themselves. Of course, if Scott gets home, he finds the police there, waiting to interrogate him. his wife was killed. Where were you at 8:00 pm, the inspector asks Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott's got an alibi, right? Only he does not know the woman's name. And the bartender says Scott, but not a woman. Nor does the taxi driver. Neither drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) at the club. Even a dancer at the club, which Scott clearly caught looking at a woman (they were both wearing the same hat), does not recognize there was someone with him. Something's going on, but no matter what Scott is helpless to defend himself in court and sentenced to death for the murder of his wife (on the flimsiest of "evidence" in the judicial history of Hollywood). He left his faithful secretary, "Kansas" (Ella Raines), who later joined Burgess pretty inspectors to find the real killer before Scott punished. <br /> <br Phantom Lady /> built on the themes were repeated, almost obsessively, in WOOLRICH in. For example, a schizophrenic antagonist also seen in the Black Angel and The Leopard Man. In addition, there is a character who becomes mentally upset or death of a beloved wife, as found in the Rendezvous in Black and The Bride Wore Black. It can leave the viewer feel as if he is treading on a well-worn ground. But in the right hands, parts of the feverish, sorry dialogue, narrative inconsistency, it's all beside the point. Fortunately, Phantom Lady was guided by sound hands. <br /> <br /> This is the first film noir in Siodmak. He will continue to distinguish itself as one of, if not, the prevailing practice style (The Killers, Criss Cross). Here he randomly paired with filmmaker Woody Bredell (they reunited on Christmas and The Killers holiday). There are some great story done in camera. In one frame, the deterioration of the mental state of the character is shown as he sits in front of a 3-way mirror, judging multiple personalities. The same character who is an artist, a self-portrait of Van Gogh's ear bandage hanging on the wall in his apartment. But that Siodmak and Bredell really do in Phantom Lady practically creates the look of film noir. Released at the beginning of 1944, it's all here; wet pavement, bags of atmosphere and fear, in sharp contrast to & W, wildly expressionistic version of reality (if Kansas Scott visited in prison), random shafts of light, etc. This stunning picture to look at. <, Br /> <br /> Franchot tonnes per side, the cast, as well as the subject and the relative inexperience of the director (and, presumably, budget), it is believed ambitions movie «B». I thought the tone was a little unusual. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not up to much, but actually comes off quite weak in several scenes. Ella Raines mostly good (and quite beautiful). Her "sex scene" with Elisha Cook Jr. so delirious he must see to believe. Another outstanding scene where Kansas is, after asking the bartender. It amounts to a chase scene, when she relentlessly dog ​​him through the streets, stopping at subway stations. Some real good tension there. <br /> <br /> *** 4
