In terms of visual beauty of this film is outstanding! I had no idea what happened so early Technicolor. Although I did not like the ending, the whole movie is fantastic and makes me wish I was in North Africa. Throw a beautiful and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus, and, of course, it is so tempting, and I just loved her in this film. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this film. I could not get the scenery and sets ... hotels, palm, desert, it's all there ... legionaries also bring "For Gesture" feel to the film. They certainly do not make movies like this anymore. Not necessarily to see this classic!
