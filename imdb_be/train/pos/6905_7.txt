I thought that Mr. Dreyfus was perfect for his role as an actor and the dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia played a role as perfect. It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss was replaced dictator against his will. But he became more confident and comfortable with the role, as the time passed. Since everything happens for a reason in life, I believe, that he was forced to replace the dictator, because he had to stay there for a year, he did. I believe that it was because he had to see how well his life as compared to the poverty he witnessed in the Parador. I think he took too many things for granted in life, and he must get a serious reality check, staying in the country for as long as he did. <br /> <br /> But ......... .. anyway ........... so I gave this film 7 of 10.
