David Lynch typically makes films that resemble puzzles to collect the wrong way. They are interesting to look at and think about it, but they do not gel in your mind. Perhaps art will always mean that the majority of its creator. <br /> <br /> The simple story is not typical of a film by David Lynch. Not that there is anything typical about them anyway. This odyssey through rural America. Real life journey Alvin Straight took the mower to get to his brother's house. He drove 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, to atone for his sick brother in the past crimes. <br /> <br /> At the heart of this film is the sweet voices of Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film corresponds to the slow pace of a slow journey of Alvin for implementation. <br /> <br /> On the way Alvin meets confused and frightened young girl. She was pregnant and decided to escape from their situation. After listening to Alvin talk about family, she reconsiders. <br /> <br /> Later Alvin witnesses mad woman to kill a deer with her car. She complains that she killed a few and leaves. Alvin feels bad, but smart enough to cook any expensive meat that night. <br /> <br /> Later mower Alvin loses its brakes and almost kills him. A good man and his wife, let him stay in their yard, while it gets installed. They even let him call his sweet, but slowly daughter plays well Sissy Spacek, which pursues a terrible tragedy in her own past. Alvin insisted on paying for the call. Man proposes to Alvin even his brothers happy. Alvin reduced appreciated. <br /> <br /> While waiting for Alvin, he also goes to a bar with good old, as they discuss the cruelty of war and the price, which he took over their souls. Alvin even recognized the mistake he made as a sniper, who always tormented him. <br /> <br /> Alvin also meets two brothers disputes that have already repaired his lawnmower. He tells them the price is reasonable to call them on high labor and repair costs. It even helps them to appreciate each other to learn from their own mistakes with his brother. <br /> <br /> The night before Alvin leaves the yard man, he takes his hat to him. The man tells him that it's an honor to have him stay and asked Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. This heart, because it's so right, so real. <br /> <br /> The journey continues, and we can not get more and communicate with them more. We want to Alvin to get to his brothers. We want to make amends. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> It was Richard Farnsworth at its best. It was his last film, and his performance was strange. You can not help but understand his honor, to hear his wisdom, and ultimately, to feel his pain. Man becomes, as is customary with him, like a man who invites him to the backyard to stay. <br /> <br /> If there is justice in the afterlife, the Alvin Straight, his brother, and Richard Farnsworth sit together at the bar. I can imagine them discussing their lives, regret, hope and joy. As Alvin says in the film "My brother and I used to look at the stars." Well, I know that all of them with the best view in the house.
