I loved this movie! It's really weird, very funny, morbid, witty ... it makes no sense to talk about the content of the film, because then I would have to give out the result! You have to see it, not knowing what it's about! Everything is interconnected and is why & back. He begins to thin and then everything will start to grow faster and faster, until they finish in the mad rush you can imagine! It's even more fun to watch the film a second time, when you know all the "tricks". Actors perfectly, especially Ivan Trojan, the final scene a real masterpiece! I highly recommend this film, this is one of the most original I've ever seen!
