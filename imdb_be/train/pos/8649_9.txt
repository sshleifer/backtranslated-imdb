I bought this a while ago, but somehow neglected entirely to watch it until last night. I love Juliette Lewis, although I'm indifferent to Brad Pitt. After this show, I have to admit that he is a wonderful actor - his character was quite plausible, and I do not think that "Brad Pitt" at all <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can not say the same for David . spiritual.
