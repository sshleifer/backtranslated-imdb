"I looked into the eyes of this island, and what I saw was beautiful," announces one of the main characters in the award-winning ABC television show "Lost." The series can be described as a drama of the story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island, but it would do a disservice to the show. «Lost» is a large group of characters that are in conflict with the island, each other, and end up the same way as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependence on one another. The situation is complicated when it becomes clear that this is no ordinary island or -., And that they may not be alone <br /> <br /> My initial fear, heard the concept of the series was the lack of new stories that they could tell us after a certain period of time, but it turned out to be unfounded. The narrative flows naturally, witty dialogue, the characters are stored and performing excellently. The island character on its own, and to understand this comment, you should see a series of for himself, which just goes to show his originality and greatness. <br /> <br /> At the time of this writing, only the first two seasons on the air, and they are filled with strong episodes. My only mild criticism is that the second season, seems to slow down a bit in the middle, but fortunately, returned in great shape for the final episodes. <br /> <br /> When I can recommend a TV series you should be following right now, it would definitely be this one. If you like excitement, adventure, character-driven stories, very strong cast and crew, beautiful places, and the island, which seems to be more spiritual than natural, «Lost» for you. Just make sure that you start from the beginning.
