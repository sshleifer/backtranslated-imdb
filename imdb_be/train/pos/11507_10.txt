I remember vividly the original series mainly because of its unique combination of wry humor and dark subject matter. Kolchak was a hard-bitten journalist Ben Hecht big city school accountability, and its sandy definition and nerd behavior make even the most mundane episode extremely watchable. My personal favorite was "Murder Spanish moss" because of his completely original storyline. Poor, confused young people from Bayou Cajun Louisiana country, taking part in a research experiment, sleep, to dream analysis. That something is not inexplicable, and it is literally a dream to life marsh creatures that live in the dark folk tales of his youth. This is a manifestation of evil looking all people who offended the dreamer in his conscious state, and violently suppresses them to death. Kolchak investigates and reveals the awful truth, unfortunately the police captain Joe «Mad Dog» Siska (well tried on the grumpy Keenan Wynn) and researcher of sleep head plays improvisation founder of The Second City, Severn Darden, in a lovely, understated perfection, wickedly funny, harrowing finals takes place in Chicago's sewer system, and is a series of highlight. Kolchak was never better. Timeless.
