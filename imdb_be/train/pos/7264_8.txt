I have to agree with Cal-37 is a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Lynch, beautiful little girl is really talented and nice, certainly, Jim Belushi earned his stripes! But I wish I really liked was the piano song if you are a musician or not watch this movie just for that, you'll know what it is. <br /> <br /> "you're nobody until somebody loves you" Author Russ Morgan, Larry Stock, and James Coffee <br /> <br /> So pinning <br /> <br /> So far, <br / > <br /> Nelson
