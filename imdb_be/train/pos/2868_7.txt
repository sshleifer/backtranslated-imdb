First of all, I must say that I am Portuguese, and it's not normally my wasting my time watching Portuguese films, perhaps one every year or even a ... <br /> <br /> ... And the reason is almost generalized representation between the Portuguese that the national picture terrible, very close to the worst ever made! However, in the last decade, he begins surprises me when we get funny 40s, when the "Leão da Estrela" e "Costa do Castelo" were among the best in the world at one time, with films like «Pulsação zero" or «Sorte Nula», both from director Fernando Fragata, as well as with some of the actors and music shared <br /> <br /> this one is also good, not of the same kind, because it is not a real comedy . in fact it is officially a drama, a woman drama has some unexpected fun part, the reason is the comic characters or funny things that happen to them as a hypothetical trip to the Caribbean just to fuck. <br /> <br /> The plot works and can surprise us several times; the actors are good, as the place of the regular assessment; but the truth is that it all makes sense, we can consider it as a good effort for national cinema, which seems to be starting from the ashes like a phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie Portuguese, of course, you can take the best option, but stops a measurement.
