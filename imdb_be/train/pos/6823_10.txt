I had watched John Cassavetes films last week - starting with "A Woman Under the Influence" to "premiere". I fully blown, in particular, these two films. from the first minute to the last in the "premiere" I was totally and completely absorbed. I just felt it a few times, but the feeling that this film was made lasted for about two-thirds in, until the loans came from. everything about this film, how he was shot, incredible performance Gena Rowlands, loans, opening, music, story, a sense of depth, pace, tenderness, originality, character, clever little moments .... truly sublime for me. I can not disagree with the previous comment about taking it on a desert island, as the net depth of this film is something to behold. if your unlucky enough to have a house fire, I guarantee that, rather than to make a last-ditch attempt to save the stash money under the bed, you will save a copy of this film instead.
