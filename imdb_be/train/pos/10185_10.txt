Seeing this film was the most fun I've had in a movie for a long time. Nevertheless, I can not say whether this is good or bad film because such a simple skill simply can not be applied. This picture has all any film could ever have. It has the characteristics of the romantic comedy, political commentary, thriller, drama, action, musical, and absurdist self-conscious cinema. It's all there, adding to the myth. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the Indian pair, Nandini (Karishma Kapoor) and Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor) lives happily in Canada, which are sent to Romania to visit her husband's father after a disturbing story. The rest of the story takes place in India, where the pair is in the middle of the plot of fratricidal violence. At some point, the story borrows "Not without my child," but called Shakti remake anything unfair. <br /> <br /> imaginary storyline takes a back seat to a number of amazing interruptions, including Shahrukh Khan dream about Aishwarya Rai, who is coming as if from another movie. In fact, these two stars all the posters, but they are very late in the film, and only Shahrukh ends up being a real character. Nevertheless, it makes up for it with a vibrant and truly unexpected performance. <br /> <br /> Karishma Kapoor is one with a lot of work to do in this movie, and it does an excellent job of having to connect to twist the film turns a plausible show of emotion. Other notable presence Nana Patekar who plays Narasimha, a tyrannical father Shekhar husband. Nana Patekar dominates every scene he is in a frightening, but the nuances of character. <br /> <br /> The film is not without its share of realism. Violence is rampant, but really disturbing in the abuse received a majority of female characters, with Karishma getting severely beaten several times. Sometimes this violence is clearly disturbing, but ultimately, it is unreal how each dramatic sequence, as a rule, should be in such a spectacular and comical turns out that the overall effect is not the same as a laxative. <br /> <br /> I have seen the share of Bollywood releases, and the mix of genres and incredible plot resolution, of course, they are the norm. But the "Shakti" raises the bar, consuming more Masai, Sun is getting ridiculous. This is a film that achieves greatness in Shakespeare's tragedy, where viewers mob and royalty alike entertained. This is pure, gratuitous movie, and director Krishna Vamsi has to have a dream about a good time, throwing every trick in the book. Maybe all important reports of violence in the conception of the family and inspire extents maternal love were not the thoughts in my view, but I went to watch "Shakti" tipsy. Making movies can be the most fun in the world!
