Since the name in English and IMDb lists the main language of the show, as the English language, I have to focus on the review of the English version of Gundam Wing (2000), presented in Bandai released a DVD set. My actual review for the entire series at IMDb entry on «» Shin Kido Senki Gundam W »(1995). <br /> <br /> Very little has changed with regard to construction, the script and the characterization of its adaptation to English and actually depends on your own taste to choose a language to see this show. Japanese purists can stick all they want, but for a more "realistic" experience, I recommend the English track, as all symbols except Heero him, not Japanese. (Most of them are actually Caucasian with a pair of non-Japanese Asians.) On the one hand, the characters come across a person "directly" than in the Japanese version. the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some of give performances take -or- but very well chosen group of actors. <br /> <br /> pilot in Gundam Wing Heero Yuy is highly skilled soldier who suppress their emotions, but gradually learns the meaning of his humanity. voiced by Mark Hildreth who is calm delivery can be criticized as "bad actions", but it fits the personality HeERO very well. <br /> <br /> Deathscythe Gundam in Duo Maxwell, when the cheerful face of death is given a crash course in cherishing the value of life and friends. He may have acted in the best character in the whole show, masterfully played Scott McNeil. It may seem a little too old for his age, but the duo of English voices easily because it takes an annoyingly nasal Japanese one. <br /> <br /> Trowa, pilot Heavyarms, is a lonely lost soul who single goal so far has been fighting; despite his inner desire to form a relationship with the people around him, he knows how to kill, sun friends. Kirby Morrow gives a grim but realistic view as Trowa Barton. <br /> <br /> Quatre Rebarba winner Swale voiced nonsense that has no problems Brining is a caring nature of the character and the shedding of his innocence, as he feels the horror of war and death firsthand. A huge plus point is the fact that Quatre no longer sounds like a girl (and he is voiced by a female actress in the Japanese version), but conscientious typical 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> impulsive, but determined Wufei Chang voiced Ted Cole may seem a little over-the-top, but he plays in stark contrast to the more subdued role Heero and Trowa. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian sounds older than the English language, the voice of Lisa Ann Bailey. This may not sit well with her youthful personification in the beginning of the series, but as her character matures later in the story, her voice should suit and completes the installation very well with the character development. <br /> <br /> Zechs Merquise would be one of the most radically changed the voices compared to the Japanese version. Both voices bring the different sides of the same character. His Japanese voice rises, authoritative and deserves respect, keeping in line with its status as a high-ranking and charismatic character. His English voice Brian Drummond more muffled sound more sophisticated and "snake", emphasizing the secretive nature of Zechs regarding his hidden plans and convinced belief in its ideals. <br /> <br /> The members of OZ are different for sure. Treize Kushrenada voiced by David Kaye provides a more realistic and down to earth performance compared with its larger than life in a Japanese-style speech. However, Lady Une not her split personality as a contrast, as in the Japanese version and Lucrencia Noin sounds simple ......... boring most of the time. Cannon fodder pilots and military leaders have nothing to say either. <br /> <br /> I would appreciate it if they took the time to give different characters different emphases to reflect their ethnic origin. Maganac Corp voices were generally uninspired, but could be more interesting if they are middle eastern accents were given. Romerfeller fund members will also sound better with some classy European accent that reflects their nobility status. <br /> <br /> Despite the destroyed exerted by the characters, the main cast of the show and get a hold of generally less over-the-top and more realistic performance scenario Gundam Wing. Very close to the original Japanese script, keeping all the basic thought-provoking ideas and themes of politics, war and human nature. Unfortunately, it also preserves the shortcomings of the original Japanese script.
