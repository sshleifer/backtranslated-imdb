I enjoyed this film very much. I've always been a supporter of Whoopi Goldberg and this film only underscores it. It reflects the housewife in the African-American family that moves up the social chain of (Danny Glover) the success of her husband as a lawyer. It moves to all the white area, where people are friendly, a little more uncomfortable for her. Various events that occur in the course of the film made some laughs, but most turn to other emotions. This film is not so much a comedy as drama. I give it a strong 8/10. I highly recommend you catch it on television or rent it soon.
