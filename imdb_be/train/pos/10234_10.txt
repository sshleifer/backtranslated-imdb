<br /> <br /> Â«Burning Paradise" is a combination of neo-Shaw Brothers action and urban cynicism Ringo Lam. If one watches the film, they can feel the fight scenes are mediocre only in nature, but it does not matter, it's the attitude and the atmosphere that counts. This is a great movie is like !! I always try to be different than his contemporaries, Lam gives us a traditional characters (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Chi-Kwan) and puts them in "Raiders of the Lost Ark" settings. However, it is not light-hearted comedy incarnations which you can see in the movie Jet Li. Instead, these guys fight to the death with brutal results. What makes the film even better is that someone could die at any time, does not hold back. Too bad they do not make movies like this more often.
