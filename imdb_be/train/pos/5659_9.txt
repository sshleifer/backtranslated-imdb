AG had an excellent presentation of drama, thriller and action movie, which is so rare US television. Sheriff Lucas gave many viewers shudder. We're rooting for Caleb as he tried to resist overtures Sheriff Lucas. We have become obsessed with fear and to learn about the incredible connection between these two characters. Manipulations that weekly gave reason to fear that Lucas would do next was really weird. The show lived up to the nickname "Gothic" in the relations of the American entertainment so rarely attempted, much less assimilated. Costumes definitely made a big mistake, do not support this show. The show puts a shame the current glut of "reality" shows- that so less than meets viewing.The challenge for the DVD box set of well-founded. This show is the quality view for the demanding market hungry for high-quality viewing. People tired of stultifying fare glut of reality will welcome this gem a real storyteller. Bring on the set of DVD boxes !!
