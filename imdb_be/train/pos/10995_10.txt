I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out a few years ago and really liked it. But I still would like to see it again this year, to check if it is still good compared with the movie coming out now, and I have a dim say that this is one of the best films I've ever seen in my life !!!!!!!!! !!!! <br /> <br /> What you should know that you should not miss a minute of the film, if you do not completely follow the action you get lost and you do not realize until the end. <br /> <br /> In the end, what makes this film so good, you can not wait for it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations producer!
