The part where Meg attends a mechanic, and he said - "Is shooting a short piston?" (Meaning, poor sexual energy from her friends) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan, and she was as sweet as ever in this wonderful film. Very nice and very smart too. Her innocent expression outraged you wanting it to be yours. The hero turns garage mechanics to transform physical well. Einstein had a romantic side to his soul? Round puzzle was done well in the presence of the press and the audience. It's terrible undervalued and deserves praise and revival attempts. He loses one vote for the inclusion of unlikely far-fetched theory, bought by US Govt. I do not understand why he does not figure in the top 20 romantic comedies century. Great movie, it has a presidential seal of approval on it!
