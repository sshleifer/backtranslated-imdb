I must confess I do not read the original M R James stories, although I have read many of his other supernatural tales. I also have seen most of the previous Ghost Stories BBC Christmas and this, in my opinion, superior to most of them, only equaled signalman. <br /> <br /> I can not fault the view from the hill - and the direction of the "mood" is ideal, as it effects, lighting and, of course, the story and write. I thoroughly enjoyed it and we can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and crew. I understand that the BBC plan to do some more (not necessarily based on M R James stories), so it is promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
