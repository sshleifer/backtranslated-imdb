I tease all the time on family and friends for my tears on the film, and they were not disappointed when I watched this. I cried many times, but believe me, it was nothing more than a juicy. I longed for a family, and I longed for the man when he tried to redeem themselves only way he knew how. Denzel was great as always, and so was Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I did not recognize, though; years had not been kind to him. My husband is not one to re-watch movies, if they are not historically accurate war films (snoring !!!!) He watched it 5 times, and now I'm going to have to get the DVD, to watch it again, because he wore the tape out and jumped all the time I watched.
