I have personally seen many films of Disney in my life, but absolutely none of them are the same in any way knob and a broom. Although I personally would not have crossed the live-action with animation, it was an improvement on trying to put people in a character animation. The film confronts three evacuated from the Second World War, which is sent to stay with a quiet and socially awkward woman in the country. I would like to say that casting was brilliant. Angela Landsbury make the perfect Miss Price, while David Thomilson made a great showman desperate love interest. End always surprises me, and this was no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, even though I do not know when it was done intentionally. The dialogue was not great, but considering it was designed to be a movie as a child, that is good. Overall, I would give the performance of nine out of ten, six out of ten dialogue, rejection of nine out of ten and eight out of ten suits.
