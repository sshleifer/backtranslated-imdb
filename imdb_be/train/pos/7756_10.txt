I'm not sure if this is some kind of a masterpiece or just sloppy down elevated performances and visual effects. In any case, I am sure that I loved him. With strange twisted, sinister stories are intertwined, to the sinister magical performances from Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, to a bright, colorful color, with which it all captured this high-end garbage, and it's great fun. Not to mention the amusing and clever thinly veiled sexual innuendo, which permeate the entire film, always threatens to break out of the way of dialogue, but never do it. I'd be lying if I said that the film's entertainment value itself has not contributed to my love for her, but there are some strange artistic unintentional (or was?) Comedy, and I really, really dug. I could really get into this melodrama things.
