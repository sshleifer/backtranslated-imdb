I was honored to have seen some fragments from the initial launch of Aardman in this exhibition in the UK. It was always fun and always funny. None of the charm was not lost in translation - it's amazing how people interviewed - some of them is a script or not, as rumored, it is beside the point. It's always interesting. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animations shows the great view from the signs used for each voice, the only aspect that I probably love most about the show and its concept (enmity between pandas, porcupines discussed needle fear, monkey picture ). Regulars really grow on you, as well as, for example, a horse and a donkey teenagers from Maryland, almost every couple (parrots, insects, and cats, to name a few) and baby-voiced character and I really came to dig a ferret! Monday, finally become a day on which to look forward.
