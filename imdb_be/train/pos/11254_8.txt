It's been a long time since I've seen this mini-series, and I'm glad to say that he is remembered achievements withstood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Most of the components «A Perfect Spy", the best adaptation of the novel LeCarré, in my opinion, the top drawer. Outstanding aspect of this is the score and powerful script, the last written by Arthur Hopkraft, who was also, I believe, a screenwriter, "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy» Alec Guinness a few years ago. <br /> <br /> the actors are mostly very good, some great, Jack Brotherhood Alan Howard and Ray McAnally Rico PIM. Peter Egan's exciting to watch, because his face is changing with every angle. With the passage of time and the impact on the physical appearance of the characters very believable done. So much so that I wondered how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming. Only push comes after the character is transferred from Magnus PIM very skillful hands of a young actor by the name of Benedict Taylor are much too old Peter Egan, just fresh out of Oxford. But this is a minor and unimportant seam as a whole. <br /> <br /> Egan has problems not only convincingly when the text becomes melodramatic, and it should be "upset" emotional, that is a scream. None of the actors is not a very easy time with these moments, aside from the beautiful Frances Tomelty, who plays Peggy Wentworth in all it's worth and steals the episode with ease. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker annoying as Mary Pym. It is part of the character under her skin, but often shows amateur irritability, reducing it as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife who Mary Pym. Rüdiger Weigang gorgeous as of Axel, funny, ironic and brilliant. I also enjoyed the camp turn Sarah Badel as the Baroness. <br /> <br /> The British think of Americans clearly provided in some dry fun scenes. If the Yankees have come abroad to ConFab with After Brummell (head of MI-6) US forces are depicted as empty headed clowns that appear remember a lot of long words from the dictionary and tucked them liberally with the American jargon and psycho babble, a large stunned neglect English . <br /> <br /> humor and sadness subtly mixed. LeCarré has a knack for blending various elements in its stories and Hopcraft brilliantly captured melancholia, but pensive, the original atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Or the perfect production (what?), and yet the best of LeCarré devices to achieve a movie or television today. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend to all lovers of spy thriller and especially LeCarré fans. DVD available from Acorn.
