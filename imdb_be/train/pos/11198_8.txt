Hitchcock shows his already developed understanding of the visual in the early silent film. The plot of the movie, featuring two boxers fighting for the girl straight-ahead drama without much to recommend it. Hitchcock's talent, though, is in its use of the stunning images. Almost every frame is filled with visual symbols. Especially memorable jewelry that gives a boxer girl just before she marries another boxer. He slips her hand in a clearly sexual way, and with one simple movement Hitch showed us all we need to know. Boxing scene well crafted with some interesting point of view of personnel, which again proves how far ahead of his time Hitchcock was. The film also gives an idea of ​​its further treatment of women. The object of desire boxers controlled by money and lust, not love or crazy. The only other woman in the film or the beautiful party girl, which makes open offer sex or old men, which help destroy a happy relationship. In general, the ring is a must for anyone interested in beginning the work of Hitchcock and his development as a visual storyteller.
