An excellent cast makes this film work; all the characters are developing extremely well, and it's clear that the actors loved shooting this film. <br /> <br /> It's not really a comedy, I was expecting a much more light-hearted look at the attempt to regain the glory of youth than bawdy humor, For music lovers, there are many subtle references that are themselves reasonably funny. <br /> <br /> I hate to draw direct comparisons with other films, but most of the film reminded me of Alan Parker's films, I can not help it: imagine if the obligation actually to make it big - and then We are trying to regain the glory of the said 25 years later.
