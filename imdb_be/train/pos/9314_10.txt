Just saw this show a few times, but will live on in my memory. <br /> <br /> It is very frustrating that it's so hard to find it anywhere to buy, and yet there seems to be endlessly repeating things like friends! Especially more difficult to obtain, while in England, I think? .. <br /> <br /> They say that it was a lower grade or is it a complaint by themselves Bakersfield PD? Maybe it was just too smart for some people? <br /> <br /> Anyway, just about a comedy I want to see again, but almost impossible to find. I heard that at the moment, or was repeated on a different network? But, unfortunately, no more than here !! <br /> <br /> Summary: Brilliant.
