This is a great drama was me in suspense all the time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for a second, because every word is stored connection parts to this mysterious murder. This movie really touched me because it showed how boring and difficult life can be. I actually cried at the end (which I do not want to give away!) Also, let me know how brutal and sickening people can be when it comes to murder. <br /> <br /> cast was also very good. The only bad cast was an actress who played Mary Ann. The actress did a great job, but the director did not. I say this because he found someone who did not look a bit like Anne Marie of Fay.
