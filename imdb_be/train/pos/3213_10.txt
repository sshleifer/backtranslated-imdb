What a fine example of a "more or less ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) has only 72 lines, and something like 104 words. What a problem!

This is one of the 5 best movies that I can not live without him, right up there with classics like the warrior path. If you liked this, check the "Mad Max 2, The Road WarriorÂ» and "Braveheart" as a starring Mel Gibson. In addition, the "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen, who was a soldier, too. "The Thirteenth Warrior" starring Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner," starring Harrison Ford.
