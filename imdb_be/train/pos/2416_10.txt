Yes, it's a bit silly movie, so if you are looking for Oscar performance, forget it ...... but if you love the humor of John Candy, this is a must see. We lost John Candy before he made it big enough brand of comedy, and it is only better in a movie: Planes, trains, and automobiles (Steve Martin). Excellent performance supported Eugene Levy, perhaps his best work as a hothead Sal DiPasquale. Also good acting, Richard Libertini, Alley Mills & Hingle. You should see this obscure and sold the film, if you are a fan of John Candy and Eugene Levy.
