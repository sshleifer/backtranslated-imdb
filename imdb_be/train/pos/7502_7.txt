Although I really do not feel anything for the character Lance, and felt that his wife could do much better with someone else. This could be a much stronger film if they spent more time on character development, possibly with Lance- I would have liked it better. <br /> <br /> However, I have to completely agree with DoyleLuver, when they said, "And to quote Glenn Quinn's character Ben," I am a star is in it, that's right, I have a talented friend, "If you watch a movie, just watch him, even if it is in the background ... just his facial expressions, all in the eyes, you know for sure what motivates Ben how he feels comments, even if it's a quick look behind your character. great acting in an honest film.
