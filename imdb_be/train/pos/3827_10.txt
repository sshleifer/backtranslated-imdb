I have no idea what the other reviewer said o- it was a great movie, and creates a feeling of the era, which feels like a trip back in time. Celebrities really young, strong match Mary Byron, Claire juvenile and a bit annoying, Polidorte convincingly downed sneak down ... everything is beautiful, interesting, and decadent ... nya scary wrecks they are in the Gothic. <br /> <br /> Gothic works as an independent piece of shock film, and I loved it for different reasons, but it works as a merchant and Ivory film, and was on my testimony better grip of what the summer must have felt themselves. Romantic, yes, but it sparks my interest in the life of Shelley and Byron each time I thought of the film. One of my most favorite.
