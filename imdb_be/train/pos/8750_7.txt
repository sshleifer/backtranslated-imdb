Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who go on a spontaneous trip to Thailand and the wind in prison after being caught with drugs planted in the luggage. Thus, the film had the potential to become a serious and personal film, such as "Return to Paradise", but instead, the film decided to focus a little bit about the situation of girls and more on their friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale and turn in excellent performances, and the film is much more about the interaction between them - suspicion, jealousy, questioning and testing of their friendship, and eventually sacrifices made in the name of friendship, this film prefers not to go into politics or even in harshness of prison life (which is a bit padh decided), and more attention is paid to these issues of friendship. <br /> <br /> There were some plot holes here and some parts that just do not seem plausible and realistic. We did not feel real fear or hopelessness of his position, and we We might have. And we have very little sense of life outside the prison walls, from Bill Pullman plays allegedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold. in short, it should, by right, was a much darker film than it was. <br /> <br /> But on the whole, I liked it. The acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the story was enough to remain interesting twists. Worth a look.
