Here the horror flick decent mid-70s on the gates of Hell in New York City, which just happens to be an old brownstone. It seems there are many gates of hell around, but it is, of course, involuntary model is to decide what she needs some space from your boyfriend / girlfriend, so she just happens to pick the one that is disguised as a good and reasonably priced apartment . She meets several strange neighbors, and even attends a party on the occasion of the birth of the cat. When meeting with a realtor because she hears strange noises at night from the top, she finds out that she and the old priest should be uniform tenants. Wow! Then who are these freaks? Her boyfriend (a slimy lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem, not by a long shot. It has some decent horrible scene and presenting a creaky old people who are her "sometimes" neighbors is, in addition, they are quite intriguing. Some decent gusset and even fewer hits than usual, people close to the end to make it a decent watch, and while I've seen it many times on television directorial DVD version is much better, of course. Not a bad little horror film, maybe, a good companion piece "Burnt OfferingsÂ». 8 of 10.
