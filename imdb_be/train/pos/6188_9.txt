The murder investigation continues at the scene back, vanity, on its opening night, playing on to an unsuspecting audience. Odd mix of music and murder mystery worth looking at him gypsum, production number and the apparent novelty of the film. <br /> <br /> Gertrude Michael has a spectacular role bitchy actress intention to terminate the marriage between the stars of the show, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as starring in the infamous room "Sweet Marijuana" (which was also on the 70th Bette Midler, the album). So while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage bumbling detective Victor McLaglen ogles girls while he tries to solve the murder behind the scenes of an unknown woman. <br /> <br /> We will soon find out that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from afar that the wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is the mother of Brisson, and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie) butts into everything. Many sites turns between musical numbers. The most famous song of the show is "Cocktails for Two". Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting "Where do they come from?" And the strange rhapsody, resulting in a number of specialty Haarlem with Duke Ellington! Quite a cast. <br /> <br /> Some terrific actor here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle pretty good as well. Brisson is a total zero, though. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek is playing doctor, and see if you can find Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball shows among girls.
