I'm not going to spoil the contents to anyone who has not watched this modest masterpiece Kay Pollak. <br /> <br /> And the world-famous conductor brilliantly played Nyukvist seeking peace from the stress of moving back to his childhood village. The peasants, who then genius in silence, slowly tempting to share his glory. <br /> <br /> Every role in this film has a very specific purpose, and shows significant potential in each of the subjects of playing its own accord in a short but precise words, a symphony of love. <br /> <br /> I do not like in terms of the relationship, but in the tone of the spirit buried deep in each of the characters, each revealing their own true story, their needs, their skeletons, desires and more. <br /> <br /> I will not forget to mention two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Nyqvist, whose dramas are played out in unforgettable harmony of emotional feedback. They relate to each other, the pain associated with their own inability to love yourself. <br /> <br /> Nyukvist really put to the test here in a very complex installation, in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fiction. And it was fantastic from start to finish, and not one second less or more than enough, you are left with a sense of change and a taste for more. <br /> <br /> Today is definitely one of the best films I've had the pleasure of viewing.
