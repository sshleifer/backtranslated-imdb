This movie is not great, but it is good and pleasant one. It feels like an indie film made from the script of the game. Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, although the director swears script was written not for him. And there is a small irony of the actor, who goes to the supermarket to do the research for the film, which he had not done yet. I mean, in fact, he made the film, in the end, and we're watching it :) <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue a little too positive for my taste, but refreshing nonetheless. This is a film that inspires the viewer to look at your own life and to choose the direction in which to go. A little too much attention to the appearance, if you ask me, <br /> <br /> The result :. A nice little film, made within two weeks, with basically two actors and a few extras, dialogue driven, making Morgan Freeman to look good :)
