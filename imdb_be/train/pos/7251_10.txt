I saw this movie once about 25 years ago, and so far I've always told people that this is probably the best movie I have ever seen. Given that there was no verbal dialogue and only dialogue thought I found the movie to be exciting, and I even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound. I highly recommend this movie, I want it to be available on DVD.
