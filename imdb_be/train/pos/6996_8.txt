This film was really great film about something that affects all of us. I know that I personally have experienced this many times. Thank God, Will Smith jumped to the social problem of texting while driving. People do not do that. An hour and forty-five minutes is not enough time for this purpose. Personally, I wanted to throw my cell phone after the movie. I was glad to see that other people in the theater saw the message and dropped their phones with empty bags of popcorn. I decided to disable all text messages on your phone and would encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, make them watch this vital public service announcement of text messages while driving, or they would have killed seven people. Thanks for showing us the way.
