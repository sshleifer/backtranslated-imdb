Do something about the film I do not know, before you watch, and I think that it was "no expectation" factor that has helped me to endure at first, and then, as it is more than I expected. <br /> < br /> The setting was interesting, strange but interesting. The plot had gaps / jumps, I think it throws the audience off a bit. There's a nice soundtrack playing in the background, creating a "romantic" atmosphere. but they do not matter. < br /> <br /> the chemistry between Emma and Luis was just wonderful. was something inexplicably strange chemistry that I could not resist, I for I made love to her, and here I am writing this review. The subtle portrayal of the love of two actors was the highest, and I think that is the core of the film <br /> <br /> This film is not a casual romantic comedy. in fact, not all of us appreciate it. I had to sit for a while, and then began to slowly understand the little things that I did not catch the first one. I can not guarantee that everyone will like, but I hope that you do.
