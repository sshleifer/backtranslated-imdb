This is a very important film. It challenges the viewer, and encourages you to pay attention. There's a lot to like here. The director seems to be interested in the deciphered some of the more tired cinematic conventions. Unlike many recent American cinema, this film is interested in what it means to make a film in the first place. DVD includes lots of bonuses, and there are two comments that explain the film to the audience more confused after the first viewing. If the movie was shown at the Sundance, he made more than a few members of the audience uncomfortable and angry. It's Sunday morning coffee film, not movie night party on Friday. For the dedicated viewer, and treasure.
