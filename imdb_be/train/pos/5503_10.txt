The material in this documentary is so strong that it brought me to tears. Yes, the tears, I tell you. The popular struggle is traditionally exploited population should inspire all of us to defend our rights, continuing the good of society and to stop the cowardly excuse for not challenging the establishment. Chavez is weak and misfortunate in the same way, Bush is facing dirty corporations and capitalism was raging. Indeed, Latin America and the marginalized majority reshaped, finally, with the voice of more than five centuries. Although, in the case of Mexico, the election was clearly stolen Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He is trying to change the constitution to allow him to run indefinitely. This can not be tolerated. Enough with the politics and return to the cinema; Breath taking pace at times and deeply philosophical to the other. He paints Chavez as a popular hero is not afraid to challenge US hegemony and domination of the world's resources. If you think the author is biased in favor Chavez, nothing prevents you from doing your homework. One of the most important message of the film interrogates the information sources, as it has been clearly demonstrated to be victims of scissors shamefully accused Chavez supporters. Venezuela puts American democracy supposedly shame. Hasta la Revolucion Siempre!
