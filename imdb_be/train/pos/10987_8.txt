Trawling through the Sci Fi section in the local store video, I lose hope to find some good movies I have not seen weekly. Removable Cypher were like a punt on as a very lame horse. My son was so exhausted from the current "B" science fiction that he did not bother to see it again. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that I did not see on the Cypher, when it was released in Australia. It must have been very quiet, and I just missed it. <br /> <br /> Well, it was a really pleasant surprise! It's also not B movie. This is not a "blockbuster" of the epic variety, and not trying to be. - a quieter film, which should be treated several times for his land to be fully enjoy <br /> <br /> The special effects are strongly represented, if they are used - my only complaint is the super helicopter leetle obvious CGI at first glance, but they get it right this second appearance, and that aside everything else at the highest level. In any case, it affects the secondary. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give away the plot. Story structure has a Russian Doll aspect bit like Basic Instinct (albeit with very different content). <br /> <br /> Let's just say that the North choice for the lead was a clever move. The actor was born in Cambridge, England, and its emphasis on the film gets into the ear, as a kind of extremely forced New England dialect, is almost mute button. See the final plot twist, and you'll see why it's such a brilliant choice! Lucy Liu also like her. "She will kiss me - she will shoot me," edge <br /> <br /> I rarely watch movies several times within a few days - this is one of them.
