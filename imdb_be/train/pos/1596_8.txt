Although Cage and Cher are the focus of this story, gardenia and Dukakis good rally colleagues is where Loretta and Ronny will be in 50 years is still in love. The entire cast does a good job of Aiello ~ d John Mahoney- it shows a real slice of life. Although I have seen this long ago- I am glad that finally catapulted the cage to the place where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From the music to the scenes in the opera on a kitchen table arguments- is a very interesting film.
