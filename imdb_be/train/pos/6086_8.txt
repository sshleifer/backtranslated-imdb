I saw this film about a year ago and found it quite Laugh-Out-Loud funny. Real winner in my opinion. It was underlining silly comedy, but in fact there was a real story, as well. As well as the hit comedy, Elf, actually. It was a few serious moments, caught between amusement. If Stiller shot Black horse in the normally sober moment, you find yourself laughing at his clumsy antics. In fact, you can find a common language there, as I'm sure many people have done what they do not want others to learn about, to your friendship to end. <br /> <br /> When I found out how many people do not like this movie, I was completely stunned. What is absolutely terrible movies like Napoleon Dynamite had a rating higher than it makes me wonder about the sanity of people on the IMDb. Take my advice and rent it out. If you do not find yourself laughing at least once, I will reimburse you for the rent. = D
