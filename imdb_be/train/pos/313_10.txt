I am a black American, and I loved the soap opera. I watched it duplicated on Telemundo Spanish, almost 5-7 years ago. The story was the true story of a black slave who is love with a white commander led to its leadership and open, bizarre lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Many of us could learn a lot from Xica. She did what she did not have anything, and saw its possibilities. Many argue that it sold itself to -. But it is trying to ensure her future and her future children <br /> <br /> It was such a wonderful soap opera, I thought that it would be released on DVD, but it is not It will be released. This soap opera was the best soap opera EVER. We need him to be released on DVD or broadcast on TV again. It is now playing on Azteca America, which is available only in Mexico or in the United States paid cable. We need to once again released on Telemundo.
