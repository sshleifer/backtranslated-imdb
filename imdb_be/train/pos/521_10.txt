This is probably one of the most original love stories that I've seen over the centuries, especially for the war on the basis of (short) film. Basically it is a story based in two worlds, one is obviously real, others imaginary, but the filmmakers say at the outset that this is just a coincidence, if it is a real place. Anyway, Peter Carter (David Niven large) was going to crash the plane, he said with June (Planet of the Apes Kim Hunter), before he jumped out and said that he loved her. He had to die by jumping without a parachute, but somehow he survived, and now he sees and loves of June in the flesh. This is another place, like the sky, is unhappy because he survived and was to come into their world, so they sent the French Conductor 71 (Marius Goring), to convince him to leave, but he's obviously in love. Peter tells him that he must seek to save his life the other ships in the world, he got it. Obviously, love prevails when two lovers declare that they would die for each other, June even offers to take his place! Also starring Robert Coote as Bob Trubshawe, Kathleen Byron, like an angel, a short (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough, the English pilot and Abraham Soufer judge / surgeon. David Niven was number 36 on the 50-Greatest British actors, the film was number 86 on the 100 Greatest melodramas for a happy ending, it was number 47 on the 100 greatest films about the war, it was number 46 on the 50 Greatest British films, and it was the number of 59 100 greatest films. Excellent!
