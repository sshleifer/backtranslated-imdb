Neil Simon was a knack for dialogue and nowhere is this more evident than the line, it gives as opposed Matthau and Jack Lemmon types in the odd couple - a mixture of comedy and sorrow, which is entirely dependent on the credibility of these two mismatched friends sharing an apartment. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is neatnik Felix Unger, bent on suicide after the divorce with his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau) with some disastrous results. It seems that all is said and done, Felix Oscar drives up the wall, and no one can stand the way other, with Oscar be messiest men imaginable and Felix is ​​exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> Funniest scene was for me when giggling Pigeon sisters in an apartment above their visit on dinner date. Priceless interaction between Lemmon and Matthau Carol Shelley and Monica Evans enough to put you in stitches. Talented Pigeon sister is a girl who did the voice for the gable sisters (pair of geese) in Disney Kotov aristocrat, and here - their comical time at the top of the sad stories Lemmon desperate enough to promote a film in hilarity- Where it stays a lot of time . <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Simon and others use the procedure on the screen of his work, this is one not to be missed. Matthau and Lemmon perfectly cast (even if they considered the exchange of roles before filming) and, of course, it's easy to understand why he became a top-rated TV show later <br /> <br /> In summary :. Top Simon comedy, not to be missed.
