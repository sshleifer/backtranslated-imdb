I watched it a few years ago. I remembered how very puzzling situation, and a mixture of melancholy things, as the fate of Dorothy and personal future Bogdanovic. <br /> <br /> I turn to look at my VHS copy, and then I looked through it more and more. I am currently waiting for version DVD, at any cost, please! <br /> <br /> At home and light music is very well matched with the first second, slightly bluish, but also happy. <, Br /> <br /> All the characters are great for me, with funny situations, a great actor and a lot of dialog boxes that have a turn, it's like a cult film for me and many people I've met on the Internet or a movie clubs. It can not be unhappy. <br /> <br /> I think the title is a hope for life! You should be happy and laugh as much as possible <br /> <br /> I know that this can be a specific comment on the movie, but the fact is that I like it very much, I think the film marked me and I I never forget it.
