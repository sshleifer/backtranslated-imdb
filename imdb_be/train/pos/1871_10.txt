I was adopted at birth, and, of course, were not the problem Antwone Fisher in the movie, but I still share some of the emotions and this film really helped to bring them up and force me to deal with them. It even made me realize that I have "no part" and I will look for my birthparents now. <br /> <br /> I cried almost a day after I saw it the first time. Antwone confrontation with his birthmother adjacent to the reaction of the family of his father to his sudden appearance powerfully for those of us who do not know what will happen if we find our birth father. And his self-confidence and self-affirmation to his mother and against the offenders of his past were so strong. I could really identify with this and my need to tell people "yeah, I put my parents when I was born. BUT another set of parents raised me and loved me. And now I'm a success! "<, Br /> <br /> It has also helped me to understand my wife and our adopted children, who were going through a tragic experience, before they came to our home. And it made me realize how messed up our social system. If you remember reading the story last year about a foster child in Florida, which has been "lost" and then «Miranda & Ashley» history in Oregon City, where SCF ignored numerous complaints of sexual abuse of a man who eventually killed them, and this week the film was released one more story in the New Jersey of the three children who had been ignored by the system. One died. The state seems to think that the house they were in order, because they were the guardian was used (as a stripper) and "only occasionally" used heroin! <br /> <br /> There are just so many issues that are brought up in this movie - and they are dealing with as good script and acting that Antwone Fisher should be a "Best Picture" candidate for sure. No matter where you are accepted or not present, it is the heart of the traction that can not be ignored, who are concerned about children in our society.
