This is a beautiful story about the older son comes home, and learn to love and to be a part of all the things that he had left the house to get away from, sharp and moving. It shows a society which is perhaps surprising for us in the Western world, with a sense of family, which we lost. The history of the beautiful, sad, sometimes funny and comic. He has a sense of realism that we do not seem to see more in our Western films. <br /> <br /> To act unusual, in that, as the film progresses, it almost gives the impression that it is not acting, but documentary ordinary people. It's brilliant direction and production of the film. <br /> <br /> I'd love to see more films of this director.
