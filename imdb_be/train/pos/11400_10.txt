I found it necessary to respond to comments posted on the first page of the page of this movie, because some of them were slightly misinformative. <br /> <br /> I originally posted quotations from the original poster, but I was not sure it was the right one, given that it is the "comments" index, not a message board (although we used to use 'em that way back to the IMDb message boards added film), so I will edit it to make it unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Well, firstly, you may not know this, but Gene Kelly first became known for playing «Pal Joey» on Broadway in the original production. If Vincente Minnelli decided to Gershwin's "Panorama" movie, the character he wanted Kelly to be more complex than the "goody two shoes" the role he played in most of his films (except "For me and my Gal»), Alan Jay Lerner was commissioned to build a new story set in Paris, based on stories «Pal Joey». It gave Kelly a chance to play his famous role on Broadway, even if Warners was outbid for the rights to MGM «Pal Joey». In my opinion, Sat film «Pal Joey» is a wreck, although Sinatra for the role, but other problems, sunk the film (script changes and bad direction. ============== ===================================== <br /> <br /> you complain that the paintings Kelly is not very well done, even with reference to your art education, to prove a point. But you miss the fact that bad art Kelly was clearly designed to be bad, and it is necessary for the story / characters. the images are so bad, the audience knows Kelly is not ready for the show. Even he knows Although Mila delivery sugared it up to the point where he almost believed it. but it is very important that the audience is not sitting there saying, "but he is a great artist., if he had the chance to" do you want the audience is fully aware of its drawbacks <br /> <br /> Then you complain that he sabotages his interest to show you again ,. understanding of the structure of the story. he refuses because he does not want to feel like a gigolo, and because he knows that he is not really ready for the show. His enthusiasm for the exhibition, of course, not as great as the enthusiasm of "Joey" to "start a night club." But it has the same function in the plot. Remember that it is important to «Pal Joey» (play), that Joe gives his nightclub after he realizes that he does not deserve this. the same with art show. If Kelly paintings were really good, it would undermine the whole point. ======== ========================================== = <br /> <br / > Then you complain that Karon Kelly and no "chemistry." I believe that it is in the eye of the beholder. I agree that the chemistry is not so strong between them, as on Inna to be, but it was great for me. You can compare it worse "forced" romances like between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "Pride and Passion". ================== ================================ == <br /> <br /> If you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything in this film, it just shows that you do not dig under the surface of the film in its symbolism. Many elements in the dance sequences are stories and characters, and through dance the story resolved through images and symbols. It's about finding love, enjoying in love, loses love (he looks around and his love is gone). Movement symphony is constructed so that a portion of each dance scene represents a separate stage of the Paris art as well as a separate stage of their relationship. If you do not "see that this is not the fault of the film. This, of course, not "nonsense." ==================================================
