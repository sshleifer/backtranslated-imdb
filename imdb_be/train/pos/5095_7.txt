Solomon the king's spear brings us Patrick Swayze (played by Alan Quatermain), who has spent a lot of time in Africa, but decided that it was time to go back to England and be a father to his son. He believes that the parents of his wife took custody of his son, and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with a lot of money for a lawsuit. In comes Alison Deedy (played by Elizabeth), whose father in Africa and carried out with the help of the African tribe for ransom Elizabeth's father sent her cards. Elizabeth is looking Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find his father. <br /> <br /> There is a good shot of secondary characters that go along with Quatermain and Elizabeth, and, of course, there are some enemies (Russian), who want to map, too. <br /> <br /> film does not hold your attention until the end. Patrick again plays smoothly handsome honorable man who comes to the aid of the girl in trouble. Patrick is a great dramatic actor, which can easily portray passion, loss and despair, durable quiet good person, anger and strength; In the Minds of Solomon his character actually smiling a few times. I really would like to see Patrick Swayze in a relaxed living loving story again, the one in which it does not have to be clenched jaw and so strong. Maybe a little dancing will help. But this is a good movie for the whole family and worth the time to watch it.
