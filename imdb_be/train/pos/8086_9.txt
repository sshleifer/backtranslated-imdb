I recently rented the animated version of The Lord of the Rings video after watching a fantastic version of the 2001 live-action film. The Lord of the Rings trilogy of live action directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtably better than George Lucas' Star Wars "prequel" trilogy (Episodes 1-3) will never be a series of real fantasy film of the 21st century! <, Br /> <br /> I remember the animated version as a child, and I do not understand the depth of the film at the time. Now, when I read the book, I realize that the whole story all. Of course, some of the characters pretty stupid, (Samwise Gangee particularly annoying, almost the same as Jerash Jerash Binks in Star Wars Episode One (HORRIBLE!)), But I must say that it is rather closely follows the book, and it comes in part two of the book, the two towers. Good things, that the effect of some interesting and some of the animation is very common because it is time. Bad things that it ends upruptly halfway through the two towers without any result of the quest to destroy the One Ring, Frodo, and the animation looks quite outdated compared to modern standards. <br /> <br /> On the whole, not as bad as many say it. BUT, the live-action version of the 2001 is the new hallmark of Lord of the Rings! At least Bakshi took seriously the script! Peter Jackson said that the cartoon version inspired him to read the book, which in turn led him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film, so that we can at least thank Bakshi on this issue! I will take an animated version of The Lord of the Rings on a live version of Harry Potter any day! <br /> <br /> 7 scale of 1-10, it is much less stringent than the live-action version of the 2001, but not nearly as good! For die-hard fans of the books and the film version of The Lord of the Rings.
