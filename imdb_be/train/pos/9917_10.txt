This is the most opposite documentary I have ever seen. It was a simple and spectacular views of the beautiful ideas. On the basis of photographs of industrial landscapes hidden centered around contemporary China's industrial growth Burtinskaya leads to life facing the problems that we have decided to ignore so easily. <br /> <br /> without taking any political party, this film is a neutral movable image of reality that our Western society does not choose to teach us about. - by-products of economic growth, external factors paid by the citizens of less developed communities, our source of our consumer lifestyle amenities and waste <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, heartbreaking, impossible to ignore. This is a difficult path, but one worth taking - please stop be ignorant and, at least to see these pictures of the truth, without feeling any pressure to take the position of these issues. 10/10 is defined!
