High school friends Kriegman Andre and Cal Gabriel to declare war on their classmates and plan the monstrous attack on their high school. When they start a deadly countdown to their final act of revenge, the two start a video diary to explain their feelings and chronicle their mission. <br /> <br /> There is another similar film, as it is called "Elephant". Why do I bring this up? To compare the two films, of course. I must say, even though I loved "elephant" is a much better film. What's the difference, you ask? Well, for starters, it is removed in many ways, much along the lines of "Cloverfield," "The Blair Witch Project" and "Diary of the Dead." This makes the film the better, because it is much more painful realistic <br /> <br /> But what won me over was that the film was ready to show the "other side of the story.". You will learn the two shooters, in contrast to the "Elephant". I actually cared for one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did. This film really makes you feel sympathy for these people, and that's good, because it's not always black and white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, so I nearly cried in this movie. The characters are real human beings with logic and reasons for their actions. You understand them. It's not like they want to kill people for attention. Overall, this film is an emotional Exciting and very intrusive and far better than the "elephant".
