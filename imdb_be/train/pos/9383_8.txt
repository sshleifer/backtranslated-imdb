From director «Last Seduction» films and "Kill Me Again", comes another film noir. John Dahl has created a niche for itself by creating a film on the theme of adultery, blackmail in the early 90s. Although I did not have a lot of opinions on the last seduction. But now Mr. Dahl refers to directing television shows.Its shame, as the man had talent. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS ** This is a pretty big movie, which revolves around the tramp Cage), which is part of the city for Wyoming. However, it does not prove successful and become mistaken for a hit-man from Texas bar owner J.T Walsh. He is assigned to kill his wife (Boyle). But the cell decides to divide after the adoption of the advance payment, not making it. On the way out of town, he inadvertently hurt guy on the road which he then takes back to the local hospital. At this point, Cage coincidence meets Walsh again, which also seems to be the local sheriff. After that, the cell goes out of his clutches, but also occurs in real hit man, who happens to Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dahl is the co-writer and director of this film. So it goes to show that the project may not be worthy, when the director puts his thoughts on the screen. The direction of a good standard, but while watching the movie I was made feel-TV movie. There were too many close shots. However, this does not keep the film on a pleasurable experience. The film was a good pace and the structure was perfect. Dahl wrote the script with a good length of duration. <br /> <br /> Cage portrayed the role as a tramp really, although I thought his performance somewhat restrained. His facial expressions were great. Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale. Her hair was far away, and can make any guy go on his knees. Hopper also played a role. But I feel that he was miscast for the role. He has not convinced me that he had a quality hit man. The role was not written by retaining their individuality in the form. <br /> <br /> While watching one get deja vu previous films as «The Hot Spot» and "A Perfect Murder". Due to the fact that some areas subov similar. In general, if you are a fan of film noir, then this one is for you. Worth recommending. 7/10
