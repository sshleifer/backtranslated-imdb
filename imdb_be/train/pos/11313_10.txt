Gina Costa (Zhirotti ~ d) is a young and handsome tramp, who comes to the way the bar. He meets a young, beautiful and unsatisfied wife Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai), and her husband is old and thick Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), the owners of the bar. He sells his mechanical skills, some food and shelter, and deals with Giovanna. They both decide to kill Giuseppe, forging into a car accident. Their relationship began to affect the feelings of guilt and the police investigation. This masterpiece ends tragically. Noir and neo-realistic film by Luchino Visconti is outstanding. This is the first time I see this version of `The Postman Always Rings Twice." I loved the 1946 version of Lano Turner version of 1981 where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange are one of the hottest sex scenes in movie history, but this one is definitely the best. My vote is ten.
