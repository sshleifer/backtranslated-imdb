The updated version of the story, which was made into a film in 1938 in England (Return Frog) with respect to harassment by the mother of the criminal police, known as the frog from the frog as a stand (bulging eyes, etc.), it is. <br /> <br /> One of the good Wallace movies of the 1960s is a solid little entertainment. Obviously, under the influence of (or is it the influence), restart Dr. Mabuse films, the frog seems to be more super villain than a master thief. While not the best of the Wallace films, is worth a look. It would make an interesting double feature with stunning early film. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 10 7.
