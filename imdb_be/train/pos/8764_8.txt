Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) have been best friends since forever, and after they are finished, they decided to make a trip to Thailand. Because of the incident, they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him to Hong Kong for the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene are mistaken for drug smuggling heroine, and they are sent to prison. Now it's time for the ultimate survival and true friendship. It was a very good movie, I saw him a couple of times, and after a while you will notice that they have a few holes in the story, but the film still keeps you entertained. Claire Danes has done a great job, as usual, she's a great actress. I would give 8/10 Brokedown Palace
