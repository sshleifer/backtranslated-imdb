Sarah Silverman is a dangerous Bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talent, dark and demonic. I read another "comment" at this show, as well as a message board thing and people just do not get it. Nothing that appears on TV not by chance. Too much money, time and effort is invested in the production of the show for TV there might be an error. This show is stupid, because Sarah wanted it to be silly. This show is a minor, because Sarah wanted a minor. I thought the jokes were great and the theme of the show, as well as other musical numbers surprisingly strange. This is very similar to the Playhouse Pee Wee for maladjusted, slacker twenty-something drug addiction, being a porn star America from the valley. The cast is amazing. Scenarios and actions go well. I hope that the show succeeds because Comedy Central would not let David Spade to keep his show. Who plays his sister Sarah? She was not in the cast list on the home page of the exhibition. I would like to see her standing. Does anyone know about it until the upcoming show dates or DVD-ROM, which can be floating around out there?
