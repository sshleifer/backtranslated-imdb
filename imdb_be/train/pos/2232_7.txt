I saw it when I was 17, and had not seen him since. «CBS Late Movie» is used to display it on a regular basis at one point. I remember how bored and worried it was, it really made me sick. The effects were not then what they are today, but nonetheless, it conveyed a sense of loneliness in the Amazon, after the loss of both parents and seeking a way out, very good. I remember the error and fad thing, so realistic that they have been, are her flesh. It is a dark film that was a controversial subject at the time, although it is likely that he was heavily edited for television. I wish I remembered more details, and if I ever get a chance to see it again, I can comment more. I was looking for it for many years. I believe that it could have been shown on CBS under another name. I have no idea if he was ever released on video.
