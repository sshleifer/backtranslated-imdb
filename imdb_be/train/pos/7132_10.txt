Touching movie. Usually great acting, John Thaw, who passed recently. The man who was always so modest. He was one of Englands top 10 actors of course my time. <br /> <br /> He can be remembered for his famous role of Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 1970s hit series "in Sweeney and as a lawyer in Kavanah QC. A must see for the whole family and a great DVD for my collection. Filming will return a few memories for people who remember the wartime Britain and, of course, those who had been evacuated from London to escape the German bombs. The interaction between the two main characters.Tom and boy William was very well acted and true to the book, Michelle Magorian.
