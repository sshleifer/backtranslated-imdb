I for one was glad to see Jim Carrey in the film, which was not to be on top of the goal. His character, like all of us. Want more - the better things happen to us and waiting for God to spare <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made a great God .. With a sense of humor and a true sense of love for each of us are not yet ready to take a little vacation, if the opportunity arises. <br /> <br /> I thought the character of Jennifer Aniston was too vulnerable and understanding in relation to Kari's basically self-centered anchorman wanna-be, but that's the way it was written. <br /> <br /> I think that previews destroyed several potentially very funny scene because everyone who saw them knew what would happen before it happened. <, Br /> <br /> I read a few reviews, and it seems that some people look too deeply. This summer comedy and is not intended to address the problems of the world, although there are a few reports, we could all take to heart. <br /> <br /> funny film.
