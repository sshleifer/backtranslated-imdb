In 1954, Marlon Brando was an ardent actor after his performance in A Streetcar Named Desire and on the waterfront. Frank Sinatra was still reinvent themselves on the silver screen. But the image of Sinatra as a former Nathan Detroit, helped restore Sinatra with his fans. <br /> <br /> This is a great film version of the beautiful game and the choice of leads and supporting players are terrific. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? It was his one and only singing the role he portrayed Sky Masterson. Besides the female lead, Gene Simmons and Vivian Blaine (replaying her stage role of long-suffering girlfriend of Nathan Adelade), put in a fine effort. Special any going to the big Stubby To (in Nicely Nicely), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton version does not meet the draw with Rockin 'The Boat even approaching Stubby years. Sheldon Leonard, who would have gone to fame as a television producer of shows like Danny Thomas Show and Dick Van Dyke Show makes "Harry Horse" miracles, BSPulley well as harsh manners and rude to say "Big Julie", and even Regis Toomey offers its advantage as a "brother ArvideÂ». <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest musicals to see a good comedy, and you get Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck Be A Lady Tonight" and a brother ... "it's your bones"
