Every time I see most of the reviews, this is called "Eddie Murphy misfire. These critics want to look at some of the things he's doing these days, and may soften its stance in retrospect ..." The Golden Child "is not highbrow entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into an old cliche, Murphy and gives one of his best roles. I do not understand, it fills the lack of "love" for his efforts at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the institution is already weary of wandering, thrill-a-minute adventure? Steven Spielberg began his Indiana Jones; it is unfair to make this one of release, if that, perhaps his greatest sin and completely harmless. There's nothing wrong with trying to be sure to benefit from the trend. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's silly, but even a casual observer would be able to understand that the "ridiculous", where the mystique of Hollywood idea begins and ends. What is more important than the credibility of a story as this is what viewers are entertaining guide on hand to show them the mysterious sights. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the bill for this power just fine. My advice to you is to buy a ticket and take the ride.
