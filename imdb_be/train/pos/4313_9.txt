Grand Canyon to get under very scarce category: it is a very intelligent film, with a very clever dialogue and food for thought in the world from start to finish. I have the impression that he had never done it that does not deserve the rating (and never will), because of its simplicity. This type of wave needs a sensitive observer. It is a pity thought IMDb makes me write ten lines, because it is in no way necessary in the present case. In any case, in order to comply with this request, I can tell you that the weak point of the film, if any is in operation: not that it's bad, but it could have been done much better. An exception is made for Kevin Kline, which was perfect. Go ahead and look.
