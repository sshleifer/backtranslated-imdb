After confused Halloween retransmission classical radio adaptation of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds for the actual Martian invasion, a group of idiotic Martians points on Earth hopes to win only their plans go awry, as they are really one element and really all alone. <br /> <br /> It's really good and often quite funny, with some decent lines (just check slogans) to download. It is likely to appeal to supporters of Sci-Fi. It passed the test of time like seeing it again recently for me, it was much better than I expected it to be. Despite a cast with no-name stars, it may just be the funniest Martian invasion ever put to film. Interestingly, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost all the classic Action Hero / Sci-Fi Hero stereotype is (cool 50s teenage fighter pilot, astronaut, fearless, brave soldiers and kooky scientist). Entertainment for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Prepare to die! Earth brats!"
