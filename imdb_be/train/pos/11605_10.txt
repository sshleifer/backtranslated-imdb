The biggest reason, I had to see this movie, it plays Susan Swift, excellent and all too underestimates the actress. Time travel movies are usually not interested in me and not make movies about witchcraft, but this film was exciting and scary. It does not rely on special effects and outrageous did not focus so much on a journey through time, the viewer is lost and confused. It was a really creative movie simple and focused with great acting by all.
