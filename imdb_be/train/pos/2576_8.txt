I "Christopher Reeve generation", it would be fair to say that he was the best actor to play Superman again, but this does not prevent me from enjoying the other actors in the role, and George Reeves does a pretty good bet to knock Chris off the top although he barely. This does not prevent me from enjoying this film, he has a lot going for it. It has everything that you need to film, the plot from the beginning, middle and end, and all the parts that intelligently written. The film was nervous in the cast and the storyline, the film noir, but with tights. History and an exciting and meaningful, it is a film with a message that is not too didactic. I'm still surprised that was filmed in 12 days, the days of Hollywood glory when we do not have to wait for 5 years just to see if a movie is going to hell ... of film is polished and artfully made, directed by Lee «Roll 'em »Scholem, best known for directing both with speed and efficiency. He never lets the limits of technology to slow it down, in fact there are some creative things to do to create flying effects, including putting on the boom camera on the truck and shooting high and traveling fast, so it looks like we can see it from the point of Superman vision, as a few close-ups of George in the process, and a long shot the animated Superman. <br /> <br /> It's now available on DVD as an additional feature for the first season of the show, George Reeves television. DVD-should possess in its own right, the inclusion of the film in its original whole, the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Give Blood Today, God bless!
