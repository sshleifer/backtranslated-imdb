Having heard very positive reviews and seeing the trailer, I had to see this movie. With William H. Mace, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell imagine it must have been good. And it delivered. In general, the film does not crack, that you are to funny, but there is one scene that really stands out is in my eyes, a classic. The spoiler at the end, where they break through the wall to get to the safe, and we see Rockwell and Washington look at Jeter is fantastic. It is just as well as on stage in The Big Lebowski, which uses the chair Dude barricaded the door, but forgets the door turns out! END SPOILER Just go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.
