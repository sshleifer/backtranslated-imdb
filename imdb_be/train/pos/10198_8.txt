I am grateful to Cesar Montana and his crew in the revival of the once moribund Visayan film undergrowth. «Panaghoy», hopefully a harbinger of revival in the jargon (which requires more speakers than Tagalog). Dialect and lifestyle item exactly resembles this region in the Philippines. Downside: trite and stilted acting US antagonist. Another point, which I did not appreciate was the lack of authenticity in "period" suit of the same nature, and above all, its bright red kit car, which I guess was supposed to pass for a roadster of the 1930s. Without these small details still screaming, «Panaghoy» would have been at least 9 out of 10 on my ranking - daghang Salamatov, Manoy Cesar! Annex: this film is sure beats Peck Gallagi in «Oro, Plata, Mata», which provides a different kind of Visayas during the Second World War. Alos, there are some parts where the cinema back to Spielberg «The Color Purple» and storyline starts to become like a "touchy".
