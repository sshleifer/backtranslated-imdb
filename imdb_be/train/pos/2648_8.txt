Indeed the story of two brothers and daring of their respective falls from grace (through drug addiction), and then redemption. One brother, a self-proclaimed genius played by James Franco your typical sensitive but intelligent man-child. Another brother hardworking future doctor, who becomes less biased, as he becomes a victim of drug abuse when dealing with stressful life to his family's expectations for both children. Not too hard, as the fable of drugs they want to be, and all in all a fairly realistic sketch of family dynamics that problems with drugs achieve. I would recommend it to anyone interested in such studies the nature and give James Franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love.
