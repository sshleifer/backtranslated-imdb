I saw the massacre at the school a few times over the years and always found it was a nice slasher film with an amazing sense of humor, but I never knew that it was filmed in the UK, and I never knew that the actor who plays Marty Rantzen (Simon Skaddamor) committed suicide after the film was released. I believe I saw him last night watching the actors phrasing seems pretty strange to Americans, and some of them are not very good at hiding their English accents. <br /> <br /> All that aside, though it is the history of class nerd, Marty, who is the subject of ridicule from their classmates, and on one particular day, April Fool's Day, he lured the girls into the locker room one Caroline Munro (as playing teenager) and humiliated great time on the tape. Of course, the coach catches the band at work and all they gave a vigorous workout to punish them, but not before a couple of guys to slip Marty joint that he is trying to smoke in the chemistry lab, but it's full of what makes him sick and when he runs in the toilet, one of its slipping and puts classmates chemical that interacts with something Marty mixes, which leads to the emergence of fire and spillage of the bottle in nitric acid, which leaves poor Marty burned and badly injured. <br /> <br /> ten years later, this same gang, headed by their reunion in Doddsville High good old, which seems odd boards and inaccessible, but thanks to the ingenuity they manage to get and find a place seemingly abandoned ... In addition, there is a room where dinner and thought the liquor and therefore, of course, they eat, drink and be merry. For soon they will die, of course. <br /> <br /> Banda went one after the other figure in the clown mask, but it can be Marty? They do not know, they believe that it is either in a madhouse or work at IBM, they are not sure what. But whoever it is, he makes quick work of them. Especially disgusting is a girl who takes a bath to wash the blood from her one of their classmates whose insides popped all over her when he drank the poisoned beer. She is a victim of an acid bath, which I think may have been one of the sections, originally carved into the tape version, because it seemed like an additional disgusting, when I looked at this time. I could be wrong, but I think it is not on the tape. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there are a few of the spiral endings, and contain pictures entirely on the tape, I think. There's also a bit of exposure at an early stage, which also cuts out, but other than that I did not notice when there are other bits in this uncut version, probably yes, but it's been a while since I last saw him. <, Br /> <br /> In any case, if you're a fan of the 80-chopper clicks and then catch a new release DVD, because it's a fun slasher with a good atmosphere and feel to it. 7 10.
