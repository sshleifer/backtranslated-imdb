When scientists have behaved in such a way that H.G. Wells was sure that they will be in the future, the story was not quite turn out the way it was in the stuff. There were almost 80 years past the point that Wells wrote the shape of things to come, on which this film is based, and no closer to a world that he describes than before, in a sense further. <br /> <br /> While such well-known players like Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson, Cedric Hardwicke in the cast, they are more than real characters cartoons. This is the main weakness of the film, it is dedicated to the philosophy of science Wells solve all the problems, and the rest of us backward fools. <br /> <br /> Weight characters, two generations of the same family that holds a highly optimistic, Cedric Hardwicke skeptic who experiences a person carries too far ahead. And Ralph Richardson captain emerged from the destruction of thirty years of war fought with modern weapons. By the way, as the atomic bomb, was not invented, poisonous gas was considered a weapon that almost destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> According to Wells, Science and conquest never mix. Scientists as a group is too politics over the world to deal with such things. During the life of scientists Wells, of course, ran out right fascist Hitler and Mussolini governments. The same people, however, in order to defeat them, subordinate ally themselves to form atomic weapons, to build in the modern era. If they behaved as Wells would like them, someone like Albert Einstein would have led the junta to scientists who have established a new order after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Wells got it wrong both during and in the development. He probably never imagined the computer, as well as nuclear energy. Programmers are much more likely to be leaders in our brave new world than scientists currently. Still Things To Come, assisted by William Cameron Menzies and kits by offering an interesting glimpse into the minds of H.G. Wells, of course, a respected thinker of his time, although he did not quite get the right shape of things.
