"How to Lose Friends and Alienate People" is an entertaining, when loose, adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. This is also a great title for helping to fill the demand line in the reviews IMDb! The main essence is the same as the book with some dramatized incidents, but the romantic plot is added and the end, of course Hollywoodised. Simon Pegg, despite playing a man irritates significantly, it is usually nice and funny, and he pretty much carries the film. It is strange to think a few years ago it was just a TV sitcom guy, and now he's rubbing shoulders with Hollywood names. There's a good supporting cast, and it's fun, easy hours - kind of male "Ugly Betty", but funnier.
