My girlfriend and I have a thing for robots. So I try to look for movies that have the robots. And this film is a robot. Large. They beat clang and scribbling from each other, with the fate of nations hangs in the balance. It's really cool. You have to forgive the film its many flaws and just try to assess what the director and his team of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget. It is very difficult to love this movie. Because of these big robots. They looked like Transformers and they fought, as a fighter! This made my friend a smile. And that's good enough for me. And especially anyone should be done with the veteran character actor Paul Kos as manic Russian Villain, will he ruthlessly trampled their pitiful opponent after they had surrendered or complain that their proximity to him at the bar called him vodka taste of "blood" (a line he delivers a magical mannerisms sub-Bela Lugosi accent) it is clearly having a ball and the film benefits immensely whenever he is on screen. This is a great little film that deserves a cult reputation.
