I must say I was surprised by the quality of the film. It was much better than I expected. The script and the action is pretty good. The director did a good job as well. Although some scenes seem a bit clumsy, it's a decent film in general. The idea was, of course, brilliant and really do not reveal themselves until the very end. mental hospital atmosphere has been given pretty good. The site was a clear, consistent and well designed. Some people may find it a bit boring, though, since the storyline is very focused and they take their time on character and plot development. Moral of the story, it's a decent film for its genre, and it's surprisingly good.
