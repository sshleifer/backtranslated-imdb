This film is similar to the 1950 version of Scola in Brutti sporchi x cattivi. Less sex and less realistic, but the tale with great warmth and humanism. I would not call it neo-realist painting. This is a very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and probably should be classified as a comedy, although it deals with serious issues (a bit like Chaplin or 1930 comedy). A typical Italian though, very emotional, and it's hard to resist a stone cold than humans. Sentimentalism is disappointing, although this pattern was not supposed to be realistic drama. This is not a masterpiece as Umberto D or bicycle thief. But this is an attractive and funny comedy, with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
