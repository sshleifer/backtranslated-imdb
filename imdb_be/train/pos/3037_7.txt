The film "MacArthur" begins and ends at the General Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata the United States Military Academy at West Point on the Hudson. We see a fragile 82-year-old Gen.MacArthur give rise to speech in the graduating class of 1962 is that it is an honor to serve my country. The film then moves in almost two hour long retrospective on General MacArthur's brilliant and controversial career that started in the darkest hours of World War II on the island beleaguered Corregidor in the Philippines in the early spring of 1942 <br /> <br /> ordered to leave the island it is for Australia to the Japanese military invasion of its General MacArthur for the first time in his military career almost did not obey a direct order from his chief of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O'Herlihy. Feeling that it would be deserting their people in their greatest hours of need MacArthur reluctantly, with his wife and young son, he did what he was told only that it haunted him for the reminder of the war. It is this reason, his escape under fire from death or captivity of the Japanese, which forced General MacArthur used his influence to get FDR two years later, to launch a major invasion of Philippians, instead of the island of Formosa, to back up his promise and the Filipino people, as well as thousands of American prisoners of war were left behind. That he will not come back, and come back to the power of the army and navy of the US Navy, to reinforce his promise! <br /> <br /> During the two years until the invasion of the Philippines, General MacArther beating Japanese forces at noon Pafific in a number of brilliantly conceived island hop battles, isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops to surrender. General made that suffering is much smaller US military casualties, any other allied commander in the Pacific war! <br /> <br /> It was in the 1950-51 Korean War that General MacArthur has reached its most brilliant victory, as well as its worst military defeat. After passing the approaching North Korean Army in brilliant and perfectly executed from the bursting of the US Marine Corps suffered less than 100 casualties, the tailgate or the left hook invasion at Inchon Gen. MacArther feeling invincible sent US / UN forces under his command in the very border along the Yalu River, the Communist Red China. This was announced on his subordinates, he is faced with the threat of a mass attack the Communist Chinese troops of General MacArthur pressed in any case, until the attack was not materialized cutting US and UN forces in pieces. Stop wave after wave of attacking Red Chinese troops forced the US / UN forces to retreat to the "Big Bug OutÂ» in 1950 with most of their lives, leaving all their equipment behind, across the border of North Korea, even abandoning the South Korean capital of Seoul! It was one of the greatest military disaster in US history with a losing record of US forces in the Korean War, 1,000 lives in the first day of November. 29/30 1950 communist Chinese invasion! <br /> <br /> shocked and humiliated that he allowed, mainly due to their own arrogance to occur MacArthur went on the offensive not against the advancing Communist Chinese and Koreans Notes forces, but his own commander and Chief Pres. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, it does not have the back or the courage to do what needs to be done: to launch a full scale invasion of communist China with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent his army from overrunning the Korean Peninsula! For Pres. Truman, who took just about enough debris from General MacArthur in his mouth dripping in public that he was mishandling the war in an entirely laid out as MacArthur wanted him, against the Red Chinese, it was the last straw! On April 11, 1951 Pres. Truman was unceremoniously relieved of his command of General MacArthur as Supreme Commander of the US / UN forces in Korea! President bold, but very unpopular decision Trumeo well, do not go along with the general military strategy MacArthur, prevented a third world war to break out with the allied countries of the Soviet Union, Communist China, which at that time, both in the US had a nuclear bomb! President Truman's controversial decision "to dump a very popular General MacArthur also cost him re-election in 1952 with his poll numbers so low in the mid 20's-, that he went in March this year, the president of the US campaign! <br /> <br /> in General MacArthur was a misfortune to be around when the political and military climate in the world changed in how to conduct future wars. with the horrors of nuclear war now, in 1950-51, the reality would be national suicide to by all forces, as General MacArthur wanted the red Chinese it is very possible that triggered the nuclear catastrophe that would engulf not only the United States the Soviet Union and Red China, but the whole world! It was that important to the reality of a future war, General MacArthur never taught as A and H Bomb is not yet were invented, at West Point. <br /> <br /> By 1962, we now see that Gen. MacArthur, after his opening speech production in West Point, was both older and wiser than men, and after his retirement from the armed forces of the USA, an elder in his feelings about the war and the complete uselessness of this. One thing that General MacArthur taught at an early age from his general civil war dad Douglas MacArthur Sr, that stuck to him all his life, that the soldier, as the war itself should be the last, not the first resort in resolving issues between the two countries. In fact, it is the soldiers who must fight and die in it. It took a lifetime, with the advent of the nuclear age, to General MacArthur finally understand how well and wisely his father Congressional Medal of Honor winner, as he really was!
