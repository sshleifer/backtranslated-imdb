I'm not much of an expert to the current or other parts movies, but this film just hit me deeply. I do not think that I ever forget. One scene in particular (I think that anyone who has seen the film will know, one of which I speak) is stored in my brain. <br /> <br /> I also like watching the film Lilja 4-ever (as mentioned earlier comment). It was very touching, but not quite as straight to the point and rigid. If you are sensitive at all, or will bring tears to your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol (Sun's Angels) can stay with you forever. <br /> <br /> This is a very sad thing, but I think, no, I hope that the film will turn out, attracting more attention to him. <br /> <br /> More and more people need to see this film !!!!!!
