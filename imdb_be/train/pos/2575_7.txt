I made this film with Netflix for two reasons - I was in the mood for what I thought it would be foolish "50s sci-fi, the ASCO and because it is the first feature film Superman. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I found myself fully occupied and very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the ground and closes the sponsor. Lois and Clark is to get the scoop, but disappointed that not the deepest well ever drilled longer be in operation. A day later, strange things in the well to make the story more suitable for Superman than Clark Kent. It seems that the radioactive Mole Men broke into their home six miles deep near the Earth's core. <br /> <br /> supermen and the Mole Men is a simplified, but well-made piece of social realism. Released in 1951, starring leading actor, who served during the Second World War, the moral of the story, it seems that the Americans are just as capable to become fascists like no other. To drive this point in typically direct way Superman, Reeves even accuses lynching hunting Mole men to be Nazis in some time. <br /> <br /> Even in the 1950s, the science behind the film was not there. Six miles of drilling through the continental crust had not even penetrated into the upper mantle, not to mention the "hollow center of the earth" - that, in any case, there is forgiven -.. Keep in mind that this film is based on the golden age of comics <br / > <br /> The film is a little uneven developing. Although mole interesting and a little creepy, and beautifully painted, there are a few scenes Kormann-squire who spend too much time unnecessarily showing us his strange behavior. The script is smart and economical. By today's standards, it costumes poor fair, but for piles th time special effects of this film and costumes were pretty good. The cinematography and overall very good, and the effect is much better than one would expect. I was particularly impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
