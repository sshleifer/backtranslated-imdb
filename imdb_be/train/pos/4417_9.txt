This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes of an eleven-year boy living in rural areas of the Cuban city of the year of Castro's revolution. This is obviously a real labor of love worthy. <br /> <br /> The name Cuba Libre and Cuban blood is just trying to sell it as a wrong action film. DREAMING Julia has a lot more sense. It has more in common with the European cinema than with RAMBO and revolution is the only disadvantage of the daily life and activities of people. This fact alone makes the film more honest than most studies of this time period in the history of Cuba. <br /> <br /> Excessive use of voice-over narrator does undermine the story, but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from Hollywood movies that tell so much more visual than could the narrator. <br /> <br /> comparisons Cinema Paradiso and fair play, as the film makes the wax melancholy about movies, but there is an underlying pain of loss of life, surpassing a lost love. <br /> <br /> The revolution, as the film JULIE, never seems to have an end.
