Usually musicals in the 1940's were a set of formulas - and if you studied films you know what I'm talking about - some running Lenghth, very "spectacular" performances that were great on the surface, but do not hit the real faces of the characters, etc. d. <br /> <br /> This one MISCELLANEOUS - and light years better and is worth a nomination for the best film of the year - 1945 (although there was no chance of beating the eventual winner - Lost Weekend). <, Br /> <br /> Gene Kelly he was probably in the best shape of his career - yes, I know about the "American in Paris" and "Singin 'in the Rain." This one is different. He really get into the character of a "sea dog" thinking (on the ground), that "picking up any girl while on vacation" is nothing more than a lark And if you were to create a "story" to get it. - so it will not be - yet seems like Music Man, when he gets "his foot caught in the door.". Final fun movie stems mainly from him and his new friend (Sinatra) 's attempt to make "history" good to "get the girl" that he actually and unexpectedly falls in love with. You'll have to watch the film to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are so many other elements of a great movie in that it is the classic story of a friend, a nostalgia to the time when World War II was almost over (the war ended about a month after the release of films), awareness that guy who is always laughing life can learn that it is actually a great man, great songs and maybe some of the other elements of a classic film that I can not think of right now. <br /> <br /> Why not 10? Towards the end - almost 2 1/2 hours begins to feel a bit long. There is a small number of ballet, Gene Kelly doing this was a sensation in 1945, but seems to be on, and feels like it just adds minutes now. But in general, these are definite winner at every level.
