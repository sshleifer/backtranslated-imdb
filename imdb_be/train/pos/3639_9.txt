This movie, to me, the family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream, not only for himself but also for his family. I can not tell you how I was able to tell my little girl that Daddy was going to Kansas City to cover Priest Holmes, Kansas City. It seems that this is the coolest thing, as the son of Maurice did. Dreams of a family is that it is one of the. I think that only a father who has a close relationship with his family can truly appreciate what made Jimmy Morris.
