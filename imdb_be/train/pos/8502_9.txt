Gung Ho is one of those movies that you want to see again and again. Michael Keaton put in charge of courting the Japanese car company to come to such a way that his city job creation for Hadleyville residents. What happens after that one hilarious moment after another. Two cultures collide and Keaton to keep things together. Look at the great performances from Keaton, Hedda Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, cox Yamomura and Sub Shimomo. All perfectly cast. Not rated fooled low numbers. It's in my book 7.5. It is interesting to note that the name of the city Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville, but in Oregon.
