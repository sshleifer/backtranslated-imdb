This episode is perhaps grew from the Cold War. There was a Holocaust, but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson came through a whole. Then he turns into a battle for turf. It attracts to it, and vice versa, but the survival instinct takes over. This quiet, slow moving, chess fight when they are trying to build trust. They come to a truce but distrust takes over and they start again. Of course, men's women's role comes into play sixties and modern viewers might find what she needs to go for it a bit offensive. But it's still fun and interesting. Because it does not say that we do not know here the mind is very good, but in the end we can suppose.
