I have not read the novel, although I understand that this is a little different from it; the fact that I'm quite enjoying this, coupled with the fact that it actually is not my genre, leads me to the decision not to conduct a book reading. Having not read a word of Austen's letters, I really can not compare it to any of her work. I can say that almost every line of dialogue in this smart, witty, and well supplied, as well as the biggest source of comedy in it. It made me laugh out loud a lot, with a lovely British and verbal material. Each active execution spot- and Paltrow completely nails the role of a matchmaker. The characters are well-written, trustworthy and consistent. I found some of them very annoying, however, and while I think that at least some of this was supposed to be funny, it tends to get repeated over and it honestly was not funny the first time they appeared. Editing and cinematography are unusual, and it looks absolutely gorgeous. The plot and pacing are great, you never get bored. It ends on * really * in the obvious way, but maybe that's what those audiences prefer. I can not argue that it did not feed me, it was from the beginning to the end, and I would watch it again. There is a short in this language. I recommend it to any fan of love stories. 7/10
