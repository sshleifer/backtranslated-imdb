"Sandra, making women" is a standout among exploitation films, and so for two reasons: (1) a great, but without effort, productivity Monica Gayle, and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was at the helm of the project. . These two talents, both of which are very undervalued, making "Sandra," a film that should be seen <br /> <br /> Another key element of the success of the film is its realism - there's nothing fake or "Hollywood" on this film is a lot-in-California. It really is a slice of life. The modest house where Sandra lives in the very beginning of the film, simple dresses, which have the character, the scene where Sandra wakes up one morning to find Uschi Digard bouncing on her front door, and Sandra sit on the couch without make- up, at the while Digart trying to sell her some make-up, looking really like she just woke up (but still beautiful), a harmless pervert Sandra picks who likes making love to her, when he wears a bra, one-room apartment in which Sandra moves --all of these elements of the film given quite real, and as such, the viewer is drawn into the small world of Sandra from the start and immediately takes an interest in her and want her to succeed. Sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity, and she goes with a lot of class. <br /> <br /> This film could have easily failed less skilful hands, and could have gone in any direction from the usual sexploitation, but Garver / Gale team ensure that "Sandra" is not only the creation of the woman, but the production great movie.
