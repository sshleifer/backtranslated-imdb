I was surprised by the low rating this film has received from viewers. I saw him one late night on TV, and it got to the point - I actually think it was in 1989, when he first appeared. However, I remember it very well, with a good twist or two, and an interesting atmosphere at the wind farm. Michael Pollard looks shabby suitable for the role, which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled promises early in his career, and all the rest of the game it is pretty straight forward. I would definitely recommend it as a rental, though some of those might seem a bit nervous in 1989, now may seem tame, which is a shame, given that the modern "anxiety" is often used only as a necessary marketing tool kind of like only required to be seen.
