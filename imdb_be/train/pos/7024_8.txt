I just saw this film in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked on it, so I thought I'd check it out. I thought it was really beautiful film and I can not wait to go see it again. the actors were really good, and I loved all of the music! there was a lot of talk in the film, which is first felt a little strange-, but once I got into it, I thought that the story and the action was very emotional and meaningful, and thought that he had left a lot to the imagination. I want to see the movie again, because there was so much going on in it, that I had forgotten a lot of small things, but I know that I left the theater thinking about the film. He was shot beautifully, and it was truly unique.
