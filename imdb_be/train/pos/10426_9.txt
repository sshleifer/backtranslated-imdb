I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the idea that everything is free, and that, of course. Characters in the company do not really like their "real" life, but they are enjoying themselves, that is what they were. The film did a good job making this an easy day, a good memory. Good memory includes not only romantic feelings about the beautiful stranger and beautiful European city, but definitely a deeper discussion of the value of life. Many films like this in terms of the discussion of definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or of any of them. Before sunrise to do with this a good way that makes the viewer pause and think and regulate breathing and going to watch the film. Before sunrise Sun tried to instill a certain idea in my head. He just called you to think about some of the issues in everyday life, and gave you a few alternative opportunities. This made conversations between the characters interesting, and not just the typical whining complaints and flowing stupid idea. You would have to think about these issues for themselves and the next line of interesting stories. The end is not very important in the end. You could have something out of it and feel something good or positive about themselves after the film. Films should be pleasant. It's a nice movie and well worth your time to watch it. I'm on the road, too. The film once represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.
