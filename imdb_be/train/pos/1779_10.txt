I love this movie! 10 of 10 hands down! This is something pretty damn good! I'm not a big fan of movies, but I must tell you that this one opened my eyes. Surprisingly fast color and energy. I was lucky enough to catch it in the screening during Zoinks! Film Festival in Boston, and the story really gripped me from the beginning. It was a lot of adult themes and character, and when it was over, I wanted more. I hope they make a sequel. That would be interesting. My only issue with it performance Melissa Connor, Anya. UGH! It sucks! I saw a block of wood to get the best performance. I do not what the director was thinking when he threw it. But if you ignore it, you can not help but to give this movie a big TEN !!!
