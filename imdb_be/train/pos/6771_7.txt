so yes, it's quite nostalgic to watch the first episode, because this is one episode I definitely remember. I love to watch the first season and even compared to the show action we have now this show seems inaccurate. but to be honest I like "less violent" part of the show and the storyline has more substance than new now. I thought it was interesting that Airwolf and Belisario lasers have a similar theme - leading actor (Hkee and damage) and looking towards the Interior Ministry (brother, father). I wonder if the personal life imitates Robert Belisario in these 2 shows theme <br /> <br /> The question -. Does anyone have photos of Hawk cabin. I love this cabin (such as mines dream cabin), and this is one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf.
