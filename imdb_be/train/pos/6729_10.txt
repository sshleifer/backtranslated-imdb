If you've seen Dogtown and Z-Boys, or have any interest in seeing the real, caricature-nya, "Real American" side of America, Riding Giants struck deeper than anything you've seen before. <br /> <br /> this film is 'unreal', indulgent life, if ever there was one, but very useful, if you can get any form of literal meaning of it - it is 100% of the actual documentary film, but with all the drama opera, and it is clear, the feeling of love, an expert and knowing, buried in direction and story Stacy Peralta, the film expertly leads you from the swell on the big waves, while keeping you fully captured in all that you are given the privilege to see. <br /> <br /> This film is a symphony, created as Beethoven 9, starting with its beautiful prelude in Hawaii, drawing deeply on the human emotions in Santa Cruz and ending din, solemnity and crescendo in Laird Hamiltons feats again in Hawaii. <, Br /> <br /> As well as classical music; 9th symphony of Beethoven, Ride of the Valkyries or barbers adagio for strings, it can only be a part of you like, but it's worth it. Trust me.
