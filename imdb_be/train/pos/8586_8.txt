Welcome to Kiefer Sutherland. it's been too long since you were in the movie and the movie ,, it was, it was 24 NO ,, but very intriguing, especially with pros like Michael Douglas in the lead as the combat readiness Secret Service agent. Kiefer is one character chasing Michael Douglas the film ,, partner Kiefer ,, ,, Eva Longoria desperate houswife. wow she can actually act, except flirt all day and look good ,, I want at least that Basinger was great role ,, but other than that, I do think that the whole film was a blast from start to finish. This film, I think B is, political thriller, all played their part to the end. nothing was open sooon film ,, so to keep you guessing at all times. and I really think that the Kiefer did a hell of a job here, in this film ,, but, in my opinion, Michael Douglas had besxt performance day ,, thumbs up.
