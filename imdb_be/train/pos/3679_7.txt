I just reviewed the film two days ago, and I was full of expectations, that Paris is my second favorite city in Europe, and I spent a very romantic 18 months there in the 80s. I was somewhat disappointed that the majority of this group of vignettes, while the original and masterfully done, not to seize the "light" and the beauty of the city is very well.Nor enough romance! We saw none of the shady boulevards ... There was not too much darkness, not only literally, but figuratively. Some of the sites seemed to manipulate the viewer and let him / her "flat" (Marais sequence, a sequence of traveling salesman hairstyle, to give two examples). Raising good: the sequence of MIM, cemetery, Montmartre (although it left too much for the audience to understand), the vignette "Cowboy", and Sacre Coeur-- seemed few and far between, and I would like to see such a wonderful actor Orlando Bloom to be in something that would demonstrate its novelty anymore.
