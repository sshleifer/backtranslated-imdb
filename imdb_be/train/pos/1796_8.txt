I caught the evening to the movies with a friend. Evening chick flick without any excuses for what are, but I can say with some relief that it was not so infused with estrogen, it hurts to watch a full-blooded man. for instance one at the very end of the film except I watched with interest and must not turn away or roll his eyes at any self-indulgent melodrama. Houses, in turn, will love this film. <br /> <br /> Anne Lord elderly, bedridden and spending her last days on earth as comfortable as possible in their own home with two adult daughters at her side. Scattered memories of his past, Anne suddenly screams, the men her daughter had never heard before: Harris. While her daughter silently contemplate the importance of a strong urge his mother to recall and correct its ill-fated romance with the mysterious man in it all the time, Anne slips back into her head that fateful day when she met Harris - and still so lost youth optimism for the future that we are all part of the way of the inevitable <br /> <br /> and Ann and her two daughters - one. married with children, one serial «commitophobe» - the struggle with the central question of whether there is really a true love, and, perhaps more importantly, when true love can stand the test of time. Are we all destined to one day realize that love never lasts forever? Can we all understand that the solution for the imperfect is the only real result? Thin fact that at the age of Anne are still struggling with the answer to these questions, before his death is not lost on her two daughters <br /> <br /> cinema for the evening interesting. - a large part of the film is spent on Ann mind as she reminisces about the past, and for this reason I think that the movie was filmed, as if all this was intentionally overexposing to give everyone an unearthly glow (and therefore make it quite it is obvious that this is not real, but there was in the past). Claire Danes is excellent (being to be really, really high, although only 5 '5 "in reality), and absolutely charming in one climactic scene where her singing talents, finally put to the test. <br /> <br /> you can not really talk trash about the cast, which leads off with Claire Danes and does not let out :. Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wilson, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close fill the other major and minor roles in the film <br /> <br /> I can not say anything bad about this movie at all, although the fight Hugh Dancy, to have your character to get out of the total . At the end of a one-dimensional complete loss Playing spoiled, pretty drunk offspring with indecently rich, which poses a great bravado, but secretly scared ran never amounted to anything, probably will not offer much in the way of research of character - he had his orders and stuck to it <br /> <br. /> at the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, your friend probably cry, and while you probably will not feel nearly as victims, the evening certainly will not be a waste of time expended watching evening. Catch it in theaters or capture it as a rental to exchange for points, if you want to accompany to view Hard 4 or upcoming Rambo flick. It will be your little secret, that this view does not cost you much at all.
