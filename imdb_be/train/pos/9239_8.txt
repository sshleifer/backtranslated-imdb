As I said in my comments on the first part: The two films are better than most admit Fiction Fans <br /> <br /> The script in the second film is not something that is moving, as we did not see destruction. human civilization, but the consequences of thousands of refugees fleeing into the small space canisters protected by only one powerful spaceship. <br /> <br /> but when there Battlestar Pegasus, the story heats up, carrying the battle back to the Cylons Planet Well, he has a bit of Mad Max, because they are fighting for is the fuel for your spacecraft to go on to find a remote Earth, but it works for me. This exciting entertainment fantasy featuring prominent actors and decent special effects (although they tend to recur, to say the least :-)). <br /> <br /> I would love to follow-up with Starbuck and Apollo on the board. Instead, we got a second sequel without any characters in the name, who proved that the story worked before, especially because it features characters so well chosen ... <br /> <br /> So thumbs down for statement 1980, but not bad for two films in 1978.
