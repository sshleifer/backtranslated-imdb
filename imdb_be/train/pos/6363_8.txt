I was pretty fans of the series as a child, and after that it was always in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that have made a difference in the early 80s from the previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait une fois l Â«Homme ..., most of which I love). I believe that other similar Japanese cartoons of this kind released later may be different Mazinger Z, as they have become boring to repeat the same pattern. <br /> <br /> This is the novelty may be one of the best features of Mazinger Z. Another good point is its inventiveness, with so many extravagant monsters, strange devices and whimsical characters; in fact, we were ready to see every new contribution to learn what new villain or evil machines we are waiting!
