Interesting thriller, having Paul Winfield as a detective in a murder case. Paul Winfield was underrated actor who took all their roles with such ease that it was hard to say, even a man acts. Perhaps the most famous young audiences as the voice / narrator «City Confidential», Winfield ends his career with a so-so film; but, as always, shines Winfield. Fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Erika Eliniak well, Erika Eliniak, nice to look at, but leaves much to be desired in the acting department. Although, frankly, this is one of his best efforts <br /> <br /> The result :. Watchable thriller that should not be missed either fan Paul Winfield. Decent TV movie to help send Paul Winfield off to celluloid heaven. Which actor. He will be missed.
