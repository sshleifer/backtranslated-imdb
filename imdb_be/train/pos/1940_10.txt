I was really impressed with this film. Drafting was fantastic, and the characters were rich and simple. It is very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them. The creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real-life characters, and the audience get sucked right into their world. In addition, the music is terrific. They used some non-party to make an account, and some of the soundtrack, and they do a fantastic job of adding to the film. If you have a chance to catch the film in a small theater or a festival (as I did), I highly recommend you go see it. Also, on a personal note, Paget Brewster beautiful in this film. This is reason enough to go check it out.
