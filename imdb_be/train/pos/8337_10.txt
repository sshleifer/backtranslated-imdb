I am a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, so when he saw a large number of these films, it is rare that one seems quite unique. However, just rare that I gasped through laughter during some scenes. The love story of a little thin on the ground, but I would say that's probably for the better, as this romantic comedy is the emphasis firmly on the "comedy", and in any case, it stretches the boundaries of trust just a little more than I like the most room com to make. Four scientists presented some of the funniest moments, not only in this film, but in any movie I've seen in a long time. I hesitated earliest moments before finally choosing "10" to "9" in the ranking, because I think that too many people use it indiscriminately, and thus the maximum rating is losing some of its influence. I'm also a big fan of Meg Ryan, which helps, but it is one of the few films that I saw, which I would say that it fully blighted. She and Tim Robbins cast as the lead, but for me to play second fiddle to the clumsy antics of intellectuals. This laugh out loud movie type.
