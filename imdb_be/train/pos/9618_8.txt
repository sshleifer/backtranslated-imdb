I recently bought this movie, and I do not regret it at all as a matter of fact, I beg you to have the movie to add to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, filmmakers, it took less than a month to shoot and spent about one million euros to make a great movie. This proves that not only large production make great movies. <br /> <br /> The title of this film fits perfectly. In computer language BUG is a mistake in a program that causes a reaction in the computer functions. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also the great moments of beauty. In the dizzying events in this film begins with the death of BUG. A man witnessed the "crime" on the other side of the road ... there and then everything gets complicated ... <br /> <br /> I show John Carroll Lynch ( "FargoÂ»), Wallece, people who can not make it right to all.
