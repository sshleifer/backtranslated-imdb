This film has a strong philosophical end. But this ending is only useful when you are watching a movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Youth alienation at the end of the 1960s, from the point of view of a young man and a young woman, obviously the theme of "Zabriskie Point". Neither Mark nor Frechette Daria Halprin was a lot of acting experience, and the fact that actually enhances the film's message. With untrained actor conveys a sense of realism, since both players seem emotionally detached from the bustle around them. <br /> <br /> This is not a script-driven film. during the first ten minutes of exception, this is basically a visual with the stunning cinematography. Excellent naturalistic system seems otherworldly, and completely in sync with the emotional departure of Mark and Darius. <br /> <br /> I would replace thematically weak Pink Floyd music with more compelling music The Doors. Many scenes are calling Â«Riders On The Storm". <br /> <br /> However, I like this movie. These are different; is unique; This artistic and imaginative. And the desert barren beautiful. <br /> <br /> As the years go by, "Zabriskie Point", it seems more and more attractive. He conveys the mood of the late 1960s in America. This amazing work of art, in a bohemian sort of way. And the last eight minutes of the film philosophically fascinating.
