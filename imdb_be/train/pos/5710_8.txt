groundbreaking music Rene Clair. If you want to see where the songs first drove the history of this place. This is a story about a hungry young artist, who believes that he won the lottery, as well as his creditors come calling. Unfortunately, his ticket in his coat, which is located in his apartment and girlfriends were given switched convicted perspective, which is then ... oh, but it could speak. <br /> <br /> This is a light and frothy story, where most of the dialogue is sung (most people think it does not happen to Oklahoma and Andrew Lloyd Webber). Its a kind of film that they do not do more, and rarely did when they did. His sound film from the early days, that plays like a movie with five or six years. Clair moves his camera around so that does not even Busby Berkeley (though, to be honest comparison of the two filmmakers is unfair, as Berkeley does basically intertwined stage dances and Clair moves the camera through the "real world"). His amazing little film. and its magical movie that just make you smile. It's just a piece of furry fun. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can not say more. It's just a good little film and it really is all you need to know.
