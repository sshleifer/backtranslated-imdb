This last Dutch film Verhooven it made me laugh well. As a movie buff, looking at all the little details and cross-references, etc. in any film, I can assure anyone who is interested in cinema, that this part of entertaining all the senses. I have not read Gerard Rêves book on which the film is based, but I still believe that we have opened a picture a few smug poet / writer who receives it (on the road - without messing up here). Antihero characters in environments that have their ambiguous intentions, as well as he. All this is packaged in gorgeous cinematography, Paul Verhopven manages to turn the other way pretty cute «gesellich (?)» Dutch seats in the alarm setting film noir, impressive job!
