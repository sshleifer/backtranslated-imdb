I've never been a big fan of horror movies. They usually try to cheap tricks to scare its audience as loud noises and creepy children. They tend to be lacking in originality and contain replays galore. The only horror film I'd Mix Echoes with Kevin Bacon. He was well-acted, and had a long history. But he joined and possibly even exceeded Stanley Kubrick Bright, quite possibly the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> The film is behind the writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family, who are willing to watch the hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors about the place, and the ghosts of the last inhabitant of crazy and killed his family. But Jack is convinced that everything will be fine, and he can use silence to overcome his writer's block. After several months of solitude and silence, however, Jack becomes grumpy and later enforced. Whether it's cabin fever or there is something in the hotel, which is the driving force behind it wisely? <br /> <br /> One of the worst parts of the film the feeling of isolation that makes Kubrick. The hotel is very quiet, and a huge number, but it is always empty. It is also terribly calm when son Jack rides his bike through the sterile corridors. performance of Jack Nicholson is also one of his best, scaring the hell out of me and makes me sure to get one once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost inside the refrigerator shower. <br /> <br /> Naked tops for a horror movie, in my opinion, beating the snot out of shit, like rings and Blair Witch Project. This may be a little old, but certainly Goody. 8/10
