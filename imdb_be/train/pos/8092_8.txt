I stumbled on this film as 8-10 years in the cold, dark day in November. I was out playing all day, freezing, and when I came around 4 pm, I had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of a TV with a blanket. I was surprised, watching the cartoon, which was not all happy and silly - and was really dark and moralistic. He captured my imagination. I'm sure he does not fall into the text, and is reduced in all the wrong places for Tolkien purists. But it still captures the spirit of history, the choice to bear the burden for others, the consequences of selfish, rash decisions, etc. Quality animation leaves no room for complaints. But one place where this movie is clearly dominates the new voice of the characterization of the films. John Hurt big in this. If you do not like the way the character is drawn, to look away, and just listen to him. His voice is unusual. I've seen it again many, many times, and it always takes me back to that time, as a child, eager for a magical adventure. It is for this reason that I say "lucky", the film is nostalgic for me, so I keep in mind its drawbacks. But between John Hurt and imagination of Tolkien, it is still up to me, and still.
