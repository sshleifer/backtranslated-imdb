I liked this movie ,, sweet and funny.I found this film to be a good family film.the dirty part of this movie was when he made reference to the New York Yankees. You must have the Red Sox nation, to realize that the New York Yankees dirty word.Sorry say fans.I Yankee recommend this picture to all family.Of of course, with your typical love / comedy ,, there is a long time in the film ,, I'm in love with and that I do ,, but the film adds to it with all the farce moments.The movie show it some points of how the nation's Red Sox (at Fenway Park), how the fans felt about 86 years old Sox always tight at the end of season, and the Sox as love and love with the other person go hand in hand.
