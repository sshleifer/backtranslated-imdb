I saw this episode more than any other TFTC episode, is that nice. And that's pretty scary, but all in good fun disgusting. Woman kills her 2nd husband, but runs into trouble when an escaped maniac in a ragged Santa Claus meeting decides to pay her and her little girl on a visit to that very moment. Mary Trainor, who I remember from SNL or any other TV comedy show of the monastery, it is a wicked wife, and Larry Drake plays crazy in a dirty Santa outfit. I forgot Sant Drake played for many years. His Sant force majeure and quite scary at times. You can guess how Santa finally gets into the house. The episode is played for laughs, but it can also be pretty intense at times.
