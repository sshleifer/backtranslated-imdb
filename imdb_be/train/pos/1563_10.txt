I loved this episode. He is so great that all five of them together and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I love this episode because Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) is guest starring !!! I just hope that Clark will join the Justice League, and we have to follow this group of heroes all over the world !! =) It was very interesting and keeps the audience interested because of what will happen next. I think that Chloe should also join the team as a watchtower, which would be a Coool that for her to do except the Daily Planet, because it does not have superpowers. In addition, I want to find out what types of items Lex is going to be used for 33.1, I wonder what other types of powers of other people in the world have !!!
