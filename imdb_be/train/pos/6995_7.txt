Quite the opposite piece of business with Bela Lugosi as mad scientist (with yes, Renfield, as an assistant, and his mother, a dwarf, and let the wife of a scientist (sound like a movie Greenaway actually laughs). Lugosi gives his wife injections from the dead bride (why are they? Who knows?), so that his wife can keep the look beautiful. it gets the bride after doing quite a clever trick with some orchids that makes the collapse bride at the altar. after another bride bites the dust, a newspaper reporter just It happens to be around a scoop, and decides to snoop around for history and. she gets all kinds of tips about orchids and Lugosi. God knows where the police. Soon she goes into the lair of Bella when she meets a kind of strange looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil. all accumulates in a very far-fetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist, but it seems to me that the scientist has X-ray vision, he films his plans, Oh, no! what happened? I actually liked this film as a kind of schadenfreude. Lugosi big here, his hangers-on are all very, very strange, the story is actually quite nasty in some places, which makes it all the more watchable. Fun little look.
