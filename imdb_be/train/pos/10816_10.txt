no, it should not be a high-budget sheen, but he is brilliant in his own right. You have to look at it for what it is, a low budget zombie masterpiece featuring rapist With a 12-inch rod of love, which he holds out clapping quietly. those who came to give this film a low review is probably looking at the next cult or a hidden "gem", as they say, and just did not get there. I love how all the obvious points of observation, such as "5 cents a child attached to the fish pole" hahaha, yeah. I do not think that the film with the budget as it can afford "good" actors or effects that they work with what they had. guts and entrails were actually very convincing. the film was a little jerk is derived from the sequence of the sequence, but overall, this is one of the best films I've seen lately, it's not worth any trends or predictability. very good for a laugh.
