Warm, moving film, which has a fantasy-like quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn, as always, superb. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis gave many outstanding performances, but there's just something about this one will haunt your memory. <br /> <br /> First of all, you should see this amazing 5-year-old. old Ferland. I was so impressed with his presence, I had to buy the film, so I could watch over and over it again. It is a miracle of God's creation. <br /> <br /> Based on the high rating IMDB, I'm not the only one who was fascinated by this young actress.
