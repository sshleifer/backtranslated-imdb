Call me stupid, but I absolutely loved the movie 2001 horror film, Valentine. It was so well-made, well-written, well-acted, well-aimed, and so on! Everything about it was perfect! There were parts that were relatively routine (the death of Lily), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), quite monstrous and horrible (Page's death), and a harrowing (the first scene). I think that all the actors did a great job, especially the three wires: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both of whom I met and got autographs during the filming of this movie - very nice people!), And Marley Shelton <. br /> <br /> I'm sick of people who call this film "Scream another clone." This film is, in no way, a clone Creek. In fact, this film works circle around the Creek. It actually makes sense! Creek is also not the only film to show the masked killer in it. I'm sorry, but it looks like the cry was also a clone of the well (ahem ..., Friday the 13th, Halloween, and many other scary movies also featured masked killers). I also think that the novelty of Cupid-masked killer is brilliant. It's so strange to see Cupid sweet face makes all of these terrible things. Another novelty (nose bleed) makes way to a fantastic finale! The ending gives me shivers every time I see it !!!!! Thus, even if you do not like it the first time, watch Valentin again and give it another chance! <br /> <br /> PS- Watch for my new site (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Quickly ...
