It's not the best movie White Lagosi, but it has a nice old-style approach to horror entertainment around the 40s. <br /> <br /> The bride drops dead at the altar, like flies. I think that I would have to postpone the wedding until after the throw is caught, but it's a horror movie, so I think that people ignore the danger for some reason. Anyway, Lagosi mad doctor who needs the blood of young women to keep its aging, sickly wife healthy and happy. He always eludes Keystone Cops, hiding the body in the hearse (who would think to look for the corpse in a hearse?), And the bride just keep getting zapped. <br /> <br /> A lot of the film as it will be complete without a type of female reporter Lois Lane, who wants to catch the criminals on their own. Good solution to crime, ill keep her mouth shut all the wrong time, guess who Lagosi chooses for his next intended victim. I love the "Haunted House" bits, where Lois Lane gets stranded storm as a guest in a family house in a sinister Lagosi. Hidden passages, the vampire, as a wife, the evil dwarf Igor assistants, and so on. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> Quite well done walking keeps moving film, and the story resolves itself in a typical but satisfying way. If you like old horror movies, it's one worth watching.
