In my years of visiting film festivals, I saw a lot of small films like this would never box office, and they end up in the bins in the $ 3 Walmart. I just found a DVD with pull tanks out there, a great document, but how sad to end up like a rock down to the end. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, it is a pity that I have seen in a movie in it all. I would prefer to New Yorker Films translated name directly. It's good for Americans to stretch a bit. If the title of the film makes the audience the United States explore the random chaos, the better. Cinema imitates life & vice versa. <br /> <br /> In addition, I found that distracts the subtitles set prices in dollars. Come on! Euro is not difficult to understand, to make the gringo audience do the math. After seeing the film, especially one shot in Paris, the viewer must not have the effect reminiscent of spoiled: I am an American watching a movie, and they are converted into euros to dollars for me. <br /> <br /> We look forward to more of these actors, and more from the writer and director as well.
