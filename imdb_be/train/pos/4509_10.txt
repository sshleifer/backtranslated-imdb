The appearance of white people in the Arctic Canada the issue of freedom of fearless Eskimo hunters. <br /> <br /> W. S. Van Dyke, a freelance director of the MGM, was responsible for a fascinating look at life in the Arctic, the Inuit. Its production was not on location with April 1932 to November 1933 (although some annoying effects of the rear projections show that some shooting took place back in the studio). Although considered to be a documentary film at the time, we would probably call it a "docudrama" as a script with an intriguing storyline and plot. <br /> <br /> The film shows the everyday life of the Eskimos, as the Winter & Summer, but in fact begins in the warmer months without snow or ice in sight. Constant desire for food is drawn, and the audience will watch the exciting hunt for walruses, polar bears, whales and the Caribbean. Native language is used throughout, using the name card; Only English is spoken fishermen and Mounties faced the Eskimos. In fact, it is the arrival of white men, both good and bad, and they do change on Inuit society, which is one of the key elements in the story. <br /> <br /> This previous code Transaction film in a refreshingly frank manner with the moral code of the Eskimos, in particular, with their practice of sharing his wife, who is an important and entirely innocent part of their culture. In fact, the entire film can be considered as a valuable look at the way of life that is fast disappearing, even in the early 1930s. <br /> <br /> None of the actors does not receive screen credit, which is a shame because there are some notable performances. Foremost among them is the fact that Ray Wise, is playing a leading role Little Eskimos. Wise (1906-1952) was a native Alaskan Inuit descent and absolutely gorgeous and totally believable that was very demanding part. As beautiful as any Hollywood star, he will continue to operate using the name of Ray Small, sporadic film career, often in small roles unbilled. <br /> <br /> excellent Japanese-Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays loyal second Shallow wife; the names of prominent actresses who play two of their wives are now unclear. Directed by Woody Van Dyke steps before the cameras, as the strict North-West Mounted Police Inspector. Two decent heart of Mounties, who must deliver the Small Canadian justice plays Joe Sawyer and Edgar Dearing, like old movie actors heroes. Danish author Peter Freucheno on whose books the film was based, has a short colorful role of the evil wooden legs of a sea captain, who inadvertently awakens anger Small ice.
