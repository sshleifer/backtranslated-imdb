When I was a kid, I watched it many times, and I remember whistling «Happy Cat» song quite often. All the songs are great, really memorable, unlike many children's musicals, where songs are stuck in no real reason. Scenes and costumes generous, and the effect is very well done, it is not surprising, considering the cast. Christopher Walken is very cat and does not need the silly makeup, or a cat costume for the viewer to believe that he turns into a cat person. And Jason Connery is so cute, as the son of a shy and awkward miller, Corinne, who falls in love with a beautiful and courageous Princess Vera. It's really fun, nice, full-length film, which unlike most fairy tales, the characters give personality. Some of my favorite pieces appear when Puss makes Corinne pretended that he was drowning; at the ball, when everyone starts to dance the dance of the country, since it is "all the rage abroad"; if Walken in the kitchen, dancing on the table (it is very good dancer, too!); and when Faith says Karin what she used to do when she was young, like pretending that she was the daughter of a miller. I would recommend this film for children and their parents, who like magic and fairy tales. And it's actually a movie that you can watch together, as it will not lead the adult wall.
