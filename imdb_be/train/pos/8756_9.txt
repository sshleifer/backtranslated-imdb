I caught this movie by chance on the cables in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it, loyalty, and I'm glad that I did. I was immediately drawn to the story line and took care of the girls who participate. Naive graduates from high school, best friends since childhood, to take a high school trip and fall into the crook named Nick, who gets them into serious trouble. They are used as sacrificial mules smuggling heroin ring. Taken into custody, the girls learn to cope with their opinions, trying to find a way out of their problems. All they are trying to help themselves hold, when the Thai criminal justice system reveals flaws and girls find themselves in a more difficult position and lose the trust of its «Yankee Hank» American lawyer. Hank refuses, trying to protect them after he feels betrayed Alice (Danes). However, Thai native wife Hankey smell a rat in the case and make some extra foot work of investigation and finds out the girl was actually pursued. The end of the film, when Alice makes a selfless act to save Darlene (Beckinsale) had me in tears. I really liked this movie, and would recommend it.
