This is not a masterpiece of theater. You do not go expecting it. This is a pure girl F with the fantastic cast led by women. As someone else here said that this film Baby Mama was supposed to be. The only drawback I see in this film that Tina Fey is not in IT- to the fact that the stars are the most intelligent and bright girl on the planet. The film is pure nonsense on the surface, but if you really look, you'll know that there are a lot of messages and deep meaning for all of us, whoever they could go back and do it over and over again in my life, knowing that, what we now know ,, PURE FUN and I recommend it to all who are over 84 minutes of a great escape.
