Thomas cap was not the boss Anne Marie Togo Carper, the governor was. This is the reason that the feds carried away, he called Clinton and asked him to get the Federal involved in the case. I lived outside of Philadelphia at the time, so it was the main news page every day. I also read the book and saw Anne Rules segment of "City" on a confidential A & E. It was dripping delusions of grandeur (sp.), Remove the controller and the monster. He claimed that he loved Anne Marie, but all he wanted someone he could control. If she will not let him do it the more he killed her in the end form of control. I think it's a waste of money that he is still alive.
