And my female friend, who is now drawn into a relationship with the SOB, which has a long term girlfriend. SOB certainly very beautiful, charming, and so on, and my friend is very intelligent woman. Watching the character of Jean-Pierre Leo at work just like to see what happens in real life, when guys like that destroys the lives of our friends. It's tragic, and you know that it will eventually hurt a lot, but there is nothing that you can do. Léaud is brilliant. Completely empty. throughout the harvesting, he pulls faces and telling the stories he deems get a response he wants. <br /> <br /> The scene two hours when Léaud, and Lebrun made love, but the next morning he puts on the record and is very cute and charming, sings to entertain her brilliantly. "What the hell am I doing here with this idiot," an expression that flickers back and forth on her face will be in my memory for a long time in the future. <br /> <br /> It is a long film, but to see him at once, especially in movies. It will take some time to enter, but then time just disappears.
