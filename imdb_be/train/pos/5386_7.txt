This film is one that played very well and probably will not be back in 1932 to work, but today, because his style is a bit old-fashioned and contrived. However, if you are a kind person like me who loves old Hollywood movies, you cut the film a bit of slack and can enjoy it for what it is - an interesting soap <br /> <br /> film. It is located in the ward for problem pregnancies. In this large room about a half dozen places in which women waiting to give birth - but doctors are concerned about the possible complications (Yikes - this room is really to injure the mother). And, as an episode of "Love The Boat" or "Fantasy Island," every mother has its own special history. With so many pretty extreme and crazy stories, you have to suspend disbelief. I could have liked the movie quite a bit <br /> <br /> Here are some of the stories :. One is my father. You do not see my mother, but he was very, very nervous father, and it is included for the comic. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful here. - very touching <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden sad case. Loretta goes to the hospital from prison - she apparently killed some creepy guy. You do not know exactly what happened, but to assume that he was trying to force myself to it! However, she received 20 years in prison - and her husband betrayed her and with her as much as he can <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell horrible person .. She has maternal instincts hamster - really, really bad and Alcoholic hamster! It's pretty funny and worth a look through most of the film. I loved her to drink from the bottle with hot water, filled with gin, and becomes upset when she learns that she can not make money selling her twin !! At the end of the film, it has a typical change in the heart of Hollywood-style, which was supposed to be touching - I found it contrived <br /> <br /> There is a woman who gave birth to a still-born child. , Surprisingly, afterwords, they put the house back on the same ward as the women waiting to give birth !!! Crazy woman, you are assumed to have lost a child some time ago, wandering down to the psychiatric ward. She insists that she is with child. Later, she runs away again and actually takes one of the children! <br /> <br /> There are most of the stories than this, but the ones I have mentioned are the main ones. As I said, it's a soap opera varieties and very interesting - and very sad in the case of several stories. The ending is particularly heartbreaking and extremely well done. There were some particularly good performances - especially Farrell and Aline MacMahon as a head nurse. All in all, a very good film - and I have no idea why they believe they should have to remake a movie a few years (which was typical of Warner Brothers).
