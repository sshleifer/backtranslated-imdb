Belushi in his most insinuating and Courteney Cox in front of your friends has a small role. I often think that Belushi is under used in Hollywood, and this role in the film is one of his best. For those of you who are watching his TV show, it's very different and pleasant character. The film itself does not shake, no new message, but rather it is a sweet and conquers. The supporting cast of familiar faces and unfamiliar names perfect balance, though nagging Lovitz can get tedious, and charismatic spiritual teacher Michael Caine has a slightly sinister, if not well-intentioned edge. Hamilton, like Belushi's wife, unfortunately two-dimensional and one wonders why he married her. In addition, Rene Russo wasted and not very convincing on "prom queen" who got away. Nevertheless, a good way to spend two hours.
