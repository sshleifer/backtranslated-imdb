It is not as violent as I expected, which makes the scenes of violence are becoming more stringent and effective. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double-crossing all the way through the film, which makes it difficult to know who is on the side of a particular character further. <br /> <br /> plot is Pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of development of the Triad gangs of worth. <, Br /> <br /> in the family when it comes to brutal, sun guns and martial arts scenes with special effects, it is not plausible violence in your face for the whole dialogue you never allowed to forget that the triad is violent a criminal organization. <br /> <br /> ending is strange but thoroughly consistent and believable.
