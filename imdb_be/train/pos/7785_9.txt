I just watch the movie 2 Pang brothers, the Eye and the only one to take. When I looked into his eyes, I was kind of disappointed with the two guys that I've heard good words about them before. This film (The Eye) is a very bad scenario, especially the ending (children, cliches and too coincidental in my opinion), but still good in photos and experimental images. So I decided to see just one take, and I'm not disappointed again. Still a great photo, excellent image editing the MTV-style, cool music, and this time, history has a lot of indie spirit, logical and beautiful, you'll see some tiny holes scene, but it does not cause any problems with the storyline. The only problem with this film I get a bad DVD.
