Yes, the plot is hardly believable, and very thin. YES, if the current in the range of medium to ridiculous. Yes, this has been done so many times. However, what we are dealing with a film that does not shy away from these facts, and pretends that he was nothing more than that. There are actually some of the original death scene and the voltage increases throughout the film. In addition, you'll never more than a few minutes walk from the massacre. I urge everyone to watch this movie with an impartial eye and see him for what he found to be; scary, funny slasher film with the theme tune to none.
