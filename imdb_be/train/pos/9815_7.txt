As the first feature film with Robert De Niro (though not released for many years later), it is worth watching. De Niro's role is not so great, but it's funny how one of the two friends, who first try to prevent another marriage only then chase him down to get him into it. Any die hard fan of De Niro will receive a blow from an early performance at the best possible actor today.
