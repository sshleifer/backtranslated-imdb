My friend sent VHS, included several pieces of work with all the lines have been translated into English. with a translation beside me, I started to watch the story (it's really a fairy tale), and with the first tune whistling tunes during the opening credits, I was stuck. color as the minimum action (well, in most cases), an absurd comedy, farce, thoughtful, beautiful ... along with a few other films (Paris, Texas and Nenette etc. Bonnie), this one is able to speak with someone heart - without words .

Oh, great acting, the soundtrack is brilliant, the story is simple and said a thousand times before - but rarely (never?) Like this.
