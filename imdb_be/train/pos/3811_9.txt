As I have not seen for a long time so beautifully animated feature. Having a healthy respect for Pixar's, I have to say that Ratatouille or any other film made 'em can not be compared with it. Animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. Graphics amazing, stunning background environment, almost every object in each frame is drawn perfectly. Sometimes I felt a tingle down my spine - because I loved what I saw <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely romantic .. As romantic as the story animated film can be. The characters are cute, especially Hector, blue rabbit, it has, by foot, rock and rules! Another symbol-s, is also very nice. First-class humor. <br /> <br /> In general, it seemed that the creators do not invest a lot of effort into it. I mean, it looked like it would not take too much to eat as opposed to people Pixar and Dreamworks, seeking each time to think about something new. And I am very happy that the product of European animation studio was so great. They have done a beautiful, moving film, candy for the eyes and heart. <br /> <br /> The only disadvantage of this is nonsense start, and that's why it's not 9of10 10/10
