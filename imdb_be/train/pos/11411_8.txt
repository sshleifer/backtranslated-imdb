Van Dyne S.S. He was an astute businessman to fight with Hollywood. Most of the series of films from the days of the studio, usually limited to one or two studios. But perhaps Van Dyne, must have sold the rights for each book of Philo Vance, one at a time. Please note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and most of all films released Philo Vance. Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood anymore. <br /> <br /> MGM released Murder Case Garden and starred Edmund Lowe as a fashion detective. Certainly MGM had the original screen Philo on the contract at the time, but Bill Powell was busy Thin Man at the time, and I think Louis B. Mayer decided to focus it there. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe quite acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe started a pretty big tail on mute so that the price of fame, and then with a string of movies with Victor McLaglen of them Flagg and whip marks. But after McLaglen won an Oscar for the use of information, Lowe, seemed, fade to market B picture. <br /> <br /> The point Murder garden includes three individual victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frida Inescourt. The sinister atmosphere around culprit kind of gives it away, the mystery really as all the murders are connected and how they are performed. <br /> <br /> I'm going to talk about it, though. Vance has a very big chance to unmask the villain and the last 15 minutes worth of Hitchcock.
