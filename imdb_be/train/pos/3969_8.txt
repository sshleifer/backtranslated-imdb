Has anyone noticed that James Earl Jones waiter who serves as Hagarty wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are in the restaurant next to the lake. I watched this movie on video that I tape from the TV. When I looked at this scene, I thought I recognized the voice of Jones, when the "waiter" laughing at the end. I rewind the tape and then slowly passed through the part of the camera is pulled back and showed the waiter. Listen carefully, as a waiter laughs when Hagarty looks up and tells him that they're going to have a baby, and then watch for slow or the scene when the camera shows a waiter, albeit quickly.
