If you played the «Spider-Man» according to the PS, you have seen it all. To truly experience it, you should get the DC version. Simply put, it is very clearly superior to the game; texture sharp, level easy to navigate, and it has a much better sound, this PS cousin. I bought this game at the end of the 00th, and it still holds to this day. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is much higher and strategy game, but if you're a fan of "ol Web Head, then you have to do it myself to take it back to your gaming library. Swinging around town as Spider never looked so good and appropriate video games. If you have a Dreamcast, snag it for cheap. DC version is simply incredible.
