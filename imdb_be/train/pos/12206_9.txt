Of all the films noir in the 1940s and 1950s, it has ranked as one of the most amazing and the most fun to watch. I say that because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are familiar to everyone, but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby," is one of the most amazing people I have ever seen on film. His voice, and some of the things that he said, must be heard to be believed. Slaone sun behind in a "strange" category. Hayworth is not as glamorous, with short blond hair, but still Hayworth, that means a lot to see if you're a guy. Wells of spectacular, as always. One tip: if you have a DVD, turn on the English subtitles. His character in this film is an Irishman and you need subtitles to understand what he says. <br /> <br /> Welles also directed the film, which means that you have a great camera angles and great close-ups of faces. You also have a unique ending, visually, with a bullet in the house of mirrors. Great stuff! As amazing as this film, I still thought the clown, like the carnival atmosphere of the court towards the end it was too much, and took away from the seriousness of the incident. Apart from that, no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is a great game, which is the name of the game.
