I first saw this in a movie theater when it came out, and the crowd was really into the film, which made the experience all the more fun. This is a large cast of characters, a lot of big names in it, some of which have not been recognized, as it was then, as now. I think it's a great idea, if you follow any of these actors, and loved them in other films, to add it to your viewed list. Some scenes really remind me of the type of well-made comedy, as in the Birdcage or even a clue, such as odd-appearing spontaneous comedy with some really professional delivery of the favorite actors. The film did a great job at giving you some idea, maybe even a very realistic, in the culture of daily soaps.
