Neil Simon has a pretty body of work, but it's Odd Couple, which carried him to glory. This film really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaw has great chemistry. The supporting cast for this film is stellar as well. <br /> <br /> This is about 2 men who live together, which of the warring planets. The script bristles with humor of the situation. This has been done in some form before. This is the one that brings it all together in a very good package. <br /> <br /> Simon did some other decent work, but this one did his best work, which made the rest of his work possible. It is hard to imagine, Simon never topping it.
