This movie definitely gets a thumbs up from me. This witty jokes and even sometimes stereotypical and degrading views of people in Eastern Europe had me in stitches for most of the film. This plot is clever and 100% original and will have you guessing throughout the film. One person I most impressed in this film was Hilary Duff. This simple and clear to see that she took a leap of faith stepped outside the genre "chick flick" it is used for. Her accent is beautiful and her performance was amazing action clear and well executed. This is the best result I have ever seen with Hillary, and I've seen most of his films. Her character, Yonica Babyyeah described as the "Britney Spears of Eastern Europe", and it shows in some of her manners and the song "I want to blow you up ... ... ...." You will also feel sorry for her, because her performance really grabs you, Yonica is very complex and complicated character. Joan Cusack made me laugh throughout the film, with its sometimes slapstick humor, but her expression and so on. witty dialogue John Cusack will probably make you giggle throughout. I highly recommend this film.
