The main room really surprised me. Compared with other films that have been written about the Columbine High School is one the best. The main room shows the shooting school, but rather the effects and consequences of the community and the city. The film focus on two opposite signs., Alicia (Busy Phillips) and the Diana (Erika Christensen). Alicia is an outcast, who had witnessed the entire shooting. She does not seem to show any emotion about it. Diana is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. Alecia Diana is forced to visit the hospital to finish. Meanwhile, police are investigating Alicia, how could she know the shooting will take place. Alicia and Diane are very different, and not get in the first. In the end, they develop a mutual understanding of each other and become friends. (It is in the club-style breakfast). Home Room Beautifully shows the power of proximity and bustle after the school shooting. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
