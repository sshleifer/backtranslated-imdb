Peter Ustinov plays embezzlers, who just got out of prison, when the film begins. As soon as he comes out of the gate, he immediately begins to work on the scheme, to make a bunch of stealing again, although this time he set his sights pretty high. It is actually one of the weak points of the movie, as he apparently did not know anything about the computer (little did back in 1968), but has managed to become a computer genius literally overnight! Yeah, right. Anyway, it comes with a scheme to impersonate the computer experts and get a job with a major US corporation so that it can eventually assigns a lot of money. Given his rudimentary knowledge of computers, it's amazing how he introduces a brilliant plan and managed to break into a computer system and its protection. But this is a movie after all, so I was able to suspend disbelief. By the end of the movie, he and his wife (Maggie Smith), capable of running a million pounds. <br /> <br /> In the end, though, it becomes very, very confusing and Smith announces she could actually accumulate more than two million cunning investing in companies Ustinov began (though she did not understand that all of them were bogus companies). This should mean that eventually these stocks bought were useless. What they seem to have in mind (and I would guess there is not), that Ustinov and his new partners quickly cashed in shares before this became known, and stocks will thus become useless. In any case, the film seems to send on a magical ending, according to which no one was hurt, and everyone is happy - and it just does not make sense. It's a shame, really, how to act, and a large portion of the sheet has been great. Karl Malden, Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just fine. <br /> <br /> When I seem to have interpreted the end, let me know how the film seemed very vague in detail at the end.
