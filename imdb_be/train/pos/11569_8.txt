Bob Clampett on "itching during" milked seven minutes of crazy action with a very small room. Elmer Fudd says his dog, that if he just scratched again, he will be given the dreaded bath. Unfortunately for dogs, flea tireless makes it all but impossible to stop it from scratches. Cartoon switch between the progress of the fleas inside the dog's fur and dog desperate attempts to cope with it. In a large sequence that really captures the frustration of itching that can not be scratched, the dog will change color from brown to blue to red polka dotted on the rug! It sounds ridiculously surreal, but it does cause an indescribable feeling the itch in a way he could Clampett. There are several other elements that make "the itch during a" clean Clampett. There's also the very notion of the grotesque, which leads to some graphic scenes fleas dog chewed flesh. There is rampant violence that rears its head at any stage with the image of a cat. In particular, there is a dirty joke at the huge number of shots from behind the dog, which causes a flea wolf whistle and hysterical sequence in which the dog is trying to scratch himself, dragging ass on the floor. He momentarily off to address the audience: "Hey, I'd better cut it I can get like this!" With a very limited concept, Clampett manages to make "an itch during" unique trivia based on the cartoon. As in the beginning, "the Seinfeld" episode, "itching during" almost nothing, but it is very funny to him.
