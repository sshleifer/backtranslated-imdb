Picked the five best films of John Garfield to be Pride Marine. This is the real story of the sea Private Al Schmid, which through its own view, while the wounded held back hordes stormed the Japanese on Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> In the history of beautiful segments into three parts, home life where he Al Schmid simple working hard, which only becomes serious with a woman, and who loves nothing better than his bowling night. Pearl Harbor was bombed, and he goes to war, like millions of others were. <br /> <br /> The second part is on Guadalcanal, and we see a piece of the action, where it is in an isolated machine-gun nest, holding the Japanese troops. Its action is alerted maritime positions from being overrun, but the grenade makes his vision. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the third part of his painful adaptation to civilian life and to convince myself that people just do not care about him, out of pity, it is likely that the girl he saw Eleanor Parker. <br /> <br /> This film was shown on TCM at the 95th birthday of John Garfield was a documentary film about Garfield was organized by his daughter. One of the people interviewed said that the actor Garfield was the most believable in the role of class in and conduct union card. <br /> <br /> In this respect he was lucky that he had made the earth with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although he continued to receive type as a gangster in the tradition of the studio, Garfield was stunning in these places because of his background, because he came from the kind of life Al Schmid was, with the exception of Jewish origin Garfield. <br /> <br /> In this respect, it was committed to play the role of the working class hero as Al Schmid, who took the responsibility to defend their country. No super heroics here, just a guy who would rather have returned to Philadelphia, but it does the job, which was to be done. <br /> <br /> Not for most of Garfield. This film should not miss. I wonder, though everything that happened with the real Al Schmid.
