"Panic on the streets" was a decent thriller, but I felt a little disappointed by this. The central theme of the city is attacked by a plague now is exciting, but the film never explores and develops it. His well-done and interesting, but it was not as much fun as it should have been. The scenario for this is really weak and bring down the whole film. None of the main characters are not really convincing or believable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film is very well made, so that compensates for the weak script. by Elia Kazan direction keeps the film moving and suspenseful at lightning fast. There are some outstanding sequence, especially memorable chase climax. If its direction is combined with the best scenario a few years later, a person could not generally do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> The acting is also very good. Widmark was always watchable leading man and does what he can with the guaranteed nature. Paul Douglas spends his time yelling a little bit too much, but it does a decent job as well. Movers in the cast are two villains. Mostel, known primarily for his comic roles, effectively slippery as one of the ultimate symbols sneak cinema. Jack Palance, which is not surprising, frightening villain. "Panic on the streets" is disappointing, but it's still worth a look. (7/10)
