I just saw this movie today with their children (a son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) in the third annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival. After watching the film the children in the audience was allowed to ask questions of the director, Tian-Ming Wu. He (through an interpreter) told a few stories about his life and the creation of the film. <br /> <br /> All on the side, both my kids really liked this movie. Of course, I had to rephrase many subtitles for my daughter, but most of the film is visually clear. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give, but the fact that this film is much better than 95% of Hollywood crap (especially children's films) there. <br /> <br /> Cheers. <br /> <br /> ps There is a "real" / original King of Masks, which can / could make 12 masks at once. Actor in the film are trained and learned how to make up to 4 masks at the time (if they are cut and change the 4 new masks).
