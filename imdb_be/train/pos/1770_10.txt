In the preview, "40 Year-Old Virgin» is another way of immature sex fuss about a 40-Isha Lone Man, who suddenly feels the desire to do the act, simply because he has not. Too many bad experiences of the past soaked his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely. And then the unexpected happens: he falls in love. Moreover, there is a movie about it, and it's called "40 Year-Old Virgin». <br /> <br /> The Virgin name Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is actually 40, an employee works at an electronics store, and collects vintage figurines, which are displayed all throughout his bachelorhood good for everyone. He has an excellent home theater system and watch «Survivor» with his two elderly neighbors good. . It's pretty colorful definition Lonely Guy, which is due to speak more and more women are <br /> <br /> Now here's a real novelty with this picture: it makes the impossible task of actually dealing with the subject in a sweet, has become a fashion. This is a film that can be easily turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent command filmmakers. This could down an endless sex fun and jokes, but fortunately, this picture never stoop that low. Of course, there is a sex joke here and there, and even a few Prods aimed at the gay community (which is in no way meant to be taken as a gay-bashing), as two of the characters exchange insults to each other while playing video games. ( «Mortal Kombat: Deception," no less - eventually testosterone initiative fightfest for guys) <br /> <br /> As a person who is rapidly approaching 20, collects figures McFarlane Toys And not himself never made a move, I found this movie funny and touching in such a way that such a theme the film would have never happened before I was able to connect with Andy Stitzer character more than anyone in the theater, because I was only a teenager attended this show,. all the others watched, as they were in the past 40. A bit arrogant, I know, but you ( "you" in italics) would still s able to connect if you are the only teenager attended an afternoon movie, "40-year-old Virgin"? <br /> <br /> you know, Andy never had sex and wakes up every day with the "morning rise" (do not ask), and he pressed his friends to try the strange ways of getting attention from the opposite sex. When he first found out Andy virgin, 40, and three of his friends and colleagues, an electronics store colleague David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen), all first assumed he was gay because he never She was not a woman who could not be further from the truth. However, Andy loves a woman, but the past traumatic experiences (found amusing each other in sequence retrospective) put him on the sidelines forever. <br /> <br /> David, Jay and Cal each mission Go to Andy put, so to help them all. But you know that such antics will only end in disaster, as has been proved for the same date with Nicky (Leslie Mann), who puts Andy through the worst drunken driving experience, I think anyone would not want to go, and he has quite an eerie encounter Beth (Elizabeth Banks), a beautiful girl who works in a bookstore, and ultimately showed that threw a total of sex. <br /> <br /> The Andy improve when he meets Trichet (Catherine Keener), a friendly woman who works at the store across the street that sells things on eBay for people. Hmmm. And with this cute collection of figures, you can go figure, in the end, a large financial gain is waiting for him, that is, if he can never "do business." <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a sex romp we've been waiting for. It deals with a very real problem for many Lonely Guys, likely to pass, not that there is something wrong with being a virgin, but let's look at the big picture: How many of us "Lonely Boys" wanna be lonely guy forever? It is important that we teach in this picture that lone guy should be yourself. I do not think he has to go through depilation body as Andy does (that side-splitting, if it is fair and in accordance with this website and various other news articles, was in fact real, and so was blood on his shirt Karel later) . <br /> <br /> «40 Year-Old Virgin» directed by Judd Apatow and co-written with yourself and Karel, which arose as a skit, which starred Karel. Karel sweet and people, as well as his character is not some slacker who approach these things with your eyes closed. This is probably one of the smartest noisy games I've ever seen, and is not offensive (much), because his characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even friends Karel, which extend from the bad advice, to hide their own insecurities relationship may be associated with at a fundamental level. <br /> <br /> Way "40 Year-Old Virgin» exhausted really funny in the end, but I'll leave it up to you, the viewer, to watch. Of course, if someone could go through Andy doing things and still have the power to attract women as sexy as Catherine Keener, it is the truth: It is never too late <br /> <br /> 10/10!
