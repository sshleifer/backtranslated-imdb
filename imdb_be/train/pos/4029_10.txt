I have no words to describe how good this film. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could write a real image separation days. The film continued to haunt me for days. <br /> <br /> Urmila did the role of his life in this film. She does not put life into the role Puroo and Manoj Vajpai at least made in his role as Rashid. It's hard to imagine anyone other than these two makes the role Puroo and Rashid. Punjabi suits looked so natural to Urmila and Manoj looked like a natural panzhabskoy Mussalmaan. <br /> <br /> Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand did an incredible job. Priyanshu Chattarjee did a good job as Triloki. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes you just can not get out of your mind. If Puroo Lajjo meets for the first time, it brings tears to my eyes. The culmination of a killer. I was expecting a tragic end, but fortunately, the end was great. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal, Benares, etc. Not to be missed.
