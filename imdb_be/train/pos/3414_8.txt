This is an interesting documentary tells the remarkable story of the expedition to take blind Tibetan child trekking in the Himalayas; but also about personality clashes between two wonderful people. On the one hand, there is Eric Weihenmeyer, the first blind person to climb Mount Everest, and the team (seen) climbers who are approximate children. On the other hand, there Sabriay Tenberken, a blind woman who starts the first school for the blind Tibetans who agrees to the expedition, but later had doubts about how it progresses. On some level, Sabine simply does not understand the philosophy of highlander (with its emphasis on climbing on); she probably right in identifying discrepancies between the objectives of climbers and desires of children, but her self-righteousness makes it hard to sympathize with people, especially if it has an effective veto. Against this background (very well-mannered) collision, we get insight into the lives of the children themselves. I liked the movie, even though it provides a clear message designed to be uplifting - despite the fact that the details of an argument, the film inevitably some states how strange all those who are in it. But it's hard to argue with that assessment, even if it appears to the viewer somewhat unsubtly.
