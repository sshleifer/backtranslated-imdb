<br /> <br /> In 1970, after five years of absence, Kurosawa made what would be his first film in color. Dodes' Ka-Den is a film that centers around a lot of interwoven stories that go on in Little Tokyo slums. <br /> <br /> The name comes from the sound of a mentally retarded boy does as he thinks he is working on the train, we slowly learn more and more people in a small community, two drunks selling wife, because they are not happy those that they have. Old, which is the center of the city, which helps with the robber, who is trying to rob him. Very poor father and a son who could never afford a house, so they think each to their own. By the end of the film, the history of all full circle, some are happy, others boring. <br /> <br /> Since it was the first color film Kurosawa, you can see that he uses it to his advantage, and it shows, maybe too much. This film goes in different directions, and it's hard to settle down and get to it. But do not get me wrong, Dodes' Ka-Den Kurosawa can not be better, but on the basis of the greatest director of all time, it is far better than 99% of today's films.
