Most recently, I watched it on the Sundance Channel. The idea of ​​the film is to bring a lot of filmmakers, famous in their own country, to make short films, eleven of them, all in the same film, focusing on only one topic: September 11 <br /> <br /> With this film I wacthing I could tell why the filmmakers were great in their own country, because it had all the elements of a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a film from Iran, in which the teacher struggling to teach students about what happened on September 11, which they will not be able to realize later. <br /> <br /> The second film from France includes deaf woman writes a letter to her lover angrily as she does not know what's going on, like a TV game. <br /> <br /> next film from Egypt includes the director talks to the dead soldier on the latest developments not only on terrorists of 9/11, but explosions elsewhere. <br /> <br /> following comes from Bolivia, where she learns about the events of September 11, and believes that they should follow them. <br /> <br /> The following from a country in Africa, where a group of boys to follow the man whom they believe bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The following comes from Mexico, where not stated, but the sound of the day. <br /> <br /> next from Israel with a reporter at the site of a bomb explosion, trying to get a report, but often talk about the attacks. <br /> <br /> There are other movies that I can "remember at the moment, but they are powerful. This will return your emotions from that day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
