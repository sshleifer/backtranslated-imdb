I first saw this film when I was about 6 or 7 years old, and do not really think it was anything special. As time passed, I watched it a few more times, and he began to grow on me as I began to understand the moral of the film, which I will come later. For some time I left the film alone and do not watch it for a while. When you look at an old classic film look a few weeks ago (now 15), I dug VHS to Homeward bound. After watching this, I was left in a natural high that I could not explain. The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never expected. Nature films three very different animals cooperate with each other to find their way back home really sent home the message that no matter what you all have to how different you can always find a common language. The way the characters face are selected really fantastic. The fact that you have an experienced wise old golden retriever grooming or gunner "chance" fun loving if slightly awkward young American bulldog with brazen smart, vulnerable, but I'm sure the cat. The film of these three friends and companions in the journey that is so realistic, it is impossible to create the magic that you start to believe that this trip may happen. <br /> <br /> I do not want to sound like soft tissue grabber when it comes to movies, I assure you, I'm quite the opposite, but the most inspiring part of this film, without a doubt, the shadow go back when the shadow is desperately trying to escape and the chance and arrogant, painfully telling them to leave. If both animals to return to their beloved owners is silence until the shadow of the sun above the horizon is lame to thrill everyone. There is a fine line between Sokolniki and banal trash, but this film is pure magic, even at the age of 15 years, this movie can not be Lord of the Rings, but for Disney to make a fiction film using animals and to elevate himself as making, even at this age, it deserves 10/10.
