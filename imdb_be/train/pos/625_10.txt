In the afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw Nile Gaimans Stardust and all I can say is, Wow. <br /> <br /> It is rare that I am completely baffled that some, but it is quite possible the biggest fantasy film I had never seen, maybe even the best movie of any kind, and it is the fault of all Neil Gaiman. <br /> <br /> Of course, I could suck a great dialogue, which was smart, uneventful, and made plausible characters. <br /> <br /> I could have a few days of exciting action, Charlie Cox perfect as Tristan, Danes is brilliant as Yvaine, and Robert Niro Yes, almost steals the film as a deep pantry Pirate Captian Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> pure joy caused by the humor that manages to be laugh our loud funny, smart enough to make the first Shrek look like a 80-Sitcom and blend in perfectly with the rest of the film alone would make a great movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects were almost perfect, so it was not rue or LOTR Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but where they were used, they were exactly what was intended, not too much to distract you from the film and it fits into the story perfectly. <br /> <br /> Then the story? What can I say. How often do you come up with the story contains all the classic fairy-tale formula components that do not come off as just another cheap Princess Bride forgery. He manages to be both familiar and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time. <br /> <br /> Any one of those things that would make a good movie, they are all together, make it a great movie, but it pales in comparison with the rich divine world, these elements combine to bring to life is good. Once again, Neil Gaiman did it, he hit another dagger in my heart, creating a fantasy world, which is so beautiful and charming that I will do everything possible to live in it, and only gave me a brief glimpse of him. I do not want it to end, I wanted to be sucked through a vortex into the ground Stormhold and get to meet Tristan and Yvaine personally travel this field and valley, a walk through the market and meet its inhabitants dangerous and friendly and stay there forever. This feeling that I noticed when I was something of Gaiman, The Sandman, American Gods, Coraline read all left me with a deep sense of sorrow when I finished reading it, because it was over, I could not see anything else in worlds that he created, which seemed to be much brighter and more alive than I have to live and watch Stardust is no different. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure Neil a letter and this film will not have the same effect at all, but trust me when I say, you will not regret the time and money spent to watch this movie is easily one of the top 5 movies I've ever seen, and I can guarantee that anyone at all to the soul, at least like.
