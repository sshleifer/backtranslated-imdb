One of the best sitcoms ever come out of Britain. Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are terrific actors and performers who seem to be at home with the drama as they are with the comedy. Ably supported by their writing partner Jeremy Dyson, they are populated with a number of the most memorable characters in recent years. Little Britain fades into the background, like a bad imitation of their ideas. Consistently original and innovative, I'm sure that so many people hate these series as love them, but I also believe that no one could have no opinion on the LOG. I still have to see a feature film, but I've heard good things and bad things, so I'll be leaving judgement.The original radio series, of which LOG came was innovative as the show began. I do not know, it made the TV series in the US, but I would be fascinated to see how American audiences found strange English humor
