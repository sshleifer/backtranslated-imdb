This is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again. If you've never seen it, give it a chance. Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia perfectly together, and although the film amuses me greatly, it reminds me of the early death of Julia. This is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us in these times of terror and fear.
