Scintillating Elizabeth Taylor star in this less well-known classics, like a young girl from London who falls in love with the owner of the tea plantations of the British Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka). Upon arrival, she immediately feels ridiculous and forced to adapt to a new culture, and to be in constant awareness of malignant herds of elephants. Dieterle, who also directed The Life of Emile Zola portrait of Jenny does a masterful job of something dark, almost eerie undertone to this romance and installation is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen with a black and white themed mansion and beautiful island scenery.
