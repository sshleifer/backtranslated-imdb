I feel Monarch Cove was one of the best written and played «Drama» series to arrive on any network for a long time. This show has a lot of potential, and I could not wait to see it every week. It can be developed into a large Primetime soap. People look forward to this type of action as we now «Reality TV» overkilled. I've been writing and type of action that shows like Dallas, Landing nodes Dynasty, Melrose Place, etc. provided. Monarch Cove updated this concept quite well, and I expect that only gets better. There's so much to expand with these characters, and all of them were very interesting and captivating in their own right. It would be entirely lost to investigate this and to develop these characters after drawn and hooked us into their world. I absolutely loved this show, because it was mysterious, exciting and sensual, without going overboard or offensive. I loved it.
