This movie scared the hell out of me when I was a kid. It is not "Citizen Kane," but it does have its moments. Hand tearing a good scene. a good story, even if the symbols are not - they might have something to do with the current. Put some of the best people in the name of the roles, and then see what happens. It was one of those editing (what little there was) and spread over several months, such as movies. This is a classic low-budget sci-fi, and it deserves just because. I rated it 9 on the basis of other films of the genre and age.
