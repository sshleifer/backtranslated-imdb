I saw this movie at the 18th festival in Haifa movie, and it's one of the best I've seen this year. Seeing it on the big screen (and I mean great, not one of the TV screens, most theaters are) with an excellent sound system is always increasing cinematic experience as the film takes over your eyes and ears, and pulled into a story in a picture. <br /> <br /> in the film is a set of characters that are poorly correlated. Their stories intersect at certain points, and the multiplicity of storylines reminded me of a very large Robert Altman and his finest films. But the real hero of the film, obviously, the city of Madrid, which provides the backdrop for the film. It houses the symbols contains sidewalks and roads on which they walk, and sets the background atmosphere for all events, all beautifully shot scenes. <br /> <br /> The film again and again returns to certain topics (shoes, for example), but in fact Salazar makes it more and more clear metaphor for the viewer, as the film progresses. It combines views of the city with the character frames and elegantly matches the feeling of the scene in the background. A lot of talented actors helps him portrait of a wide variety of characters. One excellent example is the scene in which Anita through Juaquin takes out the first time. It can not work on the small screen, but it gave me goose bumps easily on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Post film is very positive, and accordingly, the film is light and funny at times. Music for the movies tend to pop, with a few instrumental pieces (I hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day, although I seriously doubt that I will be). <br /> <br /> All along, I walked out of the film with a sensational feeling, and I'm not easily impressed (you have to take my word for it). For this and more I give this film a solid 8/10.
