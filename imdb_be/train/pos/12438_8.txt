The film was highly anticipated release, which, where a little disappointing because of the expectations x I created. When you look at it once again, I must say that it is actually quite normal. First of all, it is very faithful to the original story (of course, not completely) and as such are only made to maintain the right to film. History of modesty as the child appears very to the original. Actions may not be the best around and the plot is a little thin, but if you compare it with Witte film 1966 is better because it does not try to be a musical. In general, I would only recommend it to fans of Modesty Blaise, or to someone who is on to catch it on TV.
