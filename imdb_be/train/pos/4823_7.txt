This is a difficult thing to play the Queen. On the one hand, the actress should be majestic and powerful, and on the other hand, it should show a vulnerability in a difficult situation, as well as a fee of courage and determination to overcome their differences, as almost all movies about kings have that storyline. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt pretty radiant as Victoria, but it is not as full performance, I would not want to, do not blame her. I can not help but feel that this adaptation of Mills & Boon novel compared to the darker, more dramatic film about another young Queen Elizabeth. Therefore Blunt will not get to run the gamut of emotions of the royal, at least not fully, because it is, y'know, the young Victoria. To see the old Victoria, check Mrs. Brown. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Vallee interesting choice of director for the film. The last time he did C.R.A.Z.Y., which was lovely and stuck it to glory. It was a different movie, but I remember looking great, and this is perhaps the most important similarity between the two films. But while Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., this one was Julian Fellowes, and although I really enjoyed his Gosford Park, the story of this film was much less interesting. Soon I got lost with all government policies. Perhaps it was less attractive, because there was no potential decapitation monarchy. I'm just saying.
