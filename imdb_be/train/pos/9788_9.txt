I was at the same conference, writers and saw a movie. I thought that the writer - Sue Smith - very clearly summarize what the film was about. However, the film does not need an explanation. I thought that the themes were quite obvious and inspiring. The film, which deals with the dare to face the fear - especially fear passed down from parent figures - and overcome it and, at the same time, grasp the opportunity of a lifetime, it's a film that will be cherished and savored. I enjoyed it much more than a lot of hyped "tumble". I also think it was a bit unkind Mandy62 Hugo Weaving. The guy on his crops, I have to look good! I agree that many Australian films have been dull recently, but "Peaches" delivers the goods. I am glad that I have seen.
