It's the only movie I have seen the prince in Russia, but it does not matter. And I thought he was just gorgeous singing boy I was wrong. This is probably his best performance. Music is great. That's why he won an Oscar in 1984 for best music for the film (or something similar). Now he has an Oscar and a Grammy under his belt. While cursing gets in the way of the film (just make sure there are no small children or in the room). There is not much to say, without revealing the plot. You really have to go and get this film Your collection is not complete if you have not received this film in it. What else could I say, go and get this film right now, except for!
