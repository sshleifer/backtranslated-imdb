I am completely shocked that this show was cancelled.Ity only lasted year.I only recently started to watch it, and I love it.Its show that could have withdrawn as Friends went.It had humor and was very pleasant. <br /> <br /> it is about 2 brothers and 2 sisters living under the same roof without parents.Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the role of the oldest brother and takes on a more paternal role. <br /> <br /> it has lasted a lot longer than a year, as it was fantastic. Amazing show with the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
