Â«Silverlake Life" is a documentary, and it was clear and understandable. In fact, it was more like a home video, and if you want dramatic illumination, to see something else. And it is in any case not a sentimental. But I mean that in a positive way. It shows two people who love each other, and how to be infected with AIDS affects the quality of their daily lives. It's almost hard for me to say whether it was the quality of the film or not, because it was so divided that I had to find other ways to respond. This is a great movie, is actually one of the most wonderful, genuine documents that I have ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity as their life is reduced to the most basic parts. This makes the production of a hollow tree AIDS seem hip and heartless. These people have made this film for myself, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene in which Tom sings "You're My Light" by Mark and tells him goodbye is the real thing.
