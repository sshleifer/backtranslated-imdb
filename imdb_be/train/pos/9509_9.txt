Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really do not know why everyone is saying that it has a slow pace. I thought the pace was perfect. Film about Michael Sullivan, played by Tom Hanks with perfection, which is a kind of a hit-man / assassin worked for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He disslikes this work, but it does so because Rooney had paid for his house and helps him financially. He did not have anything, Mr. Rooney has given him everything. But his children do not know that it's his job, and if one witnesses restrained kills him, he is in an awkward position. And when there is a crime, he goes along with his son and bent on revenge. They rob abanks and more and build rapport. They are a perfect team. Hanks does a great job as always, and Jude Law, who plays his role perfectly awful. This drama is strongly recommended, as it shows a beautiful story and pretty much shows how the 1930s were.
