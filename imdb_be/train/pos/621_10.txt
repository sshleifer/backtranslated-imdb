As a big fan of science fiction in general, and with the works of Neil Gaiman * specifically *, I'm looking forward to this movie so greedy, so eagerly and with such bitter waiting mixture of fear and frustration that I can hardly believe that this finally here. And you know what? I do not need to be afraid, the film version of bl ** d strange. Unlike the book, but in a good way - less legible, funnier, more deeply sweet and charming <br /> <br /> special effects is absolutely infallible, and make a magical feel natural and right piece. peace walls, without being clearly more effective and intrusive. <br /> <br /> Due consideration has been given to speaking and stimulation, and casting is mainly a triumph, with the ghostly princes (whose roll call read almost like a "who's who" in the currently cool British comedy - Rupert Everett, Uollyams Little Britain glory, two of the guys from Green Wing, etc.) hijacking most of the best lines and almost all the funny moments of the films that exist in abundance. <br /> <br /> In fact, one minor criticism I have in general a film that sometimes comedic elements are a bit OTT, subtlety goes out the window at impairing the basic plot .... cameo Ricky Gervais, for example, was just too much, "Ricky Gervais makes his usual David Brent from the office comedy persona" for my liking, and in my opinion, created an unpleasant buffeting and a break from magic spells progressive history (although in fairness, from memory I think that the character of Ferdy in the original book was quite "Ricky Gervais e Â»-esquire, when I think about it) .... <br /> <br /> But this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately actors and script a fairy tale with a good mixture of action and romance. Charlie Cox as Tristan main character, captures the right mix of naivety, comedy and subtle self, necessary for the story as this is where the "modest boy embarks on a life changing adventure"; Claire Danes as Yvaine beautiful, evil, and only slightly foreigners or etheric perfect explanation for her starring role; Robert De Niro, in a cameo, each reviewer is talking about, is indeed commendable, rollicking good fun (it seems that he is with the ball, too) ... and Michelle Pfeiffer triumphantly cool and back as the evil witch Lamia, my favorite film performance as a whole . !. If you like it magically would tchy performance lately, "Hairspray", then you will thoroughly enjoy her well in this <br /> <br /> So, to round out this overview: you will laugh, perhaps, you smile, and you can even cry - Stardust beautiful, heart warming tale for the whole family, with a heart of gold and more audacity 'n smarts than once. One of my favorite films is absolutely fantastic Princess Bride, Stardust and now easy to compare with this a good reason, since it is very similar to the type of film, exploring such topics and areas .... and just like a princess bride is fresh, clever and funny twenty years after its initial release, I believe that delicious sweetness insincere Stardust will appear as a family favorite on our TV (or future equivalent device!) for many years to come.
