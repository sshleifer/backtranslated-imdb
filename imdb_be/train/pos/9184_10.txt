Yes, it is the production for a long time (a good news for fans of Bronte!), And he has some sense of legacy, but also casting and actions are so brilliant that you do not want to see any other version! <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton, Edward Rochester ... it's that simple. I do not care what the other reviewers say that it is too beautiful. Dalton is attractive, of course, but not really a boy. In fact, he has a rocky, dark corner of charm, which, in my view, entirely in keeping with the mysterious, very masculine, Mr. R. And he takes on boring, weary persona Rochester so sarcastically. He draws a rage when the scene calls for it, but also reflects the gentle, passionate, emotional side of Rochester as well. (IMO newer & E production of suffering that Ciar√°n Hinds - which I normally love -. Seems to bluster and bully your way through I read the book many times, and I never felt that Rochester was perceived as a non-stop growling beast.) <br /> <br /> When I read the novel, I always see ZIL Clark, Jane. Ms. Clark, reminds me of Jane as she describes herself (and described by others). Small, childlike, fairy ... although it is true, the actress does not look 18, it reflects Jane attributes as well. While other reviews say that her acting wooden or indifferent, we must remember that the character has spent 8 years at Lowood are trained to keep their emotions and "hot character" in check. Her main inspiration was her childhood friend Helen, who was the picture of demure presentation. Although its true nature is not like Jane learned her own character and is compliant in accordance with the school's goals for their charity of students who will go to the "service". Jane becomes a governess to a wealthy family of Mr. Rochester. She, of course, * nya * to speak with him as an equal. Even later, when she gave and she received, she will always be sure to remember that her station was considerably lower than her employer. However, if you read the book - to which this production is surprisingly close - you can clearly see small fight ZIL-and-Jane who suffered as she submits his emotions to remain soft and balanced <br /> <br. /> The chemistry between Dalton and Clark just, I think. No, this does not in any way resembles a Hollywood (thank God! This is not Hollywood like a book), but they have a novel that is a true, loyal and faithful. And for women like Jane, who never intended to have * any * love will come your way, it's a small miracle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is terrific, and I love the fact that almost every character in the book is here. Just a lot of rich poetic original dialogue. This version is the only one that I know to include beautiful, the infamous "Gypsy scene" and, in general, shows more humor than other versions I've seen. In particular, the mutual teasing between the main characters come straight from the book, and so cool! <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre was, in many respects, one of the first feminists novelized. She finally made love on their own terms and independently of each other, and, finally, it's true equal to Rochester. Just beautiful!
