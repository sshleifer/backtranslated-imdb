Linear drive in a non-linear structure. It is a fact that the time in the 12 monkeys, flows in this come and go between the present, future and past. However, the linearity of the film can not be avoided: it is the very operation of the projector, the narrative deployment <br /> <br /> The fact that we can see the underlying theme of time reflects the inevitability of our actions. , The world of the film, Terry Gilliam's world with a small space for free will. <br /> <br /> From the outset, we inform about the prophecy of schizophrenia, according to which a plague will manage the Earth in 1997 ,. forcing some survivors to live under the ground - the only place that does not depend on virus <br /> <br (Willis) mission /> Cole clear: a return to the mid-90s, to explore what and who who is associated with the release of the virus. There's no way to change the past: all you can do is to gather information that could help scientists present (that we the audience, this is the future) to find a cure. Do not change what happened (the past is inevitable), but to do better now <br /> <br /> In his "return" at the time, Cole gradually approaching amazing dilemma :. His life in the past, the best of his life at the moment. <br /> <br /> The last dark and brutal, totalitarian monitored by scientists who elect "volunteer" (this word ironically acuity) to embark on a trip to the past. <br /> <br /> scientists have not reached a high level of achievement in a journey through time, and Cole ends up on the wrong date - it will, at the end of the story, the work as evidence of his sanity for a psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe). <br /> <br /> We can see through the development of the plot, that of linear and nonlinear interlaced scanning in a circular time. <br /> <br /> There is more than one point, which is the first stage and ends up being almost the last - and, of course, the highest - is. It changes itself in accordance with the suggestion of memories Cole, who come to his dreams. <br /> <br /> At the airport, a man shot and killed during the operation, armed with respect to someone else. A blonde woman is running for the murdered one. <br /> <br /> This is a scene that connects the past (in which Cole is a kid who is visiting with his parents Airport), this (narration time) and the future (adult Cole) throughout the narrative, Cole's sense of what is already he lived in reality he is experiencing at the moment. His prophetic dreams are proof that it is impossible to avoid or escape what happened. Agents who shoot him to stop him from killing mad scientist, Dr. Peters (Morse), which is responsible for the spread of the disease. <br /> <br /> What happened can not be changed. And, in the case of Cole, that was what it would be. Forever. <br /> <br /> The film is not very well understood for many. For me, nothing less than a masterpiece <br /> <br /> The other good films with a similar theme :. Back to the Future trilogy (ie other angle relative to the "mad scientist" character, and although it shares the atmosphere of decay - in particular, in the second film - it's way more optimistic than the work of Gilliam, that the odd Hollywood picture) <br / > <br /> in another register, is a "strawberry", a masterpiece Bergman ,. which includes a bright and enlightening journey into the past through the memory. <br /> <br /> I never looked «La Jetée», but only because I can not find it.
