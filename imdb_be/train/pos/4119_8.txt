Another demonstration of genius Kurosawa, his first color film darkly surreal look at the tragic life of Tokyo slum dwellers, in fact weave a series of vignettes that show several groups of people dragging out a dangerous existence in the harsh and indifferent postwar slums swinging from comedy to tragedy and back, this film shows how people cope with the worst life each in its own way, basically, going into himself and live in fantasy worlds of their own heads, lifting emotionally from others or themselves Tupelo Tzav alcohol. Mixing naturalistic realism with Kabuki-esque theatrics, Kurosawa toys expertly with the emotions of his audience, using tears and laughter with equal dexterity. Excellent draining experience.
