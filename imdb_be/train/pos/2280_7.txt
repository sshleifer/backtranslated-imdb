It is difficult to classify the film - perhaps it is the vanguard of the spy thriller? Mother Night Vonnegut novel, very good, and certainly one of its light novels adapted into a feature film. A screen adaptation of the original book is very accurate. "Indy" approach to how the film was received is probably more effective than a large Hollywood studio financing. These days, I doubt a clever novel, as a mother night ever to receive the green light from the big Hollywood grindhouses. And usually, it's too bad, but not in this case. Mother Night is tight direction and a solid cast. Nick Nolte, who seems to be becoming more and more roles as he gets older, still, that "everyman" persona, which allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as always. I always thought that she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry. I think it makes his debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) with a small number of essential roles have not choice, even if the TV show becomes insignificant phenomenon. In any case the movie is quite nice, and you do not have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given the current geopolitical realities, the novel premise may seem outdated, and some young viewers with little knowledge of the history will be completely baffled by the events unfolding (I'm talking to you, dear Americans, who are students scored the lowest in industrialized countries in geography, history, and god knows what other things!).
