I just saw this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival, where he played under the North madness. Honestly, the only reason I went to this movie because it shares its name with the song Radiohead, and also because my friend bought tickets, so I really had no choice: -DI went expecting it to be something like Silence of the lambs, but it turned out, semi-gusset Flick. Someone already said that none of the characters are not pretty, and it is absolutely correct. I really could not care less if Potente character and got her insides pulled out on the creep. I was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with character Potente gets her just desserts. Christopher Smith, of course, did a great job with the visual aspect of the film. However, the story is rather weak, but then again the whole point of the movie is to scare you and did so very effectively. The cost of a gang Bristol titled Insects was at the highest level. This more than anything else, really scared the shit out of me. <br /> <br /> The director was really a decent guy and was very interesting during the Q & A session. I really hope that he gets to make the best films in the future. <br /> <br /> This one is strictly for fans of the genre, but I would recommend nya-fans, to give it a try anyway. It was a fun trip.
