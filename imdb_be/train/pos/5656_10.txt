I could never remember the name of this show. I use to watch it when I was 8. I remember staying up late, I do not think, just so I could watch this show. It was the best show for me. From what I remember of it, it's still great. This indicated starred Lucas Black makes his first boy I ever had a crush on. I'm from the country, so the guys do not have to focus attraction for me, but for him, I would have definitely made an exception. Who after seeing Crazy in Alabama, Friday Night Lights, and Tokyo Drift, you should understand why. He's a wonderful actor and has been since he was a child. I miss this show, and it is a pity that it comes back. If anyone sees where they sell season, please email me. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
