I enjoyed the innocence of the film and the characters had to deal with a reality that has a powerful animal in their environment. Gorilla looks simply stunning, and the eyes were particularly realistic. It's even a little scary sometimes, a child must have a little frightened, without exceeding the top. Rene Russo plays its role wonderfully feminine. Usually this type of Hollywood movies that take place in the past, feel the need to create a straw man villain, but only opponent gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close some of the animals to the people, how they feel the same emotions that we do, and yet we can not really treat them in the same way as humans, because they are not ' They are. Not many films take a chance on this territory, and it's worth a look if you want to see the similarity of humans and animals.
