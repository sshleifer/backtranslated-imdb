First you need to take into account the period of time this film was made. 1995. rappers were in it, and that added to his flair. <br /> <br /> Remy was a socially awkward teenager trying to find his way and could not, until he met and became friends with the Nazis. They took him. The Nazis not all that uncomfortable, but, like most bands, they fill the void, is not enough, be it economic, social, emotional, whatever. Rappoport played the role perfectly. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was the hot shot star of the track, with questionable ethics of work and a chip on his shoulder. He tried to feel sorry for himself and his plight, and was his friend and professor straighten him on it. <br /> <br /> Kristen was a young white girl is not trying to find himself and trying to fit in, until she was date raped. Then she found her own experiment with their sexuality, and is involved in political terms. <br /> <br /> This film is dedicated to racism and, as with most things that deal with racism, their own perspectives of people come into play. <br /> <br /> I have read so many comments about how there was no "evil" black characters, but there were evil white one (the Nazis). So what? Remy was not portrayed as evil at all, he tries to find his way and continued to fail, while some skinheads did not accept it. He was scared, it was sad to see him as he did to pass. He even says that right before he kills himself, I mean, I wanted to be an engineer. <br /> <br /> Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were angry black man, Ice Cube was a bit of an intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was simply painted as a dumb thug. They both showed no consideration at all of his roommates, and, as a rule, apparently, do not like white people very much. They were evil as the Nazis, but not at the level of the Nazis on the overall hazard. Unfortunately, when it does not seem fair, but there are actually black groups like the Nazis? No. <br /> <br /> People say that it shows white = black = -Bad well. Does not that just bad white characters were Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (Omar Epps roommate) was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy, he was just a mistake. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta had serious character flaws, anger and inattentive. Although their constant harassment by the police, seemed to justify some of their anger. Remy inability to fit in, it seemed to justify his anger, as well. <br /> <br /> A good movie, well done. As with all films that deal with racism, most of it to get the discussion going. <br /> <br /> I do not think that the Cube and Busta coulda beat the Nazis, though.
