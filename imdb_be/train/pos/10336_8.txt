This is a hard one to watch - says an earlier reviewer. This is surprising, given the terrible movies that were released immediately after the Second World War - in particular, the "liberation" of Dachau. It is clear that, as in the middle of the war, we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews. The sequence, which shows the "transport" is a vivid, almost as if they are based on real newsreel (Nazis liked to record their crimes). Knox Nazis is brilliant. It is defined Nazi career path. This mapping is particularly significant when contrasted with the response of other Germans, for the first laughed at Hitler, then disbelief, and finally helpless. This difference, however, allows us to believe in the "conversion" of one young Nazis to the anti-Hitler position. It happened when the witness several attempts against Hitler in the first place Staffenberg story that happened in the movie came out. Strong film, effectively using flashbacks to accurately predict the path of the Nuremberg and others that might occur after the war ended.
