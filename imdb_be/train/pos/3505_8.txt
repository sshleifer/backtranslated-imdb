I have no idea how to IMDb sorts reviews, but I know that, as often happens on Amazon.com, there are a surprising number of very negative reviews for this film, which repeats the same few unintelligible conversation, almost word for word. The company? Only knows IMDb <br /> <br /> As for the film :. This is normal. This funny, cute and very simple film. <br /> <br /> It has been over ten years since I worked in Brooklyn, Queens and lived in, visited relatives in the South Bronx. But I found nothing unreal or exploitative about these children. Is Grandma strange character? Yes. Do recognize dialogue and plot it? Yes, fortunately, they do. Other films are set in the LE and with the participation of Dominican / Puerto Rican children possible? Still. This makes this film a crime ?? some (in my eyes, AstroTurf) comments would suggest? Hardly. Let a thousand flowers bloom plastic. <br /> <br /> It's better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or Degrassi High. Scoff in comparison, but were never _we've that_ and I touched the heart, humility, this film aims and gentle spirit. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to know the background of all this slander! :-D
