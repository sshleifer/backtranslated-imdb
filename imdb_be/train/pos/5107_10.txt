What is missing soundtrack 80s. I think John Travolta sang a few songs, but in watching the film, she seems to embody all that was the 80th year of cheese. Obviously films that rely on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were in style. The best was his lousy Texas accent. Compare that Friday night, we look Lights.I cocktail mix and crazy to begin to truly get to the dumbing down of the film. Furthermore, as the observations made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg is alarmingly bad movie. I was so shocked to realize that I never watched it. Another amazing film of this genre should include Cadilac People Robin Williams. Just remember, all these big stars played a large role in these crappy movies .. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
