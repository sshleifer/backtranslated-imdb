Another for Babes & Bullets crowd. History is much more acute than any other music I've seen: guns hidden until no legs female generative and place each other in a way that comes closer to the intelligent comments than we would expect for a locale. More effective than modern "drama". It is difficult to identify with the woman who holds the gun up her pants - the LUE with leggage. Quite remarkable, given the context. <br /> <br /> Despite the gun leg up things, which provides 90% of the surprises, the film also chronicles how greed supersedes all other considerations in the life of the group in yakuzas, a woman who watches her leg gun / rocket launcher box (so that no one group shower scene, or straps) hidden projectile-launcher, which extends for the main characters back, seemingly out of nowhere in the dead or alive Miike (in 1999), the torch I deduced from the air by the end of the original character Tomie (2000), or harrowing flame throwers scene Sone chnym or get Blue (1992), all this testifies to the almost third world Cantinflas-Esquire influence in contemporary Japanese cinema, which I find it hard to explain, but I can not complain. <br /> <br /> You will not see the good quality of the films essentially made in Hollywood, it all but extinct and cheap crap they are evacuated for a cheap thrill, but it's funny. This is a real movie and while its great in its entirety, the ending is brilliant, if not plagiarism unblatant some pictures of Sergio Leone, including guns, where his feet should be, and, of course, by the way!
