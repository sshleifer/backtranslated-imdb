The director duo Judas Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto "Meatball Machine", apparently a remake of the 1999 Yamamoto film of the same name. I doubt if I ever get a chance to see the original, so I'll just stick to commenting on this. First, what is "Meatball Machine"? Easy to Noway artsy low budget splatter industrial swing is packed with great make up effects and gore. This is not something that you will eventually write a book about, but it's still entertaining if you dig this type of movie. <br /> <br /> «Meatball Machine" follows a well-known story. Boy loves girl, but too scared to ask her out on a date. The boy finally meets a girl. Girl infected with parasitic alien that turns her into a mortal cyborg. The boy, in turn, also makes the conversion to a specified thing, and goes on a quest to save his love. Will he succeed? Who gives a damn, as long as there is carnage and death, I am satisfied. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, relatively stereotyped, but it did work well enough, setting the course of the film straight ahead into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters. There podagovor focusing on how the parasite that has infected the girl came into their lives. And yes, it is also, fortunately, it shows more violence. I'm happy. Duties that you expect from a budget does not splatter. It's not exactly painful to the ears, but it is not good. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the film, but violence and blood (for example, I did not mention that already) are cyborg design. Quite Keita Amemiya who work in the creation of amazing creatures and costumes for movies and video games, which are well known. In necroborgs, as they are called «Meatball Machine» detailed look amazing. Without the use of CGI Amemiya designs are exciting fusion of flesh and metal, painfully strange in their appearance. Able to convert various parts of the body into the cool weapons, such as saws, rocket launchers, rifles firing the blood and so on, and so on. Although you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film, necroborgs are A-class film. <br /> <br /> «Meatball Machine" is "Tetsuo The Iron Man" mixed with "Alien," everything is done in a low budget and extra ketchup mode. This is a very interesting film, which does not take into account the modern special effects and proves that the spray genre is still alive and well.
