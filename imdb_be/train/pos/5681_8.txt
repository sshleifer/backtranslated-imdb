I have not had any problems with the film, which I thought was pretty good. This is an actual LAPD crime video that bothers me. I wonder if the Lion Gate really thought that the general audience of viewers would like to see people who were beaten to death and blood everywhere. Unfortunately, the lion's gate, it was incredible BAD IDEA !!! <br /> <br /> Returning to the film: The cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as the late John Holmes. John Holmes was cheap, oppressed women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend), and he is hopelessly deep in drugs. His relationship with Eddie Nash (Bogosian) creates a spiral that led to the infamous Wonderland murders. Exactly how much Holmes was involved in the killings? We will never know the truth of history (Nash is still alive, and free people), but the film does a pretty good job, though.
