First I saw this film about 1990 and all died laughing through it. He became a cult with my circle of friends, and we would like to quote from it for no reason ( "I'm going home in the bag!"). Needless to say, the humor is still there 15 years later. It has become a tradition at Halloween time to put many of my new friends to this film (well, you can still buy it Ebay!) I found that Halloween candy tastes better with tongue planted firmly in your cheek..and this film gives it all-pathos, suspense, unrequited love, generosity, and the list goes on. Royal Dano provides a wonderful heartfelt performance of the elder Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in "7 Faces of Dr. Lao" as a bad guy who met a bad end. Here, you really feel for the old from the start. <br /> <br /> If you're not careful, you'll miss some of the levels of humor in this film. The creators got real thin in many respects with an impromptu commentary little thin dripping suit in other sci-fi movies, and even a scene ripped from the pages of Wile E. Coyote! <br /> <br /> Do not waste too much mental processes are trying to analyze the film, man-it's fun fare without having nagging, and should not be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they will not know that they tease ..). <br /> <br /> -Now, when you'll excuse me, I'll go get 'Zag-nut' bar .... <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, Karaoke DJ / entertainer
