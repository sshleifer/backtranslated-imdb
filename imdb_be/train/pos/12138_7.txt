Language dialogue is rather strange and unnatural acts and still recalls his transition from stage techniques. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis always gives good results in all of his films, as it is doing in this early period of her very successful career. I feel, however, that once a cockney accent is not appropriate facial expression. I think it's supposed to Cockney accent that does not ring true for me. <br /> <br /> Somerset Moen likes to delve into human relationships a great dramatic intensity that will delight all moviegoers. Like many of her character roles, Bette Davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman in a full adder fiery hatred. Leslie Howard is well cast as the withdrawn British artist with Kosolapov desperately looking for a partner and make a bad choice on the intriguing little waitress. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film a young doctor meets his true love on a busy street. They cross through traffic completely oblivious to the many horns and whistles to yell at them. This scene is perhaps meant to be funny, but I find it quite funny, in this case, a very serious film. This probably explains to send you home with a smile on his face. And yet, as far as we can see (and hope) this is a happy ending.
