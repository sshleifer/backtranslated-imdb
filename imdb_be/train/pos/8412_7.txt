Those who engage in a movie camera so early in the century, must have realized some of its potential very early. It's a good story such as Playboy, which is in need of money, and accidentally sells his soul to the devil a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul of his double, and he must stand up to him often, tearing my life apart. There are some great scenes with people breeding and, of course, the scene when the two are in the process, at the same time. The middle part is a bit boring, but Faust story is always in the mind of the viewer. One thing I should mention is the unattractiveness of the people in the film. In addition, they are largely shied away from a lot of action, which could, at least the data some life to things. I was first made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and were finally able to see him. I was not disappointed.
