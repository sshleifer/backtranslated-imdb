Pushing Daisies was a wonderful show. Much like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you might say, was created by Fuller. I can understand how people who do not have a lot of love for the theater, cinema, musicals and the like will be annoyed. This is not a typical program of television and fiction too much for some. These people seem to need some a little more linear and subdued tone, to keep them happy. This program explodes with color, winks at the old movie scene is buzzing with incredible music and talented performances. There's nothing random selection, which are made from the suit in the leitmotif. History is replete with twists and turns, but still very accessible, because it talks about love, honesty, courage, loss and so many other things that we face every day. Only unfortunate aspect was the end of the show, and was delivered because Daisies shock was canceled. Do not approach this as a typical TV show. Think of it as an evening at the theater, and then sit back and enjoy!
