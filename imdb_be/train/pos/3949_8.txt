Like many people on this site, I saw this movie only once, when he was first televised in 1971 with some scenes linger in my memory, and a general feeling of anxiety as I can remember, that depends on it. I would be fascinated to see him again, if he ever made for home video <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler :. I wonder if someone will agree that the basic configuration of the plot and the characters may have been obtained from 1960 British film, originally called the City of the Dead, Horror under the changed name of the hotel for US release? There are some similarities and later the British film The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> One detail remains to me years after watching the film. It is a small but important point near the beginning of the film. As I recall, the minister and his wife stopped to help some people by the roadside, about 1870, somewhere in the west. Friendly imaginary Ray Milland is herself and her daughter (?), Yvette Mime, a beautiful young woman mute. While the preacher helps Ray Milland with a cart, detonating slips in sight and coil terribly invisible any of the characters except Yvette Mimi. She does not look scary at all, but looking at the snake with the silent concentration, until it goes away. With this strange little moment, we already know that there is something very unusual these seemingly normal people, although the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time. <br /> <br /> This is one small scene remains with me is alive after all these years, along with many others. The film has a compulsive quality about it that will not let go, and it's not surprising that people remember it so vividly. Someone has to do it for a home video!
