Worst movie of all time? Wow, wow now. You can not be serious. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's all that you expect the film to do for you. I live in Oregon, so I got to enjoy the beautifully filmed images of familiar yet still amazingly beautiful cliffs of Smith and other areas in Central Oregon (as well as a sweet cameo of our own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs, looking down on a carriage Cisse baby at the beginning of the film). Those alone were enough to push me to give the film better than "average" rating. <br /> <br /> Or .... Maybe it's all about what expectations you have. After reading the book AGES ago, and I thought to myself: "My God, no one could make a movie out of this interesting, quirky, amazing book ... especially after 20 years, when the manners (moray - you can not put the emphasis in the online sign) has changed." - I was actually very pleasantly surprised when I first saw the movie when it came out in 1994 and even today is more like to watch it again <br /> <br /> Cisse was exquisitely molded, and I do not care what you all told, I was also pleasantly surprised by the rain phoenix and performances by John Hurt in. I'm not a lesbian or bi or trans, but there are a lot of people who look like the people they were supposed to represent - and those "real" people kind of acted the same way as these actors acted. Fields little stage-ey - always a bit "on." Gus Van Sant is one amazing native Oregonian garsh but he did a good job adapting this insane book IMHO.
