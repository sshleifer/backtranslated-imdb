Although I have seen this movie years ago, his influence never left me. Image of Stephen Rea as invetigator deep and moving. His longing for not being able to stop the destruction is palpable. Everyone in the cast of the country from Sutherland, who is trying to adapt it and to ensure the way the police to coordinate their efforts in the troubled citizen's. Every day we are bombarded with stories about mass murderers, I think about this movie and exhausting work of people who are trying to do to find the killers.
