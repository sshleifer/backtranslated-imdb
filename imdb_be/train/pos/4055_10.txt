This movie is awesome, and I would recommend a child and an adult, yes. Animation beautiful, rich and interesting characters, and the story is interesting; much better than the American studios produced at the time. However, there are a few caveats to this statement. It's a shame that Disney bought the studio Ghibli back catalog, and then proceeded to butcher it. My main point being, Disney re-christened the film, in spite of the original English version was very impressive. New shot from Van Der Beek, and others destroyed him and took much of the appeal of the characters, such as Groove and Sita went from enterprising fellow to a whiny teenager. The original score is also much better than Disney remix. It begs the question, why Disney to make such changes? It seems to me that with Van Der Beek, and others to be thrown, so Disney can make more money, which is fair enough, but in the process they are spoiled, they shoot. It is still a beautiful film, and I would recommend it to anyone. My main beef is that Disney has spoiled the film since childhood, I loved and still love. I'm lucky enough to have the original Japanese imports of the original English dub, which I'm going to protect my life!
