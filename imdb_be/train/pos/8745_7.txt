After high school graduation, best friends Alice and Darlene, decided to make a trip to Thailand. Despite the fact that they are there, they meet a charming Aussie guy named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to Hong Kong with him. They agree. At the airport, though, they are devastated for smuggling drugs, and then get sentenced to 33 years in a Thai prison for what they say they did not. Not knowing what to do, they end contact Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. They say that if you have the money, he can help you. Things start well, but they still can not get out. <br /> <br /> The film is very good, because he does not give to the fact that this happens, and it's fun all the time. I could not believe that the end, though. It was one of those endings where you do not know is 100% true, but you seem to know what really happened with Nick and drug trafficking due to "possess up", etc. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both give good performances here. Beckinsales performance was a bit weak, though. Both Danes and Beckinsales symbol of friendship is good, but could have seemed stronger. Paul Walker even has a small caption role here. ;) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought that the destruction of the palace was a good movie, and I give it a 7/10.
