This is the first must see movie that I have seen in the past year! This outrageously funny, incredibly original, incredibly great looking (they went on this super cool widescreen Technicolor look, which is awesome to behold), and it actually has a depth in the character and the fact that he speaks of society. It's really clever satires, nails everything in internal security issues of race, at the same time leaving you laugh and understand how the world is living in fear. Carrie-Anne Moss turns into a comic performance I never thought would come of it! She's cute, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly as big as FIDO, which can only grunt and moan! And Dylan Baker as dad is priceless. In fact, all acting at all. Henry Czerny as the bad guy, Tim Blake Nelson, as a neighbor with a hot sexy zombie girlfriend (getting the idea now?) It's funny, but to think and just all amazing! Go and see this film! It's like nothing you've ever seen before.
