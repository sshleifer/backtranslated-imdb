This is a very long movie, which means that you can become very boring, before it becomes interesting, but its length allows her characters to find a permanent attachment to your likes. <br /> <br /> If you are inspired by a sense of guilt disgusting you find it particularly painful, because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and weak. If you can love a monster you will cry Magnus Pym, a spy who betrays all - in particular, his country, his friends and family. - a person who was also being manipulated and form of childhood by the same people, <br /> <br /> There is no one really likeable character in the whole of history, not a right, "moral" person sympathize. But all this will look very distinctive, without a cloth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it in the end. Well worth it for those who love inciteful of low human character of the movie.
