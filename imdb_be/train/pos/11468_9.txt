I am truly amazed at how little has been done in the film on the Columbine Massacre. There is not a major documentary, very embarrassing. Fortunately, we are graced with talent, Ben Coccio, led ZERO DAY and Gus Van Sant, who has made just fine ELEPHANT. Two different takes on the events that have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that there is something ultimately confusing and unknowable about the motivation of the two killers, and that in fact forced them to wear it outside fantasy into a terrible reality. ZERO DAY, ostensibly because of videos made by shooters and found after the event, it is absolutely riveting. Even if you know where this is going, you still have the hope that he would not "go" ... and the tension in the final minutes of the film painfully. The film is stunning from top to bottom, from the director to the script (not a lot of improvising, though it seems very spontaneous) on the two lead actors and supporting players as well. There is only one aspect of the ZERO DAY, which worried me. Thus, we can not understand why the shooter would do what they did, but it certainly was one of the authors of ANGER. However, these guys do not really seem to be angry. They may say some things to show that they are, but in fact they have not convinced me that they have something in them that made them kill innocent people. But it still leaves me with a feeling of "why ???" Coccio that the director wants me to have. Anyway, rent or buy the movie, it will creep up on you and remain with you for a long time. Blair Witch people wish only for the kind of success these guys have been out to the layout of the documentary.
