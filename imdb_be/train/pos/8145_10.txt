I saw this movie for the first time about 4 years ago, and I was expecting something funny, like CB4. I was taken out. I was on the floor laughing my example this film so great. Way better than CB4, characters, songs, story, everything. TOP expression independent film that received a "two thumbs up" by Siskel and Egbert (and if two old white guys can understand the humor in this movie, you know it's good).
