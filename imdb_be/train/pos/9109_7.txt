In principle, this is the story of two people who were part of the Portuguese revolution. It was easy to understand competition, but as a rule, the director begins with historical fact to talk about something else, they also show the period before or after the fact, everything happens during the couple of days when the revolution acts. It can also be seen as a kind of documentary. The film is to localize these two people, showing how they usually do not like the characters common, because that revolution come from people. Despite the fact that it was done with military troops from the name you can see that they were just «capitaes» as the protagonists. Pleasant color and light throughout the film, an excellent job for the director is her first film, she will not fall in the banal way. Good show emotions and passions of people and crowds. Character Maia (main) well done and there is a good interpretation of the Stephen ACCORSI, could show the limits of May, it's not-be hero.
