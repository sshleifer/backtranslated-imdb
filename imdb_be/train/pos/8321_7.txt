This enjoyable film, even if the room is stupid. It was a kind of guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to pull off the role in this film as (another example of Joe Versus the Volcano). This is what makes her a star part. Matthau, of course, had this ability, too, and he really puts himself in a role that does funny kind Einstein. I suppose you could say that they are both good drawing character attractive, although love differently (attractive young woman against a loveable curmudgeon).
