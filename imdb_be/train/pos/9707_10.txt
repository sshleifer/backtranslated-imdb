About a year ago I finally gave up on American television. I thought not giving up television completely to a friend who lived in England showed me some of the programs, which include offices, Extra, Blackadder, and the League of Gentlemen. That's when I decided to switch to British television. Among all the shows listed above, League of Gentlemen is the dark and twisted out of all of them, providing a guilty laugh and material not found in any other comedy I've seen yet. Symbols include the most disadvantaged couple, a butcher, who puts in the meat ingredients that go unsaid (probably for the better), a crazy couple to look after the local shop, which serves only local residents, and the worst vet ever. This program is one of the best I have ever seen.
