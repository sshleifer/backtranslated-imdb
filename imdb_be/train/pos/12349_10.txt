This movie just goes to show that you do not need a lot of explosions, muti-billion dollar computer graphics, or high above the highest paid actors and actresses to make a good film, all you need is a great story and plot. which is the owner of all the Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa shoots brilliantly. I recommend this movie to everyone that loves the epic period piece. and for those who like Kurosawas early work. 10/10
