I remember this movie as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO will show it late in the evening before, when they were they were the one and only movie pay channel in existence. Then it was unrated and was the only film of its kind ever shown on pay-TV ... especially then. I would like to see it now, as an adult, where I would be more inclined to understand the theme of this adult. This was probably the closest thing I've ever seen pornography at a young age of 7 or 8. Fortunately I had a stupid nanny and current party his father on weekends. Most of my memories of this film was quite erratic sexual behavior of these two guys. Breaking into the house to smell underwear, feeding on other people's breast milk on the bus, and fornication in a taxi, at the request of one of his female subjects were just some of the jaded tricks these guys pull. Very colorful film for the early '70s. While I have not checked the IMDb, I had no idea that this film was such a following. Most people, I say, that he had never heard of him.
