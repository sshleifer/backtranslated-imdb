The first two-thirds of this biographical film about fetish model Betty Page is very interesting. Betty is depicted with great sincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as a nice, girl next door type who does not see anything wrong with what she did (and, of course, there was nothing "wrong" with it). Director Mary Harron, who also made «I Shot Andy Warhol» and "American Psycho", recreates Betty America, blending the old black and white footage with the new, degraded, black and white photography. After Betty land in Florida and began working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty fame was mainly the result of her work with Paul and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a great performance, and Chris Bauer) and John Willie (Jared Harris). A scene where Betty Harron recreates Kabbalah sessions pictures fascinating and cleverly punished. The first suppliers fetishists material did not reflect too lenient, and we get the feeling that these people were part of the cruel "society". Betty was never too much trouble with her fame, but we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the forward akterskoge world. Because the third act of the film practically does not exist, we are left with the impression that we are seeing in the feature-length documentary film about Betty Page, rather than structured drama. Flaws aside, it's worth catching a movie and is another beautiful feather in the cap of producer Christine Vachon.
