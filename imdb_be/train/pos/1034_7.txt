I think that this film was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, but nowadays it seems a bit too didactic and static to lift his greatness. The film is set in 1940 - just before the US entry into the war. Paul Lukas plays a very important and worthy of the head of his family. He was a German who spent seven years of fighting with the Nazis and evade capture. Bette Davis is very understanding and his long-suffering wife, who was able to educate and raise their children without it from time to time. As the film begins, they cross the border from Mexico into the United States for the first time in many years, they are going to relax and stop working. <br /> <br /> The problem for me was that the family was too quite decent too - make it seem like an obvious positive propaganda instead of the real family, suffering through a real problem. Although it was a very lofty goal at the time, it just seems false today. In particular, it is incredibly amazing and very Scripted dialogue that used children simply does not ring true. It sounded like anti-fascism speech than the voices of real children. They were eventually very annoying - especially Littlest descended, at times, like a little boy. About the only ones who sounded real Bette Davis and her extended American family, as well as Romanian bastard lives with them (although he did not have any noticeable accent). <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that the ultra famous Hammett wrote the dialogue, as it just does not sound real life. The story was based on a play by his sweetheart, Lillian Hellman. And the main idea of ​​the story and the plot is good ... but the dialogue is simply bad at times. Overall, an interesting souvenir and a movie with some great moments ... but it's really all.
