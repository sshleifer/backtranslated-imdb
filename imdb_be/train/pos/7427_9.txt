I saw the trailer for this film in the 70s, when I was 16 or while watching another film. About !!!! how excited me and my best friend was. we could not wait for a month or so, until he comes to. I've seen this movie 17 times that year in the theater. I love, love, love it. Kris is so perfect for the film. He's brash and kind of cheesy, but also shy and insecure with Babs, and it's so endearing to watch it again. When they sing the evergreen in the studio, and he chimes in with his raspy voice, so different from the perfect score, coming from her, but I always thought that it was one of the best scenes in the film. The way he looks at her, and he proud.I could watch this movie every day. We try to dress like ECT-I have it even has a long sweater and a hat, which was so similar to the one she wore. it happened on TV time, and I got my daughter to see him, they were teenagers and they loved it. Maybe it's just that I was so captured by her in an age when everything was extreme, I do not know. The ending is always me in tears, even today.
