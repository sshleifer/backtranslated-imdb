8 Simple Rules funny show, but it also has some lessons of life, especially a mature lesson on how to go after the loose, that was the episode where Paul died, which was the first episode I ever watched the show, which It comes on ABC. Hennessy clan - mother Cate (Saga), daughter Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson), and son Rory (Martin Spenzhers) - looking at each other for guidance and support after the death of Paul (John Ritter), the family patriarch . Parents Kate (James Garner and Pleshette) to lend a hand. I am glad that at the end of the 2nd season of the show, they decided to put David Spade in this show, as it did from the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But all and all it shows is very good. This show reminds me a lot of classic family comedy from the 80s and 90s, who used to be on ABC.
