Here's another movie from the 80's that most people simply do not know exists. This slow, scenic (loving shots of landscapes Montana's breathtaking, and reminded me of Costner recently «Open Range», which also starred Robert Duvall), and emotional pleasure of the film is the perfect type of movie to watch late at night, when you can "t sleep or sluggish Sunday afternoon. Those in the right frame of mind will be considered finely detailed and intimate look at the mountain of the same family and they are back together after the younger son accidentally shoot and kill the eldest son while hunting. All performances at the highest level and quiet nuances. Glenn Close, Robert Duvall, and Brimley are the perfect step in his drawings, like all the players and support the young actors. I especially liked how the director Cain (which, unfortunately, has not directed anything remarkable, as it is but the first «Young Guns») gives us a quiet little glimpses into the private grief of everyone. Not only do we see the death affects the younger brother or the father, but also confused middle sister, wayward uncle, his wife mad, and friend of the late teen. What we get here is mainly rural average response to the "ordinary people." There are also shades of David Lynch's «The Straight Story» in some of the thoughts unpretentious Midwestern morality of people depicted here, as well as lovingly pursue agricultural boom that they inhabit. This is one of the best and more realistic "lacrimal-jerkers» era, and a nice little find for you a hunting movie there.
