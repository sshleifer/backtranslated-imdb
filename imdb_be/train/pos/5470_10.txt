Baby Face is one of the best in the "forgotten" before the code of movies. This was shown last night after the 1931 version of Waterloo Bridge on Turner Classic NET, so I was able to watch a movie as it is now four minutes, plus restored. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck lives in East St. Louis (where she may know, drunk parents "Peace" - Mae Clarke - Waterloo Bridge). Her father, Robert Barrett. She lived with him after her mother's death, and (in the reconstructed dialogue), he was pimping her since she was 14 years old. Now she is a resident of a waitress and whore in his correspondence the Speakeasy, her best friend being Chico (Theresa Harris), an African-American who holds Barrett servant hooliganism. It is one of two good points of the face Stanwyck, she continues to stand by her father on Harris, threatening to leave, when Harris burns (and since it's untidy working as Nat Pendleton, who love to see Stanwyck serve them, rather than the aroma of the brew he serve, which leads them to Barrett should obey it). <br /> <br /> one guy who comes to Speakeasy regularly Stanwyck who like shoemaker and intellectual Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Etienne), which sees great potential in energetic girl, if she would just leave her abandoned house. It also pushes the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and the idea of ​​the will to power. More on that later. <br /> <br /> After she knocks local political bigwig (Arthur Hall), and has an argument with Barrett about it, fixed explosion kills Barrett, and allows Stanwyck leave his hometown. She and Harris, head to New York, managing to get free transportation railway freight car, sleeping with a conductor (James Murray). They reach in New York, and after the walks they see Trust Company Gotham (established in 1873), and the friendly security guard tells her where the office staff is. <br /> <br /> We look Stanwyck slowly climb the ladder to the top, similar to (but sleazier), than Robert Morse ventured into how to succeed in business without torture. But Morse was a man in a man dominated company. Stanwyck knows her sex appeal of its weapons. It passes through the John Wayne Douglas Dambril (section of the film, which I always felt was the most strange - strangely enough - when I watched it), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker, and finally George Brent. Each eventually fall on it, and a push toward more, if not useful, or destroy it. Brent, the new president of the Bank of his grandfather founded, finally marries her - and the film crisis, when the economic situation of the bank shakes (especially after Brent buys her fortune in value and gives her valuable bonds). Brent charged. Will it stand up for him? <br /> <br /> SPOILER COMING UP: <br /> <br /> One thing about these films, Sun admitted that the drama and moral conventions of the time is still dictated the end. The original ending was Stanwyck landing on ships for Europe to give up Brent to his fate, but realizing that she can not do it for him, returning to them a dwelling house, and found that he had shot himself. She goes with him to the hospital, how it ends. Now, before the newly discovered material was found, the film ended up with them, apparently, giving up all his money in the bank to save it, and retire back to East St. Louis, to live happily, if poor. <br /> <br /> None of them are good endings. Stanwyck should continue its destructive course, with Brent last of his victims. But even without an office writers Brin (one Daryl Zanuck, by the way) has considered it necessary to find its moral center. She does not have one - at least, not for the strong men (which she hates). I do not think that depression spectators suffered this kind of conclusion. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, due to changes in styles of public opinion and changes in society. It was a man's world in the corporate world in 1933, as Stanwyck has her work cut out for her. The tree (if it is fired for indiscretion with him) admits that he did not want her to work. <br /> <br /> But in 2006, Stanwyck to find a woman everywhere. There's a nasty, angry remark (obviously based on some envy) in respect of the other secretaries Stanwyck and women working on its rapid growth. In 2006, it is often experienced by women leaders, and it will find them interrupted her to her feet quickly. Of course, if it finds one or two lesbian she could try this way, but it is doubtful. And she seems to never meet any men gay. They are gay leaders in business, who would not give a damn about her legs or chest. <br /> <br /> Then there's her teacher, Mr. Cragg. Cragg transformed into «bowdlerized» version in an attempt to force her to seek a moral center. In fact, he pushes Nieztsche, but the way (in the broader sense), the Nazis pushed Nieztsche - to find their way to power and push it. While Nieztsche did stress the power, it was not the Be-all and end all of his theories. Otherwise, no one will read it today in college courses. Cragg is obviously self-taught, but only half-educated. In short, if someone who has carefully studied before Nieztsche Cragg he'll make it look like a bum dropout. And this teacher Stanwyck in! A good movie, and it's worth the day 10 ... but has serious drawbacks.
