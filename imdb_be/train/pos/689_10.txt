maybe I'm identified with this film cause I live in New York and suffer from insomnia bad, but what is it, I have to praise the film director at the country working. to do what she did, the entire budget is ... wow, that's all I can say. in fact, very good. like no money has been spent on this film, and it still blew me away. I definitley suggest to check it out if you can. large uncut, fantastic result, and of course a script that will knock you on your ass. see it.
