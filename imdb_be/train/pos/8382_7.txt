If you want Fur war games is very good. Some are cheap, but the robot fights are worth seeing. I enjoyed Fur field of war for some time, and it's pretty much the only movie I've ever seen that come close to the feeling that it would be like to pilot one of these huge bags. If you like childbirth, then the game you like this Mech Warrior three and four, and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 to spare Steel Battalion. The film is worth seeing at least once. There really should be some more films on the same subject there. Less or more remakes original. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
