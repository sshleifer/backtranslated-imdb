Great story, based on a true story about a young black man, and all the difficulties on the way. Given that this is the first film Denzel Washington, that he was going at once, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical, but who would not ..? But then again, he's a great actor plently years of experience, and the final result was excellent. The story is told in a big way, making you that experiencing difficulties in childhood and adolescence, to see themselves in these situations. Thus, it hits you hard, letting you know your not the only one going through hell. In general, the moving story of a young man trying to make it in this F *** ed up world. (The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the author of the film) is strongly recommended. 8/10
