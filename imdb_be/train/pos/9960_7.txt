I noticed that this film was getting trashed long before they got to the theater, and I did not have high hopes for him. I thought that it was another «You Got Served» type of movie with some good dance moves and hardcore action. I was in the theater, and the choice between this and Meet the Spartans chose it. To my surprise, the acting is not bad at all, and the film was actually very good. The fact that it has a lower rating than You Got Served absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the garbage, published here, I recommend going to see a matinee showing of the film, so that you do not spend too much. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how wrong they were all about it. When it comes to dance movie is definitely one of the best of them with a far superior action than many others. Catch a movie and judge for yourself. It will be hoping that the rating will rise after it comes out on DVD and more people to check out the movie came out, rather than to judge it on the basis of the comments to the film released. <br /> <br /> edit the film is now moving closer to its face value. More than 1,000 people have given it a rating of 9, a little bit too high, but at least it helps to compensate for funny voices 1.
