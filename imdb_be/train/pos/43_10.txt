I liked this movie a lot. It really intrigued me, as Diana and Alicia friends for such a tragedy. Alicia was a restless soul, and Dean was so happy just to see someone after the shooting. My only complaint is that at the beginning it was kind of slow, and it took some time to get to the basics of things. In addition, it was great.
