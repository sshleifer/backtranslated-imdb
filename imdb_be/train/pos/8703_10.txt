I went into this film after reading it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift, which was made into a monster of society. Suffice it to say that I did something completely different than what I expected. But it was a happy surprise. My friend and I both thought the film was very romantic (the fact that men are not bad to look at, certainly helped), and there was enough of the plot development, action and even humor (what it does not take their 3 part of the film that is now the name of each other was a movietheatre laughs), to keep you entertained and fit into the story. In short: Not what I expected, but very nice surprise indeed. I will definitely buy this film when it comes out on DVD.
