I enjoyed every moment of this wonderful movie and was intrigued about this female artist I had never heard before. So I decided to explore her life and work later. As might be expected, I found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate. I was a little surprised, however, at a very negative comments about the movie because of this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, the film is not, and should not be a biography (and not a novel!). Any historical film distorts reality, since it must be a work of art in its own right. The film director has the full right to use the elements of reality and history to create his own world. Wormwood is a great movie, and I think that this has resulted in many people (including those who now give negative comments), to explore the life and work of this exciting artist.
