I have read most of the comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost all agree that 9/11 shocking part of the story. There are some who think that the story is weak and added <br /> <br /> I agree that the story is weak and useless. About two brothers finding each other's back after the crash and the rock hanger about Tony. But I do not think that the story is not necessary. As I have a lot of theorists, I think that our own lives are stories. We live and make our own autobiography. So, if we talk about our lives, it is always in the form of a story. We are not summarized the facts as :. Birth, childhood, school, etc. we create the story of our lives <br /> <br /> Because we are familiar with the story, we want to put the story in the history as well, because we can identify themselves in the form of a story. We can better understand things happened in history when it told in narrative form. So the purpose of adding stories in the documentary. History is weak, so be it, but we understand what is happening. If it was me out there, I'd be worried about my brother. <br /> <br /> And second, what I'm doing on this blockbuster. However, it was in the last time, to come up with a great film about 9/11. Although there were a few on the subject, but none of them, as this documentary. But what if there will be a film about 5 years? I agree that it is wrong to try to make a lot of money with 9/11. But I also agree that movies are one of the best ways to tell a story. How many films about World War 2 we have seen? If I had not seen these movies my view of the WW I would be quite different. I remember Schindler's list, and I cried for an hour in the classroom. Films give you a good picture of what happened in history, and although it is a fiction contributes to memory loss and disasters. <br /> <br /> So what's my point: tell stories not always a bad thing, it makes us identify with the story and makes us never forget what happened.
