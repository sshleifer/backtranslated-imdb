British horror film was in the final decline of the early seventies, but out of the darkness came three films that have been some of the best production of our island. Willow, Blood on Satan's Claw and The House that dripped blood from the future seems rosy, even though many people know at the moment is not going to be one. THTDB looks actors who could easily create a wish list, if he really was not collected in the harsh outback 2008, you may also find yourself waiting for awakening. Waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories, and, of course, my favorite, the life and art of Cushing interconnected so firmly that you can not tell where the performance ends and the pain begins. One can only guess how this affects the role of a gentle, sensitive person. Death and the Maiden. RIP Peter.
