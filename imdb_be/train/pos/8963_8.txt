John Van Druten Broadway lyrics are brought to the screen with the maximum power of the star in this romantic fantasy about modern witches who lures a successful publisher of Manhattan. James Stewart may get top billing, but that Kim Novak, who steals the show as one of the most attractive witch ever in enchanted on the silver screen. Lead pairing, in fact, one of the few weaknesses of the film: a gray-haired Stewart seems a bit old for the role, and while it's easy to see why he falls hard Novak, it's a little more difficult to understand what she finds attractive about him, as they seem mismatched in temperament and perspective. (This is one of the most amusing conceit of the story that witches and wizards are drawn as Greenwich Village beatniks and bohemians.) Interestingly, the pairing of Stewart-Novak will generate much more heat in «Vertigo», released in the same year as the film but then "Vertigo" had a compelling story suspense, and the advantage of the direction of Alfred Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> comical moments of the film is mainly provided by a stellar supporting cast, including a young Jack Lemmon (as warlock brother Kim), Elsa Lanchester (their ditzy aunt), and Ernie Kovacs (!), as a confused writer. Zhingold even shows in a fun cameo as a kind of Grand Witch. There's a lot to like in this film - wit, romance and a large cast - that is, if possible, you can take your eyes from the charming Miss Novak. I saw the movie a dozen times, and I never can.
