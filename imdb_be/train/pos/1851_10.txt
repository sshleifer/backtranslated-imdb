Saw this film in August for the 27th Annual Convention of the National Association of Black Journalists in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is the first public display. FILM gorgeous !!! Derek Luke is excellent as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. The real Antwone Fisher did a great job writing and directing the film Denzel is right on the money. View the first weekend. You will not be disappointed.
