This game takes the foremost still. I had the honor to play a mine on the PS2 so that the graphics were really good. Voice acting was above standard. Difficulty is just. Wesker has to be the best characters in the series RE, in my opinion. History impressed me a lot and took another turn, I did not expect. The only rating this game deserves a lot.
