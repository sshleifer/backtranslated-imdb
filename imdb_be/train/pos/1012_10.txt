Stargate SG-1 is a kind of an offshoot of the 1994 film "Stargate". I am so glad that they decided to expand on this theme. The show gets it rolling from the very first episode, Jack retired ONill must pass through the gates again, to meet with his old friend, Dr. Daniel Jackson. In the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent man, which does not allow more than one walk on it, and there is Teal'c, quiet, compassionate warrior who challenges his false god and joins the team. <br /> <br /> The major bad guys called Gou ald, they are parasites that can get inserted into your brain so that control them and do evil deeds. Any Gouald, which has a large amount of energy is often regarded as the "Lord of the system." The warrior behind Gouald called Jaffa, which house the parasitic Gouald in their bodies until Gouald can not get inserted into the human brain. <br /> <br /> After the episodes, we mostly get to see SG-1, the exploration team consists of Jack / Daniel / Tilkom / and Sam , go through a wormhole, which instantly puts them on other planets (this device is called Xia Stargate), and they are faced with new cultures or bad guys. Some scenes in the world, which means that they do not pass through the Stargate once in the episode, and it is better to deal with the pressing problems of the world. <br /> <br /> Over the years, you start to see a decrease in SG -1 command as close-knit and more character building storylines. This in turn means that even more on-the-world scenes, which is quite understandable <br /> <br /> My rating :. 8.75 / 10 ---- While much of this show is good, there are some cases storylines do not always get wrapped up, and less emphasis on the gate of the journey in these last few years. Still, at the highest level of science fiction!
