I remember watching it the first time, when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers." This film is still great. One original aspect is that the action scenes, which are very few. Bearing in mind that the "barbarian brothers", where so well that they ended up there the enemies of the fastest! In addition, you have a chase, the cage fight, the dragon, and even a bar fight! <br /> <br /> So, acting is bad so that's why it does not ten, as well as the storyline received a lot of criticism. I think it's pretty original. Not a lot of movies in its genre is the same original storylines, or scenic dialogue. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this film.
