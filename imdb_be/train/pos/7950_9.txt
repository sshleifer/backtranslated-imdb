First of all, I loved the music account Bruce Broughton, in a very lyrical, and this in itself has added to the charm of the film. The best aspect of the film were three animals, in highly voiced by Michael J.Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. While Fox funny line, Ameche plays pretty thoughtful otherwise lovable character (the voice of reason), and the field adds wit to the character that has always seen talking Chance away. People were not attractive, and sometimes the film pulled, but that's my only complaint. This is one kind of film, with beautiful close-up shots from Canada, I believe. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a dull moment seriously, and it is favorable voice work and well-written script. In general, charming and perhaps underrated film with 9/10 from me. Bethany Cox.
