I was looking for this one after watching the hilarious and linguistically complex "Clueless" (1995), perhaps the best known efforts of Silverstone at the beginning of his film career. «True Crime» is Kevin Dillon, which should be useful in improving the majority of film projects. in fact, all in the cast does a good job. the only disappointment, I think the film has for me it is uncomfortable "feel" to certain scenes on the basis of the need to run a pretty uncompromising grown theme as part of what is in the tone begins as schoolgirl adventure. <, br /> <br /> Alice Silverstone tions very well in this. It carries with it the well-naive enthusiasm and growing concern that affects Mary Giordano, as it is maneuvered to the truth behind the serial killings. I believe its characteristic MG has some mileage in it too. Conclusion storyline with ' It is that it goes to a career in law enforcement. It can be very interesting to go back over Silverstone Giordano during the crisis later in the officer's life. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> «True Crime» shows its director in a good light. Pat Verducci also has letters of credit. I do not know any other work in film PV did. I can only guess what happened after such a promising start. <br /> <br /> As with most industries, this one is largely unknown supporting cast, though, Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is unlikely. Over the past decade, he seems to have been able to provide an impressive number of appearances on the screen. I remember seeing him recently in «Carriers» (1998), made for TV presentation with military theme. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends." Proponents of classic US TV sitcom "Who's the Boss" may also be interested in "Carriers", as the leading player Judith Light, remembers with affection by many of her long involvement in the show. <br /> <br /> «True Crime» can be easily worked, but that's okay. I think it's a fascinating story, worth a look.
