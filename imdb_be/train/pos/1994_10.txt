Oliver Twist was to have a debate, as well as the success of following it after Dickens published in 1837. His picture of life in an urban ghetto was something shocking and new, and it makes the central figure of the novel include criminals was another innovation. <, Br /> <br /> One day he went to London and was a young woman, he was a friend. He said hello, but it was tough enough with him. He could not understand it. They met again in a few days, and he asked what he had done to upset her. "Well, if you must know, I do not like his last novel." She said. "In fact, still think highly of it." He was puzzled: "What happened to him?" "Oh, Charles," she said, "I am a Jew How could you make such a character as Fezhiny.?!" he did not expect it, "Well ... you know that the court last year, Ike Solomon thief coach he Fezhin model, and he was a Jew" <br /> <br /> Dickens found not to settle.. "Yes.", she replied, "He got what he deserved, but Charles, they did not call it" Solomon Jew ", as you call Fezhin" Jew "Besides, Solomon did not plan the murder Fezhin does.!.." Dickens was forced first to admit that he could have played out. He dropped to think about what she said. <br /> <br /> Oliver Twist was published in several editions. Dickens Fagin tried to improve a little bit. Then he got an idea. He reworked chapter called "Fezhiny last Night Alive», showing fear in man, as he faced the hanged man. he also added some additional details. <br /> <br /> he let his friend know about his determination to change Fezhiny. A day or later, he met her at a friend's house. She looked at him like he was crazy. "Do not you want to change?" He asked. "!" - "Charles, what changes it is still a nasty villain called" Jew, she said. "Yes, I did keep those, but you did not see how frightened he had been on death row in prison." The young woman noticed it, but I felt that he was so vile he deserves to suffer such fears. "Ah ... then I was right ... and you see the little details I added?", He asked. "What details?" She replied. "When you first see Fezhiny now he is preparing a meal ... you read it?" Dickens looked at her, waiting for recognition. Instead lady looked confused. "I read it in the fire, but I had to skim the passage." Dickens smiled as if he was brilliant, "he cook pork sausages for lunch." "What!" She exclaimed. "He eats pork, my dear ... see - he's not a very good Jew" His friend looked at him, shook his head, and to his horror left his friend's house. She had not talked to him for many years. <br /> <br /> Dickens never fully shook off his own fanaticism, but the situation has actually led to a partial attempt to make amends for his last completed novel. In Our Mutual Friend (1865), he has a minor character, Mr. Riah, used by unscrupulous landlord to collect high rents to the poor people. The owner believes that Mr. Riah will be blamed, because he was a Jew. <br /> <br /> But Mr Riah is a good man. He is a very good man. He's very, very, very, very nice people - so good to be incredible. If Fezhin saw g-Riah in action he is likely to chase him away with a stick. <br /> <br /> anti-Semitic image of Fagin lingers to this day. This measure of the genius of Dickens as a writer, the novel overcomes it. However, presenting the story in the film he is still causing problems for screenwriters and filmmakers: how, after the Holocaust, one can make the process worthy of the novel of the film without fomenting fanaticism? David Lin showed how the presence of Alec Guinness is one or two scenes showing human side and combating crowd at the end of the present advantage. Sir Carol Reed, in his musical version of the novel made it even better, because of rewriting the script. <br /> <br /> original musical was made into a hit West End musical Oliver in the mid-1960s, and then brought to Broadway, where it was hit again. With an excellent score Lionel Bart, including «Food Glorious Food», «I cover the situation", "consider yourself", "Boy for Sale", "Who will buy", "As long as he needs me", it deserved it success. Reed did well in his casting of roles, including his nephew Oliver Reed as Sikes, Ron Moody as Fezhiny, Mark Lester as Oliver, Jack Wild as Pluto, Shani Wallis as Nancy and Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble. There have been no great musical success in Hollywood for a decade - the last musical to win Oskara` Gigi was in 1958. Oliver won it in 1968. <br /> <br /> And Fezhin - how to cope with the eternal problem of the cartoons? Well, in music Fezhinah entirely captured, tried and executed for a murder at all. In the end, even Lean showed Fezhin tried to control his accomplice in his actions. But here Fezhiny realize that he is getting too old to depend on this kind of a risky life. Despite the fact that it loses its treasures (the stolen items he was holding, because he knew their value, and admired for their beauty), he decides that he can be reformed. He is allowed to do it, accompanied by his faithful servant, Artful Dodger. I do not think that Dickens would have appreciated the change in (his girlfriend may be), but the modern audience, of course, takes it as reinforcement.
