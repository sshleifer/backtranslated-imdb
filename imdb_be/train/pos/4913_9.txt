Name overstates the content of the film a few that can lead to some unfulfilled expectations. To be honest, there is very little "panic on the streets" to see here. In fact, throughout the whole movie very few people actually know that there's a killer on the loose, which could well spread the plague to everyone he encounters. Having said that, what we have here is very well done story with a level of uncertainty, which starts quite high anyway (because, in contrast to the people "on the streets", the audience knows what's going on), and that the director Elia Kazan builds very consciously. As the killer wanted the plague, one of the most interesting tie-ins I found the development of relations between Dr. Reed (Widmark) and a police captain Warren (Paul Douglas). In the beginning, the two really do not like each other, despite the fact that they must work together. In the end, they forged a real connection to each other. Kazan did a good job with it. <br /> <br /> Almost all the performances here were wonderful. Widmark and Douglas was great and I was completely taken with a very early look at Jack Palance plays that would become his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Perhaps Bel Geddes came across as a bit flat as Reed's wife Nancy, but her role was not central to the story. Overall, great job. 9/10
