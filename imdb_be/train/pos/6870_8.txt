From start to finish, I laughed very hard throughout the film. It is surprising that «The Tube Groove», perhaps the grandfather, but the raunchiest, all comedic parody movies in this way I like to watch TV without boring flipping channels only suffer from insomnia! With 73 minutes gone, a strange, strange humor never stops! Just think about how all this nonsense laughing can help you enjoy your life easier! This is way, way better than the Comedy Central or any prime time show! Do yourself a favor and trash all those soft, clumsy romantic comedy movies in the trash! Better yet, tell your manager in the office window you want «The Groove Tube» back on the big screen!
