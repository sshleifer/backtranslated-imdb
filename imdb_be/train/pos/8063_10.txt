This amazing Oscar winner (4 in total) and the first Oscar winner John Ford Award, simply stunning with a pounding score by Max Steiner. It called the art of cinema, because Ford had very little money to make this a great story about guilt and revenge, greed and stupidity. But what makes this film a classic, direction, and a strange picture and use fog and lighting, which was so different from the usual American film, and more in the tradition of German Expressionism. A winning performance Oscar Victor McLaglen as a drunken Gypo incredible. Basically, the film takes place in Ireland, and Gypo turns into another in an insurrectional movement in English, to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend. But with all that money, he begins to blow it on all night drunk and give it, while the leaders of the movement trying to track down an informant. The whole movie one night in the dark and misty Ireland, and characters that are remembered, but all together, the whole world Gypo approach him, and psychologically. If I had to choose, maybe three directors to have all your movies on a desert island forever, and no one returned to his homeland, John Ford, of course, be one of them. What's really great movie ...
