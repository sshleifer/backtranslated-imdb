Balls were out of this world, the scene spectacular fights without flying to the wire techniques (to the end), which are all too common today. Scene with Chan and Pray, probably, the main point of the film. Symbols in the attack on the bad guys of the mansion was a cliche, but the film is comfortable with it. Injection of humor from Woo. <br /> <br /> The story, with its twists and turns were unpredictable and exciting, and you could not tell who was good or bad, or what side people were on. <br /> <br /> A good sense of suspense and surprises timely. Depth stories pretty intense to wind the film of this genre, and reach you in ways most kung fu movies do not.
