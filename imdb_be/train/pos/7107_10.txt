You can call it a mystery, perhaps a small thriller, or smartest movie. <br /> <br /> The story goes through the life of one man, who lost his life and wants to return it. <, Br /> <br /> I have to say I was very surprised, I really did enjoy this film. It usually does not care for the genre but the characters quickly became the people before me, and I would like to know what they were, and what was to happen to them. <br /> <br /> Just like many French films of the English made, we can learn much more about the character and influence their environment on their faces. This film is a character-driven and does not disappoint!
