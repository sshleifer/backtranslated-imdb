I heard that this film was a good many of my friends who have seen it, and they all said that it was strange, so I had very high expectations- and Nancy Drew exceeded the high expectations! It was a funny part, he kept me entertained with action, and all the dudes trying to kill her, and Emma Roberts was a strange, like Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was very good, too. I would definitely recommend this film !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why these guys are trying to kill us?" Corky "Yes, I was wondering that too, in fact, a kind of creeping me out.Â» <br /> <br / > Nancy '! I hate it when people try to kill me It's so rude "<br /> <br /> ~ Nancy Drew
