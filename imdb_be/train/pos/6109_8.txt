My Tutor Friend good script romantic comedy film that has something like My Sassy Girl .. no kissing / sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more of Korean industries. Sex does not always need a good romantic movie. <br /> <br /> The film is a heart tons of light sometimes cartoons blended CG scenes in the movie. I like the part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. Funniest moment when Ji-Hoon struck first love Su-Wan because he threw the Su-Wan another girl, and it's going to be a father soon. . He became the father was found in the following stage, which brings a smile to the audience <br /> <br /> Mao notes: 8/10
