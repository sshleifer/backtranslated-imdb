Modern viewers know this little film primarily as a model for conversion, «The Money Pit". Older audiences today look with strands of nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were all "superstars" in a lighter, less complicated era. Or was it? Time, of course, there is a way to modify the perspective, and so many films today really ulcer with social and political commentary, has a natural curiosity to wonder about the controversy in the old, seemingly less provocative films. In "Mr. Blandings builds his Dream House», is, thus, can be more than spectators sought in 1948 exists to political commentary, however delicate. Stay home at the end of the 40s was really annoying experience, only slightly softened the advent of Levittown and the like. Policy in the film? Blandings children always seem to talk about progressive ideas, who teach them in school (which will receive a teacher accused of communism in real life). In real life too, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, democrat and feminist. Sun Melvyn Douglas was no less democratic firebrand: he was married to Rep.

Almost eccentric with was Cary Grant, whose shrill conservatism reflects the political mood of the majority of Hollywood already slipping. But it was one thousand nine hundred forty-eight: communism was a real threat is perceived and the blacklist was just around the corner. It would be another decade before the political activity will appear in a regular film, and then not so subtly.
