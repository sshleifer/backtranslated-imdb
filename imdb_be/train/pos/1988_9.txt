Firstly, I would like to make an amendment to another review of this film, who said that the last musical to win the Best Picture Academy Award was «Gigi» in 1958 that misinformation as the «West Side Story» won in 1962. " My Fair lady "won in 1965, and" The Sound of music "won the year after that. However, this film is absolutely fantastic! The history of the novel has been slightly modified, but it's more because of the restrictions, which they had on stage, they just do not change back to the filmed version. However, I do not mind. In fact, I rather think that all products pass better than the novel does. I like what Nancy Oliver to the bridge with her and be killed there, rather than later in the apartment. The finer things in this film are the ones that make me laugh. I love the time Mr Bumble and Mrs Bumble begin to emerge at the beginning of the office of governor. Underlining at the moment is brilliant. Has three favorite actors for this film were Jack Wild, who plays the best Pluto in any version of the movie stories, Ron Moody, playful and humorous Fezhin (this character has worked much better than it is in the book), and Shani Wallis, who is a the strongest, the most distressed version of Nancy. The only reason I give this film 9 instead of 10, because of the two large production numbers, which are "considered themselves" and "Who's going to buy it. I always hate it when choreographed musicals mean to look like people make daily care and work. It looks awful and cheese, especially if they are dancing in London Meat Co. they have been just made regular choreography for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us, I hope, forever.
