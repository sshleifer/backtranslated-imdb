Tintin was one of my favorite characters, as in childhood. I used to borrow books from the school library every chance I got. My favorite was «The Red Sea Sharks" -. So a lot of action and humor <br /> <br /> This documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background of the history of Herge and Tintin development. personal experience filmmaker in an interview with Hergé and the story of his relationship with the artist, who was the inspiration for the character of Jang was very touching. <br /> <br /> A great documentary film is very talented and well-loved artist, a great example of someone who has become internationally known and has brought joy to millions of children (and the young soul) all over the world.
