I would like to see Buffy Sarah on the big screen, so I first bought the tickets, and then checked the reviews on the IMDb. I was worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I had the pleasure of watching a movie. Some parts, which, obviously, should have been scared, were actually quite humorous, almost like in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. <br /> <br /> I do not think this is a bad film. This is not a great movie, too. Just pretty well made horror film. It largely depends on the special effects, but at angles, acting and music. In my opinion, acting in order. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincingly. Other actors were not exactly bad, I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> A lot of good (and I do not care that the sets are the same ones that were used in the Japanese original). <, Br /> <br /> scary moments are often predictable. But not always. I've seen a lot of horror, and did not expect to be afraid now, but it has happened at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> The film had some interesting scenes that were almost original, as well as traces of dust, simple special effects he ghosts, the boy's eyes, the cat who made weird sounds, gurgling dead boy and his mother. <br /> <br /> do not go if you want to see Sarah in another episode of Buffy, because it is very different from her job Buffy ', it is much more serious. Do not go if you want to see films that are collected an Oscar nomination. This is a good horror movie, enough suspense. I gave it a 7.
