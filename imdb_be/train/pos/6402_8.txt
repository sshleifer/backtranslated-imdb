I thought that this was a very good step. There were several things that were far from perfect, but overall, I was very surprised. Courtroom scene in the end, it seems a bit unrealistic, but it was real enough to be interesting. I found the film to communicate the hardships go, although the military training and the sacrifices that go with it. As a military pilot, I could relate to many of these parts.
