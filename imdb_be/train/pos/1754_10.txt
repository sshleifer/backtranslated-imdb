This film begins cheerful about 15 second mark, and continues throughout the film. I can not remember the scene in which I did not turn around to look at the people laughing at me. He is the perfect actor for this roll because of how he looks and how he dresses. <br /> <br /> The comedy part was great to see all of the actors are not very big and popular. As you can see what people do, how this film it is currently rated 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be 250. Lets put it this way, I have not seen it is funny from the film, as the original American Pie, or vacation. see if you want to laugh. I give this movie 2 the highest good I have ever given, as I learned about IMDb, an excellent movie site.
