Great movie Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more. The film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how the two can be very difficult to distinguish from each other. Beautifully filmed and acted, while David Niven does not seem to be 27 years old, his character says. Fun, to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This film made me think, while I watched it, and then.
