The best martial arts movie ever made. This is one movie better than anything Bruce Lee ever did. Classic with a thoroughly entertaining and a rigid isolation. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts cinema and the true king of kung fu.It very unfortunate that while Bruce Lee was so overpriced, it took Jackie Chan eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie rules !!!!
