"And around the house" is a special episode of the crypt, not only because the first season, but this episode was the first one I've seen! I remember as a young man, while on holiday with his parents in the summer of 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO, I've seen this episode, and I was buried in the basement right then and forever! I've always been a supporter of the series of suspense and horror loved monster movies, and with this series began HBO I had terrible fun again. This episode is the first one I saw, memorable for me and one of my favorite, it's just so nice with a nice twist. "And around the house" has a nice cozy atmosphere on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is the perfect way for you to relax for a holiday pegs! Well, in any case, you have Mary Ellen Trainor (which, by the way, plays in several Warner Brothers operates, as a rule, small parts) as greedy flirting wife who takes care of her husband, waiting for some money and a new novel. Just like most things horror series takes a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve. The odds heavily made up, when the maniac dressed as Santa escapes from the local insane asylum, which makes for a late holiday grinding on Christmas Eve! As of old comics E.C. the lessons you will learn the bad people get what they ax! Well, it's a fairy tale ends with the perfect vacation screams! In addition, this story was in the 1972 film, and showed Joan Collins, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic Crypt episodes of all time!
