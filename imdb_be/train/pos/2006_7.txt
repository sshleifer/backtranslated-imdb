At the moment it seems almost unnecessary to say that Jon Bon Jovi delivers a firm, strong, excellent job Derek Bliss. His ability as an actor was earlier found him critical acclaim received in other films (The Leading Man, NO Looking Back). But if someone is still wondering, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can work well, and it would be expected from him. It is easy to separate from Derek guy who belts out hits on VH-1. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to watch a horror film. I have come to expect them to focus on the sensational gore, rather than dialogue and plot. What pleased me most about this film was that there really was a viable plot moves along. The blood is not enough to become the focus of the film and does not have a frighteningly realistic quality movies with big budget technical effects. So, of Gore fans may be disappointed, but the story will not be supporters. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the militants, as U-571, where the dialogue takes a backseat to the bombast, we are able to learn "good guys" and really do not care what happens to them. Several scenes were left unexplained (as hallucinations Derek), but you get the feeling some aspects were, as they had to lay the foundation to continue. Unfortunately, due to lack of interest shown by Hollywood in the movie that the continuation never happens. These multiple instances forgiveable knowing that vampires could be a continuation of the series. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie I've ever seen in your life? No. This is a good way to spend about two hours entertained? Yes. He will not leave a person who is afraid of horror movies with insomnia, and it will not leave a horror movie lover totally disappointed. If you are somewhere between horror genre loather and genre horror lover, this film is for you. It reaches a middle ground with the effects and the story cancel each other out. <br /> <br />
