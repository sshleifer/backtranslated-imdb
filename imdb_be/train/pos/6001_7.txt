It is not a masterpiece, and away from Errol Flynn better, Istanbul is still a lot going for it. Location and beautiful technicolor cinematography, takes us back to a time long gone. Errol Flynn does show moments of his former glory, and in the manner as Jim Brennan, the pilot, who is past comes back to haunt him. The picture is actually a remake of the 1947 "Singapore", and the story seems very far-fetched and die "by today's standards. In addition, many of the supporting cast, it seems, just "going through the motions" in this picture. Many people also compared it with one of the greatest of all time, Casablanca. While watching a movie, I could see a lot of similarities, but hey, Casablanca-inspired countless imitators, so believes that what it's worth. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Flynn, or old-fashioned love stories, you can give this film a look. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca or The Maltese Falcon as a good introduction to some of the classics of Hollywood ....
