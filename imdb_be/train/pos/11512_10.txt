If initially screened in America in 1972, «The Night Stalker» became the highest-rated made for T.V. film in history. On the basis of unpublished novel by Jeff Rice, he said, as the intrepid reporter investigating named Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin deceased) discovered the existence of vampires in modern Las Vegas. When he arrived on British television in four years, it's not quite have the same effect, but my friends were talking about it at school on Monday morning, as, indeed, I. The We all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things that we have seen. <br /> <br /> I did not know about the existence of «The Night Strangler", until he was almost ten years later. I.T.V., which screened films "Kolchak", he apparently decided to go to the spin-off; they felt "Barnaby Jones in the title role Ebsno be a draw, and in any case, the audience might confuse" Kolchak "with" Kozhek! "Over the years, my only source of information about the show was an article in Fangoria magazine. I could not even buy Jeff Rice novels. <br /> <br /> then something strange happened. in 1990, the BBC-2 put out as part of the show late on Friday a series devoted to the supernatural called «Mystery Train», hosted by Richard O'Brien . "Kolchak appeared side by side with such« The Brain Eaters »and« Earth Vs.The Spider. " Opening titles were trimmed, removing the whistle Kolchak, and the closing credits ... well, it was not there. <br /> <br /> The first episode of the screening was "Werewolf." I can not say I was too impressed, but stuck with it, and I'm glad that I did! <br /> <br /> I really wish I had seen it in 1974. My twelve years I would have liked. Horrible, humorous, fun, not surprisingly, he shot an idea of ​​Chris Carter. <br /> <br /> the biggest asset of the show was, of course, McGavin. In contrast to the recent Kolchak, the original was a philistine figure, eccentrically dressed, quite conservative. It was weird, it was «Columbo» on offense. The late Simon Oakland was too big as Kolchak evil boss Tony Vincenzo. Scripts are filled with a fine, dry wit. I found myself enjoying the program content more humor than horror. If twenty episodes ended, I felt deprived <br /> <br /> «X-Files» appeared a few years later, and filled the void. - but only to a certain extent. I wanted to Kolchak and Vincenzo ago. I am glad that the show has never been restored, though. Oakland without it would not be the same. <br /> <br /> I have a book Rice now read them several times. I was very surprised when Stephen King is scheduled first (in his book «Danse Macabre»), as it is as good as anything he wrote. <br /> <br /> Okay, so some of the monsters were just the state of modern, but what? The new "Kolchak" completely missed the point of the original. The fact than what you do not see, sometimes terrible what you're doing ... <br /> <br /> The best episode - "Horror in the heights" Worst episode - «The Sentry»
