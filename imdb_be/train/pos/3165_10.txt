It was one of the funniest and most sitcoms hit national television. It is a pity that the show is not placed among the great comedies, where it truly belongs. The actors did an excellent job, and seasons one through six were shown in their peak point. Although the season seven is not so large in comparison with the previous six, it was still funny. Season 8 was a real problem down. Without Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher shows just disintegrated. Not so to speak, the other actors were not great if someone from the 2 main characters left like Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura hurdles (Don Stark and Tommy Chong are too large) left the show it will have the same effect. And the inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help, because he was not well received by fans of the show. I believe that when the show was over a year ago it would have been, of course, went down in history as one of the greats of comedy. Season 8 was a bit boring, but the finale was superb. I'm going to miss the show, I just hope that I wake up one day to find out that the show is that the 80-show with the same cast, because I'm going to miss the hell out of him.
