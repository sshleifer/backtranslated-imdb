As the Godfather saga was sort of mafia from the executive suite, the series is a complex story about the mafia with the working person point of view. If you've never watched the show, you are in for a long-term treatment. Yes, there is violence and poverty, but it is never free, and must be opposed by Tony Soprano, a gangster-minded person, with the reality of his life he was born to, and frankly, never would have survived even without knowing how many of his companions were. Tony Soprano could discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist and then knocked the man to the pan death in a fit of rage, and while dissection and body disposal with his nephew, take a break, sit back and watch television while eating peanut butter out of the jar, and let this advice nephew on his upcoming marriage, they had just finished a Sunday afternoon watching NFL football. Even Carmella, his wife, when given a chance to exit, believes that she actually prefers life with Tony and the benefits that go with it, and looking the other way, his offenses against life on their own. If you followed all that, you know how it ends. If you do not believe me, you've never seen the TV show end like this.
