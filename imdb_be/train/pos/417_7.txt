This film is Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the bad guy, who sells weapons and Indians hardly recognize him. It was the first time DeMille Gary Cooper worked together, and the next film made in basically the same, but set in a different time. The film begins with the assassination of Lincoln, and it also has to deal with an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill got married and now wants to stay home. The film also deals with the last stand Custer and far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good, as usual, and I usually do not like Jean Arthur, but I loved it here.
