Slaughter High about a boy named Marty. He was harassed and teased in high school. A group of children playing a few pranks on him, and these pranks were very bad. Last trick ended tragically. <br /> <br /> Key 5 years later. A gang of kids to meet again for a reunion. One of them put it in the old school. The school is now canceled, and they need to break. For some reason, the janitor is still there, but he tells them to go ahead and have fun, because they give him a beer. <br /> <br /> They start a party, and, looking at my old cabinets, and they see something Marty. One girl feels sorry for Marty, but another guy calms her. <br /> <br /> After the killings begin, it's great. Everyone kills creativity and mountains. We see a figure in a mask of the clown, hunting them one by one throughout the school. It turns out that Marty returns to exact revenge. After the first man was killed, they learn that they are locked in the school. They begin to look for a way out. <br /> <br /> Currently, there are a number of illogical things in this film. First of all, I do not know anyone who has 5 years of reunification. Secondly, after the first child dies, the girl gets blood all over her. All of them run away in panic, but she runs to the bathroom and found a bath. HRR friend had just been killed, and she decides to take a bath? More importantly, why is there a bath in the school room. In any case, the bath does not give up, really works .... and she dies a horrible death this 80s movie. it's slasher horror. WHO cares if he has some of the illogical. For example, I do not. This film has a very high death. The ending is .... there is a twist. Recently seen Haute Tension, I can compare the two. The only way that they are similar in the fact that there is a twist, some kind of left me disappointed ..... then immediately after curling, comes great, if not the best murders in the film. <br /> <br /> After the last murder, the killer looks at the screen and doing something crazy, and it was the best way to finish the film. He told me to go, "wow ..."
