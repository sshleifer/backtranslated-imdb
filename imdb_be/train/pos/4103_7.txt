The leading characters in this film are divided into two categories: smart and stupid. Simple enough. <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays a hapless, listless guy who gets arrested for a crime he did not commit. If he is trying to obtain financial cover his evil ex-boss, the situation gets out of control. <br /> <br /> While std sincerely (but loving) stupid, his friend Ondrej is an absolute pathetic idiot who spoils everything and knows how to say and do the wrong thing every time. Without Ondrej, std can stand a chance to go through life with a modest degree of success. With Ondrej, life will never be boring, but it sure will not be without many of the headaches! <br /> <br /> Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, evil genius type that degenerates into a Hitler-mad tyrant of Esquire. Zdenek and his supporters are trying to kill STANDA keep secrets safe Zdenek. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic, of course, has done more than its share of great memories. The best Czech films that I've seen are: 1) Peli ?? ki and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two films, you've seen the best of Czech cinema.
