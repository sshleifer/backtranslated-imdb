I think that this film received a bad score because he was judged by his worst moments. There is a joke and uncomfortable diarrhea nut scratch scene, but other than that there are actually quite a few things that made me laugh out loud. Jason Lee perform some surprisingly subtle comedy in this film, and Julia Stiles manages to be damn fun to yourself. In addition, the film behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes of it, you know how it will end. (What's better than most of them, where you already know, after +/- 5 minutes). In any case, it is better to watch movies, but certainly not the worst choice ... Cheers
