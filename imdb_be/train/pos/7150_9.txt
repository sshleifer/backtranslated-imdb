What a great movie! This is so reminiscent of the beautiful classic Disney family films 60s and 70s. I was so pleasantly surprised, after 20 years of absolute rubble alive productions crews Disney has produced. <br /> <br /> This film is an absolute joy. Star kids were just; professional, quality actors. I am very impressed with the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> Sigourney Weaver was full of insinuating * insert * hyperbole here run prison camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was great as the stars of the mother. <br /> <br /> I will not give a history there is no point in doing that again, but the story is beautiful, the direction was extraordinary and the quality of the acting was wonderful! This work reminds you of what it's like to be a child without going all sweet or too dark. Deleted scenes, located on the DVD version are really best left deleted. They were too hard for this film and would have taken so much from him. While the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it was not explicitly stated above a certain level. It was better that way. <br /> <br /> It was an absolutely wonderful film to watch. <br /> <br /> It gets a 9/10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
