Despite reading the "initial comments" from someone who curiously did not like the movie - (WHY The only negative feedback is the first list) It was very nice to note that almost all the other loved it! It is obvious that the church would like to emphasize some points and reflect the Prophet Joseph Smith in a positive way ~ that's the idea. Indeed, these items have been extremely effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was a man ... but despite it, and all the terrible negative attempts at stirring enemy, he showed how he was able to complete a wonderful, God-given work. I recommend it to everyone!
