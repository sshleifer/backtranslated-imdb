I'll be honest, I finally checked this film is not of the stars - even though they were quite watchable and compelling, in particular, the three wires - or even a compelling story about the abuse in the president's Secret Service (which is something I've been informed through the DVD extras of the show ever again happen.Assuming, that's true, it's great!). I got it because it was directed, and has a choice of a cameo by none other than Detective Meldrick Lewis !! Well, Clark Johnson, one of my favorite with «Homicide: Life on the Street" and a veteran (mostly) television director. I would say that he is doing about as well as he could with the project, which is watchable but pretty average, despite the challenges. <br /> <br /> Veteran and Ace Secret Agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas) is to find out and who blackmails him and who killed his friend, targeted and blew up Air Force One chopper and hunt for Pres. (David Rasche. Does anyone remember «Sledgehammer»?). His love affair with the First Lady (Kim Basinger, obviously, one of the first hot lady we have ever had, fictional or real), of course, does not help his standing. He must find out how the real mole in service and avoid the hound as the hunt for his former best friend and fellow agent, and most importantly (Kiefer Sutherland, almost still entirely in the "24" mode). Throw in some other key service agents (Martin Donovan and the fox, it is difficult to buy as Eva Longorria concert) and shady foreign characters and you have a fairly standard political thriller that does not aim as high as it is sent and reaches the desired, if It collapsed results. <br /> <br /> in the final line of a better way to describe how this show fizzled out without giving spoilers. On the DVD extra I thought, deeper and more interesting than the film, although the film itself was interesting enough to keep most (including me) are interested.
