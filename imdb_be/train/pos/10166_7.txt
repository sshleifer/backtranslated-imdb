I watched it on the 8:00 flight, and (presumably due to the pressure and height) I actually found it mildly entertaining (emphasis on "soft"). <br /> <br /> The real idea of ​​the film was brilliant: a woman dies, her fiance falls in love with someone else, she decided to make sure that they do not come together, but in the end, it allows them to do so. Unfortunately, the actual movie was not as good. Well, there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well. But from the very beginning of the story was as predictable as the destination of the flight, I was. I think the whole gay-but-gay-nya other part of the story could be working much better. Talking Parrot is a good idea, but to be honest: it was not really very funny <br /> <br /> As a result, the film was more interesting than looking at the seat in front of me, but it was close. call.
