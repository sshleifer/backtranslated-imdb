Father and son communicate very little. In fact, they speak different languages. But when the son goes to 3,000 miles for his father's pilgrimage to Mecca's, talk, finally take place. they are heavy, and growth is necessary on both sides. <br /> <br /> This film takes us into the hearts of these two travelers, and it's really a big journey for the audience, as well as the two leaders. The imagery throughout is impressive, especially the final scene in Mecca. He emphasized to me again, how much different the world could be, but at the same time as similar. The same is true for the father and son in this film. <br /> <br /> See this movie. Tell your friends to see it. You'll be glad you did.
