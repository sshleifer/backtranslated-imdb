Man, I really like the new DVD, that Universal put out. I've never seen a guard to look as good as I had to put up with the poor, grainy videotapes over the years. Unfortunately, there are no additives outside the trailer, which looks pretty shabby. And Goodtimes DVD avoid at all costs. It sucks. <br /> <br /> Anyway, restless fashion model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moved to New York Brownstone haunted, but this is more than just haunted. It is also a portal to hell and the Vatican keeps an old blind priest (John Carradine), to monitor it and make sure that the devils and angels are not sworn to avoid. <br /> <br /> This is an all-star cast full of old Timaeus actor as Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc ... as well as cameos upcoming 80 stars including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (who mysteriously overdubbed voice) and Tom Berenger. And you do not even recognize Jerry Orbach of law and order. I had to do a double take when I'm not really a place where I've seen it before. <br /> <br /> A nice scene Gore Alison cutting eyes and nose from the rotting corpse of his late father, who was possessed by the devil. And there's a neat ending, where the disfigured, deformed, people are trying to pursue Alison to commit suicide, so that it will not be the next one to protect the portal. It seems difficult past Alison makes it to the Vatican prime candidate to become the next patrol. <br /> <br /> well, terrible 70 minutes of classic directed by Michael Winner, which should not be missed. I also recommend it for those who want something a little more creative scope of the usual stupid teen slashers and horror comedy <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 <br /> <br />. -
