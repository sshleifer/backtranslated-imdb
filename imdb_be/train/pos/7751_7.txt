I really enjoyed AWTWB Tom Barman. You just have to let him come and enjoy it while it lasts, and do not wait. It's like sitting on a cafe terrace with a beer in the summer sun, and watching people go by. It certainly will not keep you thinking then, it is true, but it is not a prerequisite for a good movie. It's just an experience during the film, it's great. <br /> <br /> I felt that there were a few strands that could have worked a little more, but being a fan of Lynch does not bother me that much more :) <br /> <br /> And I * loved * style, or the sense of smell of the film. This spot, but fresh and Beauty soundtrack. Any music lover will get a buzz from AWTWB, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (music wise 10 of 10)
