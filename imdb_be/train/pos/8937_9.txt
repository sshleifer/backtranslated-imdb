It was a perfect example of how interesting movie can be done without the use of big stars and big effects. Just tell the true story of the fight, two African-American women over the turbulent century. <br /> <br /> This film challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black, etc. <br /> <br /> A good film with a good message.
