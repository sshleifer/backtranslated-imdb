I saw it in the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and terrible scene when the German army attacks with mustard yellow cross for the first time. The Germans and their horse from head to foot (or hoof) with horrible protective suits. Experienced British soldiers wear masks (only), and again wait for a cloud of gas and German attackers. The gas clouds are moving closer and closer, finally rounding the British defenders. The Germans are slowly moving forward menacingly in their scary-looking outfit. Suddenly a cry from the defense ... This gas, like no other, they felt before .... <br /> <br /> Now you know why I remember this scene for the past 30 years and still chills, I think you will too!
