I saw this movie yesterday for the first time and loved it. I am a student of the screen writing, and I loved how the secondary characters intervene only when something critical / climate have occurred in the scene. <br /> <br /> I thought the dialogue was very sharp, and the premise of the story is quite shocking - at a particular point in Barbara Stanwyck openly flirt with the guy of her daughter; And revive some passion in her husband, whom she had not seen for ten years; And with the fire signal "two shots, and then one", she catches up with his old partner of the Dutch shag (the reason she left the city in the first place!) All at once! Moral majority must be completely enraged when they saw this movie back in the 50s <br /> <br /> Love the costumes and cinematography, straight from the hip dialogue. - just watch Barbara Stanwyck and Co makes "Bunny HugÂ» good enough reason to make this film on DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of this period I've seen in a long time.
