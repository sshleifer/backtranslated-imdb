When I saw the movie first, it was a long time on VHS-video. I did like this movie because it was interesting and fun. A few years ago I saw another movie, called: * Andy Colby's Incredible Adventures * In this film were part of Wizards of the Lost Kingdom * * used in this film they called "CDF conqueror" .. I began to search for "KOR" -movie lot years, because I wanted to see the complete film, not just the parts that have been used in Colby * Andy * -movie. None of the store did not have the Kor-movie rental store and did not know this movie. For years I watched my old VHS-tape, I was at home, and surprisingly ... I had this film for many years still at home, but the film had a different name, because in Germany it has 3 or 4 titles. So I was delighted to find this tape at home, and this time I had a lot more time watching * CDF conqueror again. Music a big hole in the movie, but the best part of filming combined with music at this point, when a drunken KOR goes through a green forest. Music in the background was some kind of magic. I like the fact Swanson, and the boy, who played Simon in the film. Both of them did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 2004/10/26. Thank you all for reading my comment.
