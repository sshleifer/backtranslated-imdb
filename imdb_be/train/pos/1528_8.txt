I am a writer who works from home and Diagnosis Murder my lunch break companion - good, clean fun, good humor and nostalgia for the days of Dick Van Dyke Show. How innocent we all (and how it is diagnosed innocent murder). I especially liked the episodes with other pieces of nostalgia as Joe Mannix. The bad guys always get caught, the good guys are. Stars clearly enjoy and with the ball, not taking ourselves too seriously <br /> <br /> One beef:. Why were so many women villains or, at least, bitch? Amanda was too dizzy. It is difficult to imagine how it is actually carrying out anything as disgusting as the autopsy. <br /> <br /> I hope that we have not seen the last of Dick Van Dyke and family on our screens, people. at lunch !!
