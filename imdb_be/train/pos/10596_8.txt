Every time the film to someone in the BBC Radio Times says, as a satire on the world of post-war rationing and social state. I do not think that's the point of the film at all. The film parodies spivs (small time criminals who operated Blackmarket) and Housewives League, which opposed government restrictions, but were really a front organization of the Tories. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course, the film sends up the political / social situation, but in the end, people realize that they have all the controls to ensure a fair society, they want to be British and to get out, and not foreign . <br /> <br /> I do not think that they go back to the future in the same way as they were before.
