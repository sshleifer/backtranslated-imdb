The first-ever view: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> Very impressive script and comedic action and time in this film. Now 40, he has lost none of its force. Neil Simon shows great understanding of human nature and relationships, as well as how to create a real comedy of unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Matthau give great comedy shows. Neil Simon was inspired by real events in his life, to write a piece of this movie is based on. <br /> <br /> One of the best written and spoke of Hollywood comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> strange, but allocated only for 2 Academy Awards: Â«Best Adapted Screenplay" and "Best Editing". Hollywood rarely rewards comedy, no matter how well they are made.
