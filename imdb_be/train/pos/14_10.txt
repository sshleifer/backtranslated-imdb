This film has a special place in my heart, as when I caught him the first time, I was teaching adult literacy. He rang very true to me, and even outstanding students I had at the time. There are scenes that make you swallow the sudden excitement, and those who even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro that rank their best work, most of all the young Martha Plimpton, inspirational storyline, and has on the score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience,
