Can hardly imagine a better movie than this <br /> <br /> Hey, before you go «Chick Flick» at me. I am a very big Strong & Courageous, Macho Man, who happens to think that it was one of the best films of the past 20 years. <br /> <br /> The action was Superb and the story was Marvelous. This is an excellent medicine for the heart and soul. Responsibilities could not be better, nor the best movie cast. <br /> <br /> I know for a good while Mercedes Ruehl, with Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Dame Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench is one of the greatest actresses ever appear Ed. And, of course Leachman (as in the film), in my opinion, may actually exceed them all in shear Magnum her talent and the different roles she has appeared for many years .. In any case, it was an amazing shot. This film was like a book, you can not make, and if you have reached the last page of the desire to more ... more. I can not for the life of me understand why the film here on IMDb rate only 3,9 <br /> <br /> that the rating is very strange to me. Or perhaps not. Maybe, in fact, I understand very well, and it's something that makes me very sad. It makes me very sad that such films as "American Beauty", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Sexy Beast» and «Fight Club» ratings soar off the charts in popularity when they are actually, at least in this the viewer's opinion should have received «R" rating ... R, that "Rubbish." Hey, well, I understand that there are many different stories in this world for many different audiences, but it's sad when this magnificent, powerful .. . unusual, Directed, Shot, and wrote the film, seems to be more looked, <br /> <br /> This was obviously an Oscar, as well as .... How Garden. and how predictable. My summation is that if you want to see a strong, happy, sad, beautiful story? ...... hours is desirable to have this movie ...
