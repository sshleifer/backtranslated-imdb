"Hole" was a great movie. Disney made the right choice. Everyone I talked to about this said that they loved it. All the cast for the role that they had, and Shia LaBeouf does have a future in acting. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for Warden, it was exactly how I imagined it. Anyone who has not seen it, I recommend it, and I guarantee that you «Dig It».
