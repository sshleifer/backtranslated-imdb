This movie is great. How often heard, it's really very realistic, and sometimes tough, but unlike some other people I am clearly not the idea that it is depressing, negativistic or disassembly of Austria as a proto-fascist society. Quite the contrary: But in fact there are some very difficult scenes in HUNDSTAGE and some characters need to be called a very bad people, while at the same time you see the love, beauty and humor in the film, Ulrich Seidls. And this is precisely what distinguishes HUNDSTAGE for me from other films that try to show life in the "ordinary people" in a tense, realistic; they are pushed, their desires, their dark sides: Seidl is clearly not trying to prove that the life of the working class people's rubbish! In my opinion, the audience who came to this conclusion seems to be very afraid to admit that almost no one's living as a "pure" and "normal" as we would like to make other people believe. And everyone lives has its dark and often depressing side. The most beautiful scene: old Viennese man watching his old girl dancing "eastern route" as he calls it. I think anyone who believes that this ugly scene lacks a sense of beauty and need to ask yourself what it is that it is the fascists: Characters in HUNDSTAGE or viewers who are excluded body 70+ year old female, dancing all her charms to their lover.
