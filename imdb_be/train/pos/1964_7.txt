I can not take negative comments from other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who has never seen Basic Instinct 1, perhaps, someone very young? I left the movie happy that I did not shake reviewers IMDb. 14 hours later, I'm still trying to find flaws in the plot, but I can not think of anything serious. My advice to all is to see for yourself and make up your own mind. <br /> <br /> It follows a similar pattern in the Basic instinct 1, but the plot is less confused. It still left me wondering, in the end, but in a more satisfactory manner. Sharon Stone as sexy and evil, as in the past, and it is 48 years old is very good; this is still its defining role. David Morrissey has been satisfactory, although it is not Michael Douglas. With the supporting cast I particularly liked David Thewlis as a police detective.
