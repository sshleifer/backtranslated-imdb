"Gingerbread is the first thriller I've ever done!" ?? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> In 1955, Charles Laughton directed "Night of the Hunter", a terrible piece of Southern Gothic, in which Robert Mitchum plays a terrifying serial killer. One of the most famous episodes of the film consists of two children, fleeing from Mitch on the boat, the children frantically rowing while Mitch Brody after them like a monster. <br /> <br /> Seven years later, Mitch played just terrible killer in "Cape Fear", another film set in the American South. This film showed a local lawyer is trying to protect his family and also ended Mitch terrorizing people on the boat. In 1991, Martin Scorsese, trying to expand and deal with something more common, remade "Cape Fear", a boat stage and everything. <br /> <br /> At the moment we have Robert Altman "Gingerbread Man", another piece of small town Southern Gothic. Altman said that he had consulted "Night of the Hunter" for inspiration and to deal with such mainstream film just because he wanted to "spread his wings and try popcorn picture", but what he is trying to do here secretly deconstruction of canonical films Southern Gothic genre. <br /> <br /> So, instead of a showdown in a small boat, we get a showdown on a giant ship. Instead of two children are kidnapped, we have two children to be safely returned to the police. Instead of hiding the money, we have money easily be given through a will. Instead of attorney righteous one thousand nine hundred sixty-one film and deplorable attorney remake of 1991, we get a pretty three-dimensional lawyer Kenneth Branagh. Instead of a monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys. Instead of refraction monster houseboat family, we have a hero of hunting the monster on board "ship home" monster. Similarly, instead of bloody serial killer we get an innocent weirdo played by Robert Duvall. , Etc. etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Altman goes on and on, canceling all just a little bit, pulling the edges and does the job. His touch is most evident during the first half hour of the film, the film exists in the uneasy space between the traditional plot-driven film and speaking to adoring Altman overlapping dialogue, random narratives wandering camera movement and so that the characters are not so much introduced as they are just part of the happening. <br /> <br /> However, despite the best intentions of Altman's film never rises above mediocrity. Altman is too tied to conditionality, "a thriller format" to make a lot of harm, his style is too sluggish to generate a voltage and the film just is not enough radical counterpoint to other canonical films in the genre. "Bun", so too mainstream to work as a cleaner and Altmann film too Altman to operate as the main thriller. <br /> <br /> The film is not a complete waste, though. Robert Downey Jr., Kenneth Branagh and usually unbearable Daryl Hannah, back in juicy performances. The film also has a good atmosphere, against a background of an approaching storm, and the final act contains some interesting twists. Despite the fact that this is not a complete disaster, Scorsese's "Cape Fear" was the film still never reaches anything special. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late '90s Altman made 3 consecutive films set in the American South, "Kansas City", "Gingerbread Man" and "Fortune pies." In contrast to the "Bun", as "Kansas City" and «Fortune Cookie in" genre decision on broader, looser paintings, Altman was most comfortable. <br /> <br /> «Kansas City" is the more important of these two films, its class hierarchy, politics and crime, and her desire to break radically from the typical framework of the gangster genre, would be influential at all serious 21 crime of the century film authors (see, for example, «The Wire»). However, the "Fortune pies", while much lighter story, perhaps the best picture <br /> <br /> Note :. Altman says that this is his first thriller, but he sent the "Images", an art house thriller in 1972. <br /> <br /> It is worth a viewing.
