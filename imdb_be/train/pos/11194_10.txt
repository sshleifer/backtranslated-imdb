Bad script, bad direction, above the upper lip, overwrought dialogue. What else can you ask for? For a laugh, it just does not get any better than this. Zadora completed action in conjunction with the formulaic scripts she finds herself in make for a fun parody of the car "Hollywood". Almost as funny as «Spinal Tap», even if it is obviously not intended as such. Do not miss the debut film line Ray Liotta in "Looks like a penis."
