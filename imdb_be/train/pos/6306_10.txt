Hack stupid crooks, baby safe, plan and child. Add them all, and you get the best comedy, you've never heard. <br /> <br /> Even with some A-list star power (at least minus ... well, b-plus?), this film has received very little publicity. <br /> <br /> But that does not detract from his genius. <br /> <br /> Excellent writing, solid delivery and believable characters group. Some really classic lines and a fun twist at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not some watered "The Nutty Professor," a comedy. It is a low life bad guys. They say low-life language of the bad guy, and they do low life bad guy thing. But they do it for fun and entertainment, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
