This is unlike any other film, the closest thing I can compare it to is the Woody Allen movie ... But where, as Woody Allen is constantly fathoming human weaknesses Bret Carr seems to be trying to figure out a way to cope with the fact that one paralyzing uncertainty that usually define us better or worse. In case A, this is the main reason for his stuttering, which can be traced back in the hood the only injured a child who is revealed through flash backs. <br /> <br /> There are so many wonderfully neurotic people in the world, and I think that they all deserve the chance to buy, although the diversity of human nature, in the end, what makes the world so intriguing place, so perhaps we no need to fix our neurosis more than we need to fix our noses or breast. <, Br /> <br /> This indie film, shot on a long cord, but the production values ​​are great as the volume of the film. I feel like its quirky Gem for the self-help market. I'm really looking forward to see what this director does next, I could imagine a career along the lines of Woody Allen and Albert Brooks, but usually when a man like this breaks out, he goes and makes «X-Men» and his humble origins nimble forgotten quickly or they .... X-Men is a bunch of freaks Aout, if I remember correctly :)
