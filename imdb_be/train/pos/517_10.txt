Pressburger and the biggest movie Powell. David Niven plays the RAF bomber pilot, who misses his own death, but granted a second chance at life, if the sky notices that he AWOL and sends an angel to explore. The scene where the young soldiers, male and female, black and white, all killed in action, come in heaven must be treated unbearably bitter to eternal life. Also, be careful, Roger Livesey, deep under appreciated actor and Kim Hunter as a love interest (and later, of course, Zira in Planet of the Apes). By the way, Steven Spielberg cast an actress who starred angel (Kathleen Byron), an elderly woman of the same name as a private in Saving Private Ryan, half a century later, an act that speaks volumes for his cinematic literacy.
