This is a classic British comedy thriller, I've always wanted to check out, but there was no opportunity to do so far. It is based on the popular play, which has already filmed several times before (most notably in 1931, the same director, but, unfortunately, this version does not seem to have been preserved in full!); . To rework the considered section has been updated to the situation, the current during the war <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was basically familiar with the early British comedian through movies Will Hay: given that it is one distinguishes a similar plot of the legendary ghost, smuggling and enemy agents, it is very much in the same spirit (it was actually a usual scenario writing team Haye Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and JOC Orton); travelers stranded element, it was also verified and true formula. The star this time Arthur Askey (abetted by Richard Murdoch) - none of which are movies that I've seen before - who as unlikely hero as he Haye and whose personality is just as annoying but potentially ... one quickly warms to him, and Asuka, of course, come with a range of clever lines and funny business bits around to justify the fact that the main character in the play (a version of one thousand nine hundred thirty-one film) were divided into two here, with Murdoch, which acts as a. direct partner star <br /> <br /> The remote installation of one (the events of the film largely takes place during one stormy night) provides a wonderful atmosphere; the last half hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and finally the arrival of the title of the car - especially exciting and well crafted. Also worth noting, with the remaining cast list by Kathleen Harrison as the stereotypical frightened maid, with a parrot, her constant companion, and which is driven by all the excitement, to take her very first drink.
