I would not go so far as to not recommend this film, since only problems I have with it due to excessive plot devices used in the film - the kind of things that are common to all children film ever made it seem . That does not make it bad, just not what I would have to go far. <br /> <br /> it's a bit saccharine, so I would say that most of those who are looking for something with a little more wit may be disappointed in the film, obviously, for-as the children it. <br /> <br /> However, all that goes out the window when that protein (one in all the trailers) is happening on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems obvious that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys, 'Hey, you could follow in a little more protein Whenever it becomes unbearably boring This does not save the film, but?. you can leave saying "at least there was one aspect where I could not help laughing. <br /> <br /> And, of course, visually it will not disappoint, but it is almost a given with Pixar movie. all of my things, I would put it at the bottom ... but this in itself is not bad.
