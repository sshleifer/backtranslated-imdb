This is my favorite of the old Tom and Jerry cartoons from the early 40s. Original version with Mammy Two shoes on the set of Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2, a drive, and demonstrates excellent detailed animation early cartoons. Gag on this, not all extravagant style of Avery, but more subtle and is aimed at those who are ever late to watch the horrors (or radio program)! Those listening to horrible radio show, and Jerry decided to play a few tricks to scare him. Nine Lives gag well done here, and I do not know how many times I tried to make a vacuum and the letter scared when I was a kid. If the owner of Tom wakes ruckus- Mammy was NOT a maid, she had her house-she gets a hell of a surprise, with lots of laughter. Get ready pause button, it's worth it!
