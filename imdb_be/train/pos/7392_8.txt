I like this film a lot. He has an excellent chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is fairly universal, the story of the prodigal son. The aspect I like best, however, was so that the bath was more than just a background for the scene. As the father said to his son the story of his wife's family in northern China's deserts, the element of water and bathing is almost a holy ritual. The water was so low that a simple bath has a deep depth and meaning. <br /> <br /> In general, the film has been very effective. There were moments, however, when she was on the verge of "very" sweet ... borders on annoying the park is a detailed description of the scene. But in general, I highly recommend this film.
