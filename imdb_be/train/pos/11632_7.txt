Greetings again from the darkness. What a relief ... thriller that really is exciting! New "of IT" girl Rachel McAdams ( "Wedding Crashers" and "Notebook") dominates the screen time in this beautiful classic thriller from the director of the famous horror movie Wes Craven ( "Scream" movies and "A Nightmare on Elm Street"). Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers of the plane. <br /> <br /> What makes this one work is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes, we see McAdams interact with 4 or 5 people, either in person or by phone. It is natural. When she meets Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow in "Batman Begins") that appears to be an accident, the film really takes off. Watching the two flirt yuppie type, and the audience knows something evil is brewing, this is a fascinating film-making! The sequence of plane boarding mesmerizing and 30 minutes plus aboard painfully claustrophobic. Craven keeps us guessing, the involvement of others, and if someone would come to her aid. <br /> <br /> Like many thrillers, the only disappointment occurs during menopause, when the lamb turns into a superhero. Interesting plot device leads us to think a little Rachel has the necessary accumulated disappointment to see it to the end, but we can not help but cringe a bit. Most overdone scenes include irate hotel guest, annoying airline passengers, injured Killian and currency at the hotel. Film strength in character development and psychological games between the terminals. Unfortunately penalty veteran Brian Cox underutilized screen, but overall it's above-average thriller worth seeing at all, except the final.
