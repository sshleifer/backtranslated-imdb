If ever there was an inspiring story that can move any, disabled or not, hard, against all odds, and to do it (even if the "do it" as an expression, in fact, can have a wide berth, which is in ultimately, personal truth), my left leg it. It's a tough movie to watch at times: seeing less calm aspects of personality Christy Brown appeared in two key scenes - one, when his sister said that she was pregnant and about to get married while his father has a bad reaction, and on the dinner table, if a woman who reached for him, made him able to communicate effectively, are now announced at the crucial moment (the opening of Brown's art), it is going to marry another man - it's hard. Very, very difficult. Especially because this is a person who can not adequately respond to these events, and can only express himself the only way he knows how: aimed at hurting themselves with shouts, screams and curses. However, this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction, even if there is quite a bit of his autobiographical account of an accomplishment, but a person who overcomes his severe disability, becoming a functioning human being, and the power will be considered in the art world. Daniel Day-Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful, unforgettable performance as the shortcomings, but tenacious Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker did so, and for her supporting role as a firm of Brown's mother.
