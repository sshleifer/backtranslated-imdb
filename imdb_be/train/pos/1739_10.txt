from the point of view in the NASCAR maniac like me, the film is interesting. You can see a lot of race cars from 1983. Even tough racing scenes are much more realistic. But I must admit that I have not seen a race before 1995, because until now, they did not show any NASCAR races in Germany) <br /> <br /> from the point of view of a fan Burt Reynolds, as I have, the film basically what we are used to seeing from Reynolds in the 80 years :. Burt driving fast cars, as well as in his Movies Bandit <br /> <br /> If you like NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this film is a must see. If you love only one of those 2 things, I also I recommend to watch it. If you like any NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you should give him a chance, but remember that this film was far from winning an Oscar Academy Award. <br /> <br /> This is the typical humor of the 80s. If you like films like Cannonball Movies, Police Academy, you will also like the.
