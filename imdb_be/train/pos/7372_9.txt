"This Nha Love Song" is a brilliant example of the chase genre that many people think that has profound meaning. The love between the two protagonists may be more fraternal. I believe that Heaton in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see it. <br /> <br /> I really believe that this is portrayed with such scenes as kick back and write a letter sequences. Heaton shows greater affinity relative to the Spike. With intense facial expressions and he takes great care in writing the name of Spike at the top of his letters. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed, looking at the external reviews, is that when the film was scheduled, the reviewer does not seem to fully understand the film, because they are not even mentioned the possibility of Heaton who has sexual feelings for Spike. I also get the feeling that some of the reviewers did not recognize it if they use phrases such as: "Who Heaton What's he doing with a retard like Spike?Â» This man, however, may have hit the nail on the head with their comments. Spike shows noticeable signs of A.D.D, although I do not think this man knew it, as he seems to be using the word "retard" as a derogatory term. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this film. Despite the fact that it is not for the faint of heart. The film is very character-based, after the shooting until the end there is not much, but the dialogue between the two anti-hero. If you are not used to look so deep, sandy movies, stay away.
