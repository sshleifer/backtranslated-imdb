"Hatred per minute" is probably one of the best films to come out of Michigan in recent years. Not to say that it's a brilliant film by any means, but it's definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> «Hatred" ugly chronicle the adventures Eric Seaver (played by the director calla), a formerly abused child is now grown up, and begins to listen to his side of evil. <br /> <br /> «Hatred" very nice visually. Creative shots, and approporiately moody lighting and interesting to see. This movie actually has an element of the cost of products in it, unlike other recent releases like Michigan "Dark Tomorrow" and "Biker Zombies." Thin arrows Dolly and stylized compositions show a good frame to use $ 350,000 budget. <br /> <br /> This film, however, "Hatred" stumbles in the same places as many other local films do, but in the department of history and nature, in fact, everything is simple good-natured to happen. Eric Seaver does not develop at all. Basically, he was always crazy, it's just that people are starting to notice. The film is a haunting his merry way with very little development. In addition, the end is very cool. <br /> <br /> However-, as it is a horror film as if we care about the plot? We just want to see people die, and "Hate" certainly delivers. How is the body count, the people in the theater started to applaud, "Kill her! Kill them "all!" When people shout back at the screen, it's always fun. <br /> <br /> This is where the "Hate" is successful. It's fun. And in the end, that's all that really matters.
