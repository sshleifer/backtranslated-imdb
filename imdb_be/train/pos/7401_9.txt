I found it very interesting that the film actually turned out to bridge the gap between my American culture and that the origins of that is Chinese. It becomes a story about the values ​​and forces the observer to reconsider your life choices, and preferences in the institution. Surprisingly, he was able to do it in a soft, slightly humorous way, that only in retrospect seens threatens the status quo. I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again if I could.
