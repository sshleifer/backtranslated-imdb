Every time people ask me to name the worst movie I have ever seen, I always answer "Black South" and until now no one has ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> I watched it alone for about 30 years ago at the tender age of 13, when my parents went out for the evening. As far as I know it has only ever been shown once in the UK and unfortunately is not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If anyone can track copy, please let me know. <br /> <br /> If I ever saw, now it is likely to be a big disappointment, but he always stuck in my mind as particularly disturbing short film!
