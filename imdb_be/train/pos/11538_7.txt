Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) just dumped by his wife, because he is one of the most annoying, neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but he just can not seem to get it to work, so he goes to his friends house. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) has also recently divorced and live it on a stag party the sky. Smoking, gambling, hitting the chickens eating out and never cleaning paradise for him. Well, with suicide attempts Oscar decides to allow Felix settlement. At first, this is a marriage made in heaven, Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oskar pay his child support on time, but soon Oscars jonesing for women and Felix (which is being released today is likely to be gay) is not ready to move on. They invite a couple of British birds again and they find Felix so gently, that as soon as they are and Felix crying and talking about his family life, bringing Oscar refused. This is it, it explodes and throws it away, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as it seems, and soon he has the upper hand. My favorite quote is "You leave me little notes on my pillow. Told you 158 times, I can not stand little notes on my pillow. "We are all of cornflakes. FU "It took me three hours to figure out FU Felix Unger! "Based on the play by Neil Simon (who also wrote the screenplay), it has a certain theater feel to it. Install and witty and seems to feel pretty play like (better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have great comedic chemistry and appeared in the movie Grumpy Old Men and the sea raged, reprising the same role picky / slut, but with different names (to avoid royalty problems, I'm sure). <br /> <br /> This film, like chocolate-covered strawberries. Chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, strawberry tart, juicy and bright red (if you do not get those nasty green ones). They are almost polar opposites, but together, highlight the contrasts of each other and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
