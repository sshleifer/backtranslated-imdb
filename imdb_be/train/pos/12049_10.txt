I gave this movie 10/10 reluctantly, as it is difficult to praise the fact that so haunted and frightened me for years. Obvious threat to a woman's face in black only pure horror and accompanying music only adds to the fear. <br /> <br /> I saw it when it was first on TV when I was 10, and it really bothered me for years. I am fascinated by the fact that many other people said it was too. So many reviews of films to go about how unsettling or horrible film may be, but you can believe all those who have written on this forum, it really is incredibly powerful stuff. I mean really like horror movies and generally find them quite amusing, more often than not, it's really threatening, and probably most people are concerned. I have not seen him since I was 10 and I was tempted to see it again, but I am afraid that perhaps some sleepless nights. I can not put your finger enough on what is true, but I think it has something to do with the fact that fear is the greatest weapon a woman, and that we, as viewers, as sensitive as we feel fear because strongly. It is noteworthy that the feelings of other viewers so they are unanimous. <br /> <br /> I've also seen the play, which was a great product ... but nothing can compare with this.
