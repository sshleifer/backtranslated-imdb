Despite the fact that I did not want Stanley & Iris very like the movie, I admire the action. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro in the film perfectly. I have not always been a supporter of the Fund's work, but here it is subtle and strong at the same time. De Niro has the ability to make each role that it reflects the existing gold. He gives a great performance in this film is a great scene where he has to take his father's house for the elderly, because he can not take care of it any more that disturb your heart. I would not recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment, but I will say you will not see a lot Betty operate anywhere.
