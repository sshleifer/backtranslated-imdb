This movie is definitely on my list of the top 10 favorite. Voices for Animals is wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox is gleaming like a cat, insolent and inexperienced young mongrel, but the real standout Don Ameche as the old, faithful golden retriever. This film is a great family film, because it can be appreciated and loved by children and adults. Humor and suspense, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry! (Happy tears!)
