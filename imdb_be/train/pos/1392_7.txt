Unusual, trippy, forget-about-the story-and-a full steam warning low-budget sci-fi of the Williams family, who lives in the California desert. They witnessed a series of events, escalate their level quirks; apparently, they were caught in the space-time bases, where the past, present and future collide <br /> <br /> This is an occasion for a parade very funny special effects -. permanent light and sound show, dinosaur-like creatures that have one-on-one, user-friendly and tiny ET that fascinates her granddaughter, and so on. This picture really show a little imagination, if nothing else. <br /> <br /> Very nice music by Richard Band, attracting special effects working with the likes of David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Kuraev, and that is very important, nice family are key assets. It creates a sense of the child as a surprise; it may very well be that this is a romp for children (or children inside many of us) who are able to embellish any flaws in the narrative or presentation. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to resist; it is a short and sweet (80 minutes) diversion, and a decent credit to director John "Bud" Cardos (with the "Kingdom of the Spiders" fame) and executive producer Charles Band. <br /> <br /> 7/10
