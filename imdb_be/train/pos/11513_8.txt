One of my favorite shows back in the 70's. As I remember, he went on the air on Friday (or possibly Saturday) night at the Nine Network (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland was great together. <br /> <br /> Each episode usually culminates with Kolchack to engage in close combat with some supernatural adversary. To their credit, the authors made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible. <br /> <br /> I remember one episode in which the enemy was the spirit of the ancient Indian Chief who / who "returned" as a powerful electric current that began to kill people in a city hospital. The final exposure saw Kolchack trying to short-circuit on the "animal" power against the backdrop of an explosion of sparks and flame rises. Well .... you should have been there at the time, but it was an interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm in his role, and it was one of his best. <, Br /> <br /> Definitely deserves a place in the television series "Hall of Fame". Quoting Tony Vincenzo .... Â«Kolchack you on it" ... or, in the case of "it," Hall of Fame!
