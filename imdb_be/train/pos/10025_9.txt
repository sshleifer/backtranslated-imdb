It must be unique zigzag two genres have ever seen. Giant monster movie genre with a living mummy movie genre. This unique combination creates a unique and fascinating history. Casts is outstanding, including Boss, who, as far as I know, has never been in a horror movie before, ever. The effects are impressive and the idea of ​​a giant mummy, mummy filled with less steep one. My one complaint, I just want us to see a giant mummy, but other then that I think they did a great job. Dialogue, the characters and the story was perfect. Action was fine. This should be the best film to come out of a sci-fi channel. You heard me, the best film to come out of a sci-fi channel. I give the fallen 9 out of 10.
