Kate Beckinsale as well, if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this film, but I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in another version of Emma. They both are good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale as Emma seems more interesting, almost, though. And I liked the woman who played Harriet Smith in this movie is better, too ... it was more plausible sweet and sentimental. There are some things that I like most about the version of Gwyneth Paltrow, though, such as the humorous side is more obvious.
