This is the fascinating story of the pursuit of the first known serial killer of the Soviet Union. I tuned in, just waiting for a half decent TV movie, but found himself consumed by a convincing way the story was told. As others have said, there is much to admire here, that unfortunately lacking in many major releases of the screen. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit should go to Chris Zherolmo whose intelligent script and direction to draw the viewer in to it's impossible not to feel emotionally. , Action on all the cast is also very rich, especially of the two wires, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. They give a convincing image of the character arcs of great confidence, and the scene where they have their first committee meeting after Perestroika really touching. <br /> <br /> If you prefer movies crimes with a bit more depth and a little less shine, I highly recommend you look at the «Citizen X». <br /> <br />
