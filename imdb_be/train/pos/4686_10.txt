This is definitely my favorite movie of all time. This is mainly because that is not afraid to go into some very politically incorrect topics (such as flogging and female submission) that the other major movies are just too shy to touch. Nothing seems to be outside in this film, as the director develops the story freely without any concern given may offend the viewer. However, I do not think it was done here exclusively for shock or deliberately offend anyone. Sean Young is transformed into a beautiful and courageous performance. Most of the established mainstream actress would not have taken on this role or would ask for some serious changes to the script before accepting it. The rest of the actors do a good job as well. <br /> <br /> Have you noticed that this movie does not appear on the card cables with mandatory concise work within a year after he was in the theater? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it simply does not fit the current political atmosphere. It seems rather absurd to me that some of the channels now carry premium erotic porn (which is getting closer and closer to a hardcore porn), but will not be the main movie, like "Love Crimes". Unfortunately, despite the fact that this film is only 11 years old, she could probably not be done today. <br /> <br />
