As a lover of surreal (in art and cinema), I was happy to find this film on IFC. This is definitely a keeper. Most of the other reviews say the overall story (not all correct), so I will not bore anyone with it. The main concept of alternative worlds that bring close to Ana's disease, and the manner in which it manages to associate with someone after this "alone", and finally, with my family, which I believe is still on at least a little anxious, it only can be called horror film is that it has a scary scene, but it's fantastic (with a slight hint of "majority" only because Ana pre-teen who "hates the boy"). I heartily recommend to those who appreciate stretching their imagination.
