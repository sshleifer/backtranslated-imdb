This movie is really good. The plot, which works like a puzzle forces the viewer to think and wonder what will happen next. This trick brings a lot of surprises and makes the audience really looking forward to solving the puzzle. The fight scenes are very good. There are many different fighting styles (although one of the styles were a little unrealistic to me, but that's just my opinion) to watch, and it's a fascinating show. The only thing that can be annoying is the actors look. A bit too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong has always been good at kung fu films, especially in the 70s and 80s, so that the "five poisons" (or its other variants) is a great choice.
