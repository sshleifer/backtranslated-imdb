"The Man in the White Suit 'is another feather in the cap of the expert Scottish director Mackendrick (Whiskey Galore!, Sweet Smell of Success). Movie star Alec Guinness (whose comedies include a good heart and a crown, and The Lavender Hill Mob). Guinness brings his regular class to the film, and does so much more than the typical comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, the comedy is not quite open. By the end of the picture, it almost came as a complete drama. It's kind of Ealing Studios comedy, which is designed not to produce laughter, but a sense of the fun, as the best British comedy time. <br /> <br /> In general, costume idea is not very original, but it is performed. The film is very original, and recommended to all fans of Guiness or Britsh comedy. <br /> <br /> 7,6 10
