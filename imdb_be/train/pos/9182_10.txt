Those who love the book Jane Eyre, as I do (that's my favorite, and I'll read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton's just a little too good looking to be Mr. Rochester, but other than that, he's doing an excellent job, which shows the brooding master of Thornfield. ZIL Clark may have been just a little too old to play the 18-year-old Jane, but when I watch the film, I do not think about the age of heroes. The dialogue of the movie is taken almost verbatim from the book, which was very reasonable. Of course, this film may seem a bit long, but it is the only version that I've seen that includes Part 3 of the story. <br /> <br /> I want the people who made this film had been involved in the new Zeferelli version, as it would have helped, what a mess the film. <br /> <br /> I also realized the last time I watched this video, Judy Cornwell plays "Aunt Reed!" It is so versatile, that I did not recognize her. She plays Daisy in the leg appearances and also played Mrs. Musgrove in 1995 in Persuasion (another remarkable adaptation) <br /> <br /> UPDATE :. We received the DVD this week, and it's great to see the original version. There's a lot more in the beginning (Young Jane in Gateshead and in Lowood.) And in the end, they have regained a lot of things (I always wondered why Saint John was a piece of paper, when he says he knows who Jane is- - because the part where he separates her from her picture was edited with the US version VHS)!. Rosamund Oliver in her ... she was completely excised from VHS. As far as I could tell, they are not edited any part of Timothy Dalton, so nothing new there, but it's great to see the entire mini-series in full after all these years to enjoy VHS. Thank you, BBC (PS ... I would have paid a special DVD release ... with maybe some interviews with the stars ... or making a show)
