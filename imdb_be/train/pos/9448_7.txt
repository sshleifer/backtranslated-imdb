This was undoubtedly the most disturbing film I've ever seen. The first part of the film, although it is strange, is an easy and fun quality. The journey begins in a peaceful note, which details and emphasizing the beauty of the Appalachian Mountains. But this is a misconception, beyond belief. The obvious social problems (inbreeding) and ugliness in rural areas are only the first alarming aspects of the film. I can still hear Bobby moaned in pain, and I shudder to think. Lewis legs made me wince. However, while the film was, in general, very disturbing and painful, it poses some interesting questions. If it is moral, or right to take the life of another person? That morality can lead us to do or not do, and in some cases? And it is the dignity and moral integrity is more important than life itself? Whatever conclusions may be drawn from the film, it is an achievement in its own right (although some aspects that were frighteningly real and disgusting).
