I just can not agree with the comment above - there are a lot of interesting and truly amazing cinematic imagery in that it has an unusual structure and a good move toward the terrible highest sequence that differs is the effective use of silence. Furthermore, it explores the strange impulse suicide in a very open manner not pull any punches in that it shows, but does not stop, but i sensationalising above object. it has hints of a documentary about him, as well as horror and arthouse cinema, and deserves a place among the canon of "different" horror films like The Blair Witch Project and original rings (both of which it precedes and may well be the unacknowledged influence). It is definitely worth a look if you are interested in the edges of the horror film.
