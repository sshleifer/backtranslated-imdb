It's just the strangest movie you have ever seen. I thought it was just another documentary, but it is really something else. He's not trying to teach you something, it shows how life in the wild. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about the quality of the image, because you obviously know, he has no equal on the other comments. <br /> <br /> Land of funny, tense and bored. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Sometimes at the same time. This is the first movie that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you have come to realize how fragile our planet is and what treasures we have been blessed, but we do not appreciate it one bit. <, Br /> <br /> This film should be given compulsory in schools. This is the most beautiful film you will ever see, so go and see it. Who knows, maybe this is the last time we would see our planet as it ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but I would be easy to evaluate it more if it were possible.
