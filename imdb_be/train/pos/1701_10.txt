This silly film thinking person. If you do not wait, Star Wars and enjoy British humor, it might just turn into a cult for you as it is for my wife and I - by casting "votes" Kerite Grant and Jack Nicholson as the Martians to simplistic population big Bob is a movie that you can sleep through or closely watch and enjoy, in any case. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone, but if you relax the easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slides over you'll enjoy this movie.
