Not having read Nabokov, and knowing nothing about chess, I could only watch "The Luzhin Defense" as a film. <br /> <br /> It works very well, as one of my favorite genres of "sporting romances." Chess comes to life as the fierce competition is much more than, say, "Searching for Bobby Fischer," showing how hard mental work, play maybe it requires thought, preparation, stamina and planning. I particularly liked the special effects on the chessboard as alternative games are anticipated. <br /> <br /> A feminist director Maureen Gorris (with «Antonia»), Emily Watson, with his big blue eyes, gradually strengthens, through its transformative relationship with quite a note diffused intense chess genius John Turturro. <br /> <br /> Setting up in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written 5/27/2001)
