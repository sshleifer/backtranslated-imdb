If you can not enjoy the chicken Flicka, stop right now. However, if you like films that illustrate the complex and provide unusual activity, read on. <br /> <br /> Ann Grant Lord dies. Her two daughters come to be in her bed. Anne starts talking about people from your past from which his daughter, does not know, and they question whether these lost friends real or imaginary. They come to understand that these people from the past of his mother, in fact, real. <br /> <br /> The scene shifts, mostly between one thousand nine hundred fifty-three and about 2000 with a few glimpses into the life of Anne between those years. It was in 1953 that Anne met the love of his life and has experienced the greatest tragedy of his life. <br /> <br /> One of the two best friends from college Ann Lila, now married. other best friend Lila Ann's brother, in Buddy. Lila and Buddy are children Newport wealthy family, while Anne is a cabaret singer lives in Greenwich Village, who wants to be a free spirit, but still related to many of the 1950 Conventions. <br /> <br /> Shortly after Anne comes to be maid of honor at the wedding of Lila, she meets a man who will be the pivotal character in the lives of three - Harris. He's a grown son of a former servant of the family, who grew up with Lila and Buddy and went on to become a doctor in a small New England town. Ann immediately becomes enamored Harris, which adds complexity that Lily has always been in love with Harris and continues to be. Buddy, also in love with Harris, but as in 1953, he diverted that homosexual desire Harris to his good friend, Ann, for he can not admit to himself that he had a sexual attraction to another person. Buddy has its own internal frustration outwardly, being an alcoholic, a wise cracking bad boy of the family. - unfortunately it is very correct and anxious parents <br /> <br /> Needless to say, they all expressed and repressed emotions lead to tragedy. - after all this chick flick <br /> <br /> now, daughter Ann became far from his mother and suffers from their own life and the implementation of doubts. Constance runs mental exhaustion trying to keep up with its inclination as the perfect wife and mother. Nina, having always felt worse, can not maintain a relationship. <br /> <br /> Mix all these relationships in a span of fifty years, and you get an intriguing view of society, its values, and its influence on the personality and actions of the people involved complex <br /> <br /> All the acting night fine, but there are some unusual characteristics and the scene -., as well as two unique family relationships - that make this film very, very special. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes plays in 1950. Ann, and she does it in a style that clearly indicates intelligent woman since who contradicted what she should do, and not what she wants to do Her performance is not so easily forgotten. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays a dying Ann, whose mind moves from the present to the past, to flights of fancy, and, of course, Redgrave pulls his entire style with sterling. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - the daughter of real Redgrave - plays Anne's daughter, Constance, in the film. Scenes between this real-life mothers and daughters, playing a fictional mother and daughter are keen pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette plays the second daughter Anne, Nina. Nina spends a lot of his time to be depressed and feeling sorry for myself, and cutting a good man who loves her, and her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for the part, such as, but I've never seen that it does not give poor or incredible performance no matter what part she plays. <br /> <br /> MAMI 1950 Homer plays Lila, and shows us a woman even more contrary to its alleged role in life than her good friend, Ann. She is very good <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep -. Mother Homer - played by present day Leela. What is there to talk about Meryl Streep different than it always gives a deep and rewarding performance. <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai says in the DVD extras that he was looking for Glenn Close, to play a relatively small part of the mother in lila because he felt that she was the only actress, he could think of to play a scene in a movie . Of course, he was right, and closed in the same stage corrodes it in your mind. All other scenes that are very close right mother, Lila, and you'll get another job in the treasure. <br /> <br /> There are three scenes in the film, in combination with one featuring a close above that make the whole movie worth watching. On the wedding day lila Ann comes into her room and crawls into bed with his friend, to discuss misforgivings lila in its upcoming wedding to a man she obviously does not like. This scene is repeated fifty years later, when Lila comes and goes to bed with his dying friend Anne to talk about the life they lived. In this last stage, Streep and Redgrave are fun <br /> <br /> On the other memorable scene. - at least for me - is when Buddy expresses his love for Anne. Hugh Dancy as Buddy gives us a heartbreaking work of a young man torn by his conflicting sexual feelings. Its performance is superior. <br /> <br /> Chick Flick? Yes. Very special film with an incredible actor, director and scenery? Determined. I can not recommend too much the evening.
