I am writing this after only sees the perfect son in 2002 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, Australia. <br /> <br /> When their father died, two estranged brothers meet at a funeral and discover that one of the brothers died of AIDS, they are included in the heart-warming path of reconciliation. Two wires does an excellent job of making gradual warmth and respect, which creates between them, as the film progresses. I have one qualm about the film, though - while the brother who dies acts sick, he does not look it. Man with 0 T4 cells will look pretty bad - even without make-up work to look bad actor worked. A small gripe, but one that makes it a little less realistic. Despite this one small pressure, perfect son of a great movie, and you should be able to see IT- do. I hope that for the DVD release in the near future!
