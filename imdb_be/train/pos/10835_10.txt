I love this movie. This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again, and still find attractive. Congratulations !! I believe that everyone involved in making the film and the script should be proud of yourself. It's so awful, you feel like you are watching a real life group. I would like to see more movies like this. I am glad that they did not choose the well-known Hollywood stars to be in this film, because it probably will not work. And even if Billy Connolly is well known that he was really stuck in the role, and I could not imagine anyone else playing. Congratulations once again, I really believe that this movie deserves Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy. And if you reach the final stage ..... Well what can I say !!!!
