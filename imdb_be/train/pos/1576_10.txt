It was a great movie. As these women were trying to save your husband. I thought the performances were great actors. I had to think about the film in a very long time. I think every student should see this film, so that they can think about the war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked this movie, because he said, and showed me how strong love can be. I would like to be as strong as a woman. I really liked it, because he said something to me about relationships, and that's what I'd like to see in the film. I think it can be compared with the film Der Untergang, pianist. If you put these three films together, you have a great view of what happened during the war. We must remember that a kind of war forever.
