For all who are waiting for the traditional superhero movie can be an unpleasant surprise. This is definitely a drama, not a thriller. He focuses mainly on emotions, and it is a bit like a Greek tragedy - everything the protagonist does it always goes wrong somehow <br /> <br /> This is because Sasha, each superhero, takes the law into their own hands. Society does not appreciate it. Sasha becomes an outcast. While on the run, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love with it all becomes even more difficult for him. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the story itself is really dramatic, but the film is lacking in dynamics. It reminds me a bit of narration in the last film by Ram Gopal Varma. Everything is happening very slowly. However, if there is a scene, the action becomes so incredibly dynamic, that before you realize what's going on, it's over. But the director does not want to impress us with flashy and spectacular action. What is more important here is the result of the action of Sasha, who are mostly very sharp. Evaluation is very small, which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film. So basically you have to be very patient to watch it. <br /> <br /> It is a movie worth it? This is a question very difficult to answer. I do not think that this experience has enriched me so much, but somehow I keep thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again. Mainly because of the atmosphere, which is really tight, but not suffocating, because I always Sasha and Katya have hope. Once they are all young people who have their whole life to live. So no matter how hard it gets is not always easy joyful melody, when they are together.
