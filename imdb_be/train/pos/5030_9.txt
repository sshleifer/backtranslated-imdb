What surprised me in this film - it was really original. It was not the same old recycled crap that comes out of Hollywood each month. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on video, because I did not even know about it before I saw it in my local video store. If you see this film available - rent - you will not regret it. Suspension builds throughout and a twist ending perfectly. <br /> <br />
