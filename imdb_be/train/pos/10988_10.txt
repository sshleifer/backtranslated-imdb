Is there anything about this film (especially anything that can contain any spoilers) not read. Just watch this amazing film, without knowing anything about it - and you'll have a lot of experience. If you would like to see clever, twisted story: Go, get a DVD, and you will not be disappointed. «Cypher» is not really science fiction film more psycho thriller settled in the conditions of globalization of business. It's about corporate secrets, as large companies, spy on each other's research departments and the methods they use. The actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the film provides the perfect coldness mode. Cypher is much deeper and more complex - that belongs to the plot, and the ending - and much, much more satisfied than other films Vincenzo Natali in "Cube" and "Nothing." In fact, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen (and this is something that I do not actually say that it's about one in five well-made film). Unfortunately, I can not say anything more about this film without risking damage to your experience. Just give him a chance. ;-)
