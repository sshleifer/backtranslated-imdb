it is an honest attempt to make a magically sweet love story. apparent mastermind of the successful television series "Bewitched" is the perfect sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure. comparisons are obvious. jimmy Stewart plays the hapless but phlegmatic "right." Novac who plays the voluptuous blonde witch who captures it through the use of spells. but if the spell is broken more powerful witch, she is content with debts running his own shop, and take comfort in the fact that her favorite pyewacket (her feline friend) looked after her favorite aunt. You know aunt with "Murder Death." This film is fun and touching sweet, with some exciting mind and a good sense of Witchy. worth a look.
