This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> The original drum and bass. <br /> <br /> There seems to be very little sooner Who frames around these days, if it is more than allow to be «AVING, now-a-days it tends to be a very different sort of Who general, parody, their shadows (many ) the best years. To be fair, not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore, they have earned the respect and overtime. <br /> <br /> This concert footage for me one of their best. To command the audience around 400,000 plus strong singing takes skill, charisma, intelligence, and a whole heap of bloody good music. <br /> <br /> We all know about the other acts on the bill, The Doors (their last ever show weeks before Jim Morrison died), Moody Blues, Hendrix, taste free, and more. The fact that the one who was there it was Who, that most of them came to see. This show was one year after the Great Hippie Fest 1960; Woodstock. Film and recording came out and so were the greatest work Who is today, Tommy. If the hungry crowds wanted to taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to «Grove and love" that this concert was their own. To do this, you need the best of what rock and roll was cast on greed crowd device. <br /> <br /> The two 'o clock in the morning at the end of August 1970 in M.C. announces, "Ladies and gentlemen, a little rock 'n' roll band of shepherds Bush London," OO ". <br /> <br /> John Entwistle body suit is black leather, the front line is out of the human skeleton from neck to toe, Roger, dressed in his traditional stage outfits long tassels's and long loose hair Keith in a white T-shirt and jeans, as Pete was his white suit boiler and Doc Martins, that he preferred to wear. <br /> <br /> Who has never stopped their onslaught High Energy Rock for more than two hours, performing them and other artists of great tracks, such as a young man, Blues, shaking "all over, and then on the line Keith baiting crowed to "Shut up, it's a bleeding opera" Tommy, the rock opera. He sang mad. This is what they came to hear, and who does not disappoint, right in the overture, and never go on the air until the final notes of "Tommy, can you hear me?" Strange. <br /> <br /> In order to capture a show of this magnitude of growth bands at their peak at the festival, which was to be the last of its kind in the world was a fantastic piece of history Cinematic. <br /> <br /> English DVD is only available in English soundtrack Stereo / Linear PCM, were, as in the States, I think you can get it to 5.1 at least, "Check the local press details ??" what all right. <br /> <br /> The duration of DVD is 85 minutes without any additional services, which is a disappointment. So, for a piece of the history of rock festival this DVD will guide you into nostalgic trip down memory lane when you press the play button for some of the best Who concert footage, as it should be, Live, Raw and in your face! <br /> <br /> I would give this DVD is ten, if it was not because of lack of 5.1, as well as some extra would be nice. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
