Is this a good movie or not, this kind of films has to be done, I think. He remembers me, "I love Huckabees», completely confused by a film with Isabelle Huppert future raped a young American in the pond mud, in a cheerful sadistic-masochistic way (?? !!!!). I hope the director will go on stepping across the border, as if I felt the choice of Vincenzo Natali is made, has not always been thin (some scenes were unhappy "Tartu-a-la-crème», as a childish farce), saying, about the script and cinematography ?? "Cube" color was black, "Nothing" is not white, cheerful, surprisingly, than the previous films Natali.
