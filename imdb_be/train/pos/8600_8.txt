There was some hesitation on its part that the film had to offer. For starters, the cast does not seem right. Kiefer Sutherland has done very well in the "24" and the preview does not seem to offer anything difficult for him or the audience. Eva Longoria has appeared from the place, and the others do not seem to be very interesting. <br /> <br /> When the film ended, finally, I was not completely dissatisfied with what I've seen a decent thriller that could be much better that the responsible parties have taken a little more care to watch for a gap in the narrative and gave little more care for character development. We have seen such threats before, and it made the main conflict is much more of a challenge for the authors. In the audience, we do not want to sit through the same old story again. We want to see something different, be happy and entertained. <br /> <br /> There's nothing wrong with casting. From delicious first lady Kim Basinger. It carries enough grace and sex appeal to make part of an unforgettable experience. Michael Douglas has been and done it before. Unfortunately, the president of a large part, not a person even care about their fate. Sutherland rephrase it "24" tough guy approach with enough force to make it big enough for the big screen, and Eve makes impassable work as good as new. <br /> <br /> I did not expect so many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics ( "north-northwest" and "fugitive" come to mind). Leave your expectations out and enjoy the ride that it might be. All right.
