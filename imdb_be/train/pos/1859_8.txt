In his directorial debut, Denzel Washington takes real story, which also happens to be a very difficult history and brings it to the screen with honesty, we've come to expect from the existing efforts of Washington, but now we see this contact as a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> recently we have seen some of the disastrous results of children who have fallen through the cracks to protect the population. This story tells of the existence of a nightmare that leaves terrible scars, but suggests a triumph of the human spirit in the end. <br /> <br /> We can choose the NIT on some of the first efforts of the problems with too many close-ups and not the best editing of the scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that project the kind of power can not be understated. <br /> <br /> If the Academy comes this film is a parody. This film pulls no punches and goes to the cold hard facts of history in a purity that, as a rule, does not come out from the novel to the screen. This, of course, is a tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy way to see and tell your friends to see it too!
