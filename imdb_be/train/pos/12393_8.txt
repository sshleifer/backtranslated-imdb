For those who were interested in knowing how mankind came to be made up in large red pods that make me crave grenades, have collaborated with the short "The Second Renaissance". I do not know why they are divided into two parts, the more that they ascribe as one on DVD (and these shorts be viewed on any other format, but DVD?), But they are informative, even if they have a few gaps. <br /> <br /> what really makes it stand out from the first part of the second part and the rest of the animation, as well as are the parallels between this shows a robot uprising and civil rights. Graphic homage to slavery, fascism, concentration camps and mass graves mixed with verbal references to a million in March of man and mankind, God-complex. In fact, "God" is never really refer to these cowards, and replaced by "man's own image» <br /> <br /> As far as shorts are in the collection, "The Second Renaissance Part I». There is by far the most effective in bringing out the emotions. It is a sad and disturbing picture of the potential of mankind to be "the architect of its own destruction." Some of them can be turned off some of the concepts are short impulses directly to a previously created science fiction, but then again, it's basically the that most of the Matrix series did, and it was the driving force behind its success. <, Br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
