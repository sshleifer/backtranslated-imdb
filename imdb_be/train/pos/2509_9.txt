Vampires, sexy guys, guns and some blood. Who could ask for more? Moon Child supplies all in one beautifully packaged movie! Gackt innocent Sho - who is friends with Kei Vampire (HYDE), their relationship grows over time, but as ages Sho, Kei immortality breaks his heart. It does not help that they both fall in love with the same woman. The special effects are pretty good, considering the small budget. This touching story sang with human emotions. You will laugh, cry, laugh, cry and then some more. Even if you're not a fan of their music, see this movie. It works great as a standalone movie vampire. <br /> <br /> 9 of 10
