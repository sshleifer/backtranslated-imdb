I loved this movie from the opening sequence until the end. I found the style of the director / actor is directly addressing me / public is very attractive <br /> <br /> What I found most exciting and refreshing about this film Ignore. - and the most difficult - the gender and class stereotypes and idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as a strong hand, and a lack of opinion - and the recognition of the characters themselves and with each other - allowed me to accept them and allow yourself to be drawn into their world. Without preaching, and with a mind and a gentle and loving humor, this film has the power to open up new opportunities for us, and gives hope to a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and valuable individuals. I look forward to more offers from this creative and talented director.
