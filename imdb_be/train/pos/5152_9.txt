"Hitler, the rise of evil" obviously created by people emotionally burdened by the horrors of World War 2. What makes watching a refreshing experience. <br /> <br /> I think it's great value lies in its crystal clear identification of Nazi-mechanism. With Hitler's corrupt ways, to make it to the top. Once there, the movie ends. <br /> <br /> If on top, "the Fuhrer" (= German for "leader") brought Germany to its largest and most destructive war in human history. Ending six years later in the complete defeat of Germany. As a result, Germany has lost its eastern provinces (= about 35% of the prewar soil), and was forced to take 44 years, split the remaining territory. And East and West Germany should be recovered from scrap, their reputation was severely damaged by the numerous atrocities of the Nazi-inspired racism. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Hitler, the rise of evil" makes a good watch, located in a suitable environment thirtieth, with (more than) the competent action. In particular the role of Peter O'Toole as outdated President von Hindenburg stands out even adds an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> My copy of "Hitler, the growth of Evil" also provides a second DVD with two good documentaries. One of Hitler's personality, the second has to do with a fake Hitler diaries. In 1983, the forgery scandal caused merry in England and Germany, damaging the reputation of several historians and journalists.
