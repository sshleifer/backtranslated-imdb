I remember this film when I was about 7; and while it shocked me. I have seen a violent movie before, but I've never seen a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. The film shows not only that, but it also shows how people can change their lives and to choose happiness. That this film made and the accident could not be done, to be honest. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and was actually built Crash anti Asian bias) and to come at it from a moral point of view of a higher position. Grand Canyon have come at things from such a raw and real point of view, it actually ends up on the hill than an accident. Especially if you compare the ending. End of the accident is supposed neat ending that ties everything. While the Grand Canyon finishes on a quiet note, where you know, nothing much will change in the character's life, but it is because life is just too no suitable ending. No matter how good you are ... bad. There's no end of the chapter to start others.
