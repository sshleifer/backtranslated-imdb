Many of your intended happiness just readers, Cage and Hopper did meet, and, fortunately, not in the film, Lynch ?? because RED ROCK WEST is better than any movie ?? Lynch. Nicolas Cage is the third ?? rate actor, porcelain baby surrogate femme fatale, but Dad Hopper as mean as ever ??. RED ROCK West, despite the banal actor, one of my favorite American thrillers; In short, a thriller with some twists. <br /> <br /> It is noteworthy mostly tastes amazing pace, thrills, suspense is good, cute little tight ass Lara Flynn Boyle, an enviable physical shape Cage (although, of course, ugly, with sharp features birds, bushy eyebrows and thin, sparse hair, the cell displays a fine overall shape ??), an unrivaled routine Hopper, some moderately, but really funny moments, the game cage with his alleged person, hard, psychopathic appeal Hopper, meanness Larry, cage seems Roamer archetypal gloomy Roamer in noir movie, hungry, hard, if necessary, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle serves as a cold medium seductress, Walsh, as her heartless husband and Hopper as a Lynchian hit man, he had done before. <br /> <br /> The cage looks really quite fragile, or dizziness or very embarrassed i have a heavy hangover. But this could be his regular appearance.
