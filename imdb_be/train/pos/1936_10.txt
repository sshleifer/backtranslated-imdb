This independent film was one of the best films at the festival the tall grass of the film that I've ever seen there, I loved her so many things that were great about the film on top of all the cast and crew that I had the opportunity to meet absolutely phenomenal .I thought that Avi did a great job in their roles. Ricky Ullman was absolutely faithful to its role for an actor of Disney, I was struck by his talent to be able to move from a cheese teen comedy to such adult roles without talent issues in the film was just amazing cinematography was just wonderful, if you want to see an independent film is one exactly what you need see.I think Mr. Gruver would have been so proud to have such an idea in his festival and his parents liked the movie so much, when he won the favorite of the audience, they went and saw it again. it really was a great film, it was dark and funny and sad, and really emotionally it was just unbelievable. I honestly just so admired this film, and I really do not want to spoil it for anyone just to see it and really impressed with this, I think that these filmmakers really have what it takes to go places, and I hope that I will see more work from them in the future.
