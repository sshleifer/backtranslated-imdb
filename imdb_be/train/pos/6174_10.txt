It really is unfortunate that most people outside of Canada believes that the only thing that makes Canada is snow, horse riding and hockey. This film is the second Canadian wonderful film that I have seen in the past few weeks (the first was "The Red Violin"), much better than all but the best of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble nothing but that; it is a middle-aged bank employee Parsis in Bombay in the 1970s. The film sensitively explores the different things that happen to him in respect of his family, his friends and his work, as well as their influence on him. At the same time, it's exciting, and I would suggest a precise, middle-class image, city life in India at the time. <br /> <br /> However, I was somewhat prepared for it, having read books executioner in a few years ago. The film, as you might expect, can not capture all the complexities of the book, but if you want to read a very good book, and to see a really good movie, read and see "Such a long journey."
