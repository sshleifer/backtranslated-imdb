Paul Hennessy and his wife Kate have to deal with two daughters and teenage son surprise ... But after the untimely death of John Ritter, the show became more about coping with the loss of a loved one ... <br /> <br /> I found it show, passing through the channels one day and I must say that I laughed myself to my ribs ached, just in the range of characters; witty lines and the position of Paul finds himself dealing mainly with his daughters ... Since then, I caught the rest of the show, when I was free, and I have to say that the letter was very good..But I read of the death of John Ritter ... Shortly afterwards I saw "Goodbye" part 2, and I must say that I was almost in tears, watching the characters emotions, losing a loved one ... As Rory punches a wall of anger and frustration. ..H Ca case with having to sleep in my bed all alone .... Briget and Kerry talk about what they should have done. <br /> <br /> But the show really move forward, bringing with him Jim Egan and CJ Barnes, which provide a lot of laughs, as his father Keith's trying to protect his family and give Smoothie talks about the problem of "Rory. .. But the true gem of CJ ... which is absolutely hilarious as the wild cousin. <br /> <br /> It will always be the masterpiece of John Ritter.
