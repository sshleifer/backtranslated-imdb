Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of the most long-wave in New York found floating craps game from, and he needs $ 1,000 to provide a new location. I am confident in his chances, he puts the city's highest-roller, Sky Masterson (Brando), he can not get alarmed by missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). "Guys and Dolls (1955)," such a great musical, because it cleverly combines contrasting styles and movie scenes. In the dazzling opening sequence, a crowd of pedestrians moving in rhythm, stopping and starting as if responding to a cue behind the scenes. Even the pedestrian traffic stylized and angular, halfway between a walk and dance. Mankiewicz in New York City is a flurry of sparkling art color deck, movement, fantasy world so removed from reality that even the business of underground gambling and criminal banditry seems quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> As I write this review, I have just received the news that Gene Simmons has died, age 80. It's incredible, was the first time I saw her in the film, but she blinded me from the beginning. Its idealistic and sexually repressed Sarah out of her shell, following the drinking of alcohol in Havana, letting loose with a charmingly playful performance of "If I were a bell." While both Simmons and Brando had singers, producer Sam Goldwyn decided do not duplicate your vocal, claiming that "maybe you do not sound so good, but at least it's you." in spite of the questionable belief Goldwyn, at the time, how to do so to carry the whole musical numbers themselves . Simmons offers the same child as the liveliness that Audrey Hepburn might have led to the role and Brando exudes a confidence and charisma, it does not matter that his singing voice is not quite there.
