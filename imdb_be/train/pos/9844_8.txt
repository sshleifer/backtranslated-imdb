There are very few films that are as funny as this one. I was lucky enough to see this movie in the cinema "reserved" for movie lovers like me, so it was not so embarrassing to sit there laughing till my jaw was completely pain and has sleeve shirts were all wet from dry eyes ... <br /> <br /> time, the story was a little "slow", but this is probably the best - a little rest in-between rolling passes among (I almost fell out of the saddle ...) was welcome.
