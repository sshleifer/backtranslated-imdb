I did not expect that the highest caliber shooting with Joel Schumacher directing this, so I was surprised that Tigerland was not a waste of time. <br /> <br /> In the technique, often derivative SAVING Private Ryan sweep the camera work, grainy shots, the film sometimes works as a pass asterisk --- all these Spielberg methods used to make his film more realistic, but in the end was more distracting than anything else. <br /> <br /> But unlike Saving Private Ryan, the emotional component was not weak, as the characters in this film were more like real people and less far-fetched story, but not wrapped in the American flag (Spielberg receives " F 'in subtleties). <br /> <br /> Next to the first section Full Metal Jacket Kubrick, this is the most realistic portrayal of the boot camp that I saw in the movie, and I think it's worth a look. <br /> <br /> This is not a great film, but not a bad film.
