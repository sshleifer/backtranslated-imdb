Despite the rather unseemly title, this light teen dramedy. If you are not old coot, you'll probably find it pretty. It is not so well on the development of the characters or situations smoothly, though. If you view it, you get the feeling that you were running back and forth to the kitchen, even if you're sitting down, watching all the time. This is one of those movies that Podesta many characters on your souls, and they are quite attractive. Jennifer Connelly is the heartthrob of many, I know, but I always loved most unintelligible Maddie Corman. Adolescents get most of the screen time without much intrusion of these annoying adults. Is it just me, or most of the young men look very much, do you?
