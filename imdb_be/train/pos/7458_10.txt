This game is a bomb, and it's 007 game of the year and should be on the greatest hits. When I got under the fire of the agent, I thought it was a good game, but then Nightfire himself and it was better, but now there is a new type of game, James Bond. At this time, the third-person shooters, and there are more than 12 missions, schedule of games out of the house. It even has all the great actors and actresses in this game, like Pierce Bronsan, like once again James Bond, William Dafoe as villain Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as M (forgive me all that I spelled it wrong). This game will be on their own as the greatest James Bond game around. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10
