Dahl seems to have been influenced by Wenders' The American Friend. Innocent Nick Cage gets the job done for a strike. Dennis Hopper plays a real killer. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. Hero gets more confused the more he tries to free himself. And small town America does not seem to be safer than in a big city. Like its predecessor mentioned above, this film has a lot of plot twists that seem incredible, but all lead to the discovery of a laxative itself.
