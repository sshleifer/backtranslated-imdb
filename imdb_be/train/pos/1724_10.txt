This is a true story about how three British soldiers escaped from a German prisoner of war (POW) camp, Stalag Luft III of, during the Second World War. This is the same prison camp, which was the site for the Great Escape, which resulted in the killing of 50 re-captured by the Gestapo officer (and was later made into a very successful film of the same name). <br /> <br /> While the other prisoners of war in Stalag Luft III busy working on its three massive tunnels (known as Tom, Dick and Harry), two enterprising British prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse, which can be located next to the connection wire, shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom. The idea to build his version of the Trojan horse came to him when they were discussing "classic" try to rescue some POWs and observations play leapfrog in the mix. <br /> <br /> initially contains one, and then two prisoners hidden inside a wooden horse may be made into a compound and placed in almost the same position as a fence, on a daily basis. Although the volunteer prisoners jumped over the horse, fugitives were engaged in horse tunnel from under the arches of the horse, located next to the wire under the wire and into the woods. <br /> <br /> The story also details about the danger that two of the three prisoners escape encountered while traveling in Germany and occupied Europe after they came out of the tunnel. All three prisoners who tried to escape in fact hit home runs (successfully escaped to his base.). Wooden Horse gives a very accurate and a real sense of tension and events prisoner breakout. The film was shot on real locations along the route traversed by two prisoners in their escape. Made with a much smaller budget than The Great Escape, The Wooden Horse is more realistic, if not more exciting than The Great Escape and will never be able to keep you from the edge of your seat for the introduction of war to good their escape. <br /> <br /> The story lines are clear and precise and effective ring tight enough to keep the tension all the way through the movie. Wooden Horse is based on the book of the same name of one of the refugees, Eric Williams, and, of course, the best story POW escape ever made into a movie. Some of actual prisoners of war were used in the movie to repeat their existence as prisoners in Stalag Luft III. I give this film a well deserved ten.
