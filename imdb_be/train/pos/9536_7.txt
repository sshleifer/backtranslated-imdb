Deranged and graphically bloody Japanese film about the little creatures, taking people back and turning them into zombies necroborg-like machines- which beat and hack each other to each other, so that the winner may have lost. In the middle of this pair of lovers becomes infected. <br /> <br /> Technically, a great horror comedy (?) For those with strong stomachs, blood, and body parts flying. Good taste prevents me a description of what's going on here, but lets just say its pretty awesome. If you like this sort of thing with the form of several steps above slender contents of all means to see this movie. Personally, I'm not usually one to enjoy movies as anything other than as sick and twisted, they are level. Here I was intrigued enough that I can offer it to people I know who like really awful movies .. It is also a film with enough going into detail, I want to see him again, because now that I know what's going on as shown in the end, I want to go back and see what it was, I did not catch on. There is an inner logic seldom in these films. <br /> <br /> 7ish of 10 for those who love blood and severed limbs, her perspective of zero or more accurately, and to hide the warning for everyone else.
