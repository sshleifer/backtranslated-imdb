it is surprising that so many people that I know, have not seen this little gem. All I asked him back with the same reaction: What a great movie !! <br /> <br /> I never really cared about Brad Pitt (though it turns 12 monkeys and Fight Club show improvement), but his performance in this film as Psycho nervous, dark, and right on target. <br /> <br /> everyone else in the film gives excellent performance and slow and careful steps to significantly increase the production of the film. sense of fear for the characters continues to grow as they have come to realize that it really is. <br /> <br /> the only thing that keeps it from a 10 in my book, is that in comparison to what came before it, the ending is a bit too long and exaggerated. but it's the only drawback I could find in this cult classic. <br /> <br /> If you check the film, try to get the Director's Cut Letterboxed for a better view. <br /> <br /> rating: 9
