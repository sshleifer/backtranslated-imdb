The film is very realistic. Of course, this does not apply to the Hollywood Cinema genre, where each line must be marked in perfect order, and where every step is correct. The actors playing the role of fans to do the hard work that represents the feelings and thoughts of the characters - their everyday life adventures. In general, the film ends with the viewer to a depressive state. This is where the realism of the whole story is obvious. Not everything is as we think it should happen. I can say, however, that the film does not end on a bad note. We watch, we learn, we feel. This is probably the moral of the story.
