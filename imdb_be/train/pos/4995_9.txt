I do not think that most of us tend to use the term "must see" in action movies, but I was very impressed by how well the film was deservedly received "must see" Print from me. <, Br /> <br /> Mandy plays Shannon Lee (daughter of the late and great Bruce Lee and sister of the late Brandon Lee) recruited Martin, a professional thief to help remove the diamond heist at the museum for a criminal syndicate and get rewarded for it a hundred times. Little do they know that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of lovebirds), which had been rejected previously Mandy and Martin to enter into a transaction, also plan to steal the diamond. <br /> <br /> As each pair of thieves is planning to enter the robbery is a thrill to watch. Things go awry, as Martin and Mandy unknowingly find themselves step by Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You will find yourself rooting for these thieves, because they believe that they need each other to stay alive from the crime syndicate, who were not happy with all that the diamond is not in his hands. <br /> <br /> The action of the supporters will not be disappointed, as a healthy dose of shootings, martial arts and martial arts sequences. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that this is not simply an action that carries this film, but the romance and laughs (and I'm not referring to your typical jokes are common in action movies) that sneak in. <br /> <br /> It is not easy to root for the bad guys, but we get to see the human side of these thieves and Chemistry to develop. <br /> <br /> great film not to be missed! <br /> <br /> 9 of 10
