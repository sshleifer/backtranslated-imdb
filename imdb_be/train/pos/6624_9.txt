I highly recommend this film. Set in Bladerunner-Esquire future of Paris in 2054, it mainly concerns the classic film noir scenario: a lady in danger, sister trying to find it, honest cop fights each. Fortunately, he avoids stereotypical, and combines a pretty good story with interesting, innovative visual effects. The film could remind you of the Sin City appearance, but it has even more acute, more graphic novel look that I found very convincing. Each frame of each sequence, it seems that it can be pulled out from such an experienced graphic designer. From the point of view of history and art, you can find nods back to the nineteen forties (or even earlier, with the classical view of the Eiffel Tower and the Sacre Couer) and films like Casablanca, as well as looking toward the dystopian future, where our appoints are corporations guided. Make any excuse you need to see this film.
