I watched it in the Star World network abroad, which buys US and Canadian series, which will last one or two seasons as The Jane Show. I thought about how much the leading man comedy shows Im actually able to look at my own, There's Lucy, Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie (one with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind goes kind of blank, I can not think of any any other, women did not support the role of the lead. So for me, Jane Shaw in very good company. One thing I just thought of that, though. I watched a couple of things made in Canada, and I never remember any one time shot in the ordinary television series that shows the SNOW! All this is done at the height of summer, LOL! Of course, this is a great place to live climate-wise in the summer, but you would think that they would have shown a little Canada in the winter, since it is part of their way of life there. I mean SCTV, Just For Laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that have lasted a long shot in Canada and very little or no shot with the snow present, even if they both make a lot of shots on the street. I am going away, but I kind of laugh at Jane and her decidedly liberal ways of being accused of racism to his neighbor, and I like the bald man and his madness, I found it on a par with the UK series called The IT Crowd (I I think) another office comedy with a female role. Not in any best comedy ever, but for a guy to say he can watch it alone, it will say something. If I was with my wife, she is really like, because it refers to sex in the office, and the like, so that might be a good light comedy for couples to watch. 7 10.
