One of the best films I've ever seen, was an Irish film called Philadelphia, Here I Come. I read the play before I saw the movie and loved them both. This is the story of a young man preparing to leave Ireland to go to America, because he can not make a living in Ireland. It describes how from the perspective of a young man (whom the other characters can be seen in the film) and another young man who is his obscene thoughts and feelings. But that can not be seen on the other characters in the film. This is a very sad movie, but deeply touching, and I would recommend this film to anyone who wants something to think about. I love any Irish film, or pretty much any film about Ireland, and any movie that has a late Irish actor Donal McCann it gets my vote.I will see that people chew gum for 2 hours on the screen, and, unfortunately, I have.Terrible shame lost him so young.
