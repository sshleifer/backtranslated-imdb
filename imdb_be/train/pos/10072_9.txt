Unexpected joy when I did not hear anything about this movie. <br /> <br /> The infamous, because it ensures the absence of having a wider audience. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly humane story with a social message to say the least, although admittedly, predictable in its resolution. Massive acted on principles. Beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against the gray color that captures the nostalgic tone of the film. <br /> <br /> My recent foray into the Chinese film (shower, the way home, not one less) was exciting, I hope to continue to study. China and its people are a strange canvas for filmmakers. "The King of Masks" can be highly recommended as a starting point for those who are just interested in the recent Chinese film. <br /> <br />
