Herbet Clutter, his wife Bonnie and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were very loved and respected in their tiny town of Holcomb, Kansas - but in the early hours of November 14, 1959, all four were brutally murdered. Rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on the author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the progress of the case to the end. The result was the book reserved. Controversial, shocking and extremely well written, it became an international bestseller and remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day. <br /> <br /> version of the 1967 film Capote's work is almost as beautiful as the book itself. The film was shot in black and white in many places in real life, he has a bit of a documentary quality, ice and individual - and the overall cast is exceptional. This is a film in which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor resting, and deservedly so. The killers Perry Smith, the Black trap you between deep disgust and shock at the unexpected sympathy; This workshop performance from start to finish. Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is not less beautiful <br /> <br /> as the hood of the book, the movie begins with Smith and Hickock, as they travel to Kansas and leads them to the Clutter home. - only to suddenly flash past crimes detailed investigation, which ultimately led to their arrest and conviction. The centerpiece of the film was always the time when the last time we saw what happened in the Clutter house; really took off in the riots house, a sequence spinechilling, terrible and great concern. <br /> <br /> director and scriptwriter Richard Brooks directs the film with a very strong sense of deliberation, erring only in the sense that it allows the film to be a little enlightening. Given the overall power of the film, however, it becomes trivial annoyance. Strong stuff - and I recommended <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer.
