I went into my first comment on the film almost five years ago. Then, the ideas presented in the film still seemed largely fictional, when in fact they could ever happen at all. Not anymore. Now, politics, society and the media in running man seems to be very close to home really. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors, which have been largely absent in 1987 (the year of the Running Man Out), which are present today: <br /> <br /> Concern with how the character of Richard Dawson Damon Killian puts it, " traditional morality. "CHECK <br /> <br /> Entertainment in the form at the reality, including pain, fear and discomfort on the part of participants. CHECK <br /> <br /> cameras everywhere. CHECK <br /> <br /> The restricted travel for the citizens of the whim of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with passports (contour "tourist voucher" in the movie), and authorized under the guise of national security. Check <br /> <br /> blending high, bordering on the incestuous, the government and the media. CHECK <br /> <br /> computer graphics that are sufficiently developed to manipulate the real footage of the film (for example, "digital" image matting Ben Richards to understudy). CHECK <br /> <br /> imprisoning conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration. CHECK <br /> <br /> Mark economy further expanding gap between the rich and not so rich; a growing number of fringe groups, which react to the tightening noose of big government; civil unrest is brewing just below or on the surface of nearly every significant public event, regardless of its origin or purpose. TEST, TEST, TEST <br /> <br /> On the other hand, maybe it's just a film based on the novel by Stephen King. But just in case, I'm moving to Switzerland.
