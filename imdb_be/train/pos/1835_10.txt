Which is an outstanding film that I have not the words to describe. I do not know how come the movie rating 7.3 should be 9.3, but in any case, no one can do this film and acting by Akshay simply outstanding second half of the film makes to weep, and the film has a really nice surprise ending, which makes the film perfect. You should watch this movie once, I think twice before and it is good. Anyway, I love this movie, and it's not just a boring and ridiculous, but it also gives and really good value and that are supposed to do, so I think it's one of the best films in the history of Bollywood. but I know that people have the bends, so I choose. The only thing I do not like about this film music is good background music is good, but the songs are not good enough, I think the music would have been better if AR Rahman will be the music director, but in any case we can not do anything about what so I did.
