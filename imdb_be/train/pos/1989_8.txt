I admit, I am not that fond of Oliver! as a small child - it's a long time, and the story a little sluggish from all the musical numbers. As a teenager, I found that the pleasure of this film is the experience itself. Instead think of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, think of it as a celebration of the classic story. Adaptation is weakened at best, but in fact, when you look at the musical, you're not there stories. <br /> <br /> music is the basis of this film, and the vast majority of its star and very memorable. Most or all of the actor participated in a stage version of the musical, and it shows in his speeches - and I think that's a plus. Performances all the more "unnatural" style of acting is typical for the majority of old films, and they are very interesting. The exception is a child plays Oliver, whose work seemed to look nice and stay away from the real perpetrators. <br /> <br /> Fezhin and Pluto real stars of this film. Oliver Reed also does a fantastic job of keeping the menacing presence on the screen as the menacing Bill Sykes. Even Sykes Bullseye dog puts on a good job. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone. People who hate musicals will despise him, as will those who take musicals too seriously. Arraignment of defective parts or historical confused exaggerated stage type which operates on a bad actor ruin anyone's enjoyment. Just sit back and enjoy the entertainment - it's much better if you remember that, like music, is a fantasy loosely organized around the book, and not a strict adaptation.
