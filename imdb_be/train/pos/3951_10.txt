I saw this film only once, on television, and it was not repeated. It's strange when you consider junk that is repeated again and again. Usually horror for me is a source of entertainment, but it really scared me. <br /> <br /> DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU BIT have'nt seen the film STILL <br /> <br /> bit scary when ordinary people pursue a preacher, where his wife is almost dead (they were poisoning her). He asks who the hell are you people anyway. One after another, they give their true identity. The girl who pretends to be deaf to corrupt and seduce him saying, "I Lilith, a witch who loved Adam to Eve."
