This film is about the two who were sports on the spot, trying to get 2 to get a hot chick. BASEketball become a national sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) beloved captain, but hated it when he loses the NBA in some other competing teams. He meets the girl of his dreams Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they kiss. the first time I saw this film, I dip it was so funny. defined a must see for all fans of comedy. If you like South Park, you'll love it! Maybe not to watch with the kids, it's a bit not suitable for young dude. NRB give him some 6 1/2 out of ten, I give it a 11 out of ten. I love the chicken coop he swings I have to go bye bye thanks for reading this
