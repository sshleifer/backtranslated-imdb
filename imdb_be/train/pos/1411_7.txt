Greetings again from the darkness. Gorgeous pictures emphasize this Disney documentary and gives a glimpse into some of the rigors of the animals living in the desert. For those older than 40 years, Disney and Omaha Wild Kingdom provided much of our understanding of wild animals since childhood ... back when there was not a single channel dedicated to National Geographic or the nature or animal world. <br /> <br /> always fascinating just how difficult circumstances for many of these majestic creatures. Watching elephants stretch over several days, almost delirious from lack of water, oh, so painful. But their fight night against lions exciting. <br /> <br /> Some of breathing underwater shots. The mother and baby bumps are beautiful and look great white shark attacks its prey is as frightening as "Jaws." The most surprising thing for me was the scenery breathtaking view of the Himalayas. I have never seen such a vast range of parts. <br /> <br /> I do not think that most of the young guys today are very excited about this, but it certainly is one of the most beautifully photographed documentary I have ever seen.
