The name of this movie almost pushed me to look. Not being a Manchester United fan, the mere mention of Beckham was a little off putting, but I believe the prejudices behind me, and I'm glad that I did. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much of the film, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film was racing with me ever looks at his watch, and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you like the East is East, then you will love this film. Ok so the plot is nothing new, and classic story contained in the film, but it is very strange, and a breath of fresh air. The film moves very quickly and keeps the audiance entertained. In occaisional funny moments it is a good laugh, and not some poor attempts at humor, and best of all it's a good British comedy.
