So, poster pretty terrible job. <br /> <br /> I thought that the film was not well ... nothing really outstanding ... I was just hoping that it will be a hardcore drug addict and completely waste his life. <br /> <br /> Oh, but this can not happen with the rich kids is not it now? Not the son of a wealthy businessman, who holds a points greater side and has a nice manicured lawn at the front of the mini-mansion. <br /> <br /> ... No child is too good to his life completely defeated in the end, who will lead the new SUV, and who will go to law school? <br /> <br /> Oh, poor little rich kids ... they artsy beautiful house, with its own schools, Ivy League, an ultra clean houses and socialite parties ... that the world will do without them? <br /> <br /> I hope they all get used to the drug, are the gift of their lives and end up in prison ... so maybe we can see films that do not all revolve around the poor little rich children from the unreal world.
