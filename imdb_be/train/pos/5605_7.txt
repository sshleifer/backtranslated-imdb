This oddity in Roman Polanski shows clearly where his concerns lay at that time he did it. Polanski himself plays a timid person who leases a Paris apartment, where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with finding that led her to this, the fact that he wears clothes and reproducing the events as they might have unfolded. Film alarming to the point, and it has the atmosphere of terrible fear that Polanski trump on, but it comes off too much like a rehash of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion", two other top Polanski films that deal with the terrible of the ' departure for the capricious apartments. <br /> <br /> But, as for the absorption .... when I'm reading too much into the movie, I have to believe that it was a reaction to the feeling of Polanksi persecution he felt the stigma of sexual pervert and deported from America. Without making opinion about it one way or the other himself, but it is difficult to deny that the evidence of that in the film <br /> <br /> Grade :. B +
