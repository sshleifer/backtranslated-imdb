Who made the film? I love this movie? Someone has a silly sense of humor ... <br /> <br /> This Zany, Surreal style of filmmaking is attractive, but it's hard to create - or simply forget - this substance, and the characters that actually have a soul, then, that gives the film depth. Without this comedy just a bunch of ideas. What is the difference. This may raise a laugh, but it passes through you like a good half a hamburger ... more ... <br /> <br /> Crosseyed not intend to change someone's life, but I appreciate the depth and content. They sneak up on you. I started this film, thinking, "Oh, I - indie comedy - on the wall - gonzo ... yes" And is that - but if you have to pay attention to the sub text and iconic moments fill it.. In this sense, the film breathes. It makes proposals, which give a break - if you are available to see them -. And then, of course, he goes on his merry way madly <br /> <br /> You miss the point if you do not sign a contract to suspend faith in the moments in the film. Walking between reality and surreality IS one of the points of the film. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed is not perfect, but smart people have done it. I want more. <br /> <br /> In the dining scene is an absolute HOOT. <br /> <br /> Put on your seat belt.
