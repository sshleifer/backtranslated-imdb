Higher education is a slap in the face for those of us who have been in the closet for too long, regardless of ethnic origin. the topic most of us would like to ignore, but we can not afford, if there is to be a real progressive change in the way we should be able to accept and understand diversity.some criticized the film as hateful or dumb, but the fact of the matter that ignorance reigns in the world, and some continue to help it dominate our society.everyone, participating in this film did a good deed, showing what steps should be made to continue to do more films like higher learning. sure it sounds like an impossible ma pa, but we must start somewhere, and this helps.
