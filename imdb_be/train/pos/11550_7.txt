If you remove the first twenty minutes or so of the film, you stay with a fantastic comedy. As it is, I still found it to be a very good film, which is no small feat, considering who I was put in the opening scenes. Simply put, this film has a dull start, which was not even remotely funny, and even optimistic. Once it gets sillier, however, you are left with a comedy, which is still holding up well after more than three decades. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you are younger supporter of Lemmon and Matthau who want to see their earlier work.
