Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) spent most of his life to the care of her father. Now that he is dead, she is free - but does not know what she wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer), a monk who fled into the monastery to taste more life. They meet by chance in Algeria, fall in love and get married. But he can not leave his past behind and she can not live without it ... <br /> <br /> WAY overdone romance full of hysteria bad dialogue and situations. Dietrich Boyer and do their best to give a good performance, but no one could get away with some of his lines! Nevertheless, in some sense, it's a classic. He was shot in the beautiful Technicolor (try to see it on the DVD), where each frame is breath takingly beautiful. Dietrich always dressed in 9s (even in the middle of the desert) and strikes the hysterical posture, to show her body and clothes. Boyer just walking around looking for the victim (no shock there). Nevertheless, I never get bored. It was great to see and the non-stop silly dialogue held me in the paths. End I almost fell out of my chair because I was laughing so hard! Now I like corny songs and give them plenty of space, but in fact --- that's incredible! It also works very short 80 minutes <br /> <br /> I give in the camp of the classics in this 8. How serious film -. A 1.
