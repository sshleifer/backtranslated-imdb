Several participants mentioned the difference in age between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 and he was 50 when the film was released. I think that the difference does not matter for the suspension of the drama as Vertigo, but it is important for the romantic comedy. We can easily understand that this is why his character will be attracted to it, but it is less clear why she is attracted to him. <br /> <br /> However, the film functions as a light romantic fantasy. The scene where she looks at him through the head of a cat, with her dark-painted-on eyebrows flare and the sound of her humming and purring cat is real magic. It's a bit harsh, so if the stage moves to the top of the Flatiron building, and we see the age difference is very sharp. He hugs it, it comes to running her fingers through his hair, but it stops the movement and only lightly brushing his fingertips to his toupee.
