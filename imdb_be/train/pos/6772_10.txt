Unlike other user, who said that this movie suck (and that Jose was terrible), I do not agree. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing !!!!!! Jose is amazing in everything she's in! Yes, it can be over, because many remember her from Romeo and Juliet, but she is beautiful! <br /> <br /> This story line can be used very often, but it's a unique film, and I will fight against those who do not agree! I enjoyed this film as well, as I have other Jose cinema. Olivia "my girl," and I love my job. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time on Saturday (4/14/07) and fell in love with her. Not only because it is a film that Olivia, but because of its unique storyline and excellent direction.
