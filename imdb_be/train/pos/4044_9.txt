I found this film to be very well developed. The room is quite a vivid imagination, and as a spectator, I was pulled as character development. Walk it has done very well for those who like to think - are kept quite hidden from the viewer at an early stage, as well as issues arising hold which then responded by producing a well thought out and very satisfying movie as cerebral and from the action. View <br /> <br /> it seems that some people are looking for a non-stop roller coaster ride with this film - one of those who comes charging out of the gate. It will be more like one of those coasters that first takes you slowly up the hill - creating a great sense of expectation -. And, ultimately, in my opinion, is more fulfilling for the foundation was originally laid <br /> <br /> Great movie.
