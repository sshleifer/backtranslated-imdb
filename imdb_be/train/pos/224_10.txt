Sunlight Boys is one of my favorite movies feel good. I first saw him, when he as an attraction Christmas at Radio City Music Hall, when it first came out and loved it ever since. I ended up seeing it 6 times in theaters, and when he was playing today, I would come out to see him again. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of reviews excellent performances conclusions mentioned here. Matthau was brilliant, but had the misfortune to be nominated for an Oscar performance of Jack Nicholson with Randall P. MacMurphy in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Burns is victory, though Richard Benjiman deserves at least, should be assigned as well. Even the smallest role played to perfection as Fritz Feld audition for a commercial potato chip. <br /> <br /> This brings me to my reason for considering this film directed by Herbert Ross strongly undervalued. Ross, who had previously brought two people to play, "Sawa and the Pussycat" on the screen and make full movie with it, do it again. He opens exhausted, without making them look like a photographic stage game. He fleashens narrative and characters. <br /> <br /> Here we have a 20-minute movie before you get to the stage that opens the game, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the special comedy. Although there is a dialogue with the play for the first twenty minutes, the sequence is completely new. Several years ago, I saw in the Broadway play with Klagmenom and Tony Randall, who was excellent. But I think that Ross and screenwriter, playwright Simon improved on it. It's just a great movie.
