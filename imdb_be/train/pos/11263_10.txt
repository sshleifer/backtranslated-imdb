This is a great show! I was a US history teacher in high school, which was the same as this. There are many 'facts' in history, which is not entirely true, and Mr. Wuhl their points very well, so is a memorable one. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wuhl class teaches students the film, but the history of the students and even the general public will appreciate the ingenious way in which he reveals some very well known in the false history of the world and seek to impress upon them that brain of his disciples. The use of live actors performing "skits" is also very interesting. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this series to anyone who is interested in the fact that the story they learned as a child turned upside down.
