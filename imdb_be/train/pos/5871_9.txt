I appreciate each and every frame of this remarkable film. We are talking about ordinary people, people we all know who suffers a bit in their lives and have some baggage to carry. Just like all of us. Robert De Niro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker breathe life into their characters and everything is fine, but Harris is especially heartbreaking, and therefore, very real. You would swear that he really is a truck driver who drinks, so he will not feel anything. Baker as his put-upon sister also has some fine moments - when DeNiro gives her flowers in one scene, it seems that it has never been given flowers to and probably will not be. Very useful.
