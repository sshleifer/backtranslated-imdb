I question who say they do not care for this film. Some observers say that there was not enough action, some said it was too long, etc. Do not listen to them !!! If you like The Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will definitely love this movie! <br /> <br /> actor's performance is wonderful! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lange are allsuperb and Liam Neeson makes admarible work and very impressive character because of its size. Cinemaphotography was brilliant and exciting. It ONW of the few films I've seen in my life (including Redemption), which was virtually flawless from casting, directing, writing, acting, etc .. !!! <br /> <br /> I was amazed, it WASN Â»t in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed. I felt so hot about it, I just registered to IMDB, so I can let everyone know the real scoop. I saw this movie about 10 times (each time with another person), and everyone loves it! You must be awake and carefully pay attention to the first 30 minutes, because they bring a lot of characters in the beginning. If you have an attention span longer than the majority of these children juvenille writing reviews for the movies on this site, than you will love this movie! Well ... all three Lord of the Rings in the top 9 and the matrix to # 32?!?! This should show you the age range of most reviewers here! <br /> <br /> This top 50 movies !!!
