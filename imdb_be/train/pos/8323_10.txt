"A little nonsense now and then, to cherish the wisest men." <br /> <br /> If you're too smart to watch this movie, you are too smart to be alive. <br /> <br /> Great Romp, a great premise, a period piece done with a keen eye for details <br /> <br /> Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins -. etc. - just fine <br /> <br /> Rent it, sit back, relax, take it in, a little smile. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> Then, thank me.
