First, it really is my favorite movie ever. I do not want to give anyone any description, because everyone does it ** hole. I'm obsessed with this almost bloodless, cheese, lame effects that have a "boom-stick showing" bad edited 80 metal horror masterpiece. Director (I heard) was hoping to get into the box so that he could make a sequel and have the type FREDDY / JASON deal for themselves. Damn, I wish I could have went down like it! Soundtrack in Knock. Act well .... CHECK THIS MOFO OUT. and all permanent fans out there, feel free to e-mail and chat then. Midgetorgy .... I can find on YAHOO.
