I came across this series, but by accident. After half of the episode, I was hooked. American Gothic was a dark, strange series with Gary Cole as the mysterious, probably evil Sheriff Baca, who is trying to gain control of his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was struck by the sinister Sheriff Gary Cole, and I was even more impressed with Lucas Black. Caleb Lucas Black was able to stand up against Sheriff Buck, one of the worst characters ever created for the television series. I have rarely seen a child actor with so much presence and talent, Lucas Black. If you were not lucky enough to see Lucas in American Gothic, see it in Sling Blade. <br /> <br /> It was a great show with a lot of uncertainties and mysteries that have never been explained during his short period of time.
