Beautiful and touching film that deserves a wider view than it is likely to get. Semra Turan plays Aisha, a Turkish immigrant second generation, which is trying to break the mold. Neither completely at home with its moderately conservative Muslim family, nor with its liberal Danish friends, martial arts Aysha experience it becomes a battle to find yourself and have the strength to allow myself to be who she wants to be, despite how family and friends. <br /> <br /> Director Natasha Artie manages to balance the inventory and the story so that it has a depth, Sun becoming ponderous philosophical discourse, and relying on the skills of choreography Xian Gao pays off in spectacular battle sequences. In the end, however, it is an incredible debut performance Semra Turan, which gives the film spirit. Raw charisma skills and props martial arts glory in the heart to make it believable personal drama. <br /> <br /> Well worth it.
