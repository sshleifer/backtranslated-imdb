This is without a doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. The first time I saw him, I was about 9 or 10 years. I started looking for somewhere to the rape scene. And when I saw that I was really shocked to think, "What an interesting movie is sick?". Today, I saw it from the beginning and really understand how big this movie really is. It's fun, scary, shocking in its own unique way alarming. But the best thing about this is the end, where the audience showed that this experience will haunt a character for the rest of their lives. He will torment the conscience, and they will worry about the rest of their lives near bodies were found in the river. And there is nothing that they can do, that's what they need to live. This is the ending of one of the most unhappy endings in film history and a very intelligent, brilliant and terrible <br /> <br /> And the cast is also great, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Great cast in this film. In general, John Boorman has created one of the best films throughout the history of cinema based on the novel by Dick Cheney. A must see for all film lovers
