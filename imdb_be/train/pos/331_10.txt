This film was 370 minutes in the air of the Italian state television during the early seventies. This tells you the myth of Homer attributed Odysseus journey home after the Trojan War. It is an epic story about the ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, said the list of the 500 years after these events, the place of current, around 1100 BC. <br /> <br /> This is a film one thousand nine hundred sixty-nine so if you buy the DVD version, you would find that only mono sound and no other language than Italian, even close to the inscription in Italian. Sorry. Many people will enjoy this masterpiece when he was in the list of English subtitles. But if this is not an issue for you, than I would highly recommend seeing this film.
