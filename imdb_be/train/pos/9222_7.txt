There were too few mainstream movies, set in post-colonial Africa, and those that have are a motley. It is one with its altruistic claims to expose slavery in the 1970s, shows the best and worst values ​​in Africa, which are not too different from the values ​​of humanity as a whole. It also has disadvantages, given the excessive influence of Western concepts of previous Africans, and especially Arabs. <br /> <br /> Dr. Anansa Linderby, a beautiful African-American wife of an English doctor David Linderby, captured by Arab slavers, with Sanufu teenager girl and boy. Leading slave trader, Suleiman, every bit of stage Arab, with its prosperous and sometimes humorous rhetoric and gestures to match - which would not be out of place in the «Carry On follow that camel," but not to the standard of this film deserves. Peter Ustinov, of course, was more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script, and he saved that otherwise could be a bitter one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> Continuing stereotypical topic, all three of the Arab workers Suleiman are ignorant and have one paedophilic tendencies to the boy, who, fortunately, is not drawn on the screen. <br /> <br /> one of the first ports of call David is the local police, stereotypically arrogant and incompetent African bureaucracy. David meets two stereotypical white expatriates, an Englishman (Walker, played by Rex Harrison) and American (Sandell, played by William Holden). Sandell is a mercenary with a "normal" view of mixed-race relationships that initially refuses to help, if David does not provide for payment in advance. Bribed to love David Anansa, and the consciousness of his inability to find love, he agrees to take David in his helicopter to help search Anansa. They find Suleiman and his captives, who crosses the border and can not pursue them into the adjoining territory - as a result of fluctuations Sandell and lack of experience of David with a firearm, his helicopter was shot down, but David survives <br /> <br /. > Then we see David entered Malik (Kabir Bedi), an African, who lost his family, Suleiman and now only give vengeance. They find Sanufu Woman with a group of Tuareg and know that they are on the right track to find Suleiman. <br /> <br /> One of the most harrowing scenes they kill the slavers party only to discover that it was not a group of Suleiman, and have no choice but to send their prisoners they met before the Tuareg. <br /> <br /> later on we find out that the boy who was raped by a witch doctor, and in the beautiful scene with supernatural overtones, he uses his knowledge to kill one of the improvised Suleiman. Anansa its part - and in spite of the skepticism of the boy - manage to engineer the demise of two other employees Suleiman <br /> <br /> So far, Suleiman and his slaves for several days reaching a slave market <br .. /> < br /> Suleiman, is now no doubt that Anansa is a "disaster", is trying to sell her indecently rich Arab prince (Omar Sharif), which is corrupt, but reasonable. Finding that Anansa is an American working for the U.N., Prince rather rashly decides to carry on with the negotiations without considering the consequences. The scene in which the two men bargain is one of the best in the film. <br /> <br /> On the slave market, the young boy is sold middle-aged German pedophile, and it remains to whether the boy will still be considered a wonder "Wunderbar" when the owner is on the receiving end of his witch-doctoring skills. <br /> <br /> David and Malik finally confront Suleiman is sour-sweet ending with the point of view of Malik. <br /> <br /> In the end, David and Anansa re-united, and Malik, whose life is in ruins, can console himself, he saw the task he set himself completed. <br /> <br /> the general plot of the film is excellent, but it loses marks for the stereotypical image of almost all the main characters. Credit must go to all the leading actor for many scripting flaws.
