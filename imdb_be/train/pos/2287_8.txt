This film has pleasantly surprised me. It has a touch screen, a bit from the center of the approach, which never loses its focus. This is a movie that I've never heard about it, but if you want to "sleep", this is it. Great writing, production and operation. I highly recommend it for viewers who want something thoughtful. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin strange. Why this was not done yet in this film?
