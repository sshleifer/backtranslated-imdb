It turns out that even the director did not like this film, but for me, I think he's a little harsh on yourself. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots, and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout. <br /> <br /> He shot that seems to be quite a beautiful village, which adds to the atmosphere as well. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies filmed in England, give it a go. <br /> <br /> I just saw the trailer for this director's latest film, "The Devil's Chair", which looks rather strange. <br /> <br /> There are not enough British horror for me, so that all who come together deserve our attention, and this one is not as bad as you think
