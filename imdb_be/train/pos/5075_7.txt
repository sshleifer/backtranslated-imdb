Well done mediocre film with a tragic end. Advantages: The way the story moves - begins with Soorya struggled to live long then the recollection of why he was there. Music. An objective look at the life of the police. Disadvantages: Violence and blood, but I think that they add to the realistic effect. . Still have not had people's heads chopped off and sent in boxes and bags could be avoided <br /> <br /> No complaints - 7/10
