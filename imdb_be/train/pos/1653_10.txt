I agree with everyone who says that this series has been the best of the "spy" genre. My husband and I have been fascinated by it when it first aired in the United States and watched every episode. I tried at the time to buy the series (I made a tape of it all), but was told WGBH, that he was not available. I even considered writing Ian Hill, to see if he could have a copy! Like others, I bought and read a series of Dayton (in part, to understand the complex plot.) If the original version is always available to come on DVD, I'll be one of the first in line to pick up a copy. drawing IE Hill vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson was strange. (It is always amazing.)
