Finally, the film, where the audience was kept guessing until the end, what will happen. Well, all we know in part, that the life of the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will grow down to destruction, as somewhere to go but down, but we do not know how and when until closer until the end of the film. Hoffman is very rich, as usual, and even the Hawk was a decent, like a younger brother who basically does what he said, because he really can not think for themselves. Hawk may have been a little uncomfortable, but he played the role well enough. Add to this mixture the wife of Andy played great Marisa Tomei, fraud Hank; Andy embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug addiction and sex; and his father, who finally finds out what happened on the day of the robbery. This film will get you thinking.
