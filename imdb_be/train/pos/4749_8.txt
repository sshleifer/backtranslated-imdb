I really liked this movie, and it was a little hard to do when your brother makes stupid comments in it ever 30 seconds. But this movie I enjoyed, mostly because I am used to the usual HK militants. Most of the films, as it means not to look at the storyline, look at the senseless acts. And meaningless the rights. You can see Jet Li springboard spin kick, punch, shoot, make it impossible to jump and evade countless bullets. It is true that this film was released to a wider audience after Lee was in Lethal Weapon 4. That is one of the reasons why the ratings dropped on this film. Most people probably expect to see a film that was as polished as the North American film. But you must remember that most of the budgets of HK film is not as high as in North America, the film and the style of HK action movie, as a rule, is very different, as a rule, requires a wire-work in many of them. If you want to see a good action movie, you have to see it just try to ignore the dubbing. <br /> <br /> My rating was 8.
