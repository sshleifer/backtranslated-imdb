when I read the other comments, I decided to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> Firstly, the cast especially Michael Madsen and Tamir Karadagli; good enough ... <br /> <br /> The film is very interesting exploration and, because many international cast specifically European actors and actresses from both Turkey and Russsia ... <br /> <br /> Vo Second, the story is basic, and you can guess, but if you are interested in action is a good game you will like it, in my opinion ... <br /> <br /> third, final chapter is not special or interesting it is regular, like the other fighters ... <br /> <br /> Finally, I recommend to watch this movie ... And I hope that you will love this fun: D
