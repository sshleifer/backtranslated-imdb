"Vanilla Sky" was surprisingly thoughtful film. Or rather, «Abre Los Ojos» was well thought out. I watched this movie late at night, in awe of what was going to happen. I was not disappointed. By the end of the movie, I was awstruck. I could not get it off my mind. The whole idea of ​​this simply blew me away. The ending was more surprise than Shyamalan could ever do. The storyline was also what kept me wondering through. Toss wonderful. It was all around a great movie. Such a film can be watched over and over again, and always something new. I've seen it four or five times, and I always find something new. This is a movie to keep you interested for good.
