I can not tell you all how much I love this film. I have read reviews that say that the move is "too confusing" or "like swimming in the drying concrete." I say that these reviewers have no idea! For those who love fantasy, this film is for you. If you've ever loved to play Dungeons & Dragons ... this film is for you (especially if you're in the East Adventures) I'm just sorry that I did not get to see this movie on the big screen. (Just more incentive to get your own big screen :-) tanker
