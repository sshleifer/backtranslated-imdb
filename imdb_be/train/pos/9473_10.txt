I was lucky enough to see it in a pre-screening last night (October 20), and I was incredibly surprised by the excellent storyline and really heart felt itself to act. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is not particularly complicated or very new, the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh, unique, and clearly the "indie" style. This is not something that can easily be compared to films from the past, this is a unique look at the kind of classic midlife depression love story. <br /> <br /> I was particularly surprised by the casting of the film, down to every last extra in the family, it was a beautiful and talented cast. Three daughters have done an excellent job, the talent was evenly distributed between them, and none of them "is glowing," the other two. <br /> <br /> It was a really great film, suitable for all ages and laugh out loud funny at the same time be truly touching and heart warming. It was a great break from the sexual jokes and nudity recent films.
