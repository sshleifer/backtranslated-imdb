I saw this movie after watching Capote and Infamous. It's incredible how the homosexual relationship between the author and the characters in the film is sublimated. Reporter straight protagonists longer beatniks than gays. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly, but on consideration it a second time, we get all kinds of interesting information from the comparison that creates a writer / director Brooks. <br /> <br /> Note the incredible cutting at the beginning, where the killers to be killed and related. Cutter cut the phone picked up Perry on the phone. Clean cut cutter chosen to Perry to clean. Only Perry looks into the mirror and sees his eroticized male body excretes fancy his guitar playing in Las Vegas to empty chairs. This failure / failure fantasy meets-fantasy that Perry tells us about his father, who built a beautiful bed and breakfast in Alaska only to find it empty forever. <br /> <br /> Dick talks about shooting pheasants that pheasants don "t know what they are going to die. cut into clutter. <br /> <br /> Perry says his dream of a yellow bird, Â«Taller, than Jesus", which attacks the nuns who pursued them. "The nuns begged for mercy," he tells us, "But the bird is still killing them" Bird picked up Perry's paradise Ironically, Perry says that he has an aversion to nuns, God and religion This echoes later in his... last words when he wants to apologize, but does not know to whom. <br /> <br /> The director puts in all kinds What if only-CSF. <br /> <br /> Nancy cutter gets an offer to sleep at a friends house . it keeps the horse. Perry will comment on the picture of her and the house later. Nancy can not sleep in the house of his friends, because her boyfriend is coming for dinner. Solution seals its fate. <br /> <br /> Perry says Bogart in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre." But it's a different picture of Bogart, "Beat the Devil" that Truman Capote co-wrote, which is a fictional treasure McGuffin. But Dick knows that the protagonists of this film will end up with nothing. Dick wants to cash the $ 10,000 he thinks he is in a safe Disorder's, (which, ironically, is as much fantasy as Perry Mexican treasure. <br /> <br /> Cut to Herbie Disorder signing insurance in the amount of $ 40,000 life policies. He is thinking about at the moment of death. Ironically his mortality until the end for a few hours. insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life, again ironically, if we know what will happen in a few hours. <, Br /> <br /> Dick said that they did not want any witnesses, so that no one will remember them. Later, in fact, it is because they have eliminated all the witnesses that they have memorized. <br /> <br /> "was one witness," says Dick Detective continues later. But that witness a prison house, Dick, Perry, Truman Capote, or God? the viewer becomes a witness after watching the movie. <br / > <br /> Exciting film.
