I'm really getting old ,, I'm in the middle of watching this 40-year-old film, and it is interesting that my grandchildren will look in 40 years ,, its old saying ,, but they do not make them like this more ..it's not only the history of his music acting as a young and old..the actors seem to have been born to play the role of a young Oliver ,, ,, old Fagin..too many to mention them all, the role of judge Oliver stands before, I had seen in other roles over years..the beast ,, Ron Moody as Fezhin ,, Mr. and Mrs. Bumble ,, film won 5 Academy Awards not only ,, but it took several golden globe too..if you decide to watch this film..do yourself a favor ,, take some, if not all of the children, to see this masterpiece
