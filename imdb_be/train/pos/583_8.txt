In a small town in Montana two brothers growing up. One is Norman (Craig Sheffer) and the second floor (Brad Pitt). Their father, Rev. Maclean, and they grow up with his lessons that have to do with religion and fly fishing lessons. In this film, fly fishing is a life, a little bit. <br /> <br /> good stories, and holds your attention, although there are some points that need a little bit of action. Probably, the film has these moments, because it is not really about the events that are taking place, but about the message. Some things happen, though. Norman goes to Dartmouth study. Six years later he comes back and tied with a beautiful girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and he was invited to teach at Chicago. Paul became a reporter and known as "industrial reporter." He is known for, and it seems that he has a good life, but he drinks too much and too many adventures. <br /> <br /> The film is very well directed, it has a nice score, and all the actors well. The nice thing about this film is the cinematography. Mountains, forests and rivers all look very nice. If the movie was made just for these things, he was good enough to watch. Fortunately, there is more.
