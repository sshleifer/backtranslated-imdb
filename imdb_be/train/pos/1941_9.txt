I actually thought it was a comedy, and sat down to watch it waits to laugh my ass. it quickly became clear this is not a comedy, or at least not Â«Jim Carrey like" one. that kept us watching was the characters - the film begins with a rather gloomy, restless people who have come together to try to deal with one of their main fears - fear of water, fear of swimming. we are starting to get the pieces of their lives, witness their problems, to guess their thoughts. <br /> <br /> In fact, I made it look much darker than it actually is, and to the same chain of events that will soon bring some light and hope in their lives. <br /> <br /> I would probably have not watched the movie I wish I knew him not a comedy, but rather a drama, but I had a good time, enjoy the story, and do not mind, I spent about 90 minutes with him. <br /> <br /> many films treat the alienation of people in the western world, this film shows how people can come together and help each other <br /> <br /> "and when, in the light of the dying day you meet her, do not allow it to pass by you and leave, do not lose it, it is your gift from the sun ... "<br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> peace and love
