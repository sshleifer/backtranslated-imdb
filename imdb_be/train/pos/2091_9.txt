Irving Thalberg did in making this film today is not to be attempted again. Creation of Chinese history The Occidental with the players, even if they caliber Paul Muni Luise Rainer, Charlie Greypvina and Walter Connolly and others. <br /> <br /> This may be partly because the story was written by Westerners, Pearl Buck, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his novel in 1932, Ms. Buck, the daughter of Chinese missionaries, probably brought China closer to the American consciousness, than any other man. China is not a political struggle, but the life and work of the people, every day we find in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, later, Pearl Buck became an apologist for China's Chiang Kai-shek KMT in all its virtues and excesses. The rest of her literary output never matched Good Earth. <br /> <br /> In The Sundowners have a great description of the comparison of China to Australia by Peter Ustinov. When asked the difference, Ustinov said that China was very large and very complete, and Australia was very large and very empty. This is what you see in The Good Earth, China is a very large and very fat people, more than it can deal with time. <br /> <br /> The Good Earth says Van Loon (Paul Muni) in the form of a young man who buys his wife from the big house, where she was a slave. Woman O-Lan (Luise Rainer) bears him two sons, and to see it through good times and bad they are, drought, famine, revolution and climate locusts. <br /> <br /> Louise Rayner won the second of two consecutive Oscar for drawing the O-Lan. It can set some kind of record that he should be a leading player in the Oscar performance with the least amount of dialogue. All she does is almost done with facial expressions, her statement could be on a silent film with a very minimum of subtitles. I think that only John Mills in Ryan's Daughter were fewer words, and he plays a mentally retarded man. <br /> <br /> Muni are not always appreciative of how to support her in this male-dominated culture. Rainer helps in places bears and raises the child, does housework. If Muni becomes a man of property he takes a Chinese second trophy wife who causes him a lot of grief. However, Rainer has it all stoically. Nevertheless, Mooney is not a bad person, and it is a tribute to the film and his actions and writing bak that you do not hate him, and cultural gap closed. <br /> <br /> We have a group of oriental players now who are doing more than just Kung Fu cinema. I am surprised that The Good Earth all the movies was not altered at this point. I'll bet that the Chinese government, even though some American companies to do so on the actual site. <br /> <br /> By the time we got this great classic to appreciate and enjoy.
