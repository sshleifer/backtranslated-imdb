This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. All who regard this film as an absolute sh * t obviusly not smart enough to understand all the subtle humor that this film has to offer. This shows us that real life and "made-up" effect can produce a winning combination. In addition, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the smartest ways for two people to find each other. Give me another movie where you can see all that as well as Donald Sutherland sings a song like "They're going to find your ass on the mountain on Mars."
