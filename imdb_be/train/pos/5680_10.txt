Holy crap it's so hysterical! Why do not American comedy written like this? For anyone who thinks that comedy should be dumb-- there is still reason and intelligence in six episodes of the series, than in a shelf of novels! Hugh Laurie is a full horn. I could not believe that this is the same guy as the house! There are so many fine lines and gags in this series, you can watch every show dozens of times and still pick up new things every time. Rowan Atkinson hilarious as verbose and put on Edmund Butler. This is my favorite of all the series Blackadder. And Tony Robinson beautiful, as always, a few series of blunt heart "of the oppressed masses» Baldrick. Some of my favorite lines: "If someone messes with Wellington he really puts his foot in it" and Baldrick explaining how it got its name and cousin Macadder «smoked top of a Salesman" and deadly swordsmen from Scotland.
