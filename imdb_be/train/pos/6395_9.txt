For me this is one of the best films I've ever saw.Overcoming racism, struggling through life and prove to himself that he was not just an ordinary "cookies" Brashear strange character to play, which places Cuba in its best light, the best performance in its life.De Niro, who is a living legend gives something movie.Hated his character in the film, but he gives so much good acting in this film, beautiful appearance performance.And beautiful Charlize was and, as always a big plus for each movie. So if you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend for those who love the courage, greatness, seeking inspiration.You should watch this great drama. My rating 9/10.
