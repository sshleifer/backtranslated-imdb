The film was very outstanding, in spite of the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In fact, these things happen, and that's why this film shows a lot. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in a magnificent performance), whose recently started attending college is going well for her. It occurs with Jared (Chad Faust stunning performance) fraternity on the side, which is a gentleman and sweet. He invites her to dinner. They are looking at the stars from the bridge, and they end up going to his apartment. They say, and takes her to the basement they were getting flirty with each other. She tries to put an end, but he rapes her. This incident scarred her. She goes to the club meets bartender / DJ Adrian (thankfully plays Marcus Patrick), who sees that she gets drunk and makes it before it goes away. They strike a friendship. It also makes drugs and Maya are starting to use the same. In other words, to introduce it into another world. She starts to go to school and worked in the quality of (assistant) and Jared spot as one of the students. While students are taking Midterm, she catches Jared deception. Jared tries to smooth out my speech, but it still has the upper hand decides to invite him to his seat. Will history repeat? Or Maya have a surprise for Jared? You are watching a movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson reflects the role with the focus and endurance. Chad Faust did not like the fact that it can be a rapist, but he does a terrific job, Jared. Mark Patrick is very brilliant man who saved my and her coach in a new world. This film deserves a reward.
