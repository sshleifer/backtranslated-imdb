I will not repeat all that has been said in other viewers of this film. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a great movie, not only as a very human story about the developing relationship between the father and his adult son, but as a small window on the world practice Islam, for those who, like me not very familiar with this religion. <br /> <br /> One important aspect of this story is that with the attitude of the young man to the beliefs and practices of his father, and how his attitude to religion seems to change in subtle ways, as we move on them way with them. <br /> <br /> This is a very thought-provoking, pleasant and well-made film, which I would recommend to anyone with a brain and a heart.
