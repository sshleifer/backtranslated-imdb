Wow I really liked this movie, William H. Macy as big as silent You are the man, Alex. <br /> <br /> All the performances are really good, the plot is interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Alex Married You people (like his father) with a young son, is going through a midlife crisis and wants to leave the family business, so he goes to a psychiatrist for help, and in this place he He meets a young free spirit will be Sarah from whom he falls in love. Once Alex does not know what to do, if he gets the job done, to kill a man he knows. <br /> <br /> I recommend you to watch if you want to ripen interesting films. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
