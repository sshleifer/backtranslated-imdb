Pistols explosive, exploding buildings, cars crash, and this is only the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This is a futuristic film with a mercenary rogue ex-CIA, which can not seem to die, no matter how many times he shot (hence the name) is pretty decent. <br /> <br /> Strong and toothy Busey, usually cast as a villain in these kind clicks has its usual crazy charm, but a little more subdued: in the end he was carrying all shows. That does not mean that not many great minor roles, including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R. G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick Talmus Rasulala, and a few other "forgotten" characters-actors. <br /> <br /> There's enough action sequences smaller to accommodate the whole story: Busey is to release a group of "stolen" the US military elite and bring high-tech «supertank» (normal tank of a cheese of add -on attached overhead) back to the States . <br /> <br /> But does America deserves such a killing machine no more than the bad guys? This question is asked, of course, as in any film centering on a CIA ... but getting instructive.
