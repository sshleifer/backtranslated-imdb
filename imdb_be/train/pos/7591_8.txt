genres mess, but this is mainly based on the genre mash-ups Stephen Chow for his inspiration. There's magic kung fu college romance, sports, action and gangster some sentimental melodrama for topping. The production is excellent and walks quickly, so it's easy to pass a lot of flaws in this film. <br /> <br /> A child abandoned near the basketball court. Homeless man brings it to the Shaolin Temple, which is located in the city center, along with a special kung fu manual that bum something, but can not read. The old monk teaches the boy, but ends when he is trying to learn the special technique guide. The school takes on a fake kung fu master, assisted by four eccentric monks. The new owner is angry right now 20+ year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the weak beats of the master and throws it on the night. Boy found throwing trash in the basket with the incredible distance of the man who brought it into the gangster club to play darts. This leads to a great battle, the expulsion of the boy from the monastery and human solutions to turn the boy in college basketball sensation. <br /> <br /> Al it occurs within the first 20 minutes, with the majority of it occurs in the first 10 minutes. In addition to the extreme reduced speaking first problem is how little we know the protagonist, while the way to the movies. The person who uses the boy sharply determined by the time the first third over. The plot does not follow any new grounds for the insane actions of the climax of the film, with the exception of. I'm sure you can easily imagine how stupid monks will appear towards the end. Effects, photos, and stunt work are all top notch and make up for the uninspired plot. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has a much better plot and writing team of comedy and this film will live in his shadow, but that's no reason to ignore it. It's pretty exciting, even to the end of the scatter shot. Recommended.
