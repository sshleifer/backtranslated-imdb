... that the version of the Bette Davis film was better than the version of Kim Novak. <br /> <br /> Despite all the other comments written here, I really prefer the version of Bette Davis, even if the version is Novak. more coherent storyline <br /> <br /> However: raw emotions Mildred Davis seems to me, is more prone to walking a girl who seems to be easy to become a prostitute <br /> <br /> And this. those raw emotions that are part of * that poor doctor falls in love with. He has the emotions of despair, failure, 'otherness' - strong emotions, which it displaces. Mildred Davis, on the other hand, shows his emotions immediately and without censure. She has no sense of frustration or failure, or "otherness"; rather, it is simply to survive in a poor Cockney woman in Victorian era. <br /> <br /> drawing Novak was more vulnerable than Mildred Davis was almost through the whole movie. Davis Mildred had never ** ** vulnerable until it really should not go to the doctor and ask for help. And if he offends her - her method of keeping the body and soul together, and constantly using his love for her - she unleashes possibly the hottest waiver pathetic sacred attitude ever seen on the screen: "I wiped my mouth! I wiped my mouth !! "Novak's vulnerability was beautiful. Davis was a monumental realism. <br /> <br /> IMDb vote agree!
