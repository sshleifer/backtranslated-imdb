I loved so much about this movie ... the time needed to develop character, attention to detail, wonderful characteristics, amazing lighting and cinematography, amazing soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> It has a combination of intensity and lightness of touch, that will not work for those who want a typical fast paced action flick. If we lived in Elizabethan days, I would say that this film is a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy. But since we do not, let's say it's more like a drama, exciting movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but complex history. intelligent film is how the relationship and the issues being studied. Most of the stories listed, but did not say that I find makes it thinner and more mobile - and that also works well for the story, based on a comic book (or graphic novel). Sometimes I felt like I was actually there in 1930, part of the story - this was realistic yet dreamlike quality in the style of its telling <br /> <br /> I do not often prefer movies. books they were based on, but in this case I do. (Although I really enjoyed the book, too.) I bought the DVD, which is great, because it has some amazing deleted scenes and insightful comments. <br /> <br /> (I also took my little cousin who is a bit younger than the boy in the film, to see him after I saw him for the first time, because he has problems at home, and I wanted . would use this as a way to start the discussion, the father-son with him, he loved her - and discussions).
