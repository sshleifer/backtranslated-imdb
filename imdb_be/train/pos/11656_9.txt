I saw a couple of movies on eating disorders, but this was definitely my favorite one. The problem with the other of them was the fact that people with eating disorders, towards the end of just automatically gets better or accept the fact that they need help, and that's it. this movie I thought it was a real reason, this protagonist Lexi not only recover automatically. It gets better, and then has a disadvantage. I think this film shows more than any other that I have seen that getting better is not just, it is hard work and takes a long time, it's a long road to recovery. I think the film shows all this very well. There should be more movies like this.
