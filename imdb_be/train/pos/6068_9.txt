Red Skelton was one of the major stars who have made the transition from film to TV with ease. <br /> <br /> His show will definitely bring laughter in American households years ago. <br /> <br /> He will start the show with the opening monologue. After that, we would have a lot of characters. Remember, Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue? How can we ever forget the San Fernando Red? I remember one episode where the king entered Red Queen, addressing her as your fatness. <br /> <br /> Go knows that Red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life. He lost his son to leukemia at the age of 11 years or so. His wife, Georgia, died as a result of suicide.
