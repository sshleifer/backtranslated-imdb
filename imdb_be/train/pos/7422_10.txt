As once Barbra fan, any wiring as it will be biased. That aside, this film takes the classic. It has its drawbacks (underlined in the other mail), but it gives an idea of ​​the time (late 70's), that will never be there again, and interesting to watch unfold on the screen. <br /> <br /> Streisand difficult fight to make this film on their own. I do not think she ever satisfied. But it gives supporters a new Barbra (at the time) with live singing, a young fresh look and some very heavy-duty action. <br /> <br /> The history of rough, but it is interesting, and has an interest everywhere. Increased by one frame "chord" is difficult for most non Barbara supporters to sit, but it says a lot to those who admired her talent. <br /> <br />
