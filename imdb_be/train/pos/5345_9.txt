Last May the Spanish / Catalan wife and myself have seen the emotional history lesson. Spain is once again going in the direction of political confrontation. That is why this masterpiece must be specified in all Spanish universities. This is a great lesson in the hidden crime of fascism. American pilot who is involved in the Spanish Civil War opts for the democratically elected Republican government. The criminal role of religion remarkably well illustrated in one of the most inventive scenes that Uribe ever made. The colors are gorgeous. The brutality of war (can anyone tell me the difference between any war and civil war?) Is used as a scenario of hope when two small children to express their feelings and to protect each other. Cowards who start their abuse of power, even against innocent children is now active again. The film, like "El Viaje de-by Carol," "Carol's journey" / says one of the many sad stories of the 20th century. This is the best history lesson than any book can contain. Again, a lot of work with the Peninsula Iberica!
