I really enjoyed it - I'm a big fan of movies that mess with the mind and leave you with more questions and ideas for discussion, and it was a stellar example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always a good thing (well, almost always. Let's just forget about the Jabberwocky and the Brothers Grimm, we?). <br /> <br /> I especially liked the way he handled the theme of time travel and avoid the paradoxes - interwoven and fed each other <br /> <br /> In addition, it was very well done the way events in the past and the future aesthetically - direction. Art was really cool, and I wanted to Â«d been able to see him on the big screen. Future stage had a similar feeling to Brazil in many ways, and even these scenes often were really visually appealing. <br /> <br /> But perhaps the most surprising thing was that he showed two actors, I usually do not like very much, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both delivered amazing performances here. Pete especially - I've seen one or two films before, that made me realize that it can actually really act (as opposed to what I originally thought), but it really surpassed them. I actually found myself asking my friends in one place, "Are you sure you Brad Pitt?" This is perhaps the most memorable performance of his career (although it must be admitted that it can not be talking too much).
