Im going to make it short and sweet, because I do not think there's much you can exactly tell anyone about this show, who have never seen it, except his funny funny and unique, for me it may funniest show when either. <br /> <br /> You should really watch it to understand its humor and it took me a few episodes to really get into it, but once your there do not get back. For example, the method of Hydes character always wants to see his friends get into some kind of trouble the more this is becoming ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's all round classic I mean the cast, the writers, the director, it's just a recipe for success. One actor I think, who always gets difficult time is Ashton Kutcher, but I mean, it's big, I do not think this shows that it is possible for a character Kelso to have been played by someone else, it takes someone very smart, to play someone stupid. All the main characters are great, and it will not be worth a review if I did not mention a stone cold fox Mila Kunis, and now meet the ball spicy haha ​​jokes jokes amazing show.
