Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, a newspaper agony uncle and a special one father to three girls. In a large family homecoming Dan meets his ideal woman, only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother. <br /> <br /> What's a man to do? <br /> <br /> I rather liked "Dan in Real Life," but I would imagine the success or failure of this flick will be down, are you ready to take Steve Carell plays the role of a relatively straight and restrained rather than through broad comedy moves that have made it so successful. If you can not take it, do not be afraid, "Get Smart" will be later this year, but I thought it was very good for writing. <br /> <br /> Â«Dan in Real Life" begins, as your typical, by the way funny, family drama, but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and Karel frustrated with his situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you have only seen the films with original ideas, cinematic than profit would be very small indeed, is not it?), But "Dan in Real Life" is an entertaining and a good cast (which will not be lodge in love at first sight with luminous Juliette Binoche?) make the most of a fairly astute script that contains a lot and talk about the meaning of love and passion. <br /> <br /> I hope that Steve Carell is pushing himself and doing something as exciting again.
