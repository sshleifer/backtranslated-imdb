This film tells you why Amitabh Bacchan is one man industry. This film will also tell you why Indian movie-goers are discerning buyers. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the height of their rule Bollywood, if it once godfather Prakash Mehr decided to use his image again. Prakash has a habit of choosing the theme and build a story out of it, adding a liberal dose of Bollywood clichés and feelings to him. Zanzeer saw the production of malicious young man. Lawaris was that bastard and Namak Halal was a master-servant preferences. <br /> <br /> However, the topic was limited to the script to move through the regulation three o'clock songs, dance and drama. Consisting of a film caricature Haryanavi, who goes to Mumbai and becomes a hero adjustment. Vocal skills and diction Amitabh saw this film to make their big money thanks to its impeccable composition Haryanvi accent. For me, that in itself is the biggest draw in the movies. Everything else is a typically Bollywood screen for writing. <br /> <br /> Amitabh, now I had to have some of the typical comedy scene in each of his films. Due Manmohan Desa. This film had a good dose of them. Shine capers in the party, monologues over Vijay merchants and opinions Vijay Khazar, in the mosquito challenge in a conference room and a regular drinker scene that has now become standard fare Amitabh. <br /> <br /> Highway Kapoor added the extra mile to film with his moody, finicky nature (remember him asking Ranjeet to «Shaaadaaaap» after being poisoned cake incident "). He had all the important role of the master while like Amitabh was his faithful servant. But Prakash Mehr know Indian intelligence ... and so on Highway had to carry his act with the rest of the film. it was a character that could be better developed, to make a serious film. But it capers, remember? and as long as it stays that way, people came and saw Amitabh wear new hat and went home happy. the end is always predictable, and the good guys are bad goals and go to the jail, the eternal theme of loyalty once again emphasized, and all's well that ends well. <br /> <br /> So what is it hat what makes this film is almost a classic? Amitabh Bacchan like Haryanvi. Prakash Mehra created another icon in the title of the story. by Chuck story, the characters and the story. My marks are for Amitabh alone.
