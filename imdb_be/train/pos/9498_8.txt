"The picture is seen, then remembering better than you have seen." So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), an artist in the world who Failed.The film is in a great old Hollywood style, starring Ronald Colman and bravura supporting cast, including Ida Lupino in his first major role, a reliable character actor Dudley Digges (who also co-starred with Coleman in Condemned.), and the solid performance of remarkable actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The name and the opening sequences of the film are largely given to the fact that Dick lose his eyesight. He was blinded by the spray gun discharge, he and childhood sweetheart Maes (Muriel Angelus) playing with a gun. Later, early in the fighting in the Sudan is the catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a famous artist, but he was blinded by ambition, and does not actually reach its full potential until his vision leaves him. Enter a bad girl Bess (Ida Lupino), and its destruction is itself in motion. Lupino is a very powerful very well in this role and played by Coleman. Her evil tart reminds me of Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> Well acted and well directed, it is one of my favorite dramas Coleman.
