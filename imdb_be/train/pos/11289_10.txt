There's something strange in the fact that a film made in 1934 can be a head taller than any film Tarzan followed, including bloated and boring piece of 1980s Greystoke. Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which admittedly dull, Tarzan and his Mate takes off like a shot, offering non-stop action, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan magical and beautiful as Jane leaves the film. Weismuller is solid as well. Highly recommended.
