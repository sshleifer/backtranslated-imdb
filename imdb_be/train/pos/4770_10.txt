The only show I watched as 90210! Why did they stop? It was the only show which captures the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like you're part of it! At least they should do is to release it on DVD! <br /> <br /> I have tested like the show, but nothing approached. The cast was incredible chemistry, and I'm looking forward to every episode with much anticipation. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake by pulling the show. If anyone has any information on where I can get a videodisc North Shore please write a few lines here. Thank you! Aloha!
