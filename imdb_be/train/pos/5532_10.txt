Maybe I'm biased to the fox, fox stories and all, but I thought it was cool to do. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased that it has been shown that Lily was not very comfortable, such as a fire, and the room (being careful not to spoil too much here). I think it's important for children to see and try to understand. <br /> <br /> After reading some of the other comments, I'm a little confused, one says that at the end -spoiler- are a mother and her son, because she was the one talking to his son about his history. The film, which I saw was not a mother or a son in the end, just a picture of a girl with a fox. Can anyone enlighten me on this? Anyway, I really enjoyed this film, but some scenes may be a little slow, which can be difficult for a high-energy children to sit through. Nevertheless, it should, if they can sit still.
