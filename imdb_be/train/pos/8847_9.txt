When I watch a movie and not once look at a clock or watch to see how much longer it will work, or if I hope that the last scene was not the end of the film, it should be pretty good. I'm not a movie or a movie internalist dissectionist. I watch movies, and if they keep me interested to the end, they are pretty good, because some of the most critically acclaimed films gave birth to me to death (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Redemption, Crash. This film made me interested and absorbed from beginning to end. Acting big story absolutely original, flash back technique is very affective. it was a bit citizen Kane thrown into tho when Hoffman Gromit his apartment after Tomei leave him, but I forgive this reason I see it as a tribute and not a rip-off with, Orson.
