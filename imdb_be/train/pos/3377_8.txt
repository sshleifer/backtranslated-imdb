Soylent Green is a classic. I'm waiting for someone to re-do, it seems, it.They be reworking the classics of science fiction these days (ie, War of the Worlds), and I hope some of the director / producer once again make Soylent Green. With today's computer animation and technology, it will have the potential to be a great picture. Antiutopian movies may not be that far-fetched. Racing human species, like cockroaches, without outside influence, to cut it. We, as humans, have the ability to put the kibosh on childbearing smaller species, if they get out of control, but there is nothing to control human breeding for ourselves, but. In spite of all disease, war, abortion, birth control, etc. the human race is still breeds like bacteria in a petri dish. Classic Malthusian economics argues that all species, including humans, will multiply beyond their means of subsistence. 6 billion is growing .... it's indecent.
