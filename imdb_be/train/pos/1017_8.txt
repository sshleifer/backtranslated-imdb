I started watching the show since the first season, and in the beginning I was quite skeptical. The original film was a kind of child, and I was just looking for some kind of sci-fi show in anticipation of the new season of BSG. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes, I became a fan. I loved the characters - not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-Jack O'Neill, is not only smart, Samantha Carter, Teal'c glorious, women and children, loved ones, and the brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson <br /> < br /> Of course, the stories sometimes serious, sometimes funny, but mostly it's not about technology or space-combat operations. - it's about the help of his friend, even risking their lives for him. This is the "we will not leave anyone behind." Resisting to the end, when all hope is lost. Of Free Will, and all the good qualities that make a person -. Human <br /> <br /> And now it's breaking the record by going 10 seasons, and is still doing well.
