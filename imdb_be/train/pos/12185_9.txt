The Lady from Shanghai is proof that the great genius of Orson Welles may direct "core" movie, if he wants to. Compared to its other, more works of art, the film has only a moderate amount of guile, and almost esoteric elements. <br /> <br /> The exception is, of course, the final scene in the hall of mirrors, it is generally accepted that one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. This alone is worth the cost of rent. <br /> <br /> sweet surprise was the excellent cast of beautiful Rita Hayworth. Her actions during the beginning and middle of the film is so great, she made the other actors look like caricatures instead of characters. Even big, Mr. Wells.
