about one and a half years ago, my father told me of the French doors. I thought it sounded interesting enough, but I did not try to find it anywhere. Then about a year ago I thought this film and thought, "Hey, why not" and tried to find it online. in the end, about a week later, I found him looking at atomic film. I called my father to the computer and told him, "Hey, Dad, I found that terrible movie you told me about a long time ago!" He smiled at me, turned off the lights so it was pitch black except for a computer screen and told me to watch it. I started well ... Then when he started to get concerned, that's where I found it very exciting. in the end I pushed back his chair and stood up ... he startled me: P, if you have not seen this movie, I strongly recommend you do because it's well worth it. even after the fourth or fifth time it is still alarming. <br /> <br /> Great movie!
