Damn, it was that much to take. I was pretty much mesmerized throughout. It was quite perfect, though I would say that the editing had a lot to do with it. I can not believe that this guy was on good terms with many of them (Anton especially) to get all the shots without any major ... beef. Dandy had to come off welfare together, middle-class children, took advantage of his position (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Johnstown, and especially for Anton, who was probably not what a lot of other people felt. A large piece of filmmaking and a large choice of subject (s). I recommend it to any fan of music / movies. You'll probably learn something about the movie.
