I appreciated this film 7/10, which is an average of 8-10 for the production of writers values, direction and 1944 and 6/10 for acting.My the current rankings in their turn, were calculated on 4/10 for all the screen characters to play this for except heroine Ella Raines as Carol Richman, who was very rich in the 8 / 10.Also give Thomas Gomez as inspector Burgess, the nature of which proves that he personally does not believe that the conviction of Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) was only because of his naive alibi .These two then form an alliance in order to prove an alibi. <br /> <br /> Scott I have this movie on DVD «SUEVIA Film Noir Cine Negro» Spanish as «La Dama Desconocida» with the original soundtrack «Ingles», as an alternative language, since, despite the searching, I could not quite find the English version.I was, however, like to see another performance of Ella Raines after being impressed with her performance as a heroine in «Impact» plays a single woman's garage proprietor.Here Ella perform another heroic role believes in innocence his boss refuses to engineer and a few suggestions that she should return to her home in Kansas (pet name vaygo boss to it) to the solution of the missing alibi.The fact that she was secretly in love with his boss a bit difficult to find, as it is formally only seemed to have a formal business relationship with her.He was developed, however, children's homes and children's playgrounds so I think "family man" struck in the brain Carroll. <br /> <br /> in the 1940s with the "code of the film" in operation, manufacturers can only reflect sex through metaphors and here it is done in the form of a fierce drumming plays Elisha Cook jnr.Carol doll like a girl of easy virtue in an attempt to lure the striker in giving her information about «The Phantom Lady» alibi.The other main character, Jack Marlowe (associate Scott Henderson) plays Franchot tons, I found the performance too theatrical and wondered why Carol, for example, did not notice it constantly Strang Ely admiring his hands.Here script should be improved I have provided greater uncertainty because these theatrical move telegraphed plot too early audience.
