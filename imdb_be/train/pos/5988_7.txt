This film is one thousand nine hundred thirty-nine tried to benefit from a much better movie Michael Curtis in "Angels with Dirty Faces". As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how to tame these children were compared to what is happening with youth in inner cities today. <br /> <br /> American film only worth a look because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed that they were well-coupled to each other. Blind children have a large part of the plot focuses on them, rather than in older people. <br /> <br /> In a sense, it's interesting how arson was used in the same way, some conscientious homeowners have done in recent years here in New York. It was the fastest way to turn around the property never taking into account the social problems created by it. In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. Young guys in this story seemed simple pranksters, not criminals. How times change!
