Many reviews here explain the story and characters of "Opening NightÂ» in some detail, so I will not do it. I just want to add the comment, I believe that the film is an excellent confirmation of life. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of Myrtle Gordon he recalls how "easy" it was to act, when she was 17, when she was young and energy, and it seemed that she knows the truth. The experience left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life had been to and, in fact, even if she can continue to live. The tragic accident causes an identity crisis that almost overwhelmed her <br /> <br /> Almost. - but not quite. At eleven o'clock she rediscovers the power of his art, and reasserts itself ( "I'm going to bury that bastard," she says fellow actor Maurice, when she goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic, when the director of Myrtle prevents people from helping her when she comes hopelessly drunk for its first performance. He knows, however, that it must have the courage to do it myself, if she wants to do it at all. <br /> <br /> Some critics wonder if this celebration is only a temporary pause on the way down to Myrtle. I believe that it's really her "opening night" - it opens like a flower to the new possibilities of life and action, she sees the way forward. It is an extremely moving. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands fine. great movie. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, no matter where you are.
