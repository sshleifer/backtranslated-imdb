As someone once said, it's a good feeling film. There's a nice scenery and filled with wonder voices Luciano! I've seen this movie many times, and just saw it again in the afternoon. I had forgotten how much I miss singing with Pavarotti Nessun Dorma, and I need to go out on CD! This is a great movie, just to pass the day absorbed in the fun and reverie. Eddie Albert grandly as an agent and a bit over the top, but only agents that in any case. The Italian village is great, but do not cover the trip in a balloon for a perfect view. If you need a valid Olivier proportions, this film is not for you. If you just want a flight of fancy, and some beautiful music, watch this movie. Just enjoy!
