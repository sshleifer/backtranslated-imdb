FINALLY !!!!!!!!!!! I was waiting for this movie to come out for almost a year, and finally saw him at the premiere in the SB. I met several actors who were really good, and that was great in the film. I watched the trailer so many times that I do not know what to expect, but was completely absorbed. the film was really nice to look at it, and the music was very good. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Ryan Donohue and Dominique Swain was good at it too. Other actors were good and big. I hope that it will be released on DVD in the near future !!!!! <br /> <br /> I first got into Ryan viewing OC, and then saw it in a bunch of good indies like Imaginary Heroes. He is big in this film, and everything he does is indie. I would also like Dominic, but did not see her anymore. I hope to see them both in the shorter !!!
