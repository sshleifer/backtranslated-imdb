I happened to catch this film screening in Brooklyn - it's difficult to describe the plot; he has a lot of eccentric characters, but let's just say, I would be hard to choose which of them made me laugh the hardest, I would not know where to start. Even peripheral role is well written and well acted. <br /> <br /> There are numerous little touches that make it unique and very nice, it has a number of "tools" that appear and add another layer of fun. It's refreshing to see; not some recycled material that I have seen many times. If the film could reach a wider audience, I am sure it would be a real crowd-pleaser, the story is so original and heartfelt. <br /> <br /> There's a lot to like here, ridiculous back stories, mishaps and misunderstandings that create the final act and dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed very funny movie with a ton of heart; This touching story with rapid comedy woven throughout. Definitely worth a look!
