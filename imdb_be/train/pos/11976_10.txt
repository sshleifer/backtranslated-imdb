This show is about three little girls. (D.J, Stephanie and Michelle) Their mother was killed by a drunk driver, because their father Danny invites his brother-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). Thus, all the show about living life. Girls go through life problem and there are lessons to life. They develop breaks, your friends, and much more. All shows are basically going to go with the flow. You do not need to hold a grudge, you just have to let go. I think this show is very good and fun to watch. I grew up watching this show and still watch it today. I am glad that they are still airing the show on television. I see it almost every day. I rate it 10/10.
