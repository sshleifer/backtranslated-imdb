May the dog died recently, and it was a movie that I loved as a child, so I had to see it, to try to lighten the mood. <br /> <br /> (Beware of the dog, I mean Spoilers.) This film ISN "t just for kids, and it is far from ordinary. It was set in New Orleans in 1939, first of all, the dog was not shown as an additional member of the family in the film, but as an adult with his own complicated life to deal with. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Charlie is not too different from its shameful and hard business partner, Carface. He drives the money, greedy, and only escaped death, he says, in the beginning of the function. The difference between Charlie and Carface, Charlie can learn and willing to listen to others; Anne-Marie and his sincere friend, itching. Carface will not even listen to the fat, ugly dog ​​with big glasses who happens to be the closest thing to it. <br /> <br /> Carface trying to kill the hero, because he wants 100% of the profits in your business and will not be content with only 50% - a very unusual way for a German Shepherd to die. In addition to being eaten by the size of prehistoric alligator, which ends sparing his life, because you can sing very unlikely, whether or not the dog. This cartoon, and therefore it is logical here. <br /> <br /> Carface method of revenge for the killings, while Charlie believes that the success of the best revenge, financial success, that is. Having survived death, he starts his business, taking Carface source of funding, a very talented girl who has the ability to communicate with animals. They win a whole bunch of races, and Charlie tells her that he will give the money to the poor - hint hint: Charlie and Itchy live in a dump, and so poor. He uses the money to his casino / bar / theater, rather than the other "poor". The reason why Anne Marie has the ability to talk to animals, she has sympathy, and she listens carefully. It teaches ethics Charlie showing his gambling, lying and stealing. Charlie tries to make up for it by buying her dresses. She added ethics, who need his business, while Charlie took control and itching provided construction. <br /> <br /> Carface uses violence and property damage to ruin business, Charlie, unprotected by the government. Charlie loses everything, and all that he had left this little girl. In the end he had to choose between his life and his. He grabs the first watch with a self-preservation, and sets it as the girl began to sink. And the girl, and the clock was sinking, and he had to choose, which one of them, and he chose the girl. <br /> <br /> The best part about this film that focuses on a person's ability to know right from wrong for a long time, and the child's ability to cope with the natural occurrence of the death of your pet, is that he never shows who dies! Watches symbolize his life, and the clock shows the dive and stopped. All these deaths were ambiguous, even for a villain. I never cried during the movie so far, and I got a lot more out of it that I had to write and share it with you.
