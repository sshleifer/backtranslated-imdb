IVAN (Marco Rica) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in the company with Estêvão (George Freire), but the first of them a professional killer deal, ANISIO, to kill Estêvão (land, at least in the beginning, Indifferent "t explain very well why). The guy does it, and after receiving his money, he begins to blackmail the two partners within their company and says he wants to work there (as a supervisor or something ??). At the same time he meets MARINA (Shimenes), daughter Estêv, and begins to see her! <br /> <br /> In a story like this, where crime, corruption, treachery and blackmail go hand in hand, no one is guilty, or may be a victim, an exception is made for the marina, which is the only person who does not know what is happening, and not put anyone ?? <br /> <br /> This film reflects sarcastically sad and cruel reality that exists in a large metropolis like São Paulo, where the crime is the presence of each day. We can feel the irony, but true to the characters as ANISIO (played brilliantly by Paulo Miklos), which makes the blackmail with the guys who paid him without any doubt, and even flirts with the guy he killed his daughter! He really needs to be a monster to do something like that, but of course I know that there are people like him out there in Brazil or in any other place ?? <br /> <br /> This is a very good film, a hard but true, the sad reality ?? Actions great and the soundtrack too.
