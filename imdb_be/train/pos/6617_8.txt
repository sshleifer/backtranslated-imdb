Animation always seem fringe. In Japan, this may not be true, but in Europe and even more so in the US animation is a big fat «KIDS» label on it. France is probably one of the most comical-liberal countries, classical home as Tina-Tina, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon and so on (not if you have never read this, it's not too late. There is no upper limit of age on them and they do not carry the stigma of nerd-DC or Marvel) seems a natural film like this one pops up in France. It fits my preconceived image of French as an art-loving, anti-US-oriented and talented filmmakers. Fortunately, there are also "A Scanner Darkly" is there to suppress this point of view - it seems that art is largely international <br /> <br /> In any case, as you may have gathered artsy Renaissance and French .. If you are a normal man, you're scared of it. There's no need for that, though! Under it's cool, smooth appearance Cel-shaded have a good thriller and a good movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> It was one of my fears for this film. It's so easy making a spectacular stunt animation, as well as Sony & C: to do with their Pixar rip-off. I was expecting an intricate, sometimes boring and not very attractive film, but fortunately, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo-noir thing, but it was good that it was worth at that level as well. Note: I've seen the French dub, which was fine, as far as I could see. English can be more interesting that Craig and all. <br /> <br /> A final word of praise animation. It was awesome. Futuristic, well thought out, well-camera work, smart solutions (eye, for example looked very good, it's hard to do), and so visually stunning, I felt like bursting out, "It's so damn cool!". Again, I really like the animation, and I appreciate the effort to put down the studio, so my verdict is a little biased. <br /> <br /> A good movie in any case, certainly lives for this "trick".
