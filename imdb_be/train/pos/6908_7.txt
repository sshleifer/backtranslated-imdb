Richard Dreyfuss stars in «Moon Over Parador», 1988 Mazursky film also starring Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfus plays a New York actor, Jonathan Nolan, the Parador in the Caribbean country, to make the film. If the dictator dies suddenly, the main secret police (Julia), which is the one actually controlling the dictator and the country to play checkers Jonathan dictator, noting the similarities between them. Jonathan soon ensconced in the palace as Alphonse Simms and Simms' prostitute girlfriend Madonna (Braga) that implements switch promises to help him in any way she can. <br /> <br /> Mazursky, who appears dressed as Simms' mother, gives us a look at how the CIA works in third world countries. Winter's character, supposedly the seller is actually a CIA operative. The film, however, is flirting with, but really do not tread on very good reasons, and a derision, and funny in this. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss does an incredible job as an actor Jonathan and Alphonse dictator, creating two separate characters and nailed both. Gorgeous Sonia Braga great as Madonna, and Raul Julia in the hands shamelessly funny performance as the Strausmann, the man behind the dictator. This is one of those performances where you never know what you think the character - it can be enjoyable or turn psycho at any time. Magic on the arm as a maid, and manages to be funny and unobtrusive at the same time. <br /> <br /> It is a good movie, but not a big blockbuster, but very interesting.
