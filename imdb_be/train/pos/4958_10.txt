Full disclosure: I'm a cynic. I like my ending is boring and handkerchiefs to dry. I did not cry when Bambi's mother was shot. Happiness is a new movie Will Smith looks like a desperate plea for an Oscar. Basically, I was born without the artistic soul. <br /> <br /> So why do I love "10 Items or Less?" Maybe it was the double espresso I drank before the show. Or (more likely), maybe it was the fact that even the most hard-boiled film lovers can use a random shot of sweetness. <br /> <br /> And sweet. From that moment on, "His" meets "Scarlett" (the event is far from Nora Ephron's "meet cute") view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learn to care about where their lives are headed. (Aided beautiful movie believe Papamaykl style camera work.) <br /> <br /> The main argument of the film, it's too far-fetched. Is it far-fetched movie? I do not know. You tell me. I've never met Brody in the market. (However, not for lack of trying). Should I take pleasure in view of adventures that can occur if a significant event occurs? Damn right I am. , .That is where most reviews "10 Items or less" do not hold. , .They do not take into account that even cynics we fantasize. And, heck, sometimes it is worth the price of admission to live it indirectly, 82 minutes at a time.
