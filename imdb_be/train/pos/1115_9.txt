This is one of those unfortunate films that suffered even more sad, miserable death at the box office. I saw this movie at the local feature film, in the form of regeneration, shortly after the tank in conventional theaters. It certainly deserves to go a second time (or even third). Sandra B. takes it to the limit, making the spoken word and take some well-known songs in this part of (her version of Hank William's "I'm so Lonesome I Could CryÂ» can easily move you to tears). Maybe, someday, the audience will be willing to accept this film a little more serious (but not without some well placed laughs, too). The film moves at a fast pace (thanks to some good editing), so that some viewers do not find stale and sad. Perhaps a revival just down the pipeline.
