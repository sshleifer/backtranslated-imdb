Brilliant portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in the Oscar winning performance), who bullied his own conscience. McLaglen plays blush the IRA, who betrays his leader to collect the award during Ireland's Sinn FÃ©in Rebellion. Scenes depicting fights and mob action is very realistic, focusing on the desperation of individuals. Lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> Directed by John Ford beautifully creates a dark and tense atmosphere, enhanced by a hazy and dirty way of the Irish landscape. dramatic score by Max Steiner adds to the cinematic passion. Oscar winner for Best Screenplay also nominated for Best Picture. This is one of the Classic Hollywood.
