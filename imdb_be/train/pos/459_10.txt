This is the best series of its type I've seen all year. I can not think that it's just my luck - I love the series gets 6 episodes (and more in the next year), and a constant stream of cookie-cutter cop shows to get the episodes do not end <br /> <br /> I think. Due to the successful completion of new tricks much. The script is good, and the combination of signs of great acting top flight, but a mixture of comedy and drama works a treat. History is not all that memorable, but that's not the reason I watch shows like this. <br /> <br /> The theme song is a favorite, and we were disappointed that it is not available in any published edition. Great stuff, BBC- triumph over the sexy sense (aside from the young constable's nobody there, like the eyes of a stick, and even if he is, he can still act!).
