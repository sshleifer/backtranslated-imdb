"The time of day is ended," an incredible picture. in some ways, it's better than "close encounters of the third kind." (I prefer the cheese independent clicks in the big-budget spectacular.) The special effects are cheesy, but it's a big part of the fun. Jim Davis gives an excellent performance in this film. this is probably one of the best role he ever had in particular. the musical score is very good. the story does not make sense. But it only makes it all the more intriguing. Like many of the best works of art, "the day ended," do not be afraid to be thin and ambiguous. "Time of day is over", can be a low budget indie film, but it's not too much of the duration, in order to compare it with the "existential" European films fifties and sixties. (Many of which were low-budget independent productions themselves.)
