I went films about animals talking with caution. For each distinct, as the Babe, you get the same beggar, how terrible remake Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a movie does not live up to their potential. When I heard about Paulie, sending a very true parrot not fill me with confidence. But I found the film a pleasant surprise. And he manages to uncover its way into the heart without your knowledge. <br /> <br /> A Russian janitor Misha Vilyenkov (Shalhoub) gets a job at a research laboratory. One day he heard singing coming from a basement. And if he investigates, he finds a parrot in a cage singing her little heart. Misha becomes fascinated with birds, especially when it turns out, the parrot can not only sing, he can talk. And not a few phrases or. His parrot you can make conversation with. <br /> <br /> Parrot called Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr), and recognizes a fellow like Misha. Want to know how this world is a wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, Michael convinces Paulie to tell him the story of his life. Which all started when he was a child, and in the care of Marie, five-year-old girl with stuttering. Two of them became a bird feather (OK, bad pun!). <br /> <br /> If the parents Marie worried about his close friendship with the bird, they thought it sent out. And they finally did after Marie slightly injured himself in a fall after training Paulie fly. Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey to America, which includes a wide range of new owners, flying long distances, and even end up in jail. With cells, that is! <br /> <br /> Paulie was one of several films speak of animals, DreamWorks released in the late 90-ies. And although it was not given the same recognition or box office success Babe, Paulie succeeds on quite a few levels and a chore strange intelligence. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr standing style action is well suited to the part of Paulie. He never plays the role as too complacent, even if it is a little insolent. Field mundane, but it is also naive in its kind. <br /> <br /> Because he lived a fairly sheltered life with Marie, when he picked up, he has to fend for themselves for the first time. And if he falls into the hands of various owners, they make Paulie promise to combine it with Marie, he said. Only for those promises to be broken again and again. <br /> <br /> Paulie, admittedly a little occasionally. It follows the eclectic people Paulie ends, and as he slowly getting closer and closer to Marie. He first completed at a pawn shop, where he accepted Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of style. She sympathizes with the situation and leads Poly RV across America to find Mary. <br /> <br /> Paulie is sometimes very touching movie. His scene with ivy is one of the best. Wonderful moments Paulie sat on his shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers. The way she instills in him the need for hope, a large, and some of the dialogue is well written and even to think: <br /> <br /> "There are things in life you are put off because you think you" re going to make them later. But the real thing Ivy taught me you have to live, as it might not be later. " <br /> <br /> scene where Ivey passes on the way leaving Paulie all by itself is a very heartbreaking moment. And the sequence where he breaks the courage to fly for the first time through the Grand Canyon, soaring majestically composed such beautiful scene it stays with you for a few hours after the film is over. <br /> <br /> Despite the at times sad moment, there is a lot of laughter is worth. Paulie falls with a group of performing parrots outdoors in the Spanish restaurant. The animatronic effects are really great as four birds makes perfectly choreographed dance number. And Paulie even gets to have an affair. Who dashed when he gets in with a thief (played by Moore as well). This may be the only complaint I have. Once you are comfortable with a situation, the film moves to another Paulie. <br /> <br /> The scene where Paulie taught to steal money from ATMs fun, but a little anxious too. I'm surprised DreamWorks were able to include such a scene in the children's film. And a diamond robbery Poly is a Mission Impossible. He was caught in the act and sent to a laboratory for tests on animals, where it remained until now. <br /> <br /> In the story finally comes full circle in the laboratory, where Michael vows to help Paulie. Of course, they find Mary. But the final revelation is the scene of a shocking intensity, I left numb for a few minutes. Paulie can never get longevity Babe is, but I think it is just as brilliant film. Those laughs. The same effects are spotless. And the same amazing intellect. <br /> <br /> Minor stone.
