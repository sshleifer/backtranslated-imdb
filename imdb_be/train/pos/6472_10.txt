One of the best parts of the TV drama of the last decade. Within five hours, those perceptions and sympathy are constantly challenged as she explores the many aspects of modern day British society. David Morrissey, as usual, brilliant. At the first coming across as heavy hand of copper in conflict with the heroine, but then it turns out, intelligent and caring as he deals with it in uncovering the truth. I had never seen before Surrane Jones. I believe that it comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was superb, as it supports her sense of humor and self-control when trying to balance the demands of affairs and stress care of the mother. I could go on and talk about each of the members of the actor, who contributes to this great drama, but their efforts mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenge your assumptions about any of the characters. It is programs such as this that restore your faith in the television drama, while at the same time, which makes it virtually impossible to solve most of the debris that more and more shine airwaves.
