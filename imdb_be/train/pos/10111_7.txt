The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is not particularly good documentary. Aesthetically, it is a vague and cheap looking, the people in it go on tangents that make it a very focused and united in, but it adds to the charm. I say this because it is a documentary about an eccentric, who made magnificent paintings and surrounded himself with other eccentrics, and as such, there's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits. There are some glimmers of understanding of both the genius and the slowness of wood, and the image quality is a credit to both genuine documentary. In general, it is worth a look for fans of wood and those films in general, but does not expect that shine here. Wait a documentary made after Wood's own heart.
