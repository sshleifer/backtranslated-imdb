Well, the "Cube" (1997), the first film by Vincenzo, was one of the most interesting and challenging ideas that I have ever seen when it comes to movies. They had only one scene, a bunch of actors and the plot. So what made it so special were effective direction, excellent dialogues and a strange condition that the characters had to deal with, like rats in a maze. His second film, "the Cypher" (2002), all of its history, but it was not as good as the "Cube", but the characters are tested here like rats again. <br /> <br /> «Nothing» something very interesting and Vincenzo gets back to its "Cube days' closing characters again in a completely different space with no time once again to play with the characters, how to play with the rats in the room experience. But instead of the thriller of science fiction (even some of the promotional teasers and trailers seemed wrong that), "Nothing" is not free, and light comedy, which certainly can be called a modern satire of our society, as well as the intolerant world we live in. Vicenzo again amaze us with a great idea in this little sort of thing. 2 actors and dazzling white script, that's all you've got most of the time, and you do not need more than that. While the "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and "the Cypher" confusing, "Nothing" is not completely opposite, but at the same time and desperate. <br /> <br /> This film once again that a reasonable idea is much more than simply shows a millionaire budget. It is known that the film can not sometimes, but the main idea means a lot, and eliminates any imperfections. There's nothing more to say about this movie, because it's all a brilliant surprise and a very different experience that I had in the movie as "Cube".
