The question is, can be considered "bad" film if the film is really the entertainment? My husband and I picked it up at the video store is used for 99 cents just because of the name and the fact that the field was the word «Vestron Pictures» it (Vestron was highly regarded as a sign of quality ever since I first bought the legendary film "suburb "and" class of 1984 "). We did not expect that the film is a complete victory, as this one was. Your main plot as follows: Grange, it goombaesque thug from the planet Earth, robbing "Moon Bank" and sentenced to a colony on a distant planet (I do not even remember the name of the planet) to mine for bauxite and other minerals, "Governor," said. colony and mine owner operated for prisoners work. Walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three in the whole planet) reminds concluded that there is no escape, because there is only one transfer from all over the world, and they had it would be dealt with. Then there baa znazovny "Col." retired mercenary suffering from pursuing recurring nightmare. Much of the film centers around "futuristic" chases (dunebuggies with plywood slapped on the sides) with explosions in abundance. The planet looks suspiciously like Hemet, CA or one of those other dusty outposts of the Inland Empire. but what makes this film really shine strangely amazing soundtrack featuring several LA punk bands of the mid-80s. I seriously doubt that the soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl, but is, definitely worth buying just for the film soundtrack. I can not even remember the names of groups (listed in the credits), except for the white myshe explode, because it was the only one I heard before I saw the film, but I would definitely look into it. <br /> <br /> In principle, the film is definitely not a waste of time, and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends.
