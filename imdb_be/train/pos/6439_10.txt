I went to see this movie twice a week and can only be summed up in one word (which I usually do not use lightly): Excellent! In my opinion, the best movie ever made. Who deserves the Oscars and other awards, unless a Swedish team that created the cinematic excellence in the last scenes of the movie, when all is said (and left unspoken) throughout history portrayed together? Just as the character of Daniel Dareus causes so many feelings and long-suppressed feelings from the people around him, the movie does the same thing for the audience: You play with your head buzzing and your heart a feeling of satiety. Great stuff! The next time you ask yourself "what is the meaning of life", it is possible to think about how you feel after a luxury experience like, as in heaven: Happy, content, fulfilled. To say that of Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, "Such moments are enough."
