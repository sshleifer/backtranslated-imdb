This movie was excellent. It details the struggle between poruchennomom detective isolated against ignorance corrupt communist regime in Russia during the 80s. I give this film high marks for it-holds-barred look at the birth and development of the forensic examination on a global scale, isolated (thanks to the "regime") community. This graphic film. It is a picture of unsensationalized violence and its tragic remnants. Nothing is "candy coat" with blood or overdone baked blood to separate us from the harsh reality on the screen. This film is based on a Russian serial killer Chikatilo. I'm familiar enough with the true story, to have a very deep appreciation for the way they have kept the real movie. This is not a comedy, but for those who appreciate a dry and dark humor, this film is a must-see.
