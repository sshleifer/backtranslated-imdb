This is not a great idea to look Hundstage if you're not 100% sure of their mental stability, as it will not be a serious challenge with this film, no matter how sensible you are. I have to say that this feature film Hundstage, not entertaining film, so that the majority of the audience will not have the level of "maturity" to achieve in its beautiful side. Kind of like Tarkovsky's films, but different in the way. I myself can not say that there was a lot of fun to watch. But it is an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who only suffers a clich√© at Hollywood. Hundstage sticking a finger right into your brain and your mind scratching all over. You can not just sit back and watch, you will use shouts or looking with eyes wide open throughout the film. The film, which is similar to this style is Nachtgestalten, but it was much better, and the method is less strict. This one, for example, not for children or those who are mentally soft or irritating. Most viewers are likely to give either 10 or 1 for this film. I give it a 9 because I have seen a few stories-in-a-film phenomenon in another movie, and it was better. But this is one of the outstanding in themselves. Worth seeing, but be prepared to see something disturbing.
