It really seems that this film polarizing us. You either love it or hate it. I loved it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment (s) who said, you just have to "feel" is one. <br /> <br /> In addition, at the beginning of the film, Tom Cruise shows a picture of his girlfriend made Monet - Impressionist artist. Monet's style is to paint in small strokes well before the closure of the picture looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can say that subject. Cruise says that the picture is "Vanilla Sky." I believe that this is an allusion to the moviegoer. This film, like this impressionist painting. This impressionist movie! And it is no coincidence that the title of the film refers to the picture. <br /> <br /> This is not your typical linear section. It requires more thought. There is symbolism, and there are scenes that jump around and do not have, you are not always sure what was happening. But in the end, everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You need to focus on this film, but I think people make the mistake of focusing too much on it. After it ends, when you have to think about it. If you try to understand it as it unfolds, you will overwhelm yourself. Just let it happen ... "to go" with him ... an open mind. Remember that you can see and save the analysis for later use. <br /> <br /> I found all the performances at the highest level, and thought it would be extremely unique, wildly creative and unique. <br /> <br /> But I do not critize intelligence of those of you who do not like. He refers to a specific taste. If you like the existential, psychedelic, philosophical, meditation, spiritual complex movie, and then view it. If you prefer something a little lighter, then skip it. <br /> <br /> But if you like what I've described, you will surely enjoy.
