I just thought it was excellent, and I still do. I am grateful that we are still able to see different things from what Hollywood almost fills us. Saving Grace is smart and nice - those who feel abused marijuana thing better go look at American bride kind of movie <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows that a funny movie must not be silly .. I laughed my ass off at the time of most of them, but also pondering questions about what was a woman protagonist has to make in order to pay the debts of her late husband <br /> <br /> In a nutshell -. Witty story with typical British humor and good acting and directing. You could not ask for more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
