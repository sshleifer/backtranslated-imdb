Wow, this was a great Italian "zombie" film of Luci Fulci two big director ( "zombies") and Bruno Matt ( "Hell of the Living Dead"), Lucio began this film, and I was sick, so great Bruno took over and turned surprisingly better than I expected it to turn out so, if you've seen the "hell of the living dead," directed by Bruno Matt, and if you've seen "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucio Fulci and loved both or one of the threads, it is a film that you should look he has a great "zOMBIE" witch makeup equates look great "zombie" has fun "zombie" volatile th head! and "zombie" birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a "zombie" (it just happened to two people), but they are mostly just large toxic "zombie", as in Bruno Matties Â«Hell of the Living Dead," So if you as the Italian "zombie" movie or just "zombie" film in general, the check is one of his great Italian "zombie" film!
