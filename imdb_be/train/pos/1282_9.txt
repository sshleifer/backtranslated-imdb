I saw it a couple of times on the Sundance Channel a few years ago and got a good boost to the cinematic system. Gender-surreal still hard-edged take on the modern Media Culture (or lack thereof), focusing on some seriously wacked, WAY-of-The-Hollywood fringe inhabitants. It was a fun early performance by Mark Ruffalo, and some memorable cinematography from the DP, who made films of the Polish brothers. It was a wild umcompromising humor and successful original feel to it that just set it apart. This film was a cult written all over it, and I'm surprised that it's not on DVD. <br /> <br /> I hope in the near future.
