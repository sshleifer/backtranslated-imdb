I do love this 1930 mystery / police type of Charlie Chan films, and this is no exception. Nevertheless, something seems to be bad with this film. A late attempt to go from cerebral Moto films centered around the plot contrivances in the salad bar is spoiled by means of comedy, which is a relief as the pain in his legs. Printed clown appears from nowhere is not impersonating a clumsy Englishman who plays the detective, and even other characters seem confusing to provide assistance to the comedy. The plot may seem strange or naked occasion for us today, but then the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries not only real, but common.
