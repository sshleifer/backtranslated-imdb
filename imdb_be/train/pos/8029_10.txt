I wonder what Beckett rifle used in the film, as well as the caliber of the bullet, which was suppose to shoot. If it is loosely based on the sniper Heskoke, I believe that I 7mmy. round. I am also very interesting rifle. He also made a comment to the end of the film sniper rifle that will allow him to use the Vietnamese, owned by his father. Beckett said that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. I would like to know what a rifle too. I know that this particular rifle was made around the Second World War, or in advance. I just could not get close enough to watch a movie to watch on it to identify it. <br /> <br /> As for Mr. Hathcocks kills his long shot was 1:47 miles, and he 93 confirmed kills and 14 unconfirmed kills. After his wounds healed a few burns in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career in the USMC sniper training skills they would need in this area. His career sniper is still mentioned in our brothers and sisters who are preparing to USMC. I learned his name from my friend, who is a former Marine. Any information would be great.
