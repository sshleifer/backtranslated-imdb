Well ... just my favorite show ever. Call me walking clich√© mail, but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. on the show, and you have the winning points in my book. Combine all that with the cast that superceeds anything you've ever seen on the small screen, add the Director, the appropriate type and vintage movie most letters that blows the mind (and a few brain long way), and you've got themselves show Thats going to be pretty tough to compete with. <br /> <br /> First of all, there are two actors James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano and Edie Falco as his wife Carmel ... as for Gandolfini, he approaches his cast in a way that words can not express, if you have not seen it, Tony still see it now! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on and on about every character in the show, the psychological brilliance, gripping scenes, etc., but you could not stop me, so I can say that we are talking about the only show with the Seinfeld, I can watch over and over again from beginning to end, and end up like it even more.
