this film is very relaxed, romantic comedy, which is quite pleasant. Meg Ryan does a very good job as a genius of Albert Einstein's niece, although she believes in their own skills. Tim Robbins does as good a job as a mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes to his shop with her fiance after her car power up. I loved Matthau as the one and only Albert Einstein. This film has a very simple feeling of weakness to it, at the same time maintaining a certain seriousness to it (if it is in fact possible, it happens here). <br /> <br /> Personally, I found this film very interesting, especially the old scholars - I thought they were fab and fun! This film seems to be undervalued beyond comprehension. If you have a daring sense of humor, this is the movie for you!
