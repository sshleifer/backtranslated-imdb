A great piece of good cinema. This is one of those movies that you see smiling, and you do not know why. Well, one reason may be that we are in front of one of the most amazing film directors today, and he is able to remove emotion. <br /> <br /> When you are watching a movie you can feel that Mr. Straight was feeling when he decided to go to visit his brother with his "beautiful" John Deere. What changed his mind? What has changed in your mind when you saw the film? <br /> <br /> A beautiful brotherly love story.
