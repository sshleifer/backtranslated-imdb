I was looking for this movie for years, apparently, it's not available here in the States, so I bought a copy of the deleted Ebay. <br /> <br /> The four young hunters and three of his friends venture into the woods looking for a bear that apparently killed several campers. What they find is an ex-Vietnam vet had gone mad (it kills some of its victims, using a glove with a long metal nails a la Freddy Krueger). As soon as night falls, one of the girls out for a walk after a short argument with her boyfriend, she dies. After one group finds the body, they hide in their tents while waiting for dawn. Once the sun rises, they all try and do this, but to sacrifice one for the other. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, a little gore, but murder a few good, especially the girl's death. The boys slaughtered in several ways bloodless (blown up in a car, shot, knife over his head). <br /> <br /> In general, INFERNAL TRAP good slasher from the end of the 80s. Nothing new, just worked well, fast paced, and some beautiful homes. 10 out of 10.
