"The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the definitive documentary on the life of man who brought us such films as "Glen or Glenda", "Bride of the Monster", and, of course, "Plan 9 from Outer Space" . This sophisticated film is far superior to where other documentaries, such as the failed "Look Back in Angora» and «The Plan 9 Companion». It rounds off his surviving entourage, many of whom died after the shooting, and gives an honest study of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic is that it looks at the darker corner of Hollywood past, sentimental treatment of directors (up to the obsessive music), this film is an absolute must see for those who love a director who so failed in his day. Just two hours of the film lovingly and retrospective pieces together the life of Ed and premature death for the viewer. Best viewed at 3 am while wearing a sweater angora.
