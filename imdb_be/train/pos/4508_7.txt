I was struck by the beautiful photography in this film, which was shot on location in Alaska. Although technically Romance, we see a lot of activity Inuit are involved in such as hunting, dancing, building, etc. needle, and their customs, such as his wife offer visitors, usually in the story. hunting sequence sometimes footage, as it was easy to recognize a rear projection animal scenes, but even they were spectacular. Spear for salmon fishing, hunting walrus, caribou and even polar bears and whales made it seem like a documentary at times. There was not a cast list, which strengthened the documentary flavor. The filmmakers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speak only in the language of the Inuit, which has been translated, or someone on the screen or intertitles. The introduction stated that white traders and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, except that there were no actors in the film, but it's not quite true. The two leading characters, played by the Small and Lotus Long, the Eskimos were in origin, but they were professional actors with credits for the earlier films, and you could see they were sometimes makeup. But they were great in their roles, and they went on to have a Hollywood career. In general, the film is definitely worth seeing.
