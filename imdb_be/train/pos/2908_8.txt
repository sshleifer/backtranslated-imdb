A journey of discovery, this film is worth the life of a family living in a dream, the island city in British Columbia. Languid and dreamy, the residents are happy to walk the life around them, while young, fresh-faced teacher, comes up with new ideas and brings life to the mainland. Slowly, their lazy condition wakes up, his father (and the director of the local school) looking for excitement, the mother of stability, the eldest daughter in love, and the youngest for power. While not incredible and innovative piece of cinema, the film quietly pleasant and good for the weary night, when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt that anyone outside of Canada will find it easily accessible.
