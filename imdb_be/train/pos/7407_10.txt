This movie took me by complete surprise. I watched it 2 or 3 times. I really liked this movie. There are many truths of the movie brought up. I love all the characters in this film as well. This movie makes a lot of sense, because as a society "becomes more forward" that culture untie, do not sound instructive. I can really relate to this film with my child hood and loss, except my life that will never go back there ever was same thing. This film is on my top 5 movies I've ever watched. There is just such raw truth is that I feel when I watch a movie and not the truth that you have to look for it in your face. the creators this movie did a great job, and I enjoyed this film very much. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you'll love it.
