Born Boogie real "find" - even a rock fan for almost thirty years, I only saw the first movie a few days ago, and rank it among the best rock films of all time; MUSIC excellent (cream T. Rex) and visual consistently interesting and unusual, leaving the audience hungry for more than last directorial effort Ringo Starr, who has done an excellent job here. If you love music, you'll T. Rextasy around, like Marc Bolan really the star piece, front and center. Even the fact that some of the songs are repeated does not matter a bit: different locations, costumes, musical arrangements and fancy visual concepts are all used to bring a different texture and a lot of optimistic humor to what could end up as 'just' concert film in the hands of others. How rich and full packaged BORN TO boogie, the film only about an hour long, but the fact that there are quite satisfied. Therein lies my only criticism - the video package claims that something like 71 minutes, and at least one online source says that the film will be 67 minutes, but apparently it's more like 61 minutes of rocking pleasure.
