In life, we first organize stones (Piedras in Spanish), for example, career, family, friendship and love. So we have to find space between these to fit smaller stones, our small needs. If you act in the opposite way, you will not have enough room for larger stones. Five main characters in this film are women who have not been able to organize large "stones" in your life. Ramón Salazar, Spanish director defines his first film artistic gems that way. The film tells the parallel conflict trajectory of five women: Anita (Mónica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adele (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-), and Maricarmen (Vicky pena, 1954 -). Everybody is trying to remove the stones that insistently appear in their path, or worse, being in their shoes. They are five Cinderellas in search of prince and a new chance at life. The best story of the five Cinderellas is that Anita (Monica) Cervera, who also plays in the "20 centimeters", "Busco", "perfect crime", "Entre Vivir in Sonar", "Hongos" and "Octavia" .
