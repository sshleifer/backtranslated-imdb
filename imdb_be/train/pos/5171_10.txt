If I could go back, even as an adult, and relive the days of my summer spent in the camp ... I would be there so quickly. I went to the camp, it was even a big no. They were in Texas, where mosquitoes actually carry people away, but we had horses and fishing. Cinema film was strange, funny characters and believable especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. the character of Sam Raimi and sub-tricks were priceless. So, who ever thought that this movie was lame ... I am deeply sorry, because they can not suspend your disbelief long enough to represent the life of the camp again, as an adult, and they never went as children. The thing is that these people were able to regress and become a juvenile again and so they are at every opportunity. I wish I could. It was funny, smart, beautiful script, brilliantly cast and artistry takes me back, so I want to watch it again and again, even just for the scenery. Sorta like Dances with Wolves and LadyHawk ... a good film, but in the desert becomes a character as much as the actors. Rent it, see, buy and watch it again and again and again ... never gets old. ; 0)
