If you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss, the first boy / girlfriend, or the first puppy love affair ... this movie is for you! Ok so this film would not ever win an Oscar but how Dominicans I loved it ... there are some things in the movie that could just go right over your head if you are not a part of the culture ... the children to be brought up by his grandmother who a mother and a father, the younger son being nursed and bathed with tin cafe Bustelo (sooo Dominican!), Ju harassed neighborhood people go to church and light a prayer candle ... film gloss was in these small details. Of course, it would not pull out all the works of cinematic extravaganza, but it was not to be, and was not it meant to be a training tool for those who want to learn about Latin culture (hint: make new friends, as well). More bitter sweet, artificial-cumentery, this movie kept it real, not taking ourselves too seriously. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mamá También," it was just a boy coming of age tale. I recommend it (especialmente si Eres Dominicano!) = O)
