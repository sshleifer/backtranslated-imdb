There's a certain charm I have always found in the disclosure of a large (floor) unknown film. These discoveries were almost always dramatic films - in my experience, unknown to science-fiction, action and horror of the unknown is very, very good reason. I found «High Tide» video in a rubbish store, mixed in among the countless dozens of tapes of varying quality. Of course, this is the only place where I could find him, because he is not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> While I watched, Judy Davis (as Lily) for this film, I was sure that I was somehow watching is no longer open performance. Yes, I have seen Davis in several small parts - and one of the main roles in "A Passage to India." But, although it was beautiful in the aforementioned film «High Tide» is a different animal entirely. More recently, after watching the film, Gillian Armstrong's "Charlotte Gray", I am acutely aware of the actress, who hits her. Davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to Cate Blanchett. - in order and sensuality <br /> <br /> performance Judy Davis is stunning, I can not say enough good things about it. She shares an unusual attitude on the screen with a young Claudia Karvan (as Ally), another great actress of this film. There are a lot of drama and quiet humanity shared together, the details of which I will not presume to show here (see it for yourself!). There's too much good in the «High Tide», to cover in a single review. In fact, I would hardly care - the film speaks quite well for themselves. In conclusion, I would like to praise the screenwriter Laura Jones for its stunning dialogue, directed by Gillian Armstrong, for her understanding of the great actors and Russell Boyd for his brilliant, understated Cinematography (see his work in the "bounty").
