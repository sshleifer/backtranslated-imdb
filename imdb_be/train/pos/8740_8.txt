There are a large part in the life of a beetle. Everything is covered. The film looks great and the animation is sometimes amazing. The film is not too terribly original, it's basically a modern view of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, but with errors. I enjoyed the interaction of nature, however, and the bad guys in this film, in fact, seemed to be bad. It seems that Disney usually makes them a bad guy with a copy expressions. Grasshoppers are threatening and Hopper, the leading bad guy, was Brillant creation. Check out this.
