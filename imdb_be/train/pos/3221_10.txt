In the film, several references are made to a thin blade, but one of the most obvious is the fact that 607 Cain and his unit all the genetic structure, species to be expendable soldiers. But as a favorite quote of mine from the movie, "you had to make them smart and fast." Kurt Russell did an incredible job, his facial expression or absence in the movie gave more in the way of relating the history, the second part of the cast together. Even when he falls in love with Sandra, but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after the expulsion from the group, or a shudder when he gets his arms, and his commitment to the dumb boy, who in many ways reminded Todd about himself, and what he could be, if not his choice to be a soldier.
