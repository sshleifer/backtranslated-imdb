As with all environmentally conscious films of the 1970s Soylent GREEN has a rather unpretentious view that the ecological crisis is. Overpopulation means it`s too many people to feed? I was under the impression that the famine was caused by a war or a failure of economic policy. Stalin`s policy in the Soviet Union in 1930 left millions dead from hunger and to this day a great man made tragedy was rustic Mao`s policy in China, which resulted in more than 30 million deaths from starvation in the 1950s. And let's not forget about the great famine in the Horn of Africa in the 1980s and '90s, which were associated with the conflicts entirely overcrowding. You might also like to consider that two of the most densely populated areas in the world, Hong Kong and Macao, has never suffered a famine in modern times. Similarly, the expansion of slums around the cities as seen here ISN `straight down to overpopulation - Eto'o th down economic factor, where people flock to the city to find better paying jobs than in rural areas (It`sa symptom of industrial progress - not too many births), so the image of the city in the streets of New York city is too overwhelmed to go through and to have people sleeping in the stairwells few ridiculously <br /> <br /> But don`t be fooled into thinking Soylent GREEN bunch of boilerplate tree hugging shit, because I believe that that the best environmental film with <br /> <br /> 70s. He plays contempary audience`s knowledge of the world, where Thorn and Sol overjoyed by finding the fruits, brandy and fresh meat. Thorn gasps in disbelief with ice in whiskey, inhaling on cigarettes and provide a classic line, "If I could afford it I`d smoking two, maybe three of them a day." But it`s appearance euthanasia That`s camera memorable Thorn looks like the image of wild animals, flowers, running water and snow-capped mountains, Thorn`s generation the world has ever known. It is a very persuasive scene in which Soylent GREEN very memorable film, coupled with the fact that shows the final appearance of Edward screen G Robinson, as a wise old Jew Sol Roth
