Goebbels motivation departing entirely investigated. In the aftermath of the Stalingrad Reich I decided to go to "all-out war." It is mentioned in the film. Part of this was to use women in a war that Germany had not previously done any great extent. SS massacre of women would be faced with a disaster Goebbels ties with a massive proportion of the public. His advantage was to make this problem go away as quietly as possible, on the grounds that Jewish men can always be rounded later. I understand that most of the survivors of the war. <br /> <br /> His other problem was that the «Red» Berlin has never been more enthusiastic for the Nazi cause and had to be handled with care. Again massacre women could cost the Nazis that the mediocre level of support they had in their capital. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that the majority of the SS uniforms showed patches that have shown that people who wear them are not of German nationality, but were of German origin in other countries, such as Lithuania and Latvia
