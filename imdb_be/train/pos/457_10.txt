This program is very fun, and the title song is so catchy, I can not get it out of my head. I believe, as I get older, I am drawn to the wrinklies, getting things done, and these four well in their endeavors. Some of what they are doing is outrageous but brilliant, given that now days with our world PC, we could never do that in real life. I always learn something from the show. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy and a bit of trial work, you will love this show. It reminds me of Quincy, ME to one side and Barney Miller in another, how they work and to react between each other. They tighten a lot, but they get the job, and that's what matters.
