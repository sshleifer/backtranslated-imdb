I did not read about the movie before I saw him, by chance, on Saturday evening. And then, as I watched it, I felt the suffering of the Lena and Boesman in my bones. I was so captivated by the action and tone and filming, I listened only partially dialogues. My husband went to sleep shortly after we went to bed, and I was sleepless, under the influence of the film. I wanted to wake him up just to say. "If I ever vote for an Oscar nomination, it would have been for these two actors," I decided to wait until the next day then I read more about the movie on IMDb, and was. sad to learn that Mr. Berry died before the film's release, and that he probably had not seen the latest version of his brilliant masterpiece. I still want to tell him that I was his film was a true independent film in its concept and spirit . Actors boast not only for their brilliant performance but does not take part, without shine, sun hvalyach camping, on the contrary, showing the true image of human depression. It is sad, but bitter.
