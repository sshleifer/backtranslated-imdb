Gandhi, the Great: <br /> <br /> The greatness of the world is associated with people like Alexanader large, Ashoka the Great for their greatness lied praised as more than men. Gandhi called for great actually being great, but to be a man, because I always think, showing humanity at us, where the greatness of human existence lies.Gandhi was a man of humanity and those who seek to humanity, ready to sacrifice themselves in the struggle for humanity, not its enemies. Let me turn to the consideration of the movie now <br /> <br /> About Gandhi my father :. <br /> <br /> My father Gandhi film is not about Gandhi, but his son Harilal Gandhi.On told the story of his son, whose father was one of the greatest men to walk on this earth, the director manages to portray a film tale.The managed to tell a story to mislead his father's son, who will lead the people to greatness.The film is called as a critique of Gandhi's refusal, as a father to a son, I would say it was because of Gandhi's sacrifices made as the son of his father, to do justice as the father of the nation. <br /> <br /> I want the essence of this film is not only prevalent in India, Gandhian land, but through the heart of all the people of this world. <br /> <br /> Gandhi true man. Jaihind.
