That's strange: a modern film about a serial killer who has no battle scenes, no one has seen death, sun chases and no loud noises ..... and this is happening in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but they are terrible. <br /> <br /> The rest of the history of detective work, and how much red tape poor detective had to go to solve the murder. It's a very dark film, and "dark" best describes the personality of the hero (Stephen Rea), as well. However, history does not bother, and it's very interesting, all the way through. <br /> <br /> Rea is outstanding, it is determined, a harried-looked detective. Jeffrey Demanov downright scary, as the killer. Russian accent Donald Sutherland is doubtful, but he only plays the character in this film, which has some heat. <br /> <br /> Once again, history is dotted with liberal agendas, here and there, with not one, but two reference bias against homosexuals, the general validity of secular psychology, police and government officials being boorish / raw / fanatical yadd, yadd , yadd. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a clever and refreshingly restrained detective film. This is somewhat unique film, which is probably not very well known but well-loved people who have seen it. Since it is based on real events of this murderer, this is more frightening. Do not miss it, just because you do not have anything about it.
