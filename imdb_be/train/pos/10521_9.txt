Well, I guess I'm emotionally attached to this film, because it's the first one I went to see a more than 10 times in movies ... helps me through my master's thesis, or, more precisely, keeping me from working on it ! <, Br /> <br /> But watch it again in a few years (and many many movies) later - that well crafted little gem it is! I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a convincing performance, and the North is the perfect Mr. Knightley - where does one find such a person ??? <<< >>> Sigh turn Sophie Thompson as Mrs. Bates virtuoso acting of the best (oh, napkins, sorry!) And the rest of the cast is not disappointing either - Toni Collette brings a lot of her Muriel Harriet, and Ewan McGregor convincingly charming - Alan Cumming and Julie Stevenson is an ideal "impossible" pair <br /> <br /> we know, sets and costumes, a great soundtrack and make a great contribution to the Feelgood, almost Hobbiton-how! the atmosphere of the film - though as far as cinema and decoration are, it is almost a case of visual overload. Very very nice, but a bit more austerity, perhaps gave the best sense of time. But the good thing, the film does not take itself too seriously, and there's a lot of fun - and some pretty cool editing. - that keep it from sinking into saccharine mode Merry Old England <br /> <br /> My particular favorite ball scene - some nice acting and directing here and the final dance misses relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightley is simply beautiful. It is a pity that the final offer stage lasts for just a little too long - cut two shots (I can think of which of them!), And it would be much more in line with the rest of the film <br /> <br. /> Gosh, I just understand (read IMDB lists), I have seen the North, at least three films, even knowing that it was he - I think he's got a lot more going for him as an actor, than simply being bred British heartthrob! Hmm, I think I need to pay my video store visit ... <br /> <br /> A great movie. My favorite Jane Austen adaptation so far - though perhaps Ang Lee Sense and Sensibility, strictly speaking, the best film, this one is close to my heart - and I, of course, seen it many times! See if you can - and not too hard on their little imperfections <br /> <br />.
