If you have any idea about the production of Jane Austen, There, now you can when she repeats the same in each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion, all the films made of her novels a little sad, but I like Austen's characters because they all have a certain personality and typical statements they like to say, as in Emma. The fact that Emma makes it well Gwyneth Paltrow, she's very good in its leading role. In addition, the fact that each one of the characters in the film do not, it seems to be able to do anything, but to get a good partner to think and soon married makes the movie fun.
