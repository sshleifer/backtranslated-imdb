I have not read the other comments on the film, but, judging by the average rating I can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary. <br /> <br /> I've watched him for a second time with my children. They absolutely loved it. However, he did not have adults rolling on the floor, but the sound of children's pleasure to do this seems to be so <br /> <br /> This is a real Mel Brooks farce with lots of moral content. - how sad to be loved for their money, not who we, and how unstable our friends and associates. There are many other films of a similar subject, no doubt, many of which will have a greater comic or emotional effect on adults. It's hard for me to imagine such an influence on the younger members of the family, however. <br /> <br /> Thus, for children, and 9/10 from me.
