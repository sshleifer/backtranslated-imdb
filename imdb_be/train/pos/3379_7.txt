In the '70s, Charlton Heston starred in the science fiction movies of varying quality. «Soylent Green» is one of the best. He plays Robert Thorn, a detective in 2022 in New York. In the future, most of the food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. But if Thorn discovers uncomfortable truths about this product, he finds himself on the run. <br /> <br /> I think it's only natural that the film should look away now. But despite this, it still raises interesting questions about what will be our agriculture. Also starring Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson (in his final role).
