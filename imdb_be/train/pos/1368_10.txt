All right. It was a favorite since I was 14. Of course, I do not watch it a few times a year more, but ... this is not a film for the older generation who want a deeper meaning, or some kind of brilliant message. This movie is FUN. This is a fairly outdated, almost fades, but Posey is so brilliant that it's incredible. If you want to be fascinated 90 in Breakfast at Tiffany's, which was attended by 90 raves, or love Parker, this film is for you. Otherwise, do not worry.
