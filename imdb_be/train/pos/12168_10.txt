"Guy Thing" may not be a classic, but it sure is good funny comedy. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in the morning after the bachelor party with no memory and Becky (Julia Stiles) lying naked in bed. Before he could understand what had happened, he sent to Becky from her apartment because his fiancée, Karen (Selma Blair) comes. After that, as you can imagine the chaos stands. <br /> <br /> Almost every single scene in «A Guy Thing» provides laughter. The funniest moments come from when Paul imagines what might happen if he says Karen. Selma Blair really talented comedian, and the worst thing about this film is that it is not enough. Despite the fact that it is more ridiculous than the character Stiles, which in fact it is not so interesting. Of course, not every comedy perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Guy Thing» is not a classic, but it's not bad, 7/10.
