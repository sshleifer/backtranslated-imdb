It's not so bad ab movie with Sanders, Barry, Hale, Cowan, Hamilton, Gargano, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best we could be with Charlie Chan, Moto, falcon, black, Holmes, or holy, etc. In other words, you get the chance to spend another hour in the company of old friends, from the simple to the polite, Kill and be killed. - always fun in my book <br /> <br /> Barry boiled home with revenge and cleanse her skeleton and a dead father, a police detective on the planning and conduct of its underworld hangouts line encroachments. That would, of course, had the opposite effect! Sanders joins in the fun, just dancing in the right club at the right place in the right city at the right time with the right lighting, falling on him, and the first murderer (at the right time!) And kill him. <, Br /> <br /> stories and act normally, the only gripe I have is coming to an end with the hasty and almost laughable discovery of who the evil genius (Waldeman) was - they were almost forgotten about its relevance in the story? However, the tough entry in the series.
