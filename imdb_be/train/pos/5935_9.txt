Seeing the terrible, terrible, terrible BATMAN: DEAD END I knew I had to see it as soon as I heard about it <br /> <br /> When you click play to watch the trailer, I thought I was in for another disgusting short. the fact that so far looked the other poor wannabe filmmaker trying to bring a new depth to the existing character. But instead met with a significant combined trailer of the film, which, unfortunately, does not exist, because I wanted to see the finished film, even if it was only 30 minutes long. <br /> <br /> IN THE WORLD are refined is for Batman :. deadlock, and then some <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to the next short!
