the move was fucking hilarious !!! Funny, I've seen in a while, Akshay and John Kick Ass, as always, and hot chicks. story is amazing, a lot of great jokes, and those who considered it before me an idiot. to him I say, that is not of Indian origin, so you would understand the humor in MORON. not a movie you do not understand the speed. What to watch subtitle version, where the majority of the jokes are lost in translation? that's what I thought a donkey. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar best actor ever, and once again proves its versatility, it can make not only the action, but comedy as well, and well at that. John established himself as well, this is his first comedy role, and he was also very rich in it.
