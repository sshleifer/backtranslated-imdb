It's a shame that Deliverance is mostly known as a beast rape movies and dueling banjos. Even people who have seen this movie can not get your mind off of the rape scene. It's not as bad as rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It's certainly not as bad as any woman rape scene in almost any movie. People tend to skip the strength of the film, which contains the infamous sodomy scene. <br /> <br /> action, plot, cinematography, and sound disposal all lend a hand to her brooding charisma. Backcountry, he was shot in the beautiful and completely unlike the dark subject. Actors both major and minor, you feel like you're rafts down the river with them. <br /> <br /> The thing that separates this movie from others is tangible sense of fear that it inspires. Not many movies can make you feel it crawled with. Bottom Line: This movie is a classic. I can not say much more than that.
