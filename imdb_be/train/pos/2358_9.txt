Pushing Daisies is just a wonderful tale, with shades of "AmelieÂ» 's aesthetic and romance. He has a beautiful palette, his shots are well thought out and detailed, its name and the dialogue capricious and too coyly, to be real, his imagination is great, and his novel deeply. <br /> <br /> See the blue sky in the ass on you, as blue can not be found in other sets or pictures (with some exceptions). <br /> <br /> Look bizarrely natural and quite happy with the break of the song from the scene. <, Br /> <br /> his score is gorgeous, its cast is highly enjoyable, there is great music, and two of the leading romantic stars can not touch each other, or it will die. As far as the sexual tension you need? (In fact, I'd found a way to get around this one, but c'est la vie). <br /> <br /> It's just a show, it's nice to spend time with, and I recommend it highly. There was no other TV very much, and I would like to see more. He got me through the flu one crappy week, as it makes for a good company. <br /> <br /> Bring it back!
