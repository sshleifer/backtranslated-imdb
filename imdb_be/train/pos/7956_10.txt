It's just a classic film, where human voices that come from animals, in fact, what they thought. I do not know whether my video copy of the scene is missing, but it never shows, the dogs got out of the pit. It also shows the animal instinct of survival and tracking abilities.Put people in the same position, the ant helicopters will be absent. At this time, a remake of the original film is improved as a voice-over for the first has been removed. Only the use of animals can work in this kind of film, because with the help of the people, would have to fill out the history, turning it into a murder, arguing that, in the end, the animals are more interesting than people
