As a person who usually does not use a boxing movie, feeling they only focus on the box, not the characters, this film really touched me. I loved being able to see the protagonist of Diane (Michelle Rodriguez) to go through so many things in such a short time, it was amazing for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) did such a fine job playing Diana, especially since it was her first acting experience, she showed real emotion and drew Diana's fine. All participants had chemistry on-screen and make the film even more strange. I highly recommend this film, even for those who usually do not watch boxing movies. 10/10
