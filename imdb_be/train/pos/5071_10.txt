I saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and thought it was great, especially since it was based on a true person. Pierce Brosnan was very good, as a single English man, who took over half breed Great Gray Owl persona. The photo was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film made me do more research into this character Archie Belaney known simply as the Great Gray Owl. I want to read as much as I can about it. At that time I did not know, Richard Attenborough directed it. But I'm not surprised. I love all his movies, whether it is acting or directing. I gave him the highest assessment. Nevertheless, I would like to see more of in the movie about why he took on the persona he showed two aunts who raised him and his room in their house. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong with this film, if you're like me and enjoy a beautiful story, not feeling the effects of matter and flimsy every few minutes.
