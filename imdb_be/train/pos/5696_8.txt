What do you do with a 14-inch cocked pornstar, who was involved in drugs and murders, and then died of AIDS? You make a film, of course. The probable reason why it was not done earlier, is the fact that Eddie Nash would have been in the way of its production. So it is no coincidence that the film was made only after a certain time after Nash was sent to prison. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is its fast pace. There's no time wasted on unnecessary crap. And why would it? There is too much good stuff here to warrant scenes.The cast blunt filler well. Kilmer was mediocre in a series of films, so that here, finally, the role is well suited for it. Bosworth cute, so it does not matter how it works (it is solid), and McDermott, which is otherwise very annoying, quite well, largely because he wears so much hair on his face that I did not recognize him at first. (I want them to do that Cruz every movie, so I would not have to watch his dumb face.) I am completely unable to recognize Christina Applegate, and would not know that she was in it, if I have not seen her name final credits. Kudrow is charming, as always, a little unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Incidentally, the "Friends" worst TV sitcom of all time.) The only casting choice that was questionable was almost an early cameo Carrie Fisher and absurd inclusion of 90s moron Janeane Garofalo. You thought I would include Paris Hilton, well, is not it? No, I think the Hilton is an ideal choice in its 10-second video, how dumb whore. Because the film is about decadence, among other things ?? and porn actor ?? she is perfect.
