I saw the trailer for this film several times, and I have to say that Ned Kelly looks like it will be a great movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not take my eyes off her (it caught my attention probably). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, which is visible for a split second looks fantastic. I think this film will be a hit, and it will be seen over and over again has a lot of people.
