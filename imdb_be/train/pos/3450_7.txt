Never heard of this movie until I saw the DVD rental, I like a little skeptical, had a lot of movies in the past with good ensemble casts that can not do a movie bad script, and in some cases do not seem to care. <br /> <br /> Well, just watched, there was no reason not to give this film in theaters, it's good. History, like most in this genre may seem a little forced at times, but there seems to be a good amount of realism here that allows you to carry the momentum. I was pleasantly surprised by how well the work of Justin Timberlake doing here with this important role, well it is not Oscar material, but he will learn with each role, and it shows a lot of promise for the future here. Dylan McDermott was also surprisingly good in his unexpected role nasty and definitely the cream of the crop in this film. <br /> <br /> In the end, just give it a go. You will not be disappointed that you will not get bored, in fact, I think you'll be more than happy with the end result.
