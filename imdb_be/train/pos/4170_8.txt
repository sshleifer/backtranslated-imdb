I've seen this movie several times. It was at the same level with more frightening material, which was shown in the television movies then. The only problem I had with the name for obvious reasons ... One immediately thinks of the famous snack cake Drake! Leaving from the first part, Â«Hound of Hell" would be enough <br /> <br /> inclination always manages to bring a sense of gravity to anything that he does, anyway -. Whether it is good or bad story. But it was nice Halloween fare offered on the CBS network. I loved the part where the inclination takes flight in some obscure country to find a mystic to help him defeat the evil beast. He asked the taxi driver how to find this guy. Great dialogue between the taxi driver and a native inclination to view the coachman Dissing ethnic beliefs of its own people. "Oh, Mr. Barry, I left this stuff behind when I came down from the mountains ..." - referring to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and no one knows how to actually contact them. <br /> <br /> As far as the supernatural fare goes, this film is still enjoyable.
