One of my favorite movies, I first saw it when I was about 10, which probably tells you a lot about the type of humor. Although from the humor, of course, it has a charm about it. Expect to see regular Askey and Murdoch banter so popular in the day, with lots of interesting, quirky side characters. The lady with the parrot, it is time for marriage and in trouble with "her", and my favorite, the caretaker, "No one knows where it comes from ... nobody knows where he is going .." I wonder what was the ghost train written by Arnold Ridley pope glory army (Private Godfrey medic) Be careful on a rainy Sunday afternoon and smiles.
