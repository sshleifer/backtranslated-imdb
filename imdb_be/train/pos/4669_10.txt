If there were two charming performers than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith appeared together in a fascinating film in 1968, I do not know who they are. I first saw this beautiful little satirical rock 25 years ago at the age of 16 years, and I think every year that I could not sit down to watch it again wasted one. This is a smart, quirky, neat, thoughtful, sweet, slightly subversive, and very magical. Romance of the two social outcasts is both richly comic and touching awful - never more than a desperate attempt to Maggie Smith to display the correct card in the deck, the scene is sad and funny and the perfect portrait miniature heartbreaking loneliness. And the final freeze-frame on the anxious, concerned, loving person Ustinov, he asks, "Are you all right?" - Does anyone ever did look and sound so great devotion and blatantly honest? I never wanted to know, someone who did not love this movie.
