Yaitate !! Japan is a really fun show, and I really like it! As we have shown in our country, most recently in Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. It is about Azuma Kazuma, who is trying to realize his dream to make the Japanese bread to represent his country. He works in the industry with Southern Toyo Pantasia and he also helps his friend (zucchini Azusagawa) together with other bakers (like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) beat Saint-Pierre and take control Pantasia. They fight other skilled bakers from many other countries, not only to learn how to make different types of bread, but also learn how to cook another meal. It's really funny and unique anime because they also mimic the characters from other anime (Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous people from real life. This is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and really need to see people of all ages.
