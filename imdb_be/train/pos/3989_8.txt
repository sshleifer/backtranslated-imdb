"Mother" talk about the recently widowed mother mid 60's two adult children (Reid), who, in the wake of her husband's death, finds himself waking up from a life of sleepwalking, because it deals with a young carpenter, who is also married lover of her daughter. The movie stops at a quiet passive mother, her tenuous relationship with her adult son and daughter, a silent demand she tries to calm in bed with her young lover, and convolutions resulting from them. Several antiseptic drama rattled psychodramatic underwater, "Mother" does an excellent job of combating uncomfortable questions realistically, avoiding gratuitous sensationalism. It will play better with a more mature audience, perhaps women who are better able to empathize with the central character, its needs and challenges. (B +)
