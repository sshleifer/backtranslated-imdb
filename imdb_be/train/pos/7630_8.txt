Kurt Russell, whose career began when he pushed the REAL Elvis happened at the World Fair, probably never started to work as a king in this biopic took off on slash and shock Meister Carpenter. There are times you feel that you are watching Elvis until something snaps you to reality ... perhaps memories of the hapless Don Johnson and Elvis Beauty Queen? All performances are excellent: Season Hubley, like Priscilla, Hingle Colonel, even Shelley Winters brings the right level of the nerves and hysteria its provision Moms Presley <br /> <br /> Papa Kurt Bing plays. Elvis's father, Vernon, and there is a fine understated appearance of Robert Gray as Elvis friend and bodyguard Red West. <br /> <br /> A must see for a rock 'n' roll fans.
