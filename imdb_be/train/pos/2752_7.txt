Although the plot elements to the "eighth day," it seems as if they have been made many times, the film is still a big part of the candle, mystery and symbolism that the first film by Jacques Van Dormal had. Although not as good as "The Hero", which will always remain in my favorites list, the movie still leaves us with a lot of emotion. Auteuil, 2001 in tasteless «The Closet» downplays his role, fearing replay (this is true, the role could have easily destroyed when the actor was too dramatic). Nevertheless, I felt that a part needs a little more realism to it, focusing more on the nature of, and not just the growth of character. <br /> <br /> Do not go to this movie waiting for the dark humor and unexpected twists and turns that you got from "Toto the Hero", because you will be disappointed. Nevertheless, the film is still a worthy, if not handicapped, cinema
