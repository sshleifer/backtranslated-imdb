Some genre films should be dressed. This one was no exception. Taken on its own merits, it is a dressed-down version of the horror film genre. With minimal special effects, he manages to be a psychological study of varieties with simple but existential topic - who gets hit by the bus, and why is it? This is not a great film, but because a little far-fetched about this, work history. Thin, and all of the interaction of the characters. In fact, there is a scheme in the initial stages, but it may have been placed there just to set the tone for what is to come. I really appreciate the balance of male and female energy, and would not recommend this story, who is interested in more than the people who respond to the physical and psychological problems. You will enjoy the film, if you have some empathy, appreciate the need for a bit of adventure in your life, and wonder, "What would I do in this situation?"
