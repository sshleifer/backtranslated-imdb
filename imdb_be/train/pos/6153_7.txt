Obvious parallels between the magical fantasy of Walt Disney and a broom and knob C.S. Lewis The Chronicles of Narnia are pretty obvious. There are more matches here than comparing knob and a broom than with Mary Poppins, although many of the same creative talent went in two Disney films. <br /> <br /> As Chronicles of Narnia it includes a few English children leaving London during the Blitz and coming to live in this country. And these children have to deal with the world of magic. But unlike C.S. Lewis Rawlins children have the magic to invade their world and help defeat the people who make a mess of his here and now. Nha departing to the realm of fantasy like the Pevensie children. <br /> <br /> a lot of heavy philosophy of service here from Walt Disney, with the exception, perhaps, is not a good thing to mess around with witches even an apprentice of them, Angela Lansbury, studying their magic to quack like David Tomlinson. Ms. Lansbury did not get to be one of the most bankable artists for a song. It carries its own brand of magic, special effects, even the boys at Disney could not top. And they won the Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in this department for this film. <br /> <br /> The two artists have made their farewell to the films in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tess O'Shea played her last role in this film, she was decorated with a lot of the film in the United Kingdom as one of the best of his favorite artists music hall. And it's a great character actor Reginald Owen as a retired general, who leads the old militia in the war and in the rate of simple song film audiences around the world. <br /> <br /> Team Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman, who wrote the score for Mary Poppins has written a good and serviceable here. Age Believing was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to the theme from the shaft. Personally, although I as a tribute to David Tomlinson that most colorful of the streets of London, portabella Road. <br /> <br /> knob and fine broom fantasy film that still holds good after almost 40 years. Imagine what it would be like with a computer generated graphics.
