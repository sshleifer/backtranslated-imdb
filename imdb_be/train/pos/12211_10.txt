Crook is an extremely innovative film with a couple of very smart and talented directors, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They manage to tell an original story in a unique cinematic style, and it is beautifully filmed Ann T. Rossetti, and beautifully written - indeed poetic. <br /> <br /> the main characters are the real heroes and serve as role models for the rare species / inspiration for butch dykes and Transsexuals worldwide. This film has so much energy, so much passion and touching sloppy heart of San Francisco to it. I can not recommend it highly enough! <br /> <br /> Best Butch buddy movie of all time!
