Seeing Charlie Boorman in Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I found it very interesting to see how Charlie would be in his own show. I thought that Charlie came across as a nice guy who is very strong and down to earth. Its nice to see that celebrities are struggling with their weight and fitness, it's just show them too, man! I do not know much about bikes, but this show captured me from the very beginning. Preparation and organization for this event seems huge. The event itself seems to be very dangerous, and I'm fascinated to see why Charlie and everyone else is doing it, and how far he gets. I like the pace of the show and the fast rhythmic music. I can not believe he broke his collarbone, I really hope that it is not until the end, I can not wait to see the next episode ...
