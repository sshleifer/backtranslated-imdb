Watching Midnight Cowboy, as the adoption of Workshops in acting / directing / cinematography / editing / recording. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw him for the first time a couple of years ago, but it absolutely has withstood the test of time, and I watched it several times since then. <br /> <br /> Everything about this film is brilliant, from the painful ideas by Voight and Hoffman (although I know this movie is good, I still well up every time Voight breaks one of his innocent looks pained, Hoffman or coughs it painful and sinister) to the stunning cinematography and beautifully edited sequences dreams. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers are not willing to take the risk of making movies that are visually and aurally exciting as this one. Midnight Cowboy should be required viewing in all film schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
