When I was flicking through the TV Guide, and came across «Twisted Desire» in the movie plot, I read this description. Three words caught my eye, "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I believe its role in 'Sabrina: Witch "absolutely disgusting, I hate these kinds of programs, so I just thought it would be boring old love story starring her ... little did I know. <br /> <br /> he finally began on television, I had prepared a bucket if I feel sick at his cheesiness or soppiness, you know what I mean. Firstly, do you think that she's just a nice, normal girl who is in love, but does the average parent. Then, when you find out that she manipulates her boyfriend in the murder of her parents, so she could be with her true love, you, like, 'Wow.' You just did not expect this kind of role this kind of actress. It is very well played a role, in my opinion, I never expected that she would be able to act like a bitch, and voila, she did great! Congrats to her, the film was very good, I would definitely watch it again and recommend it to others.
