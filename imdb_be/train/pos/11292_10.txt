. I saw this movie when I was a child, at the end-the end of the show and fell in love <br /> <br /> It has been more than 30 years, but recently I found it on DVD - it's not cheap, either - in the catalog, specializing in war movies. We watched it for the first time last night. The sound was good, but it was grainy and had trailers between the drums. Still, it was better than I remembered. I was amazed at how well it was in the game. <br /> <br /> The catalog is here somewhere. If you are sincere in looking for him, fire me an official letter, and I'll see if I can get you the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
