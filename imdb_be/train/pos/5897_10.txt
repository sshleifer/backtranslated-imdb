This film has to be put on DVD. It was so funny, and I loved it. Indeed, it is very cute and funny. Not realistic, but are not intended to be. The only thing I do not like about it was the girl, leaning on the guy too much. It is a period of thinking, although time. I tried to get this film for so long, and he was not available for the US format only in the UK and will not play on US players DVD. This, unfortunately, over-looked the classic movie! Believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult classic for all ages. It is a pity that we do not legalize some of the things that could really save a small country, or our own. Lindy is unsinkable, positive character, making lemonade out of lemons. She's funny and charming. She stole the show!
