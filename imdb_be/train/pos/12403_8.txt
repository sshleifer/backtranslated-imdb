You would be forgiven for thinking the Finnish director of Helsinki will not be good to send the American horror film (especially one completely inside the US prison) - see it to prove yourself wrong! It was made in the 80th year after all, and the film was made on a budget of more suitable for the modern DIY company's TV advertising (something I think someone notices now that almost all accustomed to the $ 100 + budget fighters on, unfortunately, the dominant reason industry) is the first basic production and r-Harlin - at least what is currently regarded as a star - cast. I still think that most of the Scandinavian contribution to the film industry as a whole more to do with the screen appearances Stellan Stargaard in (not to mention the well-inflated Mr (s) of Bergman directorial effort) - at least for all women spectators - but this movie really shows that there is indeed a right film talent outside the United States and Hollywood, to make us watch a movie in limbo. Try and watch the movie, even if you do not puff horror, IMO it's definitely worth it!
