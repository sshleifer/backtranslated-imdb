I must admit that I am a big fan of South Park and Basketball waiting to be funny, but not nearly as good as it turned out! I think that's what happens when you mix Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker together. This film has so much replay value and at any point interfere to take itself seriously. Slap stick humor style mixed with stone and Parker just works flawlessly. humor species is present in basketball was not popular at the time of its release, and it was to go out today it will be a hit. Do not try to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and waiting for endless laughs to come. It recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor.
