Although I did not read the "Classic" in the literature, until I was 47, it's never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because it is not part of the book, which I liked less, only part I liked. 1983 TV mini series with ZIL Clarke and Timothy Dalton was everything I hoped it would be. I saw it as a feature film in 2006, Dalton «Mr. Rochester "was very good, but I absolutely loved the ZIL on" Jane Eyre. " Relecting another film «Classics» I've seen lately, I was disappointed in the production, direction and dialogue. He was loyal only to greed and arrogance of Hollywood. Artistic license to the great works of literature is nothing but a plagiarism. Using the title after such a license is a fraud. Leave it to the British to get this one right (among others). You can not read a book without worrying about film with its proper context and spirit. Well done BBC.
