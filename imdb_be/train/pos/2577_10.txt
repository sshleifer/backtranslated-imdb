My father grew up grew up watching George Reeves as Superman, and when I was a small child, he had episodes on VHS and let me see them including this film (passing them in the family, if you will), and I loved it. <, Br /> <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small town with the oil and mine and the mine is the mole men radioactive and covered by the city is considered a mortal, and it's up to Superman to stop this lawlessness. <, Br /> <br /> It's just so cool and interesting to see. Old-style special effects and sound - the crew took such beauty with a little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a little kid, and I'm 16 now, it just goes to show how timeless and classic, these adventures.
