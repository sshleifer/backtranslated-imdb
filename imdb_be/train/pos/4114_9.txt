The name of this movie does not make much sense until you see it in action, because it is the sound that makes the retarded young man while he works his apparent truck, which is what he does all day. And he's just one of the many odd characters in this surreal and time, the tragic tale of a group of slum dwellers in Japan. <br /> <br /> There are two drunkard selling a wife, there are people with aspirations to be an architect, and his young son, which he sends to beg for food. There's a wise old man, who seems to be a pillar of common sense in everything that is happening around him, and there is a businessman with some serious nervous tics, who has a wife who sees it (and everyone else) in the dirt. <br /> <br /> There is no particular story to this, in fact, a bunch of stories that drift back and forth, sometimes funny between each other, sometimes tragic. In general, I thought he worked very well, and I'm dying to see it for a long time only on the basis of its description. I am not in the least disappointed, and I would definitely recommend it. 9 of 10.
