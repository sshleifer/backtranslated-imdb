I saw the dirty work several times, and probably my favorite Stan and Ollie short. <br /> <br /> In this, Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and get a job to clean the chimney in the house of Professor Noodle (Lucien Littlefield). While noodles are doing crazy experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos, trying to clear tube and make a mess of the living room. End where Olli enters the tank to a special formula, which uses Noodles for their experiments, and it turns him into a chimpanzee! The best part, where Olli falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head, but he does not seem to suffer much from the pain. <br /> <br /> Dirty Work Stan and Oli in them laugh. Great fun <br /> <br /> Rating :. 5 stars out of 5.
