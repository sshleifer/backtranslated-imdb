What was always short Matrix story, all came to be in the real world. Do not say anything, because this part of the story covers most of the base. What was really interesting, as it was a political, perhaps even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things people could think of in relation to the fight against the robotic hordes that meant nothing more than the servant of humanity. What I found interesting was the use of fear and how it was immortalized by the idea of ​​the unknown. We, as people tend to fall into this trap often, allowing the lack of logic and thinking ahead of ourselves, because people can not believe the contrary. Well presented and put together, it is a real demonstration of how illogical people can be.
