There's no director I like more than Mamoru Oshii. But, unfortunately, despite the fact that he had sent a lot of films that have received huge international attention, there is still a sizable some of his films released through the crack. Tachiguishi is one of them, and although I loved him to pieces, it is not difficult to understand why some distributors in the West reluctant to release him. <br /> <br /> In between the big and serious films, Asia, as you know, do some small projects and quirkier. While Tachiguishi determined falls into this category, Asia has really outdone themselves with this, creating something that is very difficult to classify as quaint Japanese film. Go figure it out. <br /> <br /> At its core lies the documentary is not entirely unlike Otaku no Video. But instead of making fools of existing subculture, Asia invent their life and go deep into the culinary heroes, stealing away the free rides and defending Japanese culinary level. Hosea's approach on this issue has a close relationship with Dai-Nipponjin, as an object is treated with a deadly sense of gravity while the images on the screen look as ridiculous as it may be. Calm humor carried to extremes. <br /> <br /> But this is not all, and not just shooting his mockumentary Hosea decided to do it with a new visual technique baptized superlivemation. A strange mix of live action, pictures, digital animation and puppets on a stick. constructed and operated (or correct, if you want) on the big men of the Japanese animation industry, however, since the project was supposed to be a low-budget, as far as possible. <br /> <br /> And if you think that about covers it, know that the film is very dialogue heavy, making it a good companion piece for innocence. Influence Grifters analyzed from all kinds of cultural, political and even philosophical point of view, burnt to the audience through a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues. And to make it even worse, the whole film is entirely based on real history and customs of Japan, making it even more difficult for a foreigner to get a good grip on the material. Needless to say, several views are advised to make the best out of all the details are hidden within the film. <br /> <br /> However, at the conceptual level, the film is easy to follow and quite fun. Various Grifters introduced as they were the most influential historical figures war Japan. The film plays like one would expect serious documentaries any other important figures to unfold, but somehow big and rough animated expression photo limbs which figures are collected not quite make it all that seriously. A range of characters entered sublime, Shinji Higuchi taking the cake in the form of a cow creature wearing a nose ring, taking on fast food with his gang bull / man. <br /> <br /> Hosea regular Kenji Kawai provides, moreover, a rather comic performance rating in the range of atmospheric and dark to the silly, strange and funny. Fun to be obtained from the exaggeration of noise and effects, adding animation and completely contrary to the rest of the film tonnes. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is very atmospheric, although I must say that the animation is very small, and while effective, is softened only to burst in hyperactivity quirks time to time. But it is not bad seeing as Tachiguishi so serious dialogue. Despite this, the film is still a visual masterpiece, each frame looks absolutely gorgeous and is designed to fit and improve the overall atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Beware, though, because Tachiguishi does require a lot from the viewer, if you do not speak Japanese, there is a lot of reading to be done, and there are many cultural references that require attention. In addition, in the field of movie monologues rather extended and can be difficult to follow. The film is still not enough English subtitles and although my French was pretty much enough to get what it was all, I'm sure I missed a lot of the subtleties of the film. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi not easy to film there, but around halfway through it reaches full steam and not let out. I still hope to see it again, with an English or Dutch submarine. Dub is actually better for a film like this (as well as the container), although I believe that the quality of the anime dub a little too much to ask. <br /> <br /> With all of this said, I can only congratulate Hosea on another beautiful film. It's rare to find a movie that mixes and blends are so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and is still working. The film is intelligent, looks and sounds great and is filled to the brim with creativity. It's very funny, even if you can not catch all the details on the first viewing. But rest assured, at least, is worthy to receive the submarine as automated translation into English, floating there is absolutely worthless and does not make the film entirely fair at all. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi caters to a very specific audience, and I'm not surprised the French got their release while the rest of Europe (and the rest of the Western world) are still waiting for a sign this film. But for those who, like Hosea, appreciate dry humor and calm and eager to creative spirits, this is a film not to be missed, although it may just snapped. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
