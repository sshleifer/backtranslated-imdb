Matthew McConaughey mysterious man waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims that the information about a serial killer pursued by the FBI. If Doyle agent arrives in the office, he tells him that serial killer did his dead brother. Agent Doyle asks some of the evidence, and the man tells about his life, from his childhood. They were just a family of three: his widow Meiks father (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father collects two brothers and tells them that an angel of God had just visited him and ordered his family to destroy demons. What happens next is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this film four months ago on VHS, and yesterday I looked again now on DVD. While being a low-budget film, the script is sharp, without blemish. The cast is outstanding, but I would like to emphasize the performance of Matt O'Leary as a young Felton. This is a very difficult and challenging role that will perform a teenager. The direction of Bill Paxton is excellent. There is no explicit violence in this horror film. Big debut behind the camera. I'm sorry, the Brazilian title of the film: "MAO do DiaboÂ» (Devil's Hand '). If at least, it was "God's hand", this may be acceptable. But calling this film as "the devil's hand" is really funny. Brent Hanley, screenwriter, does not deserve such disrespect from the Brazilian distributor. It is recommended to use this film. . My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "MAO do Diabo" ( "The Devil's Hand")
