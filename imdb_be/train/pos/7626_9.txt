I loved this film since I first saw it in 1979, I am still amazed at how accurately reflects Kurt Russell Elvis until he moves and the expression on his face. Sometimes it is scary as it looks, acts and speaks like the real Elvis. Fortunately, it is now released on DVD, so that all of us who have been waiting for, finally, may have a different version of a full-length film. I heard detractors, who say that there are some inaccuracies, or some things left, but I think that having in mind that John Carpenter was only about 2 1/2 hours to work, and it was shown on television (only two years after the death of Elvis!), he did a good job with it. In fact, I did not see another movie Elvis, that even comes close to this. Highly recommended.
