I found this film is available for streaming on Netflix, and thought I'd give it a try. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt), who finally saw each other after their father died. Ryan and Theo at first arguing about who did what. But later, Theo learns that his brother Ryan is not only gay, but he's dying from an incurable disease. Thus, Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences. <br /> <br /> This is such an incredible film. I just saw Koly Fiori in the 24-season, but he was phenomenal in this. David Cubitt, an actor I've never heard of before did a phenomenal job as well. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it for anyone interested in the gay and lesbian genre. This is one movie that you do not want to miss. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. A great movie!
