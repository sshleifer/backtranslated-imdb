Most people who have seen the film said that it is the best film ever made. I do not agree, but this film is very, very good. Tony is a bad guy ass, and knows that he is terrible, and uses it to get ahead. It's about him and how he goes from washing dishes to having a huge house and office with cocaine all over the table. If you want a family film, it is not the way, but if you want the mafia and revenge and the like that then you will enjoy.
