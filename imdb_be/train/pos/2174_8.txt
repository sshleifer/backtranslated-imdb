I think I really love this movie. «Prix de Beauté" was originally a silent film, but was later dubbed into French in 1930. Despite the voice of someone else dubbed over it, it's still a stunning tour de force by Louis Brooks. The fact that her singing voice voiced by the legendary Edith Piaf helps calm us purists about dubbing deception. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and the first time we see her at the resort with his manly guy, Andre (Georges Charlia) and their friends Antonina (Augusto Bandini). Lulu comes in the frame as a pair of legs: we see it in the car changing into her bathing suit. Lula is very free showing her body, and it's not good to sit with the annoying Andre. If Lula considers the use of the title "Miss Europe", we know that a happy ending is not to sit at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a lot of focus on men ogling beautiful women. We see a lot of bathing beauties and reactions of men looking at them. But in the middle of all this is an excellent Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind watching films from past eras, and then consider checking it. Louise Brooks is not a name that most of the middle film buffs can easily know, but once you see it you will be charmed, and you want to know more. Also check it in "Pandora's Box", if you can find it. <br /> <br /> Be careful with the US Kino DVD release. I do not know if their velocity projection is correct. Many scenes seem to be shown at too high a speed. Perhaps it was the way they were shot. I do not know. But since this is the only way to see this film, it's worth swallowing that one little pill.
