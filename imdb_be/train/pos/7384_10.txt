Whoopi was the only reason I watched the Oscars this year. She's funny. Of course, it was one of the main serious side of the show. It was great not only because it was funny, but because it says some things that needed to be said in a public forum. White people need to remember that the rites, employment and representation Hollywood Awards' is WAY to racially balance. There should be no need for "black" awards show. White bread, shy and judges offering the candidate must bring their heads in the sun and see that a lot of material is not limited to "white" directors, producers, actors, etc. ALLOWING Woody Allen air depth bad taste. He had no business to be there. The fact that this is the first presentation of the Oscar I watched from the time of «The Color Purple» was for the awards. This miscarriage voting not soured me to watch the show until 2002, which is not to denigrate the other speakers. Billy Crystal riot.
