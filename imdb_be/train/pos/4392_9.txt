I enjoyed this film very much.Tobey Maguire gives a stunning performance as Jake. He must be one of the best actors I've seen. And I was surprised that so many comic lines throughout the film. He was very good at it, too, although I've never seen him put the comic line before. The film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all. I did not know what to expect from the implementation Jewel, but I think she did pretty good. Exciting a plurality of scenes. Thoroughly good ride. I am absolutely a fan of Maguire years. Check winemakers rules. One is constantly the best ever.
