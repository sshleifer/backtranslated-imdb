This is one of the finest episodes of Dark Zone, with some funny dialogue and interesting characters to take the pressure off some terrible moments. There is the usual blonde vamp "dancer" (that Serling's love for this kind of character, such that it continues to appear in various episodes?) And various other characters, but it is the "old man" Jack E, which completely dwarfs I I think it's funny, light-hearted version of "Monsters Subject Maple Street" - or perhaps a parody «The Thing» a 20-minute Twilight Zone. On another note: I thought that the young lover episode can be someone, who eventually went on to other things - he looked familiar - but it seems to me that "Ron Kipling" disappeared after only two television credits to his name.
