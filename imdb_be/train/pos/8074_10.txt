Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is poor as anyone on Earth. Life in 1920s Ireland, Gypo and his fellow Irishmen are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive British. One particular rebel, wanted for the murder of the British, he came back to town secretly. He thinks he can trust his friend gypo, but the reward is Â£ 20 is too attractive. Gypo gets his friend killed, and plunged into a pit of despair and drunkenness. At the same time, other Irish rebels seeking informant. Immediately, gypo, a hole burning in your pocket money is their main suspects, but they are, who his friends are, do not want to believe. History widgets just the plot, but complex in its moral and emotional problems. This is easily one of the most emotionally involving John Ford films. What Gypo did wrong, but we can certainly understand his motives. We also understand the nature of his miserable, and there is a lot of sympathy that arises for him. The script is very alarming as well. This kind of uncertainty, where we're pretty sure we know how things will end, so we have to grit your teeth and bear with it. Act fine. Victor McLaglen, acted in many films, Ford probably gave his best performance here (and won an Oscar for it). Any other artist in the film deserves his or her prestige. Attached to the amazing script and actions Informant is one of the most expressionist films of John Ford. I love the dark side of Ford. In his mood, and his topics informant reminds me of two of my favorite films of Ford, The Long Way Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); it also looks a bit like The Grapes of Wrath (1940) in this regard. 10/10.
