My 3 year old loves it. I loved it, my wife loved it. Thus, 10 out of 10 of our family. As for the level of violence? Not really, that violence, mainly because of the variety of buffoonery. No one really dies, no gore, no blood, no torture, so, of course, suitable for children, much more than many Saturday morning cartoons. <br /> <br /> This film really takes the idea of ​​CG movies where he should go. <br /> <br /> First of all, beautiful graphics, fine texture made with real depth, not trying to be realistic, but forming an artistic whole. Moss on the stones, rust on metal reliefs in wood and stone, all adds to the whole. <br /> <br /> modeling characters, unlike many of today's CG films, quirky, cute sun, again in an artistic whole. Individuals may look less pliable than some other films, but a puppet characters like than human-like. I think that is a good thing, it gives the truth, strange as it may seem easier to suspend disbelief. <br /> <br /> hair, fur, clothing, on one level at least, with the Pixar's, just look at the initial stages, when Lian-Chu is fighting a giant slug; Gwizdo is in front of some of the farmers, and they detail the clothes, forced me to pause the movie to admire them. <br /> <br /> Settings. Far beyond these cars, and even the walls ?? E. The space has been done many times, but the fancy neighborhood of Dragon Hunters is comparable only with some scenes in history and the Infinite Lord of the Rings, but again it is an artistic whole, and with lots of good ideas thrown about easily. Excellent prospects, both on the scene in Monsters Inc., where they ride all the doorways through storage or wall ?? E, where we see a huge waste of the tower, he did have a lot in this film, more and more, but never lived in; it's just the background all the way! Interlude, where they pass through the area with fantastic waterfalls. Wall, islands floating in the sky. Broccoli in the sky? This is really where I think, CG has to go, to do what is breathtaking, and do it again and again. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music is diverse and not only epic, and, fortunately, not any vocals, and purely for the original movie. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. Lending his inspiration in cartoons, especially good use of stretch and squeeze. Sometimes it is not realistic, but the 3d model is not realistic any. <br /> <br /> The characteristic is well made too. Lian-Chu delicate and uncertain giant is gradually growing in confidence is bathed in the attention a little Zoé. <br /> <br /> Gwizdo wily manager Lian-Chu redeems himself in the end, while the ESR not changed very much at all, but who wants that cute baby to change anyway? At least I loved Lian-Chu, more than any other recent character, as Sulley Monsters Inc. <br /> <br /> Infighting in the group receives the smoothed by an external pressure, as well as it should be in the correct fantasy stories. <br /> <br /> in the history mainly it resembles a never ending story, especially the way the world brake apart. Monsters fairly standard, except for one flock. It lacks the emotional impact of the wall ?? E, which is a really strong point of the film, but it's a lot more riding pleasure and not enough annoying music scene replaying in the former, and shall have effect from the first scene. This movie is what you want to watch a fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> The entire film is, as I have already mentioned the whole concept, which seems to be strictly followed throughout. <br /> <br /> it seems that the machine is ready for more adventure, and I, for one, hope so. <br /> <br /> One side note, the French actor makes Lian-Chu sounded a little like Jean Reno first, but I'm glad it's not him, though he is one of my favorites. . Nice to hear new, to me, the voice <br /> <br /> I give it a rating of Max, a little surprised at the mediocre and low ratings of some; I was trying to solve some of the problems made by the two surveys with the least votes. The approach of this film as an adventure and as a European cinema, not against Hollywood, but different.
