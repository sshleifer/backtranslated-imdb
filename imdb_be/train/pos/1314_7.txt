If a small town is threatened by a child murderer, a police woman goes after him, pretending to be his friend. As it becomes more and more emotionally involved with the murderer of her psyche starts to take a beating, causing her to lose focus on the work to catch the criminal. Not a film of high voltage excitation, but the tough job of the police and the good image of a psychotic mental defective loser.
