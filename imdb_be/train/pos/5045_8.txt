The film is very full, in which he is, keeping a constant interest flashback to childhood and continues to grow with such a bizarre father, and interspersing it with the tails of the serial murders, one simply can not go wrong. The very plot itself, the very essence of the story and the film entertains. This kind of story that the director (Bill Paxton) could do so much, and in this case he did do a lot with it. <br /> <br /> From start to finish you kept advancing more and more about what is happening and where the film will be, and work that is behind the story in the first class. I felt as if this film was exquisitely done from beginning to end, and one of those rare gems that, seemingly without any unfortunate lull - the action flows accurately, quickly and firmly from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> It shows how far people can go: so to do such horrible things to their loved ones, and to do such acts of evil in the name of "God" when they were disappointed in this case. In addition, it is sometimes interesting in its twists and takes on the concept of morality in general. <br /> <br /> In general, this kind of film that one is easy to open, but I would recommend you do not do the same thing and check out this movie with - it is very much so worth your time.
