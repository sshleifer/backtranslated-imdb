This supernatural thriller Peter Weir is truly one of the most fascinating and exciting films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain does his best work here as an Australian lawyer who defended a group of young Aboriginal people, who are charged with murder. When he is getting closer on the case, he discovers more about the main defendant, Chris, and last but not least about himself. Chris says that he is Mulkurul, which seems to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, unusually high rainfall, seems to confirm aboriginal prophecy about the coming of the last wave, the one that will drown the world. <br /> <br /> dream sequences and supernatural effects to enhance the film and make it an exciting experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil steadfast in supporting roles, as well as the head of the difficult name who plays Charlie, an old Aborigin, which can turn into an owl. The culmination and ending not disappointing, unlike many other supernormal thriller which become flat after promising hour or so. However, this can not be called pure thriller. This drama, as well as talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. Masterful work of Peter Weir, Master visually stunning drama.
