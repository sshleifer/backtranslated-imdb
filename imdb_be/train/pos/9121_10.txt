SPOILERS having to make an observation. <br /> <br /> In the twenty years since 1984, this film tells about Prince freight future in the music industry. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that sums up the musical production of the prince for the last 10 years is fine, which, if you took the best two songs of the last 10 albums that you have a fantastic album! <br /> <br /> scene plays like this. Prince runs away in his dressing room after the game one song and the owner of the club comes into the locker room to give the prince a scolding about his fall from grace during the 90s and simmer albums, only the most dedicated fans would be able to tolerate and maintain his skill. <br /> <br /> Club owner- «you do not packs them like you used to. the only person who digs your music is you! »<br /> <br /> Spooky yes! How about a musical underscore, making Prince even more angry when he gives Apollonius on the ground in two separate scenes! This gave me the creeps, it is not only women, the scene where ill-treated in this film. <br /> <br /> I'm all for comedy sparring between the day of Morris and Jerome Benton, these two steal every scene they were in. but what was funny about the woman threw in the trash? It was just disgusting! Another bad bit was the chalk outline on the floor of the prince's father thoughtfully provided police Minnieapolis, which leads to the prince to go more crazy !! FANTASTIC !! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is an entertaining film as a whole, as the soundtrack Prince songs, which increases its cost by 110%. But then again, the film gives us another theory on the Prince and his music, as the film tells us that the greatest song Prince film is written by Wendy, Lisa and the Princess wife beating musical parents! <br /> <br /> And the prince and the creators of the film trying to tell us that the prince stole all their best songs from his father after his father found a letter written musical songs? Maybe that's why the prince began to run out of steam during the 90s because he had exhausted his father ideas ??? ........... hmmm .....
