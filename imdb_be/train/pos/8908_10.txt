Firstly, I have not seen "The Drop," since I was 7 or 8, and considering it as an adult was an incredible experience. Pages can be written on its influence on horror movies, even today. And more could be written on his social commentary, from the 50s, "the fear of teenagers." But it's just a small story about interplanetary horror still damn good horror film, if you let it be. <br /> <br /> Of course, it looks bad as all get in our modern world. But «The Blob» packages in some really scary moments, a group of children to monitor irresistible creature when the adults do not believe them. In fact, there are even some pretty bleak moments in his candy-colored world. And Steve McQueen gives a lot more than the story deserves on paper that we, the audience really caught up in the moment and believe in him. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you can take off the postmodern irony of the filter, there is much more to love than meets the eye.
