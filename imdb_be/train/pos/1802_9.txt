Well, I saw this film as a child and loved it. My parents never bought the movie for me, but I think I'll go and buy it now. I am a lover of 2,000 animated films. In any case, the actual review <br /> <br /> What I liked :. It was an actual image of heaven and hell, one of the few I've seen in animated films. Character development there! It is easy to classify the characters in this film (ie:. Charlie selfish dog, Itchy cynical, but believes that Charlie, Carface, obviously, a ruthless villain, etc.). I also loved the song Gator King in. I've always loved the loud, annoying, shocking guys. This song may be accidental, but it was so much fun. And finally, part animation was beautiful. You might say, Charlie was rough and stuff and backgrounds were excellent <br /> <br /> What I DO NOT LIKE :. The actual image of the sky: The Way Charlie responded to him, "no surprises whatsoever," did it actually seems to be very sad. He denied a place in the sky and still have to return to it in the end. I remember a few lines of some of the songs, such as "... you can not keep a good dog down", "... let the music forever," and "... welcome to be dead," but I can not remember most of all . of these songs were not so catchy, to be honest Whippet angel. She's annoying and neck !! aUGH <br /> <br /> What can parents do not like: Some very scary (depending on the viewer) hell image Set during the film. Carface quite threatening. beer also has in mind, but in reality does not correspond with the beer. gambling is Xia a key element in the film. A good guy dies <br /> <br /> The total :. I love this movie, even if it's a bit forgotten at times. dreaded childhood animation is always my favorite. It was created at a time when manufacturers and the authors are not afraid to give the kids a little scared now and then. at the present time, it would probably be a PG rating. children under the age of 8 (or easily disturbed children) do not have to look at it. In addition, I give it a 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
