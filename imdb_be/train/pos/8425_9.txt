In the end, I watched these episodes in 2008, and I had to constantly go back and check, when they were actually produced. They are absolutely terrible that they did a spot on the satisfaction of knowing what will happen in the future. Or Parker and Stone have lived in Texas and was a witness to the idiocy of Bush or they Govan these strange, terrible people who pay attention to things. Boo, scary! bro invasion Bush White House fraternity, dressed as Arabs wielding rifles? Bush has "accidentally" someone performs? (No, wait. It is a kind of do it as gov.) This may sound like a sitcom rejection at the time, but must now be considered brilliant when ghost foresight.
