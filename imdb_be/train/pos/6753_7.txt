Preminger noir classic works almost like a downside LAURA ... while this film was tasteless and features a high F-fix Clifton Webb, this film is much seamier. Dana Andrews is less good cop who accidentally kills a man, only to have it potentially pinned to the girl's father, whom he loves. Preminzher keeps things moving in a short clip, so that failures in the logic is easy to overlook. Andrews pretty good (much less wood than it was in the past) and the stunningly beautiful Gene Tierney stunningly beautiful! Terrible Craig Stevens plays the unfortunate victim. Where the sidewalk ends must see and a stunning companion pieces equally terrible WHIRLPOOL Preminger (also starring Tierney).
