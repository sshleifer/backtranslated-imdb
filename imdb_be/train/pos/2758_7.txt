This film about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a person with Down syndrome. <br /> <br /> The development of character in this film perfectly. We get to believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and Georges innocent man who craves love and care from "normal" society. Duties of the fine, and was awarded the best actor in Cannes deservedly so. <br /> <br /> fantasy scenes in the film highlights the fact that Georges suffering to his rejection by his family, and his desire to be treated like a normal person. The song, which is played several times and confirm the message. The film shows that people who are mentally disabled are good. We are treating them with discrimination and neglect, that is highlighted in the scene where George gives a gift to the waitress in the kitchen). If we understand and share the world of these people, and we, and the mentally disabled can be very happy. <br /> <br /> I was so drawn into the film and emotional experiences of the characters. This touching film for good-natured soul.
