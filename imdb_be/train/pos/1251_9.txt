This documentary explores the history covered in the last book pilger "Freedom Next TimeÂ», which was published in 2006 reveals the shocking expulsion of the indigenous inhabitants of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. <br /> <br /> the islanders are technically citizens of the UK, and Diego Garcia is a British colony, as well as Mauritius, the neighboring island where the natives were exiled before. But the British government ignored their requests to return home, since the island is now a military base for the United States Army, which used it as a base for bombing Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> As usual, pilger coverage is shocking, especially when he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the survivors of the islanders. His interviews all round great, and his turn Parliament representative, where he uses his own information the government to pin it down, is ranked as one of his best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction dissect series recently released documents, which fully cover the British plot to evict the natives. Weave this footage of interviews and music islanders really increases the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> This is not just watching, but "The theft of the nation" by John Pilger at its best. Recommended.
