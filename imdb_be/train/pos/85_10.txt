I saw this film while at Birmingham Southern College in 1975, when it was shown in conjunction with a red balloon. Both films are similar to their dream-like quality. The main part of the film entails a fish that swims happily in his bowl, and its new owner, the little boy away at school. A cat walks into a room, where the fish and his cup is, and begins to carefully pursue his "prey." The boy begins his walk home from school, and the audience is asked whether he would arrive in time to save his friend the fish. Fish becomes agitated by the presence of a cat, and finally jumps out of the cup! The cat quickly comes to fish, gently lifts up his paws, and returns it in a bowl. The boy returned to his happy fish nor wiser. <br /> <br /> ending is not surprising, in his irony and his technical complexity. It is difficult to imagine how the director could have pulled an engineering feat in 1959 - it seems to be more gimmick in 2003 <br /> <br /> If you can find it, watch it - you will not be disappointed! And if you * really * find, let me know so that I can get a copy too!
