Addictive potential loser male hustler in New York forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled fraudsters. Extremely bleak study of contemporary moral and social decline, very well directed by John Schlesinger (who never topped his work here) and superbly acted by John Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Packs quite a punch as a whole, is still "fantasy" scene - some of which plays into giggles - a little intrusive as "fashion" party drugs. The relationship that develops between the two men sentimental, but the filmmakers careful not to get soft and it gives a picture of the edge could not be with less than director Schlesinger. Originally X-rated in 1969, and the winner Oskara`; screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted the book of James Leo Herilhy), and Schlesinger also won the statue. *** 1/2 ****
