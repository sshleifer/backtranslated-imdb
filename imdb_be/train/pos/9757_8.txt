Richard Willaims animation is God. It was difficult in directing the film producer. The final product is very uneven film with a very complicated story, but some strange moments of animation (for example, Emery Hawkins 'Greedy'). Repeating music Joe Raposo does not help. It was done in a wide screen, so that the VHS does not show the entire his glory, let us hope Letterboxed DVD ever. Nevertheless, it is worth looking at some terrible animation.
