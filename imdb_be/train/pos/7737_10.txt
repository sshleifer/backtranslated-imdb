If you, as a huge fan of the author, I, Jim Thompson, it can be quite complicated if their product is converted into a film. This is not the case with the implementation of Scott Foley with after dark candy May. The suspenseful, sexy noir classics, which closely monitors and does most justice to the original text. Jason Patric and Rachel Ward to give the best possible performance of his career. And always phenomenal Bruce Dern, perhaps even Toped herself to him with it. As Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and surreal world where passion overcomes logic and double cross is never far under the arm. A must see for all fans of the great film noir. **** !!!
