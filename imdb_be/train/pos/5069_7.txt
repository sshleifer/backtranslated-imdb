The film is more about Pony than Great Gray Owl. It's also about the Aborigines, Canada, English, aunts and great gray owl North Bi nugget. A wonderful story. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, more like a book that raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values. The key scene Gray Owl admits his deception in Pony and her reaction. <br /> <br /> A few notes on user ratings. Please note that the user ratings are bipolar clustering 5 and 7; it is not for everyone, but it has a strong following. This film is undervalued and lose sight of, but will be seen for years to come. In addition, some women were watching a movie, but they estimate it higher than that of men. Was he correct in the market? <br /> <br />
