I watched this movie without knowing anything about it at all and found it seems thematically Billy Elliot (2000). Both films are based around the unfortunate relationship father / son. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their hometown. Both sons faced ridicule from her classmates, and both have a strong female role model who teaches them. <br /> <br /> The main difference I found between the films that October Sky was much more interesting and touching film. Laura Dern put in a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays a disapproving father very well, as he continued to do in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his fine direction, very different from his other directorial functions such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
