It has been so many years since I've seen it, but I feel compelled to protect the stone against those who criticize him. <br /> <br /> It is interesting and unusual to observe a variety of opinions here. That's what humor is, I suppose. It is subjective. This is either charged via your funny bone at 60,000 volts or leaves you cold and wondering why you gave him time. <br /> <br /> This show is some of the best comedians in the history of the UK put together, it's silly and irreverent and hilarious outcome. Dialogue and visual comedy beautifully delivered, and two wire (Cleese and Lowe) perfect together. This was done for them. <br /> <br /> I can not say more, except to beg you to find it and watch. You will not be disappointed and in a world where there was no noble sense of humor, this is a classic part of the meaningless and harmless comedy shine.
