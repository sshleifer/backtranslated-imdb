It is one in which a miniature Ruth Gordon plays a type of Agatha Christi secret author of the murder, closes her nephew by marriage in the safe. Gordon believes that he killed his niece and a young man died from suffocation, while Gordon goes back and forth to New York. He manages, however, to leave some clues, scratches on a pair of black safes and homemade and well hidden note. Columbo included in the case, suspects her immediately, and solves the mystery simply by using their supernatural mystical intuition. Oh, and Mariette Hartley's arm as Secretary Gordon and potential blackmailers. Hartley, I think Skinner's granddaughter psychologist. I'm not sure that its origins had nothing to do with its attractive navel, which is on display during a sequence of belly dance, but I've always admired Skinner anyway. <br /> <br /> The killing of a well-handled. It's a good story, and none of the performers or crew members not beating anything. But the outstanding figure here Ruth Gordon, just skosh more than five feet. She was older than 80 years old and looked it up. There are times when it is almost balanced, but she always exudes charm. Her acting is special. You can never be sure if it is serious or if it puts Columbo and spectators. She gave a few good lines, too. What humor there is comes from Gordon. Columbo does not have any of his frequent comic moments. <br /> <br /> In general, a good job for all interested parties.
