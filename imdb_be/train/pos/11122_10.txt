When we started to watch this episode on cable, I had no idea how addictive it is. Even if you hate the character, you have to hold back because they are so beautifully developed, you can almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed and temptation, as they do. It's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of the curves Christopher training. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why Adriana will put up with Christopher its abuse, verbally, physically and emotionally, but I just read the newspaper to see how many women may tolerate such behavior. Carmella has a dream house, an infinite number of expensive things, but I'm sure it'll give him love and faithful husband - or maybe not. That's why I'm looking. <br /> <br /> It does not matter how many times you watch an episode, you can find what you missed the first five times. We even watch episodes of their sequence (watch season 1 to the late night advertising, but the whole language, A & E with the censors language, repetition of Movie Network) - every time they we're there. We were completely spoiled at the moment. <br /> <br /> I also love Malaprop years. "Albacore around my neck," my favorite Johnny Boy. If these values ​​are entered our family vocabulary, it's a sign that I should get a life. I will, if the series comes to an end, and I collected all DVD, and put a collection of my own.
