I «Breaking Glass» first seen when it was released in England in 1980..I loved her and then just caught him in August 2005 at the Canadian station is still large. The only thing I'm sorry, I can not find the audio track or DVD in stores ?? ... Or anyone shed some light, or do I have to order it from some overpriced Internet companies. But back to the film music stands up to the test of time, yellow / Kate had something to say about the 80-Britain..actually it was the same decade I moved to Canada for some of the same reasons of which is «Thatcher» and that it It is making in the country at the time. Please, if you get the opportunity to watch this film you will not regret!
