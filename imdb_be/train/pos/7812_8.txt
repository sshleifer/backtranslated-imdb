Long film about a very important character of South Africa, Steve Biko. He's one of these Negroes, do not survive apartheid, which are actually dead long before their normal time. Already an old movie, although it does not show how important Biko was that it really represented. His life and teaching is reduced to small, at best, a few witty remarks. The film is a task was set in 1987, to push South Africa for the line, which will lead her to freedom. Thus, the film aims to show how irrational South African proponents of apartheid in 1987, to show this film should look after Biko's death, so the center of his speech is not about Biko, but on a white liberal journalist and escape the absurd system in which he lives. His escape is made necessary because of the persecution he is the victim, along with his family, because he wants to publish the first book on Biko, after his death, and this can only happen in England. The film shows the way to flee to South Africa, while apartheid is still standing and kill. So do not wait so as to be realistic and true. It could not be. But the film is extremely age, because it does not show to South Africa with any historical distancing itself distancing that took place under the chairmanship of Nelson Mandela, and that is called forgiveness, provided those who want to be forgiven and to speak. The film is a powerful and emotional, but it's very historic limit makes it pretty weak today, even more so that the film does not mention the third-racial community, the Indians. Praiseworthy books or movies all have that defect: they look at the person they are supposed to be a portrait with only one point of view. This explains why the film at the age of so much, it seems, comes from so long ago, as if nothing had changed. Remake necessary. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Panth√©on Sorbonne, University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, Cegid
