This is a movie for entertainment; I do not think the world has made social commentary with a short film. I personally believe that this film is funny, bold and memorable. This is a fantasy not unlike the cinder girl becomes a princess. This film was made very well, I might add, in the 70th year, the best time of experimentation in film with noted human sexuality. This film is not about a person being a homosexual or not, but about love, it's all strange forms. This film does show some of the realities of being gay in the 70s in Hollywood, or in California. Pretty boys looked after the older men are not so nice. Women who were to remain closed deep in the emotional closet or risk not having a career. The baths were an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> Then the fantasy begins !! Let's mix with lesbian gay, and add the liqueur and what do we have? Well, this film, which is in any case better than the dull repetition of «The Next Big Thing». Perhaps someone had to ask the crew to see this movie and then try to do better. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the 70s and still brings a smile to my lips now. I heartily recommend to anyone who wants a funny, tender film curl up with some popcorn and have fun. Some people need to light up !!! And this is a movie, you have to do it with! <br /> <br />
