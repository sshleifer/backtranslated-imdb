Although in recent years the presentation of the epic "Troy" with Brad Pitt Homer was interesting once, "Iphigenia" with Irene Papas hot breathtaking. Unfolding in a natural setting of the Greek actors speaking their own language gives such authenticity. A chance meeting with this film on one of the many cinema DirecTV's kept me interested, in spite of my trouble concentrating channels. There's no glitter or "toys" in this movie, just incredibly rich history told by the actors so perfectly real one feels they overhear a real family at bay. I think that even Homer, if he really existed, would have been proud of that history. <br /> <br /> JLH
