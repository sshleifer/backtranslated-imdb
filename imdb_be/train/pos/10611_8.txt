That another reviewer called the lack of character development, I call humiliation. The film does not hit one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary prehistory. Yes, there were a lot of names of the stories we've only got a glimpse, but it is above all one day snapshot in case catalyzed changes in all life heroes. Henry Thomas's performance was truly remarkable study in the power of action, which focuses on reaction rather than action. Good rental.
