Wow. What a wonderful film. The script is almost perfectly looks like it's the only film written Minglun Wei, I hope he has a great history to it. <br /> <br /> action sublime. Renying Zhou, like a dog was amazing - very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a delight - very believable as a jaded old traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective, directing, without being overwhelming. <br /> <br /> When only more films were made, like this or in Hollywood or Hong Kong-family vacation, well acted, well written, well directed, near perfect gem.
