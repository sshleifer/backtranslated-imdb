I was fascinated by this touching and funny film, not to mention surprised. I was also surprised to find that the voice of Paulie was made Jay Mohr. The play was so subtle nuances or vibrational sentimental and does not become too hard under the swagger of New Jersey, I thought it must be some undetected old pro, not baby-faced Mr. Moore. Very impressive results, in fact, and it's nice to see that his talents are being taken seriously in a series of unusual, indie films.
