A true classic. Beautifully filmed and acted. It reveals the Paris area, which is alive and full of comedy and tragedy. Although the area «Hotel Du Nord» and the hotel itself still exists, it is not gay (in the original sense of the word) and joyful as it was once supposed to be. The film makes to miss the past that has been lost, with a sigh and bittersweetness.
