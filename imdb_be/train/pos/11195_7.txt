The name has many meanings - a boxing ring, where differences and resentment fought, wedding ring, where Mabel feels trapped and Jack feels that his problems will be over and cause trouble, rings, like a bracelet, which Bill gives Mabel as a sign of love. <br /> <br /> The former professional boxer, Danish Carl Brisson, got his start in films by Alfred Hitchcock in "The Ring".
