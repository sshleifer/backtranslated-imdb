EUROPA (Zentropa) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that should come to the birth narrative of the film is almost a hundred years ago. This film is truly unique and brilliant. Camerawork and editing genius, and in conjunction with the narrative paths of alienation used in the film, it creates an awesome and unforgettable cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> part Suwkowa Barbara and Eddie Constantine is in the cast are two guilty pleasures, which are to be seen and enjoyed. Max von Sydow delivers his loud voice as the narrator. <br /> <br /> A one of a kind movie! Four stars (the highest rating).
