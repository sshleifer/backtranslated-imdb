Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston, I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie. I mean that conceptual nightmare. Jim Carrey plays God? Nothing is sacred anymore. <br /> <br /> Well, the film is hardly a saint, but this is not sacrilegious, at least not to any significant degree. So, Jim Carrey has the power of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I'll give you the low-down. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter, who fell to his success and felt extremely unfortunate with his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Aniston), and you can tell immediately that they love each other, but the relationship on a fairly shaky ground. <br /> <br /> Then, Bruce gets a shot at television presenter, only to have it stolen secretly Evan Baxter. Apparently, no, please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the TV in a way that is comical, and certainly worthy of getting him fired. <br /> <br /> A lot of griping and complaining about God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of her calling, so he says, and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the boss, electrician and janitor of the building. I found it very amusing. God Boss, Electricians Holy Spirit, and Jesus Christ Janitor. Think about it. Boss, obviously. Electricians, the guy who keeps everything running. Janitor, the guy who cleans the mess that the world is gone. BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Bruce a little skeptical about what actually met God, but if God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a chance to play God, he starts to believe a little bit. I wonder why. Enter a flagrant abuse of office for personal gain and blame the enemy. <br /> <br /> Since this is Hollywood, Bruce, obviously, in the end smartens up, learns his lesson, and begins to use his powers for the good of the world. In the end, he calls on God to take it away and pray that His will be done, Sun Bruce. <br /> <br /> As Jim Carrey, the film is quite funny, and certainly some very interesting points in it. The film is not perfect theology, but in Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite thoughtful, and even complex, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his efforts in this film. <br /> <br /> Thus, while far from perfect, determined funny popcorn movie with a little bit. I thought him <br /> <br /> The result: 3.5 out of 4 (it should look or two)
