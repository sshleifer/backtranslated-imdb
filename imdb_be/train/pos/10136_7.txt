This is one of the best episodes of the second season of the Ministry of Health, I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... He kill'em all, they are often victims (Screwfly solution, Pro-life, Valery on the stairs, I do not I remember an episode in the Argento in season 1, and so, obviously, Imprint). I think he likes to watch women were burned, tortured, mutilated, and I do not know. Never the less, "Right to Die" is one of the best, with good twists and graphic scenes, and unknown (especially with pictures of the scene cells, excellent). Act like the whole series, a regular, I would be the worst, as the "Pro-life" or "We scream for ice cream." In addition, I think that the story it could have been to make a film, not just for the episode. Series ideology terrible killing and stopping women, mutilating animals and so on ... the first season was better than the second with the episodes as "Cigarrette burns" (best), "Homecoming" (the funny thing), "Imprint "(actually shocking).
