One of the best documentary films released in recent years. Some things ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998, his support mainly comes from the poorest regions of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, a coup briefly ousted Chavez. At that time, the Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas, a documentary film about Chavez for British television. Their film denounces the coup and its aftermath, as well as records electrifyingly stories unfolding in the workplace, inside and outside the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. Chavez to free Venezuela from the free-market policies imposed on it USA. Although oil in Venezuela is already in public ownership, it was launched for personal gain on the part of managers, who wanted to replace Chavez. <br /> <br /> 4. While the world's fourth-largest oil supplier, Venezuela remains littered with poverty, its resources are literally sucked foreign multinationals. <br /> <br /> 5. The documentary begins with the image of the first years of Chavez's presidency before the coup. He focused on his popularity with the poor, and its various policies that were popular among the working class locals (curricula, distribution of oil revenues, grassroots democracy, and so on). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a huge fan of education, and print thousands of copies of the Venezuelan Constitution, encouraging children and adults to learn and understand it. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chavez came to power, he immediately promised to redistribute oil revenues. This, of course, made the oil companies nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. The media war. Six private television stations started quickly against the state run television station. They questioned the motives of Chavez's health and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without support from the media, the revolution would not have been successful. The film makes it clear that coups to rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and news can be easily manufactured. <br /> <br /> 10. Under the guise of "restoring democracy," the opposition subsided state run television station, dissolved the National Electoral Council, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly, and took control of the military. <br /> <br /> 11. Material interests, backed by the military elite (and encouraged the US CIA) organized a march to the presidential palace to the citizens, to carry out a coup. Snipers fired on supporters of Chavez, but private media station edited footage, so it seemed that the return fire was directed at the opposition march, which was in fact safely in the security services. <br /> <br /> 12. The police continued firing against Chavez supporters, further bloodying street. <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez was taken prisoner, he refused to resign. Of course, the media / government then lied, saying that he resigned, but the Chavez government members to communicate the truth to the international community, which eventually got a message back to Venezuela and cable TV. <br /> <br /> 14. The people rose, crimping the return of the president they elected, which only the constitutional referendum can replace <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 -. In slightly more than an hour long, the paper is too short. Nevertheless, its exciting part of journalism and deals with a form of "media war", which rarely gets touched. It makes a great companion piece to "The Battle of Algiers." <br /> <br /> Worth a view.
