I can not believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was the master of my favorite show, hands down. I hate the celebrity gossip, and do not like a talk show, but if Hal Sparks took Talk Soup, it must see TV for me. I rarely missed an episode during its run, and was upset when guests started pouring owners (although most of the guests has done an excellent job). <br /> <br /> Anyway, for all the people who do not like Hal Sparks, I believe that they should not be seen in the weekend event. They were an hour long episodes of Talk Soup, which included the best clips of the week, and were complemented by the sketch comedy bits. Original beats that made Hal Sparks were funny. In one he was possessed by the demon of bad comedy, and an exorcist, as the scene of his head began to swim, he said, dated jokes about airline food. One episode was dedicated to making fun of multiplicity, like a bunch of cloned Hal Sparks continued to multiply from the episode, excessive work studio. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe they do not sound so funny, when I describe them, but all I know is that in addition to Talk Soup, only two other shows I watched the series in those years was the Simpsons and Late Night Kononov with O'Brien. So if you love the comedy style of the show, then you will probably like Talk Soup during arcing. <br /> <br /> However, Henson and Tyler both were great hosts as well. All three owners have brought something different to the table, but they were fine comedians in my opinion. Of course, for Tyler and guest stars of years, my interest in the show began to weaken, but every now and then to catch the soup, the spiritual successor to the show, and of course, the new owner can bring some pretty unexpected laughter from time to time. <br /> <br /> Well, I've spent enough time talking about the TV show, which is not on the air anymore and the channel, which I generally despise. Go watch something else!
