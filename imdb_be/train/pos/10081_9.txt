This is a beautiful, rich, and very well made film from a rich and meaningful story. Basically, it tells how the old master storyteller is to find (male) heir to carry on his craft, but ultimately did not get what he expected in his very male dominated world. Then the characters must deal with their situation and the old master has to deal with the conflict between his desire for companion and heir and his views and traditional society. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, emotional and complex. Investigation of the characters, their lives and emotions, rich and compelling character development is strong, and the characters are complex and not at all one-dimensional. The film cleverly conveys the emotion of the old man and his desire to find an heir, and compelling shows how he and the child to cope. There is also a sense of humor, sometimes very subtle, at the appropriate points. The film also explores the good and bad of traditional Chinese culture, creating additional interest and depth of the film. <br /> <br /> directing, acting and scenery, all outstanding. Posts in other strengths, it creates a rich and compelling visual imagery and compelling, real characters. As a result, the film evokes a strong sense of compassion and about, the characters. <br /> <br /> Some say that the end weakens the film, but I do not always agree. Perhaps it might be stronger, with the other end, but any improvement in the overall film would be very small.
