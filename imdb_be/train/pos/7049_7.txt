In this satire of commercialization and "carelessness" of the war, John Cusack plays Marc Hauser, a murderer sent to «Turaqistan» take Omar Sharif, which makes some of the oil business, that would mean trouble for the former vice-president of a private American company. In addition to this, Hauser must juggle his false position as a producer of the exhibition, the wedding for pop princess Yonica (Hilary Duff), and a curious Liberal journalist Natalie (Marisa Tomei). <br /> <br /> In assessing the technical aspects: <br /> <br /> - acting (from the main characters, at least) was good, as one would expect. Some of the dialogue John Cusack was obvious, was not written for him, as he often seemed uncomfortable talking about. ,, Maybe unreal is more accurate. Joan put forth a great and often hilarious performance. Marisa Tomei, while I've never been a big fan of it, was more suitable for this role and worked well. Hilary Duff, however, it was pretty scary. They need attractive Middle Eastern (or Russian, or whatever, that the emphasis should be) a pop star. Unfortunately, they went 0 for 3 with it <br /> <br /> -. As I mentioned above, the letter seemed to be a bit stiff and mismatched at points, especially the dialogue of John Cusack. Not much, mind, but some of them. The story also got a little out of place in the points, and it's good for satire to the point, but he took it to a whole new level here. Fortunately, Cusacks Tomei and maintain a relatively cool, calm demeanor throughout, and it makes a good even mix madness of the film and the actors levelheadedness <br /> <br /> -. Joshua Seftel, who had previously been a drought of real credit to his name, has done an excellent job with the film, and with a wide range. He spoke with a small ($ 10 million) budget is very good, stretching it to make it seem so much more. Seftel also managed to mix well humor stories. ,,. With painful and difficult hours of the real war (including killing of civilians, etc.) <br /> <br /> - How do satire goes, his exaggerated view on the commercialization of the war is very well done, especially advertising in the «Golden Palace Poker »US tanks. At points, it becomes too much, but in the end, it is still a precision reflects the fact that it will be for the young, "Mel Brooks' type style. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very well done for a poor budget, and it is certainly worth the look. He did not go down in history as one of the greatest satirical film, but it is certainly not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
