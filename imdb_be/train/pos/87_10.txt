This award Academy Award-winning short film may rank among the greatest of the genre. This was reported entirely without dialogue, it is a visual treat a young boy who buys a goldfish, lovingly puts it in a bowl, then go to school, leaving goldfish exposed window and casually opened. After a while, the adjacent orange tabby comes poking around, comes through the window and heads slowly bowl. Fish seem to know what is happening, and it becomes very excited. Like a cat comes very close to the ball, a fish jumps out. Cat fishing, drop it back in the bowl and out through the window, he came in the same way as a boy, not knowing what had happened, he returned. It was amazing to be charged with real animals; Cousteau was how these animals behave in this way, great. I just want this film was now available for people to see; I saw him only once, in 1959, when it was released, but it was memorable.
