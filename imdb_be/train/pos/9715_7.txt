Here's the skinny, it seems that it is much older, I thought it was. But it's still great. Bike bags cool and the story works for the most part. There are some problems of character, which I hope to work himself to part 2, and my biggest complaint of all that seems to be MACROSS knock. Not only the style of animation, but some designs of characters. For example, all the girls in this film look LYN Minmay from Macross. The bags are similar to Macross, as well as other characters. It really is not for young children, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. So to make a long story short, I give this cool knock-off Macross 7 stars.
