Firstly, this film was a wild ride all the way. The history of training soldiers, fighting with their superiors, and eventually group together. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning to the very end. This is one war drama worth a look if you are in a constant quarrel (sometimes beyond the mind) and the horror that Boot Camp. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of how the actors interact was very strange at times, and sometimes humorous. As Bozz (Farrell) is engaged in Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the storyline from the camp in Tigerland, and even in the end helping him. <br /> <br /> innovative free hand shooting was to add a certain flavor or taste to the film. Constant movement, constant action, and the only constant confusion. From time to time, it was a help. Others, not so much. <br /> <br /> During the film, he was more realistic. Some moments in the film (the sex scene, in particular), it seemed just a little too realistic, even if they are added to the effect of the film, which would not be there without them. it was a very hard film through. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of the best films Farrell (if not its top performance). Actions for each character was superb. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
