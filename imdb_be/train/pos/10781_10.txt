Road Rovers was a big show about a superhero dog selected Master to fight crime in the world. The show was fun, to say the least. Simple and complex jokes that would appeal to all ages. Running joke throughout the series, which could give rise to a drinking game. Action is fascinating, and cleverly set up. The characters were very original, each with a very different personality. But what made me enjoy the show most of all, the depth of the characters. Each of them is a struggle and emotional difficulties that have never been found, but we understand the subtext. Hopefully, one day, there will be some way to see the Rover in action again.
