Oh, it's such a nice music. There's something like miscasting - Frank Sinatra catastrophic error was assigned the role of Nathan Detroit Jewish, although it becomes apparent only in the «Sue Me», which is clearly a Jewish song. Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut one of the best songs from the show "Marry the man today," and replaced it with the bottom of the exhibit Sinatra. With these two shortcomings in mind, the film is otherwise fine. Gene Simmons fair as Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can not sing worth beans, but pulls it anyway. Stubby Kaye great reprises his role on Broadway (it was written for him). language and walks Damon Runyon and humor come through very well. It is in my see-this every-chance-I-get list.
