This must be one of my favorite movies, in contrast to the weak "Elvira ghosts Hills" ... in any case, I like how the film goth / com "The Wizard of Oz" stories ... <br /> <br /> Elvira Goth Dorothy, who is stranded in an unfamiliar city after the Good Witch of death (Elvīras aunt Morgana) ... it receives a legacy, "Rubin" ring, which is extremely powerful and popular Bad Warlock (her uncle). ..She friendly four characters, she unwittingly helps to grow throughout the film all the time with a dog in tow. There is a show-down with his uncle (the wicked witch of the West), where Elvira knows that she has the strength within her and ends up being a win it. In the end, she goes on from folk cities after the victory over their hearts, and finally gets her to Las Vegas (Dorothy's house in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references made by the master throughout untsa film ... she and her uncle and quote lines related to their parallel characters. Elvira: "youe must be Aunt Em, and you must be Uncle Remus .... There's no place like home, there's no place like home," Bad Uncle Vinnie: "I'll get you my dear, and your little dog too! »<br /> <br /> There is a sign that Elvira is held with its first road trip, which is mentioned in the state of Kansas <br. /> <br /> But apart from that, the fact that one of the sequences it is "torn, um ... I mean, was inspired by Flashdance» pure genius ... and if you do not fall down laughing fuck her at the end of the spit of its "80" Las Vegas show, then you do not get a bone in your body camp ... This film is a Cult / camp Classic
