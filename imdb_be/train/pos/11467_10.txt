This is the best film that I have encountered in a long time. Not only is it the best film of its kind (school shooting) Way Ben Coccio (director) decided to film it was fine. He shot it with the teenage actors who were still attending high school. He shot him in the actors of their own rooms and used the actor's real father, like their parents in the film. Also, the actors were filmed using cameras too, which makes it seem a lot more like a video diary. It's almost sly. (If this is indeed the word) There are a few slip ups, but, for example, when Cal called Barda (?) Land Rover Range Rover (or vice versa, it's been a while since I've seen it)
