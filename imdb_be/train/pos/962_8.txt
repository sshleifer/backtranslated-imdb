I just finished watching this movie, and I must say that I was so impressed.Everything about it was excellent. Actions of the characters, the plot. Probably a child who grew up in bold, always ready to help others. His mother must be proud. I could not take my eyes off of the film due to fear of missing something. This is the prefect bike / fairy tale with a moral, cute and scary sprites and "monsters", but nonetheless a touching folk. The child poked and bullied at school who becomes a hero. Raised to be a rider at a local holiday village and a journey into the mountains of the Goblin, where he discovers Yokai, who are wonderful creatures, Brian Froud be proud of. And evil Kato and his off Sider, which, of course, you need a hug. These evil people Yokai grab and throw them into the red to him along with the unwanted objects such as motorcycles and other mechanical things, and they merge into one terribly cruel monsters robots, the only work to kill. Takashi young boy is one to be their savior, along with the red man / man dragon turtle princess and rivers, as well as the cute little creatures that, if this were America, they would have turned it into a cozy and toy We sold it in all good toy stores. Especially good line not try this at home kids and other gems that bring a smile to his lips. Suspension of belief and watch it with your child, or for your own and enjoy! Although I must admit that the end was a little bit sad. Not necessarily. greeting Furdion
