I love this movie too. I saw it when it was first shown i8n Germany in a small independent film in Frankfurt. It was really crowded, and it was a very ambitious atmosphere. The erotic film was in the audience and discussion with Moritz Boerner producer and director has always underlined this. In its genre it was a very ambitious film, even especially when you think that it was an independent film. <br /> <br /> It does not exist a lot of copies of this film, Mortitz Boerner came out of the theater and made two or three short films worked more for television, as well, before he became a kind of therapist. <br /> <br /> for people who want to see this movie again, you can find it on the home page, which is not so easy to find, but it can be.
