I am afraid that this was a film that you should really look to get something out of it.I do not so meaningless film like ..... Â«LEATHAL WEAPONS SECTION 58" You know, the one where Riggs really gone your mind? this is not a movie that pretty much the same at the end as it began. You can work anywhere talking on the phone do what ever and enjoy it in any way.I have noticed in the past that most people who do not like this type of type of movie that will do almost anything, but watching the film, and then slammed it because ..... uh, they do not get it or understand it or what happened. <br /> <br /> Do not let your DOGGY take a shower !!!
