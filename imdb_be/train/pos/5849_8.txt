Damn straight ..... this show was kick ass back in the day and still continues to overshadow the cartoons today. I can not wait to track down some of the DVD, to share with my little boy, and see the same glint in his eye. I have already presented it Voltron (5 lions alone, rather than 15 vehicles of one), and I was laughing my head off when he told me one day Â«Dad..you sure, watched some amazing cartoons when you were a kid !! "How cool. <br /> <br /> Well, Hollywood, dust off this one and give it a try live-action. I can not be worse than Spider-Man 3 was ... People about people ... 2007 was a rather lame so far for summer movies. <br /> <br /> Well, I shuddup now <br /> <br /> Greetings
