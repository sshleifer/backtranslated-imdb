First things first, this film is beautifully aching. Who works on 3D CG movies like lighter / compositor, video blew me away. Every second I was amazed at what was on the screen As for the story, well, that's fine. It's not going to set the world on fire, but if you like a futuristic Blade Runner-squire tale (and who is not?) Then you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I feel particularly soft voice and detract from the film as a whole. I saw it in a movie in English, but I hope there is a French version of the floating somewhere. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look.
