After reading the book, I accidentally came across this DVD at Wal-Mart for $ 3 and thoughts, of course, what the hell ... I got the DVD and watched it last night. When I started playing, I checked the work, and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, okay cool ... It seemed to run quite slowly, knowing the history and how it was there. By the time I got to the actual killing, I was like, "how much time is left?" Checked. "One minute! What the hell? "I felt incredibly deceived into thinking that the film progressed through only one-third of the total history. <br /> <br /> But, I am pleased to notice that a scene selection menu on the DVD includes part 1 and part 2. I still had another hour and a half to go! I then sat very happy and enjoyed in the second half of the film, even more than the first. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I have not seen the 1967 original film (despite my sincere desire to), I have yet to read the novel and felt that it was pretty generic film for two part TV miniseries, that is. I think the cast as Perry was completely wrong, and a few minor inconsistencies jumped out at me, but still very well done. The first half drags a bit, while the second half is much more gripping. I think that they should be made more film Capote made his book: 1/3 of the murder, after 1/3, and 1/3 after a killer arrested. Instead, the film makes it more than 1/2 of the murder, after 1/4, and 1/4 after the killers were arrested. Again, this makes the second half of the more exciting, but at the same time, less than convincing, making the first half dragged and ... <br /> <br /> Now I look back and realize that I had just done the same thing error of things to drag on and on, so I shut up. Go watch a movie and make up your own damn mind! <br /> <br /> Note Houston
