When this first came out, my father brought him home- we were amazed IT- It was so different from anything we've seen before. I was looking for a specific movie last night, and I found "The eyes of the mind" again. The box is falling apart, and I am surprised that the band is still working! Despite the fact that it is not "Finding Nemo," the quality of graphics, it is still very good. They should sell this again- it is a landmark for the computer-animated images. Highly recommended <br /> <br /> This is what it is: <br /> <br /> «Mind's Eye" spectacular odyssey through time.
