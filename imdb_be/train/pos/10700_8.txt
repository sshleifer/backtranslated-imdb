This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you leave far pretending you know you do not care what communism was about as real Russian or British, if you are taking, and do not hurt the conventions, you can have fun with this film. Nicole Kidman in her best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin managed to avoid completely because overshadowed by Nicole and the rest of the cast does a good job as well. The final moves, and it is logical - logics movie, of course. Worth a look if you accept the rules of the game.
