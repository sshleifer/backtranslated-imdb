What a terrific episode for this wonderful series. This television perfection at its best. The story takes place in 1968, and it is beautifully shot in black-and-white, almost noir style with deep shadows and frozen images. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I do not want to spoil it. This is a rare idea that homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written superb Tom Patty, and director of a large Jeanne Schwartz, we are moving through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning. Our emotions are as eager and on the edge, as heroes. Chills ran down my spine at the end, when they played Bob Dylan's gorgeous, "Ah, but I was so much older than I am now younger than that," the song of The Byrds. This one goes far beyond the 10-and all the way to the stars. Beautiful.
