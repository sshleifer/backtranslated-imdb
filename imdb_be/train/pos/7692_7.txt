First, I will give their assessment for the series as a whole; ******* 7 out of ten stars. I took three for launching a series of slides that hit after John Amos went. Do not get me wrong, there were hard-hitting episodes later, but only after Esther Rolle left in the season and returned. <br /> <br /> In February 1974, the really great sitting by whom (with the dramatic overtones) CBS premiere. It was the first television show about the African-American family living in Chicago's projects in the 1970s. Norman Lear created as a spin-off "Maude", he once again struck the right chord with the audience. <br /> <br /> Not like this show I've seen a situation comedy to speak directly to the struggle of urban families. (Well, there was a «South Central» Fox in '94, but has not been restored.) <br /> <br /> John Amos, James Evans, Sr. was the ultimate father figure for the family and acted as any parent must to keep his family together, and his children from going down the wrong path in life. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle was a great no-nonsense figure of the mother, who was on the same page as her husband when it came to their children's education, <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter, Michael Young, but very bright young man for his age, but stuck in the school system that does not meet his academic needs. His character's name is the same as the founder of the show Mike Evans, who was Lionel Jefferson on «The Jeffersons». (Mike Evans died in December 2006). <br /> <br /> Thelma young girl of 16 or 17, and have to deal with the danger of being a young woman in the ghetto streets. Jimmy Walker as JJ Evans Jr. typical young wise-cracking, jiving view of a young man who does not take life seriously enough. <br /> <br /> Simply put, all my favorite episodes with John Amos, with the exception of Penny Gordon / Janet Jackson storylines. <br /> <br /> After the death of the character James Evans, the show lost it's stability and the audience left. Esther Rolle left for a year, did not want to play second fiddle to a smart-Aleck JJ in "Dina-Mite's"! <br /> <br /> She returned the following season, after securing guarantees that even with the things of the writer. Florida neighbor of Woods Wilona divorced woman who is over the adoption of an abused little girl Penny Gordon (played in the 10-year-old Janet Jackson). abusive mother Penny Totie playing field, the mother of Kim Fields. <br /> <br /> In August 1979 the show came to an end, leaving all the projects for a better life. JJ artist has sold the idea of ​​comics, Michael went to live on campus in college. <br /> <br /> Wilona and Penny, Thelma and footballer husband Keith + Florida all moved in the same building, at the top of the city of Chicago. Not the most realistic ending, but by then it did not matter.
