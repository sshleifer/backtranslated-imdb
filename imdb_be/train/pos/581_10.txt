The river flows It is one of those films that deserve to be seen in the theater, so that the greatness of his film can be truly appreciated. Act fine and understated, with every gesture and smile and nod carrying meaning. Brad Pitt gives a radiant performance and Tom Skerritt is a powerful preacher father. Travel movie, like a river, you should be ready to follow him through the ebbs and flows, but it is well worth it in the end.
