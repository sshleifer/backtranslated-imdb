Of course, the story, the script, and especially strong in casting the film. So many wonderful things to see. One aspect that I liked especially the idea of ​​antagonist - Luzhini-x (Turturro) - ex-mentor worked its evil on the sidelines. His chess opponent - Italian dandy in three parts and a cane - is a real gentleman and a truly great player. To him credit, "the enemy" noble goes along with the plan in the end, to complete the final game of the championship posthumously (Puddle took a flyer out of the window - sad, but releasing it) by an unstable genius widow (Emily Watson). in death, and then because of the gallantry honorary master chess Luzhin Defense (which he developed in the late moment of awareness) are allowed to play. Italian pan appreciates the game and calls it brilliant. We are talking about a dramatic "end of the game!"
