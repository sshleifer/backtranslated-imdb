this is a very good film, and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 negative points: - the level of the stories has a great range. some scenes are very large, and some are just boring. - a lot of the stories are not autonomous (when compared with f√© coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message in a punchline or whether you want to call it), but well, most of the stories are really good, some of them large and in overall this is one of the best films this year for sure! <br /> <br /> annoying that I have to fill at least 10 lines, I did not get more to say, and I do not want to start analyzing the individual sequences ... <br /> <br /> Well, I think it is!
