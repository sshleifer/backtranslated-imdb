I love it when they actually make sporting history well. So many in the past have been so sentimental it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a really good movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and based on the real life guy, so he did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who persuaded to try, late in life, athletically language to become a pitcher in professional baseball. In the end, he reaches his goal, making it in the big leagues, even if it was a very short stint. <br /> <br /> All of the characters are nice people, the kind you root for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now a few stars on television). <br /> <br /> Quaid plausible in the game Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in the sport movies, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who can shoot out of his 90-plus miles per hour. And the best part of this film, however, as demonstrated in real life jug in one of documentary films on DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for good, inspiring real life sports movie, you can not wrong with this.
