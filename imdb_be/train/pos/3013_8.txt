The Talented Mr. detective Philo Vance (William Powell) cancels his trip abroad to examine the apparently trivial case of suicide he has reasonable grounds to suspect, it is really something much more magical rather complex murder! <br /> <br /> As for the murder mystery movies go, it just does not get better than this. Settlement with suspicious characters, all connected to the show and they all have very good reasons to kill her apparent suicide Archer, it's really hard to understand it or to wrap his head around it, but boy does it prove interesting to watch unfold before us. Even the police, the investigator and the district attorney to prove, colorful, characters fleshed added level of realism unexpected rough things are one and amplifiers of its overall "cool" factor. I especially enjoyed the comic scene involving the coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), who always seems to him to be brutally and prematurely interrupted by the discovery of the corpses or wounded during this time his work. As Detective Sgt Eugene palette. Hit allows you to receive, often humorous later magically at their own expense, critical comment during the investigation Vance. I can not think of any legitimate criticism to give this film really, except perhaps that it is particularly well-Sun dated. Do not stop the movie from just a fun show, though. Watch and see if you can wrap your head around it of its mystery. We strongly advise you to try!
