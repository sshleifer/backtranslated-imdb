Considered almost all critics to be the best of Weissmuller Tarzan films, I do not argue with this, although there are a few others, I thought just as interesting. One thing: this is the longest in the series that I saw for 105 minutes. I saw only six of them, but it was more than I used to, and the duration of the final, I thought that it was all a bit too long. <br /> <br /> However, this is a nice blend of action, suspense and romance. The only thing missing are the color and stereo sound. . Primitive special effects do not bother me because it was all they had back in 1930 <br /> <br /> Among some, this film is the most famous one: the skin! "Jane" is never anything this poor after that film wore as the Hays Code was excited by that time was made the next Tarzan movie. Its outfit has shown that a large figure has Maureen O'Sullivan. Naked underwater scene, however, was not her - on Longshot. A woman under the water was a good figure at all, whoever he was. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action here. Before the final, there was no exaggeration, either. The ending was continued for 15 minutes, although it was so strong that it was too much to see <br /> <br /> However, this film offers everything. - except «Boy» (their adopted son) - you «d like to see in the movie Tarzan, even O'Sullivan makes her Tarzan yell about a dozen times. With her pair of "light" that there were no problems.
