Excellent early film music with Ren√© Clair as a fun and witty as his silence "The Italian Straw Hat". The use of sound in a clear way, and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair under the influence of early musicals in America (opera scene from Night at the opera is heavily influenced by Le Million, for example). If (but will not) show all moviegoers and DVD from Criterion just as good as one would expect. There's not a ton of extras, but most DVD-ons that I've seen the useless fluff, and interviews Clair on disk one I've never seen. Get it while it's still around.
