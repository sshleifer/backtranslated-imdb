Anyone interested in pop music, and are not familiar with the British music trends of the late seventies, we must be sure to observe the broken glass at least once. The film, about a young woman seeking to make their mark in the music world, captures great time, from the open sexism, rough economic times, social upheaval, a shift in the pop culture of the landfill punk scary fairies and pretentious Futurism / New Romanticism. Music and fashion style, created on a daily basis in the UK in the late seventies was still open again and again (there really was nothing new, since 1980). It was a brilliant time, and broken glass and tells a very personal story and looks at the cultural landscape, and doing very well.
