I was treated to viewing Cracker bags last night pre-screening before Disney's Holes. I do not know who decided to show it, but I am so very glad that they did. Cracker Bag is an absolute gem of Australia shot in the early '80s, as seen through the eyes of a child. The "conversations" between Eddie and her brother were gay and, like the rest of the film, so true to life. Every shot brought a great sense of nostalgia as it reminded me of my childhood (being the same age as the director probably helps a bit), and multiplied by the sound feeling. I just hope I get to see Cracker Bag again someday.
