I used to love to watch it. I had no idea it was part of a larger series. I must have been 6 or so at the time it was on TV. I just thought it was interesting, and for some reason I had a deep passion for something, it was clear that the president was in a pile of toys in the bathroom. My parents taped it off the TV when it was originally aired on NBC. The tape was even an old coffee commercial Sanya, along with several others. I speak from returning home in the near future and will try to record a tape on your computer so that those who want a copy, you can do so. If anyone of you would like to contact me, I think you can make it through the IMDb website, do not hesitate. I'll keep you informed and let you know if I have a show in a digital format.
