When I first saw this movie, the first thing that I thought that this movie was more like the anime than in the movies. The reason is that it includes a vampire doing incredible stunts. Stunts are very similar to the Matrix moves as moving too fast for the bullets of interesting things and jumping around very far. Another reason why I'm a good movie because your favorite anime person they do in the film. Way Gackt makes his face puffed up, or just the way they operate, very ANIME. I think it's a really good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this film is 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde are also 10). ^ _ ~ If you Gackt and Hyde fans, you should see it.
