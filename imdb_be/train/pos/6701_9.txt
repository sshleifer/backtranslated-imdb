I really liked the first 2 seasons. because a lot of good characters disappeared later. Like most curious show, first slowly getting better in the next season, but it is the absolute opposite. Jenny from the 1st season and Valarie from the 2nd season were friends of Sabrina, I do not really care for others, and Jenny had her Valarie coolest friends. I think, for some reason, the makers wanted to, we do not want her college friends for some reason, they were so cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite episode from season 1 is the cat fights and my favorite episode of season 2, witch garbage that is the funniest episode. I also thought it was interesting how Libby had been popular, but it always envied Sabrina, and never seemed to be a true friend, but always wanted to be with Harvey. I just wish that they could do better. I also loved how the first 2 seasons, during the opening credits Sabrina would like to say a few words while wearing a suit, in the pilot episode, where she dressed as a witch, I liked the way she said, "so I do not" and then she continued to try to change yourself is something else that I think, but it's really cool show. it's kinda like Griffith show AnDy in a way, because it is good at first, but as soon as she turned the color of Barney fife and left, that's good. but I still love to watch, but the only reason I watch next season because of Sabrina. what I meant about the opening sequence is: the discovery of the names of seasons 1-3 shows Sabrina posing in front of a mirror with a few different costumes and outfits as names of actors quickly flash in the bottom of the screen. In the end, Sabrina would say some sort of pun, which is associated with the outfit she wears, and then disappear. opening sequence of the fourth season includes symbols in bubbles. introductory credits seasons 5-7 especially Sabrina in different locations around Boston
