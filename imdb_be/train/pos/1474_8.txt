I saw this film at the International Film Festival in Toronto. Not as obscene as it sounds, it is a three-documentary (each episode 50 minutes) with the participation of the Slovenian superstar philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films, exploring the theme of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. It was directed by Sophie Fiennes, multi-talented Fiennes kind (it is the sister of Ralph and Joseph actors). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it quite a bit, although I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD, as there is a stew of ideas to digest. Freudian analysis and varnish can be quite difficult to go and see the entire series immediately became a bit disorienting to the end of two and a half hours. It did not help that a rash of coffee and bladder storage has led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so. <br /> <br /> My only real problem with this is that Žižek chose films that were very obviously filled with Freudian themes. He spends a lot of time on the films of Hitchcock and David Lynch, it is not master of subtlety. I would like to see how he was trying to support their theories, using a wider range of films, but it's actually just me say that I would like to see part four and five, and six. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very funny and the humor watched him imagine that was a lecture by inserting themselves in the real scene of some of the films he discusses. For example, we see it on a motor boat on the way to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock's Birds) or sitting in the basement of the Bates Motel (from Psycho). Which is not to say that his theory is not provocative. Even when I found out he did not agree with him, it's definitely made me think a little deeper about the films. Which is exactly what he is trying to do.
