This film began to kick me Nick Cage. This is a story full of twists and turns- movie motives and movements. With, of course, Dennis Hopper was ham, but J.T. Walsh and ENT Flyyn Boyle is the perfect pair to catch an unsuspecting person who fell into their network. Everything about this movie is good - cinema, history and most of all the tempo until the end. The cell is different in that it does not mean it's Best- be action hero, but to be caught by the laity in the life force.
