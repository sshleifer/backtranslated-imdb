I must admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind, you can not fill up a person with a strong presence of cinema style. China Fantasy image can not be easy to imagine the audience, the director tried to return to the classic fantasy stories of the Zu mountains and that's what he showed. <br /> <br /> The new Legend of Zu really improved from one in 1983 with this new update of the Millennium, we could see the vision of Tsui Hark in the Zu mountains. Exciting visual design, amazing action epic fantasy done pretty well. Kept me glued over the whole picture. A large cast with a great act. This is a really fun movie to watch, but it's too weird? <br /> <br /> Now the downside is people will definitely get confused a broad storyline cut down to 95 minutes of the film. The site can not have a great relationship between the characters, but rewatching the movie, you'll have a better sense of understanding of the sign. Some of them may complain there are not too many physical struggle, besides, with the symbols that have supernatural powers to defeat the enemy, the spirits who are struggling with using hands does not make sense at all. <br /> <br /> I appreciated this nice stylish pattern. This can have a fine story, but hey look at Tsui Hark in Â«Time & Tide," we are entangled plot, as well, but it was really something stylish and strange. Tsui Hark always attracts something else in H.K. Cinema. American audiences may have some difficulties to understand, while watching this movie, cause it is not no Crouching Tiger, it's a whole new genre. While this may not be a masterpiece, but it's special effects really better than the Storm Riders. It is really worth checking out.
