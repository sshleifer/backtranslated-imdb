Allen and Julie move to a cabin in the mountains after their daughter was murdered one night. No one knows who killed a little girl, but that's why they moved to the mountains. Thus, the pair is moving in the cabin, and it is on the people who killed themselves there, and no one in the neighboring town does not want to talk about it. <br /> <br /> In this film there are a lot of horror to it, and it has a lot of details that made me jump. Some of the pieces are predictable, but once in a while there is a part I did not expect. It was a very good movie that was not the worst movie in the world, but it was still scary enough to do it very well. <br /> <br /> I also liked the ending, because he left the viewer to decide how it ends. It is also a kind of a sad movie, as well, but well-made horror film.
