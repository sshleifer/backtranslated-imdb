First of all I want to clarify that the inability of the average user to evaluate the idea terrifying. What makes this show so unique is the hyper-reality, it creates. You do not need to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead, and why it can only be a minute. Where are my children's astonishment bizarre tales NO, as well as a fold in time. <br /> <br /> I say this refreshingly original, because it's the polar opposite of mass lay-it-all-out television, it does not leave room for imagination and wonder. <br /> <br /> it's good to add a bit of escapism to the television experience. <br /> <br /> hyperreality my favorite aspect of the show. In the 1950s in the style setting, innocent and rare characters, and the scenery and natural settings that should not be taken as a pure reality. <br /> <br /> This show mask the painful nature of death, while others cover it, while entertaining, other television shows have taken a back shelf in the series. It really restored a sense of curiosity, imagination and wonder to the TV. <br /> <br /> Pushing Daisies quickly reached the top of my list.
