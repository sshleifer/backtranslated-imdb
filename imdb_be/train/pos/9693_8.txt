I was very surprised with this film. I was touched by the life that Paulie touched along the way to find it «Marie» the little girl, whom he had been separated from. Humor was also very good, and it does not hurt the story, I thought it would probably do. Actually I expected, "Polly wants a cracker" jokes hurt the film, but even that was done in a very humorous scene which makes very touching when Paulie is located in the research center's press conference laboratory. So if you want to see a good "animal that talks," the film is one of the check, much better than Dr. Doolittle, in my opinion. Paulie is also surprised by the twist in the end, that is very good as well.
