First of all, no adaptation never as good as the book, especially if you are dealing with a major writer, like Tolkien. This adaptation of Tolkien's universe of strange synthesizes 1970 psychedelia, aesthetics and liberal culture. Yes - animation and background picture is sometimes a little "rough" in its technical performance, but it's not pretty though, and is very similar in terms of providing a unique "sense of place" to each of the scenes. In addition to the absolute uniqueness of the imagery is absolutely outstanding voice - acting is far superior to the current in the new live-action films. And while cell animation may not be the most "technically proficient" animation it perfectly reflects the clear face and body gestures, operating while time not forgetting to be thin and delicate. Backgrounds vary from the traditional "fantasy" motive to direct abstraction, but the transition to the retracted configuration is always motivated by descriptive and contributes significantly to the film's theme. If you are a person who needs to have a computer rendering of the movie, so it is visualized to you, then I can see how you could not like this film, but if you like excellent performances, transcendent images and Tolkien, this film is a must see.
