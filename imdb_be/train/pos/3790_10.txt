I tuned into it by accident on the independent film channel and was riveted. I am a professional actor, and I was amazed by the performances. They felt completely improvised, completely without affectation. I could not tell when it was the script or how it was made, and waited until the end to see the credit, and then spent half an hour on IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss it. I see that the writer-director also made a very thin film called Everyday People, I enjoyed a lot. Shame on the movie business is that the draft is a great sun to get distribution and publicity they deserve, and live under the radar. This film deserves to be raised high and proud. I encourage people to watch it and watch it.
