"The Godfather," "Citizen Kane," "Star Wars," "Goodfellas" None of the above, compared with the complex brilliantly «The Sopranos». Each character has layers on layers of absolute truth, fully three-dimensional. We take care of Tony Soprano's heart, despite the fact that in the simplest model of good versus evil, he is evil. The Sopranos is the most provocative, confusing and fascinating character ever created in this moment in history. If you are in the mood to be openly challenged as a spectator, and forever changed your feelings for entertainment, watching «The Sopranos». I challenge anyone to sit down and look at the very first episode of Season 1, and do not want to continue the series. Each season is completely brilliant in its way. DVD-drives are important to one's collection of spent 4 ****
