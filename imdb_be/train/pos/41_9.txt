"Who did it?" It contains many unmistakable laugh and jokes. It is not only one of the best films Stooges with Shemp, is one of the best short comedies Columbia production. Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the puppets, but if Howard Curly suffered a stroke end of a career, it was adapted for the comedy team of Columbia Schilling and Lane (their version was released as the "Pardon of terror.") Evidently, too good for the stooges to pass up, and it was finally removed puppets in late 1947 <br /> <br /> Old Goodrich calls ace detectives Shemp, Larry and Moe out of fear that he would be killed. When they come to his house, Goodrich had disappeared, and his niece and various thugs trying to get rid of the puppet. Goodrich will find them and bring niece and goons to justice? <br /> <br /> Shemp particularly funny in this movie. His reaction when given a mickey Christine McIntyre beautiful; he gives his signature sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre visibly trying not to laugh! Other funny scene: a close-up mugs Maybe looking through a camera lens; and fight in the dark with all the actors involved. <br /> <br /> Nikki goon (played Duke York) is one of the most unusual-looking characters ever portrayed in Stooges movie. With its twisting hair, he could almost pass for a Stooge, if it does not rise above the rest! "Who did it?" Is the jewel among the Stooges with Shemp films. Even die-hard fans of Curly will enjoy it! A true classic Stooge. 9 of 10.
