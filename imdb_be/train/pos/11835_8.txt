While I wanted from this film, since the first time I watched the trailer, I was deep surprise with this film. While some of the elements and actions of the characters seems a bit too ?? cartoon "dark nature of the film does make it a very different experience. Instead of well-being-happy stories, the film takes you into a different direction, as evidenced by uplifting, but also concern. Most children will not understand some of the darkest moments in the film, making the film quite watchable for adults. I was also struck by the film, using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts. The musical score was again solid, Hans Zimmer proving go-to guy when it comes to animated evaluation, and I never thought I would say that really enjoyed the music of Bryan Adams.
