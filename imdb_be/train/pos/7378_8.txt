After watching the film last night at the Sundance, I realized that most of the style Nakata was the first to make this film. Here we have many of the same elements of the Ringu series, especially the idea of ​​the media, which are the source of the supernatural. Instead damn movies, we, instead of having a studio ghosts and strange images that appear in the film. In fact, the strange images that appear on the film immediately brings the cursed videotape in Ringu to mind. The only thing missing was an obsession with the water passing through the later films Nakata. The final scenes is quite frightening, with a slight bow to the Murnau that the doorway itself Ands ghost, entering the room, immediately reminds me of the <br /> <br /> Nosferatu. Scary movie that will make think twice about going to the podium.
