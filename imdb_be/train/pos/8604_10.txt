I know that many people do not like this film, but I just think it's great. There's not much I can say, but the film is a good feeling film I think. The songs are beautiful, beautiful costumes, beautiful voices, and there are a lot of funny lines in the movie, especially Briggitta learns to do and don'ts of society. If you love musicals, I would say that you would like it!
