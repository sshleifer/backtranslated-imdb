If you liked Deep Cover, you could have this film as well. Many of the poetic interludes Fishburne reads aloud in the Deep Cover appear on the lyrical script "Once in his life," A screen adaptation of the play that Fishburne wrote. If you like Larry's as much as I have, you will love this film, which is all Larry, all hot, all fleshed out. Of course there is a gun to play and an illegal substance, it is kind of a movie gangster, in the end, but the script is beautiful and touching story, even a little bit on the side chick flick. <br /> <br /> AMAZING movie ... a dark, scary, sexy and exciting. If you have ever entered the night or hung out at the club, you will get a proper impact compression sets (metephorically repeating being caught in life). Full reasonable omens and complex relationships, the film tight..every mood is reflected in the set dressing and the camera shot. Good job!
