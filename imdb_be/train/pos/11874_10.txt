best role Arguebly Al Pacino. He played Tony Montana, a small time hood with Cuba has become a lord in Miami rich and powerful offense, and he does it with only two things that he got in this world, his balls and his word, and he does not break 'em to anyone. Starts as do jobs for the big-time Cuban dealer Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly climbs up the ladder of organization along with his longtime friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon, he has eyes for his wife Elvira sexual boss (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position, he is trying to assassin Tony, but no luck. Tony is upset, and nothing can stop it now. the film has a great supporting cast among them F. Murray Abraham as jumping a gangster, another familiar face Harris Yulin as crooked cop trying to shake Tony ~ d, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as the younger sister of Tony. Loans Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This film is one of the bright spots Brian DePalma in his long career ups and downs, you can see that this guy is very talented. The film has a great view of it. You should also pay attention to two unforgettable scenes: one in a fancy restaurant ( "to say goodbye to the bad guy"). another final shoot-out, where Tony reveals that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 killer who broke into his home. This is definitely one of the most spectacular endings in a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime films, this is a must see. For the rest of you are strongly recommended. 10/10
