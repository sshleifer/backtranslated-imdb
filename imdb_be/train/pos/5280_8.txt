Reda young Frenchman of Moroccan descent. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in attitudes and values. With the blue, his father said that Reda is driving him to Hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca - something that Reda is not interested in this, but agrees only with the liability. As a result, from the start, Red angry, but being a traditional Muslim, his father was difficult to speak or discuss their concerns. Both father and son seems to be very rigid and inflexible - and this is very ironic, when the father tells his son that he should not be so stubborn <br /> <br /> When I read the summary, it says, how many characters. I grew up and began to understand each other. However, I really do not think they did, and it's exciting and sad aspect of the film. Of course, there were times of understanding, but often there is rancor and repression. I really liked it, and it is clear that it was not a complete solution to this. - as it would have seemed phony <br /> <br /> In general, the film is well-acted and entertaining - giving Westerners unusual understanding of Islam and the Hajj. It also provides an exciting juxtaposition of traditional Islam and secular young generation. While the slow pace and lack of clarity in the relationship throughout the entire film can be annoying to some, I think it gave the film an intense realism and made it look like a film about the people - not some formula. Pleasant and unusual film.
