I thought it was very funny movie. I love dogs and movies comedy movies together because they were twice as good. K-9, K-911 and K-9 PI my favorite movies. Belushi and Jerry Lee hysterical funny and charming they make a great team. The only drawback is that I really do not understand how Dooley's wife died. She died before the film, but how? When they said that I should miss it. In addition, I give it two thumbs / tails up! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus), must have been a lot of training. They were so funny and all the noise, Jerry Lee would do if Dooley spoke to him was so funny. My favorite was when Jerry Lee sang, and when it will bite ordinary peoples, to get the information very, very funny lol
