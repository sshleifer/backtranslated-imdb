Personally, I think that the film is quite good watch. It describes the actual situation of the triad in Hong Kong and gives the viewer an idea of ​​how to organize the triad. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but also shows the viewer how the police of Hong Kong triads to control the situation and why the police do not just go all out and destroy the triad. <br /> <br /> as a whole, the film is quite hard because of the methods of gang killings and torture. Nevertheless, the film remains true in the real world that violence on the screen is just a reflection of what is actually going on. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to any Triad / Mafia fan film. Another good looking will be the Dragon team. This film has more weapons than it is, because there are more knives than guns (in fact I do not remember any gun) in this film.
