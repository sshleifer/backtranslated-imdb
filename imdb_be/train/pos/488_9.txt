Part of the pleasure I took from this film derives from the fact that I did not know anything more about it than he starred John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to look), was during a part of and participate in chess. All that evolved was totally unexpected for me. I will not, therefore, give more. Suffice it to say that a great Turturro as an eccentric, obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and Em corresponds to it step by step, as a strong person who accesses it. It is about love and obsession, not revered board game, and after the image changes gradually during the first half an hour, became fully convincing. And I challenge anyone to provide for termination.
