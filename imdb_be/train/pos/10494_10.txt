Beautiful view of a mature woman who is about to lose everything (even pruner has a mortgage). The way she is involved in this particular "business", innocence and true love that exists between the people of a small town, he blended perfectly to give us, as a result of fresh, light and funny comedy. I could not help but laugh with a very funny scene of two old women in a pharmacy. <br /> <br /> I love European films, and films like this, my opinion is growing. The film, which I also recommend with eyes closed, in the same genre, is the Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace, comedy, that many members enjoy the same way as I do. You'll love it.
