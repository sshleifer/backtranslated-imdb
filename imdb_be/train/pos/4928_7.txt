Given the time of release, a story that unravels in 1950 thriller "Panic in the streets" is hardly a surprise. Mysterious Corpse found illegal and passed, as no one before further investigation with the Inspector of Public Health, who claims the body does not bear the strain of bubonic plague. But with the current drama in the modern world, it's amazing this film helps in being a trust for modern audiences. Throwing and crew flawlessly. Widmark in his first role after his breakthrough performance in "Night and the City," Jack Palance had a frightening film debut, also starring in this film, Paul Douglas and young (and rather cute) White Geddes. Lots of credits, non-professional actors (Kazan typical director) to fill in the remaining slots. Elia Kazan directs Joe McDonald movies (he would later work with Widmark again in 1953, far surpassing Â«Pickup on South Street") and large assessment Alfred Newman him. Almost all participants here did a better job, "Panic in the streets" it is quite useful for hours yet. Especially for the film noir enthusiasts.
