People do not expect no less brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs the film, and this film is no exception. Some movies I like to do poorly at the box office, but I'm glad to say that this film is not one of them (more than nine million dollars that I do not think it was bad at that time). The characters were fun, the animation was not clear and wrong, and the music was modern, too, which is unusual for an animated film. I do not think that Professor twist or "Last CirusÂ» was too scary for small children (the target audience for this film), but I think what happened with the terrible Professor at the end was a bit too dark children's film. Overall, this movie is a fun and charming classic, I loved for many years.
