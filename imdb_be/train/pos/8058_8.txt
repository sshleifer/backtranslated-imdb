Like many people here, I started to find my patience to judge this film. In the end, I actually sobbed. <br /> <br /> It seems to be in the nature of most of the old movies drag on 7/8 lengths, then light up right in the end. Old movie viewers have learned to wait patiently through the slow parts, take comfort in knowing that a big win is on the way. But this is not quite true. You see, in the earlier audience that we "slow parts" were the main part of the story. They observed and found a fragmented and thematic interest there. Modern audiences, after Spielberg, are in a constant state of waiting to hit a small climax every two minutes when they see old movies. This is the problem of inflation contemporary films. Well, it's not going to happen. No need to apologize for these films; it's just that you have to adjust their expectations and personal rhythm, when you see them. At the moment, the difference between the avatar and informers as the difference between Euripides and runaway production lease. Think about it for a minute or two. Nha lean on the obvious, but still worthy of Euripides hearing. <br /> <br /> «interesting», for the majority of modern audiences, begins with the tribunal scene IRA and escalates to the final couple of minutes, if you do on board, or even pay attention to the time, will tear the heart. This is not some high tone abstract universal call to forgiveness; It is a plea from one boob, and those who feel sorry for the big bumpkin, for the small mercy. It's private, and strikingly bare appeal. For after angry at gypo, in a rage with him, thinking it was a stupid character of all, you finally find yourself captivated scene gypo former girlfriend in supplication for another woman to talk to the man, that he must go it easily. <br /> <br /> The film may be sentimental, but the sentiment does not come cheap, as some here have charged. There is a question of life and death, which plays here, and by the time you are taking one life to offer the customer seriously, it's sentimentality pushed out of the most serious things. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10 and the blame for this is not a 10 out of 10 my and to some extent your own, when you read this. We all asked for more, more, faster, faster and faster, until we can not put ourselves in 1935 - just yesterday, in fact - just as easily as we should be able to.
