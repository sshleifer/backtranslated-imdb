In this sequel, Liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu, and then beat his friends. It mimics the original Shan Those trying every possible trick to get to the Shaolin Temple to study and ultimately received some unique skills to fight with some bullying bosses. Its classic light hearted martial arts tale, with the production values ​​of Acey Shaw brothers and self-direction Lui Chia Liang. Choreography fantastic everywhere, whether to fight or farce and speeches Gordon Liu, like the others, in particular, cute monk work is ideal for the material. The film is less epic or deeper than some of the stars and other work is, of course, grandiose, more stringent and sweeping Shaw Brothers films. But few of them have the magical mix of buffoonery, a unique training and fighting, with a thin even warming story about useless guy does well. Full light joy of heart, it is impossible not to give it a high score.
