I did not know what to expect from "Ned Kelly", but absolutely loved it. It was dark, dramatic and exciting. It also felt very authentic, I felt like I was transported back to the 1800 year. I've never been a big fan of Heath Ledger, being only seen him in the type of teen films, but he was very convincing in the role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us how highly alloyed energetic boy became the most notorious killer of Australia. Naomi Watts largest in supporting role lover Society . Kelly Highly recommended - and this is from an Australian!
