After not seen all the films released in 2002, I can not say that this is the best film of the year. I can say that this is the best film I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> Most American films with the participation of black people or fixated on the US absorption "race relations", or fall into the clich√© inner urban ghettos, with every conceivable sterotype beating ebonic-slang wording. Antwone Fisher proudly stands alone in this respect: the race does not matter, except for one fight, which may or may not have been provoked by racial legate <br /> <br /> The history of Antwone Fisher is one that should find a resonance. any empathy individual. He understatedly, and thoughtfully, drew Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, while apparently using his star power to have a film made, stick to the background, for the most part, and allows the film to be a history Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> At the time when the BET and popular culture in general want to keep ghetoization a large number of Americans (and Canadians, you know), this is a film that speaks to the humanity in all of us. I just hope that Nonchernozem viewers to see this movie for that of mankind, and not to avoid it, because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the film, which they can identify. This would be a sad commentary on race relations in North America itself. <br /> <br />
