This movie is Arnold. Now that you know that I have saved you a lot of time it took to read this review. If you do not like Arnold, you will not like this film. If it's different, you will very likely enjoy. It's as simple as that. <br /> <br /> Now, if you're still reading this, I'm waiting for you, Arnold. Well done! He's pretty good, is not it. Running Man is a very prominent feature of Arnold. He received the usual retro-future that we know so well from the B-Sci Fi 80, he got a bunch of terrible jokes, a lot of violence and explosion, and pretty heroine and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In this case, all the evil enemy control 1984ish government, which uses television as an effective crowd control with the game show gladiators type. Arnold, of course, in the end, in one of these shows and turns it all upside down, with a little help from his two accomplices and pretty Amber. <br /> <br /> This is not a big-budget movie, but it still managed to create a very good atmosphere in the future, with some nice matte paintings and kits to help him. It's hopeless' 80s, but I find that charming. Duties vary, Arnold makes his usual grunt and shout thing, with a portion of the stone face of jokes. The heroine Amber, to put it mildly, a bit stereotyped and subtly named Damen Killian is a typical evil TV man <br /> <br /> Despite all these shortcomings, the film shows his message is very clear. TV opiate of the masses, a good way to control people. It also has some in futuristic digital video editing that allows the bad guys to change the face in the video, to deceive their audience. It does not seem futuristic at all today, which is a bit worrying. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Arnold movies before you know if you watch it. Enjoy.
