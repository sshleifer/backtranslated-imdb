The undoubted highlight of this film is the performance by Peter O'Toole. In their turn wildly funny and scary terrible tragedy. Or does it better than anyone O'Toole? I do not think so. What a great person, that person is! <br /> <br /> In the history of the odd one and very anxious and emotionally intense in parts (especially towards the end), but it's also strangely touching and really it is a success on many levels. Nevertheless, I felt this film mainly revolved around Peter O'Toole glowing performance, and I'm sure I would have enjoyed it even half as much as if he was not in it.
