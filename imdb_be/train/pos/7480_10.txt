This film is one of the best of Tom Cruise movie. It captures the audience with his presentation of the role of David Aames. His character may refer to all of us in some way.The storyline is very smart and keeps the audience on edge throughout the film. I never really watched the winged movies that much before, but after seeing this, he showed me his true talent. My favorite part of the film in the end, where it all comes to a conclusion, large, and he learns the truth. If you have not seen it yet, you should definitely give it a try. This is one of those movies that, once you've started watching it, you've just got to see it to the end or it will keep you thinking and you'll regret it. My opinion is that you should just go out and buy it and take the risk that's what I did, and it became one of my favorite movies of all time. This A * 10/10 I promise, as soon as you watch it, it will follow you, and you fall in love forever.
