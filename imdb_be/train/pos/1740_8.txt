This film is not so much promoted here in Greece, despite the fact that the good actors, great script and a pretty good photo was not the so-called "blockbuster" film in my country. The film is very powerful, it is a difficult time, that the newcomer had to pass, when he returns to his home-village after it was freed from prison time 5yo (drugs), the end is very sad .... Mourikis trying to to keep up with his hand, and he handles it very well ... Lambropoulou large and very sexy in a strange way and, of course, Hatzisavvas it for another time close to excellency ... 7 out of 10, because very few Greek films may to make an impression!
