Hamlet is by far my favorite of all the works of Shakespeare. Branaugh is one of the actor's traits. His image was simply amazing. His monologues were breathtaking. By the time it was rare for a film to hold my interest, but I was involved in that particular part. I recommend it to everyone, as a supporter of Shakespeare and those who are not so much. This is all that the modern world is looking for in his films: murder, betrayal and deceit. Nha pounding version of Mel Gibson, but Branaughs affects all the work. It leaves no stone unturned. When you finish this film, he will feel as if you are reading on their own play. Um, as you say, "two thumbs up".
