This is a great movie. It has a fascinating history, a wonderful protagonist, very good acting skills and killer action. It occurs mainly in 2036, but shows scenes that take place in recent years to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very well done and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a soldier by the name of Todd, who is trained from birth to kill and, like all the other soldiers never have a normal life. In the end, the military introduced a new, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee is one of them. As a result, they have no need for the old soldiers as Todd. They test out new soldiers, having them fight with some of the old soldiers, in combat Russell was injured and assumed dead. Military dumps his body, as well as smaller amounts of other believing that they are all dead, but what they do not realize that Russell was alive. <br /> <br /> Todd is a camp full of civilization on this planet, that the military dumped it on. For some time he lived there, but can not adapt to a normal life. He rarely says a word, and it is sometimes very aggressive towards other people. If they feel that he is a danger to them, they send him into the wilderness. <br /> <br /> Just as Russell leaving the planet attacked the new soldiers. The fact that the military had forgotten to teach soldiers to be smart as Todd and other old soldiers. Thus, while these new soldiers faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easy Outsmarts them. Military and begin implementation of this Todd kills all his man, but one. This is one Jason Scott Lee and in the end you will see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell clearly comes out on top. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. That's all you can ask in the film, including some great lines. The writer also not forget that Russell had never seen a woman before he even calls the women "sir." There's no holes in this film, every moment has a purpose, and it is very interesting. <br /> <br /> amazing one man army blockbuster for fans of Rambo, Commando and missing in action. This is highly recommended for all fans of Kurt Russell and action / Sci-Fi fans.
