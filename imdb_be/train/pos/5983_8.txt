I first saw this film as a teenager. This was at a time when heavy metal rules the world. Trick Or Treat has every element of the film that swings. With a cast that shows Skippy by family ties, Gene Simmons of Kiss, Ozzy Osbourne, and as a preacher, how can you go wrong? Backwards evil messages played on vinyl! Yes Thats right, they use entries in this film. In one scene, Eddie (Skippy) listens to a message from the evil on his Rockstar player when things start to get scary. Monsters start to go out of their speakers and stereo becomes obsessed. As a teenager, I tried to play my records backwards in the hope that it will happen to me. Nearly 20 years Trick Or Treat is still one of my favorite movies.
