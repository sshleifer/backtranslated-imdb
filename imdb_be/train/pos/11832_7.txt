to call, but I think the spirit was a great movie to watch. Nevertheless, there were several things that stop me from rating it higher than 6 or 7 (I'm being a little generous with 7) <br /> <br /> Point # 1 :. Matt Damon aggravates me. I thought, "that is unhealthy votes they received for the main character," when I first heard him speak - and then I realized that Matt Damon was human error I am so very badly -. His performance in «The Departed» was terrible and ruined film for me (before the film got a chance to destroy itself, but that's another story some other time), as he nearly did, "the Spirit." I was able to pass by this fact, because of how little narration there on in fact it was ... luckily <br /> <br /> point # 2 :. Brian Adams sucks ... the entire bill was a terrible ... the songs were nearygina flax, generic and poorly executed, never can not find music to match, and the lyrics were terrible every time one of the squalid songs came, I was off I almost thought I was beginning to hear some patriotic propaganda slipped.. in the super-American-style freedom of the lyrics (I could not help but think about those terrible patriotic songs that are played constantly on the radio after 9/11). in the light of the Indian aspects of the film, they had to go with mounting music, using the right tools, and do not minor radio hit, etc. dletki-Bop, 14-year-old girl shit. I thought I was in high school. I can not believe that there is no better and was not done - I refuse. If it was not for this, I would appreciate the film more with Disney, who knows something about the original (ok, do not bother to say that I know some of you are probably thinking;). Too bad it's a shame that they could not hire the best musicians. <br /> <br /> I loved art and animation, except for a few things, except here and there ... sometimes the corners seem to be too sharp on his face and the lines are too thick or dark on the body (thick / dark lines, mainly , near the end). There were often times when I thought they were too _tried hard_ on emotions and facial expressions and did not draw any real emotion. But there were times when emotions ran thick. In any case, many of the scenes were lazy and the layers were clear. <br /> <br /> Well, I fall asleep here, so I'll summarize, before you start to make less sense ... <br /> <br /> A good attempt at epic ... it turned out to be mediocre, though. Matt Damon, you suck!
