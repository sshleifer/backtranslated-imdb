It is much more than the magical story of middle-aged man showing satisfaction ballroom dancing (although that too). This is the story of one man learn to love life again, pushing past all the pressure of work and money to discover the joy again. Bonus in this movie is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes in modern Japan side just from ballroom dancing to physical contact. There are scenes that will make you laugh out loud ... some where you want to get up and tango ... and many others, where you simply feel good. <br /> <br /> This is a great introduction to modern Japanese cinema for those who might be under the impression that all the Japanese films "difficult" and are not available. <br /> <br />
