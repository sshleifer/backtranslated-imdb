this is the best comedy I have ever seen! but not everyone can understand it, you have to be from Georgia to see this amazing movie! :) as a whole is one of the best films I've ever seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all supporting actors play very, very well, but operating in Cote Daoshvili (Germogel father) for my opinion best acting in a supporting role in the history of movies :)) in the film played by many Georgian stars as ipolite xvichia, Zakariade, Chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze .... they are all stars in the Georgian cinema :) plus in this film He plays great Russian star Evgeni Leonov and, of course, the film's director Georgy Danelia is one of the best ...... I would recommend this movie to everyone, but remember that you need to know, a good Russian to watch this movie
