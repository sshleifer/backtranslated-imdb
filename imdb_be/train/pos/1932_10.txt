I think I usually suitable film festivals comedies with a low expectation that they will always be "nimble" and that any intended humor is derived solely through the simplicity of the characters in a complex context. What was exceptional about the Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and the development of his characters in his film, he is still in a laugh out loud humor in each scene. There was a sophistication, perhaps due also in part to the harsh work of the DP, I have rarely seen in the indie film, and even more rarely in the comedy. It should be emphasized here: the rotation Paget Brewster, Amy math teacher. After watching this show, I can not understand why Brewster is not "discovered" by a wider audience. It brings the necessary combination of anger and likability to the role that really makes this film reaches its full potential. This is an excellent work deserves a wider audience. I look forward to more from the director and actors of this!
