Read all comments very interesting. but can someone please tell me the name of the artist who painted the picture for good broadcasting times. I understand that everyone refers to J.J. as an artist in the family, but there was a real family, which has a real artist, and he did not get any credit in the form of another. So, if you do not mind if someone can say the name of the artist, I would also like to say "job well done". I know that this vision for the actors GOOD TIME, but you do not agree with the fact that he also touched the hearts of all of us. I would like to know if he still draws or if he is still alive. I would like to have some of his works are displayed in my house.
