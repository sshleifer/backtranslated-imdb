Nice to see such creativity on the TV. This show is a poetic, artistic and good fun. Symbols and letters are also not bad (I think it will improve as they get their feet). Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> The girls steal the show so far in this series. Chuck beautiful as the olive. Two aunts pleasure. I sincerely hope that they write them in a large part, because they are magical. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all the news fit to print. Go make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in the old-fashioned way. It's like Dr. Seuss for adults.
