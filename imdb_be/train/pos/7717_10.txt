I loved this film all my life. It is intellectual history, too, with a large number of classical allusions. for example. The ship, which has been missing for decades used to be called Bellerophon. Well, it was a man in classical mythology, who killed the chimera, the legendary beast, which consists of two or more other entities. The OP Dude obviously chimera- himself and his monster Id. <br /> <br /> I love the movies, where the authors clearly credited his audience with a modicum of intelligence, unlike most modern blockbuster that spend $ 150 million on special effects, but about $ 1.50 per script. <br /> <br /> Greetings
