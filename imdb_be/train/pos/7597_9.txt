Lost holds something of interest for everyone. You can tell an awful lot about this series, and a lot was said, so I'm not one to spell it all out for you again. Just read people loved it, and you'll know why you would want to watch it. The good thing about this series is that it completely new. There's not a lot of movies and even fewer- series based on just the unknown, but the theme of Lost live with honor. Its all about the inexplicable, and if you combine it with an exotic place, nice plot twists, great cast and a good format (the present and the past in combination in some episodes), you will have a series in which each episode is a story about it on their own, but some great stories. You want all the ideas of characters you want to see the big picture, and you want to know where the authors take you. The result of this is that the series, which will not let you go. On a more skeptical note, the series went a bit in season 2, probably due to its own success. It is well known that Lost was written only for one season and was initially a huge success when followed, the authors were impressed as well. In my opinion, they have made a mistake, to add even more mystery and at a higher rate, in Season 2, and then decide whether those (or at least partially) those with season 1. At the end of season 2, you are finished with large Blurr secrets plot twists and unexplained phenomena, but there is only so much the viewer can take. The difference between seasons 2 and 3, however, was enormous. Season 3 were given a lot of insight to partially replace them with new questions. And that's exactly how they should write; You want thumble from one turn to another story, do not get the secrets of the tsunami spread to all of you, and then pick up a little, to explain to the audience. They found that in season 3 and bring us a series of promising upcoming season 4. It's nice to see such a different format series, can be so very popular.
