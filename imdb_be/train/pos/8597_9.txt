I enjoyed this film. I thought it was a great political thriller about something that never happened before - a secret service agent is bad, and participated in a conspiracy to murder. Unfortunately, for the character of Michael Douglas "Pete Garrison," they think it is a mole, but it is not. <br /> <br /> He's morally-flawed agent that has to do with the First Lady! As he does so, he can not give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes it the number one suspect, when he revealed a conspiracy to assassinate the president. <br /> <br /> «Garrison" is forced to go on the run but at the same time, he is still trying to do the right thing, protecting the president. Douglas does an excellent job in this role. I do not always care about the people he plays, but he's a great actor. Kiefer Sutherland ( "David Breckinridge») is just as good (at least here) like a boss SS officer who does not strive to Douglas convinced that he was telling the truth. If he makes the two of them working together in the final, to detect and then stop, if they can, the story. Fraudsters are interesting, too, by the way. In addition, I have never - and will never be, unfortunately - to see the first lady who looks as good as Kim Basinger <br /> <br /> It's just a slick action flick, which entertains from start to finish. There are holes in it? of course; perhaps some of them, and the reason you see so many criticisms. However, it is unfair to beat here. It is simply not smart enough for the geniuses here at this site. My advice: chill, just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue. Yes, it gets a little Rambo-ish at the end, but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment ..... that is all about movies.
