To some extent, I really liked this movie better than the original vampires. I found the film quite a misogynist. As a woman and a horror fan, I'm used to the fact that women are in danger are a staple of the genre. But they just slap Sheryl Lee around too much. In this film, Natasha Wagner more fully realized character, and the main bad guy Gal! Arly Jover (played sidekick to vamp BLADE) is very otherworldly and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... well, yes, not a great actor, but he's doing OK. At least, he begins to sing. Catch it on cable, if you can. It's Encore action this month.
