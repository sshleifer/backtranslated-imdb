I recently watched the movie version with Judy 54, and while I appreciated the story and the music, I found that the film could not hold my attention. I expected that 76 will be a remake of the same story, except a twist Barbra. I was pleasantly surprised - it was much more realistic and modern look at fame, money, love, and the cost of it all. This version is so much more real than the one 54, with possibly the best music, the best action, more thrilling storylines, and, of course, a deeper love. I do not understand why the previous film on the top 100 list of the American Film Institute, while this exciting remake is not able to make a mark in the list any criticism.
