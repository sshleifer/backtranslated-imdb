"Ned Kelly" great Australian film made in honor of the Australian character. We have taken the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne and other members of the Kelly Gang, as the film explains and possibly justifies the actions of Neda. <br /> <br /> There is an exceptional cast is present, which all give stellar performances that bring the film to life. (Great job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was fantastic, Joe, plays the role of the quiet, precise ladiesman very well. I was put in the time. For a moment I almost believed Banda would win the battle at Glenrowan, unfortunately it was not to be. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the movie are fictional, and as an ardent supporter of Ned Kelly (and supporter), was a little disappointed with this. It is also possible the film could have gone more to cover a large part of life / Ned Kelly Gang - I felt not enough was covered <br /> <br /> Despite a few shortcomings, it is a touching film that moves. all kinds of emotions. (And hey, I would suggest, this film will be better to look, not Mick Jagger tries to portray Ned ...)
