Indignation is a very good movie! Robert Culp was very good in the film, and is perfect for the part! Its hard to believe that this is a true story, but what can you do? When I watched it, I thought, why they should do all these things. It's not right, but they have learned the lesson, if they chose to the wrong people! Anyway, if you ever see this movie on the TV to watch because of its good!
