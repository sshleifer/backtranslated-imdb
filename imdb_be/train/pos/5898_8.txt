Penalties Princess says US working girl Yolanda Donlon heir of a small kingdom, which is in the triangle where France, Italy, Switzerland and meet called Lampidorra. It seems as if Lampidorrans obliged to account for the whole of Europe and the main occupation of the country throws because of its geographical position. American billionaire buys the place, but dies before he can take the title. His closest heir Donlan. <br /> <br /> But, of course, the property has to go through a will in America and that Lampidorrans do? Especially because Donlan, who has now become a princess smuggling banned. <br /> <br /> Enter Bogard, who is on a trip to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It seems as if Lampidorrans a type of cheese, which they playfully called as Schmeeze. With a few bumps in the road, Schmeeze solves all problems as financial, geopolitical and romantic between Donlan and Bogarde. <br /> <br /> As Schmeeze work, and it is a wonder for the entire film. But here's a hint. The Lover Come Back Jack just got destroyed can grasp Schmeeze secret, when he was busy inventing VIP Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. <br /> <br /> In any case, Penny Princess beautiful mixture of farce and the British romantic comedy. Yolanda Donlon again plays the role of Marilyn Monroe would plunge if the film was made on this side of the pond. Bogarde was well matched to the part that was the beginning of his career as a romantic heart throb, the road in front of anyone but himself, suspected that he had acting chops he had. <br /> <br /> This film, unfortunately, as shown in the 3:00 am on TCM. But at least I found a reason to be grateful to insomnia.
