I realize this review will have me beat by expert critics patrol this site, but I will defend this film. <br /> <br /> The dentist is actually a very good film. Actions are not always at the highest level, but the thrill of a good and the story is good. In addition, you see dolt Linda Hoffman. Not that I'm an expert in this area, but the direction seems to be good and the story makes sense. Corbin makes a great horrible dentist. This makes the dentist that make shark jaws ... ish. This obviously had a fairly limited budget, but they are fine with it what they could, and the characters are well developed (the ones that count). <br /> <br /> end.
