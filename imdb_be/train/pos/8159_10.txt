All right. This film is a pure pleasure. It has a very Violent Horror, mixed with a small suspension and Lot black comedy. Dentist is really starting to lose my mind and it's a pleasure to watch him do it. This movie is for some people, though. Or you will be totally love or you hate It. Good movie to rent and watch If you do not have anything else to do. Also recommended: Psycho III
