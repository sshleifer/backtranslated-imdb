I saw this film, as it was the second feature on the disc that contains the previously forbidden video Nasty «Blood Rites». Blood Rites were really awful, I really did not expect much from this film; but in fact, it would seem that the director thrash Andy Milligan has outdone itself this time, the seeds Sin apex Blood Rites style and rise as more than enough slice of the patient sixties sexploitation. The plot is actually very similar to the rites of blood, as we focus on the dysfunctional family unit, and, of course, have an inheritance on the map. The film was shot in black and white, and the appearance and it reminded me a lot of trash classics "The Curious Dr. Humpp. There's barely any blood on the display, and the director seems to be keener focus on sex in order incest and hatred can be traced. Actions are usually bad, but most women get to appear nude in some time, and despite the bad reputation director Andy Milligan in fact, seems to the eye for this sort of thing, as many of the sequences in this movie actually quite beautiful. The plot is paper thin, and led kai of the filler film, but the music is bright, and the director also makes a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes himself, as most of them are more erotic. In general, this is not a great film, but it is likely to appeal to the cult fan, and gets a much higher recommendation than the better-known and more low quality «Blood Rites».
