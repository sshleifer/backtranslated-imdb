Well let me say something about these actors, they were really good decision, and from the experience of having the actor do bring the dialogue to life. If you walk into it, even fifteen minutes late, you will be shocked, the film has already begun. You do not want to miss the first few jokes when you came not to miss some jokes. <br /> <br /> Wow! I've never seen a movie that ended with a final denouement. Do not be harsh, I mean, I loved it, but it just surprised me, that actually kept going until he stopped! But I'm getting ahead of myself, let's start at the beginning of this year, when he started. The contours of the story goes like this, there are the people, and not to give any spoilers (* Spoiler alert !! *) (he did not have any sex ever (!) They use this plot device to set the story moving and there ( intentionally or not, it can go either way), some funny situations were the main characters, contains some irony and jokes and awkward situations, you know. <br /> <br /> Director uses advances in technology, combining film shot on the set and script dialogue, music and jokes to sdela beat a funny movie, made in the form of comedy, where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with a totally complete film between them. I went into this movie expecting to see the funny comedy from the fact that I already knew about it, and It left feeling as if I had just left the theater, which is just playing a funny comedy. TEN STAR !!!
