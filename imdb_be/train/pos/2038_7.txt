This film has surpassed all my expectations. I thought I heard that he was going to be rubbish, so I was not expecting much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first I did not take a good lead girls really do not care if she lived or died. After a while it definitely grew on me and became a nice character. This is not just some slasher, where people die for no reason. There is a background story, which takes only a few seconds of the film, but it explains a lot. I would recommend this movie to everyone. If you are not sure, just watch it anyway, it's only half an hour of your life. You will live for 80 years in any event.
