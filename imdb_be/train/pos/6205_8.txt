Convoluted, furious and incredibly, Fay Grim is difficult to sit through, but Posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it. She immediately touching, funny, clever. Supporting actors do it as well. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to tell you a story .. She includes symbols Henry Hartley tries to fool and a story of international espionage. <br /> <br /> the film works well if you are still with him realizing it. in a sense, it is totally inappropriate. It is becoming more and more ridiculous as you drag. (I resisted the temptation to exclude DVD twice). <br /> <br /> Fay Grim requires an adventurous moviegoer ready to tackle something that is not cookie-cutter. In the end, he offers something that can not be described.
