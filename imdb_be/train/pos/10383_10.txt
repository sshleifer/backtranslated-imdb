I saw this film in 1976, my first year in New York. I continued to live there for the next 26 years, but nothing like the delicate and beautiful never seen again, as this little TV movie. It was part of the PBS series, as I remember, and I will never forget it. <br /> <br /> There's no sex scenes in sight, just a gentle, moving, very touching moments, full of tension and excitement, all set in the conservative Boston (I think), World War 1 ambient environment where women played the role of a dedicated wife waiting for her husband's return from the war, and was not looking for a career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain wonderful career as a photographer, and I spent the next 30 years looking for her in an equally challenging role to no avail. <br /> <br /> There should be a video of this movie? Of course, it should be on DVD, but, of course, at least in the video?
