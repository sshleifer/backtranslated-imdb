Greetings again from the darkness. Understanding the mind and motivation of a remarkable artist. How strange for most of us to see someone who has to work ... no matter what the conditions, otherwise it is no longer a reason for living. To see Goldsworthy sculpture come to life and see his reaction to each very voyeuristic. This artist creates because it should - not for money or fame. This is his Lifeforce. If you see his failure, the energy seems to banish from his body, the bursting of the balloon. It is not the fear of beginning again, is that he takes his energy from his work. Watching him to create a character just have to capture and remember his work somewhat painful, but nonetheless breathtaking. He discusses the flow of time and in a minimum of dialogue and seems to be little doubt that the artist and the land are one in the same. If he says that he needs the earth, but it is not necessary ... I beg to differ. Only complaint is the music, it seems to slow down the pace further, which relaxes at best.
