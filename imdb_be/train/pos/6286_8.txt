Gone in 60 seconds. where I began, it keeps you in a movie with some good action and some of the coolest cars. people say that this is not a good movie, I do not agree that it has some of the cheese, but what action movie does not. I gave it an 8 out of 10 causes of action and comic, if you like Rock or Face Off, than the movie directly on your cell line to dose a good job with one of the most under-rated actors, in my opinion Linda Del -Roy. I think sometimes people look far into the movie a few times, you need to sit back and enjoy a movie after the words to ask ourselves, they have ensured that they where to show. that is, if they where going for concrete actions, this action pact. if they where trying to make a movie to change the way films are made and try to win all the awards for their good have they done? I think they did the gunman they are set to do, give him a chance, and you will not regret.
