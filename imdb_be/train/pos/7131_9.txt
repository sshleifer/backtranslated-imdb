This made-for-TV movie is a brilliant one. This is probably the best and most favorite role in the BAFTA winning John Thaw (Coffee and QC Inspector Morse). Meanwhile Oakley (thaw) widowed people lived in the village in peace for a while, as his wife and son had died, and now he was landed with evacuated called Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). How did he know this child, he begins to develop a friendship. While Willaim Mom (Annabelle in Apshen) does not want him back. After Tom gets worried William Sun contacted him, he was going to London to find him. Eventually Willaim gets your home with a loving family (or dad). Set during World War II is a great movie. He was put forward BAFTA Award Lew Grade, and he won the National Television Award for the most popular drama. John Thaw was number 3 in the 50 Greatest Stars TV. Very good!
