This film is really fun to watch if you love movies of different organized crime. Those looking for a crime film starring the charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way, it may be a little disappointed with the way this movie stride. <br /> <br /> It is a fun romp through the underworld, however, and if you are not familiar with Hong Kong movies, then you may be pleasantly surprised by this. I was somewhat disappointed by some of the stories made a wise choice, but overall a good detective movie. Some things do not make sense, but it seems to be the norm films East. <br /> <br /> People are just casually do things, no matter how their identities were established earlier. It's a bit annoying model, which penetrates even into this film.
