«Red Rock West» was by far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90s with a magnificent screenplay (John and Rick Dahl), who kept you guessing throughout and at the edge of your seat for most of the film. He was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and showed excellent cast including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper Lara Flynn Boyle and especially JT Walsh (in a memorable performance), making this an exciting and fun thriller that should not be missed.
