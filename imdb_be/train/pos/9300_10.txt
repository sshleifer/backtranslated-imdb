I do not know much about the Rat Pack, Frank Sinatra and always seemed a bit too shy to me full of myself. So when I call it one of my favorite, it has nothing to do with the tribute band mentality. As another reviewer said, Mad Dog Time of symbolism rather than realism. It Kafka (sorry, Kyle MacLachlan, probably the weakest of the very strong crowd when he was as good as Josef K), it is stylish, knowing, sarcastic and clever. Jeff Goldblum is navigating your way around the different characters, being careful not to shoot and act smartly and not dorkily, trying to be aware of the fact that he knows and others do not, someone he can shoot and whom he can not. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) has the ball, and the supporting cast look spot-. Symbolism, settings (one outdoor shot motion with Jeff Goldblum went down the stairs, it seems really strange after so many living lizardry), dialogue (style rather than practicality, this agenda), all of the characters that interact, in fact, NOT banditry. Fun to watch, it must have been fun to do. What the critics had to really secret ...
