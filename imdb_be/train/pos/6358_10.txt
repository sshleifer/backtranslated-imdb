I love this movie, but can not get that TNT did not like this movie. People who do not like this movie should be, Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe that Mr. Currie for all that makeup. And I'm sure that most of the actors and actresses in the film made the film for it. And there is a new face in the film. Taylor Momsen, who plays Cindy Lou Who. How to open, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of hiding. And causes a secondary pleasure to Whos in Whoville. Sicne we know that love Christmas Whos. While the Grinch does not like Christmas. And even makes fun little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), who is the daughter of the town supervisor (Bill Irwin). The film is directed by Ron Howard. And narrtor voice is made by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets from Space) cast as the mayor of Whoville. Who does not like to talk about the Grinch close to Christmas.
