I love these "Diaper BabyÂ» movie! You could not make a film as it is today, and it is rich in cinematic history. It is stupid and the film was made to make you laugh, it does. How did they ever get these children to "act" I'll never know. I think that they are valuable and children make me laugh, but so do others who have made this film, as it shows the naivety that existed in the early 30s. You must remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market crashed, the world depression begins, and these films were made to give the man a break from the real world. The fact that you can see movies for five cents over my head, but then the dinner for 25 cents too. It was a different time with a completely different mind set.
