I bought a DVD set on Amazon.com recommendations based on my interests. They hit the nail on the head with it. I remember watching the show when it was on TV, but always wondered what happened to him. Ten years later, it's like watching it all over again for the first time. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck well together, despite the fact that they have few rivals. Representing almost good (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never understood what Lucas had to be, but let it suffice to say that it has any special powers that I do not believe have been provided personal Spirit. It can make the phone ring, the letters are, or even cause human emotions change. However, there are not a few episodes where it actually becomes a good guy, despite all this. Overall, this is a great series, which, like many others, I can think of (IE Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and Underwater odyssey just to name a few) have been canceled, as soon as time. Stephen King's Dead Zone (Sunday USA Network), seems to be the only thing in this genre, which seems to be doing it. There is simply nothing suitable to watch on TV anymore. That's because everything about Christianity and Satan is offensive and should be immediately pulled out of the TV. Thus, at the same time, I'll just continue to buy DVD sets and watch the show, which still needs to be on television, but was booted television religious fanatics, so we can observe the "quality" shows as Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons (which is a bunch of crap, that is).
