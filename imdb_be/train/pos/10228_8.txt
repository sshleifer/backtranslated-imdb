Being a huge fan monster, I saw «Yeti» was an absolute necessity, especially after rumors about it so much. Thanks to the good 'ol bootleg market I was able to find a copy quite easily, and was pleasantly surprised when watching this film was actually, dare I say, decent. <br /> <br /> Worthy for what it is, in fact, namely cheese giant monster flick. He dies pretty quickly as Yeti meets pretty much right away, and we got acquainted with the various characters. They consist of some unscrupulous ones, some of them good, and the girl, which to a large extent one of the most beautiful girls absolutely amazing in any cheesy sci-fi movie, definitely. <br /> <br /> Yeti looks like a long -haired guy right out of the original Woodstock concert, but in fact, it's not as bad guy, especially after introduced to the world in some funky cage-like thing. Godzilla he is not - despite his rude awakening, he even i do not rave about (in fact, it rarely destroys anything in the overall picture), but it seems just looks confused, trying to figure things out. The Yeti, seems to understand English quite well (my copy was dubbed in English), and he knows who the good guys and the bad guys. <br /> <br /> However, we want to see a giant Yeti to do their job, and it's pretty much the entire movie, and in a typical low-budget fashion, he seems to have changed a lot in size depending on the scene, and there are even a pile of "false feet" of his shots were just standing there. <br /> <br /> Yes, the special effects are not very big, but there are definitely some good here. The scene where the Yeti breaks through the warehouse is done very well, and in another, he uses a window of the building, as a "step ladder" to climb down from the top of it - the shedding of each window with his foot, and often shocking passenger inside -. in one sequence, which actually looks much better than it should be in a "bad" movie <br /> <br /> «Yeti» never stoop as low as saying, "APE" does. In fact, the only time it even comes close to this nonsense, when a pretty girl is Yetite nipples become erect, and he raises an eyebrow in the "Oh, baby" way. But even that is not so bad, and like even gets a laugh from the audience <br /> <br /> The film is long enough for this kind of thing, but oddly enough it does not get boring. - the story is really good and just watch this absolutely gorgeous actress on the screen will make any man happy audience. <br /> <br /> "Bigfoot" can not be in the top echelon of the giant monster clicks, but it's certainly better than the other 76 King Kong rip-off, as the "APE" and "Queen Kong» very far.
