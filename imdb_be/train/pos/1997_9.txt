As a lifelong supporter of Dickens, I was always disappointed with the film adaptations of his novels. <br /> <br /> While his work is represented extremely accurate retelling of human life at all levels, in Victorian England, during which it was spreading the flow of humor, which can be either playful or sarcastic as dictated by the narrative. In a sense, he was a literary caricaturist and cartoonist. It can be serious and funny in the same sentence. He stabbed the honor, pride ridiculed, mark of modesty and empathised loneliness and poverty. It may be a cliché, but he was a writer of folk. <br /> <br /> And it's a comedy, which is so often lacking in his interpretation. At the time of writing, Oliver Twist, is currently filmed in serial form to the BBC. All the suffering and cruelty, but not by humor, irony and savage lampoonery. As a result, only a dark, somber experience: history is written as a journalist, not a novelist. It's actually not even Dickens. <br /> <br /> «Oliver!", on the other hand, is much closer to the mark. Bullying officials beautifully interpreted by the raging Beadle to drunken magistrate. A classic confrontation between Beadle and Mr. Brownlow, in which the law describes as "the ass, you idiot" could not have done better. Harry Secombe is an ideal choice. <br /> <br /> But the blinding cruelty there as well, callous indifference of the state, cold, hunger, poverty, and loneliness all well presented exactly the same as the Master would have wished. <br /> <br /> And then there is a crime. Ron Moody treasure as a sleazy Jewish fence, while Oliver Reed, Bill Sykes to perfection <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, Lionel Bart. - himself a Jew from the east end of London - takes freedom of Fagin for re-interpret it as a much more benign than the guy was the original Dickens. In the novel, he was completely ruthless, sending some of his own boys to the gallows, to protect himself (although he was captured and hanged). While in the film, he appears as something capricious father-figure, a native charity thief, not the corrupter of children, and last a long time anti-Semitic sentiments. Otherwise, very little freedom to make the original Dickens. All of the most memorable elements are included. Just enough threats and violence persists, to ensure the accuracy of the narrative while at the same time allowing for the children "feel. Nancy still beaten to death, labeled narrowly escapes drowning, and Bill Sykes gets exactly graphical retribution. <br /> <br /> Every song is great, although they incline towards sentimentality. Mark Lester mimes it perfectly. And it, and my favorite scene is the one in which the world comes alive to "who is going to buy it. It is even corny, but it's Dickens through. <br /> <br /> I could go. I could give a great a set of masks, the contrast between rich and poor. There is a high quality, effective British regulars more than you could shake a stick at. <br /> <br /> I have to give him 10 points, but I feel more Scrooge today. Soak it with Christmas dinner. None of the original was better implemented.
