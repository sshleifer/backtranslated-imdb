I was disappointed to not be surprised at the lack of opinion of this film has received. Once again, Billy Zane proves that he is more than just a pretty boy of Hollywood in the silent performance that combines spastic slapstick with understated pathos. Call it a silent film is inaccurate, since there is a lot of music and sound. It has a manic pace and full of stupid ingenuity that Ed Wood is finally starting to be appreciated for. Look at the cast list, and understand that all the glitters. No one is there to show his face. I believe that they are in the movie, to show their appreciation of Wood, and make wide, the physical form of acting did not see a lot these days. <br /> <br /> But, today, reviewers try to guess what is going to be a hit a lot more than they show any aesthetic appreciation for the film. And IWUETDID has no tangible target audience. This was done mainly for the love of the script Wood. Even after his death, the trendy social parasites inflicted another serious blow, and deprived the world of a minor classic. This is a very interesting and truly experimental film that truly deserves to live, at least on DVD.
