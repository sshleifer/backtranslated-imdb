Sorry, a couple of comments to me does not know the facts of the case. It is based on a true story, very publicized disappearance and murder of the action takes place in the region Wilmington, DE / Philadelphia PA from '96 through 2000. I must admit that I was very skeptical about how Hollywood would dramatize the real story and the events and was actually very impressed with how close they were to the point that all the time, reported local news programs and news Philadelphia Inquirer during the entire period of time. Of course, I immediately drew attention to the fact that the actress (who I like very much to Cold Case), who played Fahey did not look anything like her (Anne Marie was really beautiful). I must admit, however, that Mark Harmon really nailed the type of person who was exposed as a drip-x and behaviors that dripped exhibited throughout this period. Details of the case were not allowed ... no deviations from the dramatic effect ... even down to the carpet, guns, furniture and radiator. In conclusion, I would like to add that I met Tom Carper many times for different functions (a good man, though the politician), and I am very happy that he pulled strings in the Federal area needed to solve this heinous crime. Guys like dripped real, and it was great to see it finally behind bars.
