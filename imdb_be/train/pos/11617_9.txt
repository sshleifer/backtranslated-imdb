The premise is simple. This movie starts looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other at the airport, all take a 180 degree turn ... <br /> <br /> For example, I do not like kind of mind staggering story of love nonsense that pollutes the average cinema. And it is my humble opinion that Wes Craven, based on his previous films, meta-horror (Sceam) does too ... <br /> <br /> Following this logic, it is not surprising that Craven sarcastically takes his time I created a sickly sweet Â«sependipity love'-story, only to have a big Cillian Murphy ruins that all sugar-coated dream world ... <br /> <br /> within his character Jackson Ripner (Jack the Ripper, get it? lame, right ?) in this film is impressive, it comes from a completely charming to be twisted nihilistic Sicko, which is a plus in my bottom. As he continues to excite his victim (Jennifer Garner Double Rachel McAdams, which I found very annoying, by the way), you can not help but sympathize with the guy ... <br /> <br /> This is Wes Craven, embodied in Jackson Ripner, by Cillian Murphy, beat all the stupid chicken clicks ... <br /> <br /> Mr. Craven, I welcome you <br /> <br /> The best quote :. <br /> <br /> Jackson Ripner (after beating the snot out of Rachel McAdams in the toilet of the aircraft): "Thanks for the quickie !!! "
