A little masterpiece. Not so well written. Beautiful cinematography, I think not. This film was not so terrible, but it was not much better than average. The main story of the struggle with a very immoral teenagers have been focused more on the forbidden romance and why it would be ... really got to her, instead of scraping the surface of the mainly "because my mom says we can not." Some parts have been removed completely or processed to have a greater value to the fate of the two protagonists. Couple times I was wondering if the writer / director was a supporter of George Lucas classic American graffiti. Not that it is wrong to be a fan of this movie, but to make the film look like sometimes, I mean come on! The worst part of this was that MÃ¤dchen Amick was such a small part, I mean let's Dual !! It was only one, in one or two lines that are actually trying to southern accent. (Take a listen well, it was there, even if her character was from California! DOH !!) Maybe, if it was the other star could follow, and we would have more concrete sounding movie. Well, what can I do, if you have a director who is a director and not an artist as well. Too bad. Overall I give it a B- and it being a little generous because I'm partial to Mr. AMICO.
