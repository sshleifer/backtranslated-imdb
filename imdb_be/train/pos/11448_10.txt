I first saw this completely riveting documentary in its first issue in 2001, and it's really had a profound impact on me, so I listened to some of my friends to see it with me on reruns. Result: disappointed (Never!) Did not leave any of my friends. This star-studded film about the Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy, who creates some absolutely beautiful works of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, stones, etc.) to create pieces that will eventually return to its natural form ( a statement in a temporary state of all?). We will see Goldsworthy create several temporary works of art, as well as some of its long-term facilities in major galleries around the world, as well as several pieces in a natural world, as well. German director Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographs and edits this meditation on the creative process, which is a real treat for both the eye and the ear (with the ambient score composed and performed by Fred Frith, who a musician, as a rule, acute experimental / noise textured guitars, and also capable of musicians ensemble). Despite the fact that this film was available on DVD for a few years, if you can find a movie that highlights the revival of this remarkable film, by all means, look for it (it is easy to film, which was drawn up on the big screen with experienced system sound to truly experience the movie the right way). Many MPAA rating, but contains nothing to offend (if born alive sheep on the screen not to offend or disturb)
