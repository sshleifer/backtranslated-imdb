Production of The Thief of Bagdad full story in itself, almost as amazing as the story told in this film. Alexander Korda almost ruined doing this film. <br /> <br /> According to the Citadel book series film about the Great British films, the adopted son of the United Kingdom Alexander Korda conceived the film in 1933 and spent the years of planning and preparation. But the Second World War, unfortunately, caught up with cords and mounting costs for the filming of the grand event. <br /> <br /> spending budget will be held in the United States, too, only films DeMille always been free hand to Paramount since 1932, when he returned. But DeMille, nor his American contemporaries did not have to worry about the enemy bombs during the filming. Part of the way through the shoot, Korda transported the entire company in America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as a genie in our Grand Canyon. He certainly was not going to get the scenery like that in the UK. Korda also finished interiors in Hollywood all the time to rest on Christmas Day in 1940 <br /> <br /> The spectacle of things Thief of Bagdad earned four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography, best art direction and set to color film, and best special effects. Only the original score to not take home Miklos Rosza prize in the advanced category. Korda was real happy to take a decision to shoot at the Grand Canyon, because it is impossible to get a bad color images from this place. <br /> <br /> The special effects, however, do not overload the simple story of good wins over evil. Good two young lovers Justin John and June Duprez and Conrad Veidt as an evil sorcerer, who is trying to steal both the kingdom and the heart, as belonging to Duprez. It was a career role Veidt in to Casablanca, where he played a major Luftwaffe Stroesser. <br /> <br /> Of course, good gets a little help from an unlikely source. The beggar boy and a thief Sabu, who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself during an international movie star. Literally growing poverty operates like an elephant groom for the Maharaja of Mysore was seen by Alexander Korda, who needed a native of lead for one of its features jungle. Sabu grabs all the innocence and mischief of youth as it performs a fantasy Arabian Nights a boy who topples tyrannical. Good message to be sent in 1940 in this. <br /> <br /> The Thief of Bagdad holds up surprisingly well today. It is a timeless story about love, romance and adventure, in any order you want to put it.
