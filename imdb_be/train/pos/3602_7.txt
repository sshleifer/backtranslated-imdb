While the history of caring kid turns to boxing for self-esteem and anger management is hardly a new thing, the story is given a fresh twist here if the main character is a girl and not a boy. <br /> <br /> Diane has a problem at school. She just can not stay away from the fighting. In the house of her father constantly put her down. Her brother teaches boxing at the gym, and one day, when she takes him in her arms, she decides that she wants to train. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to call this film "Monty girls", I think. But this is not what this is about. The story is actually very beneficial to the main character, who is a girl and not a boy. Thus, you may be dealing with a lot of problems at once. The first problem it is not accepted because it is not a girl-girl, and then, when it comes to the boxing gym, because she's a girl at all. It is also the story of how the goal can change someone's life. Positive things can make you grow. I do not want to sound pretentious, because the film does not feel pretentious at all, but what I say is true. <br /> <br /> In addition, Michelle Rodriguez is very good at those. It's a shame, really, that she was stuck in a "tough girl" typecasting now, because it's really not that part in «Girlfight» is all about. Of course, she is a woman boxer, but it is more significant moments that really makes it shine. <br /> <br /> So, maybe it's mostly average loser story with a twist, but he lifted the path above the crowd Rodriguez 'performance. I rate it 7/10.
