I must say, as a fan BSG, I was not exactly sure what I think about this show. I saw it on the big screen in the Arclight cinema today (as part of the dropout Paley Center), as well as the cast and filmmakers said after wards. Ron Moore said that they "wanted to dissociate themselves from the Cruiser, and do something else, and that, yes, they will lose some fans, but I hope they get the others." <br /> <br /> Even without talking, now I'm a fan of the new show. But that's what I thought about the film. <br /> <br /> I loved it. It was really very good. I think that I am a true sci-fi (or «Syfy '- I really have to enter it) freak, because I totally see it as a series of strong and he has a rich history and has kept my interest <br /> <br /> it begins with a small? .. a group of teenagers who were planning something that for me was the weakest link and a little confusing. actor plays "Ben" was supposed to give us more than a glimpse of his strong convictions. actress plays "Zoe", it seemed a little flower, but she played a teenager (and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thought "Zoe" was the Cylons on the ground, the danger of being a geek BSG). If they are hoping that this will be a new Bamber / Helfer / park, they want to rethink it. Surprisi ngly, it is adults who attracted the attention of viewers. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz gives a stellar job as Daniel Graystone, a man so often visited by his family tragedy, he jumps at the first opportunity to obtain his grief and does not let go. He makes the frightening and fascinating job of conveying a cunning knowledge of the character of the inner world of computers and people, especially in the scene in which he weaves a web to a young teenager of his daughter, he catches it and then dismiss and releases it. Not one sign at all "serial killer", he played on Gray's Anatomy, is really impressive actor. HN <br /> <br /> It is equally strong, though not in him almost as much as is Paula Malcomson his wife Amanda Graystone. She is just as intelligent and well-written and well played as part of Stolz and I totally believed that they were a couple, and the couple who have been together forever, and have a strong relationship, something you rarely see these days. I'm looking forward to see what was going on with this family, and I hope that they give her is so much to do both in Roslyn BSG- she's strong and smart, and she pounces on her child, you crawl, it really cool. Not to mention her eyes, which contained magical powers, which, as they intensively. The scene in which she assumes the government agent- very short scene, but beautifully played- really gives an idea of ​​its power. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, show that it is not running at 100% for me were the scenes of Esay Morales and the type of mafia clan from him. He does a good job in general, but I do not believe in these mobs power or threat to intimidate them. I found myself wishing that this whole storyline was a bit more mysterious and hard to understand; as it appears almost a tribute to the godfather, they kind of hit on the head with it a bit. But given time, I can see how it will develop in an interesting "up / down" kind of thing, with the poor minorities (Morales and others) against the rich people who run the planet (Stolz et al). And to be honest, I do not like it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their Name-, which was very well-played scene. <br /> <br /> Note to fans of the BSG, boy plays "Willie Adam" is not really very similar to Olmos, but he's just a kid. Regardless of whether or not it will appear larger than it was in the movie, who knows? I'm sure I could not say. But it does not bother me, because he was not as interesting as everything else going on around him. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays "Sister Clarice," and it scary and weird in every scene she is in. I do not know where it will go, and with whom she will eventually, but I was very impressed by her actions. In this film, she was kind of on the side, but, obviously, are to play a very important role in the future. It was nothing like her character in "Rome", I always find impressive cast. <br /> <br /> One good surprise- music is actually better and less obvious than the BSG, in spite of the fact that this is the same guy does it, Bear McCreary. It has a catchy and unusual approach that took me by surprise, I would have bought this regard, when I had the chance. <br /> <br /> As for the "discussion" after the show, it was organized by Seth Green, Ron Moore was a very intelligent and eloquent, David Eick Treshchalov wise (as well as his video blogs), Esai Morales told a long story about the way he was thrown, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and does not answer the questions (but I 've always had a thing for him). Paula Malcomson was tough (she took Seth Green to task by mistake saying that she was "24"), and the girls who played Zooey and Lacy were both favorite. Grace Park and Helfer were there, answering questions about how they did the scene, which operate with them to BSG. . Overall, a very interesting and wonderful evening <br /> <br /> I give the show 9 out of 10 and really looking forward to watching it all unfold <br /> <br /> Note :. I just watched it a second time and I hope that they are investigating that HOLOBAND was originally made for. I have no idea what it could be, but it has a great fascination for me.
