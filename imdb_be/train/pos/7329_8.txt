I really liked this movie. Humor was a little away for a while, but I liked how the story moves between the dramatic and serious throughout the film. This is only the second film where I saw Verdon action (another was «Un Sacco ~ d Bello»), and I can understand why the Italians find it tedious, but he thinks he's played well its role as a loving father. <br /> <br /> My one drawback of this film is that I knew that this was the case in Italy - somewhere in the middle or in the south, I suppose, but I felt that I had no idea about the place. This film would take place in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Delhi ... All the time I think it's important for a movie to take place, to give the audience something to relate to. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, I think you will enjoy it. It is not Fellini or Rossellini - this is not realism or neo-realism. It's a comic story of the gravity of the moment, that might actually happen to any of us.
