Well, of course not, women are too sensitive and need to be average, which is interesting to reflect on the mother to the whore, but not a pseudo-art, extravagant, or explicitly focused on. Unlike many of you, I've only seen La Maman Et La Putain twice. How many good films, I noticed, my opinion of him has improved after a second viewing. All I know is what I saw and even delve into further exploits, until I myself purchased DVD. I still understand why I like this movie so much, but in fact, I do not care, why? Although I'm sure I could have, and will form an excellent explanation. Okay, so you can not agree, maybe it's a little sad from time to time, I am not an expert. Blonde reminds me of a beautiful Grushenka.
