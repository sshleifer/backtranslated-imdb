Cheerful Neil Simon comedy, which causes laughter from beginning to end. The late Matthau is grouchy ex-comedian, who had persuaded to join together with his former partner (the late Oscar-winner George Burns) for a final reunion show on stage. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin is Matthau-X Agent and nephew, but two have as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love grumpy character Matthau in - .. It is just as it always has, and yet very different <br /> <br /> Burns as scattered old, as ridiculous as Matthau <br /> < br /> Matthau: Want crackers? I have a coconut, pineapple and Graham <br /> <br /> Burns :. How about the usual crackers <br /> <br /> Matthau: I did not get the plain. I got coconut, pineapple and Graham <br /> <br /> Burns :. Good <br /> <br /> Matthau: They're in the cupboard in the kitchen <br /> <br /> Burns :. Maybe ,. later <br /> <br /> Or how about this: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I made a black and white knew what I said <br /> <br /> you have to see it in movie to understand it! <br /> <br /> as a whole, refreshingly cheerful, sweet, sincere, warm, belivable comedy character with a heart, and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /> <br /> They just do not make them like this anymore! At that time, when all the new comedies are gross, juvenile and silly, it leans towards a soft core comedies really - funny characters, smart and funny dialogues and a grand entertainment <br /> <br /> One. the best buddy comedy of all time, right up there with "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," "Lethal Weapon" and Â«The Hard Way." <br /> <br /> You can have a difficult time finding it for rent or on TV, but believe me, it will be worth your time <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars <br /> <br /> -.
