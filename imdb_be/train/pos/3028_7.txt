This might be the best film. This makes the resistance at points, and the central story moves from Boyer is completing his mission in Boyer avenging the death of Wanda Hendrix, but Graham Greene is the author, which is really hard to screw up. His stories all morality tales, because of their own reasons Catholicism, guilt and innocence (very relative terms in his world), and the human condition. <br /> <br /> Boyer Louis denarius, a well-known pianist, who joined the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He was sent to England to try to carry out the transaction of purchase and sale of weapons, which is desperately needed. Unfortunately, for a denarius, he is literally on its own - every one of his contacts is willing defector to Falagists Spain. In particular, Katina Paxinou (Mrs. Melendez) dark pension keeper and Peter Lorre (Mr Contreras) Teacher with "Esperanto" type international language.

Boyer is a great actor, but he is not retractable, and Herman Shumlin Sun Hawks. Her next film returned her Bogie and hawks, and her star has resumed this domination. <br /> <br /> It is a grim film (as the novel). Boyer Mission never works, because it has too many hidden enemies everywhere. But the villains as well as lost - their lives <br /> <br /> With Dan Seymour as a suspect foreign tenants Katina Paxinou (and the person who destroys it) .. It is worth watching to catch in the Warner character actors were doing, given weakness in the side.
