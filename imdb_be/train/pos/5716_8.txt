Never seen a Japanese Grudge-movies, but I really like it. I rarely get scared when watching movies. I can jump, if the effect and the sound startling enough, but are afraid of the movie is a rare thing for me. But I'm scared of the Grudge. Maybe because I generally do not wait, when I watched it. I did not expect to get scared. I do not know about that. It was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is a film that you seem to either love or hate. Most people seem to compare it with a Japanese-Grudge movies, but even if I did not see them, I believe that it is not correct to compare any movie, really. This movie is worth it alone. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, most people say. I do not agree. History minimalistic, and done on purpose. storytelling techniques are used - broken time frame, for example - very well done. The director knows exactly what he does, and I believe he's got his vision through the way he wanted. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 8 out of 10. This is a movie you like to watch, hatred. It's as simple as that.
