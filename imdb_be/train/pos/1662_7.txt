Artemisia film can be considered treason, or as a true artistic license. <br /> <br /> What can one say ,? <br /> <br /> In recorded history, Gentileschi was subjected to a lamb, and still maintained that she was g *** ed, as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem eloquently confirmed. <br /> <br /> in a film other torture, she refused to denounce her lover / intruder. <br /> <br /> How can a film deviate so much from the received history, but still inform the human heart? <br /> <br /> The answer is not hard to find. In the film, the director and the cast fill the gaping hole in the historical record, with the power of imagination. <br /> <br /> This has led to the conclusion that differs from the recording. <br /> <br /> So be it. I find _both_ recording and film, to be convincing. <br /> <br /> In both the film and (I think) in history, wormwood was an artist before everything else. <br /> <br /> For that vision, framed as part of a wonderful (sic) of the film, I am sincerely grateful. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen a film that is so forced my eyes. <br /> <br /> David Broadhurst
