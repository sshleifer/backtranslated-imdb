Life and Times of Little Richard, like Little Richard said, and the producer and director of Little Richard, was how one sided as one of his songs. This is not a biography or even a docudrama, but there is good writing, great energy and outstanding lead actor playing Richard. All music on Little Richard, so it rocks close to each lipsync song. <br /> <br /> The film covers the early childhood, carrys through the formative years in music, wild success and Richard throw it all away to praise the Lord. It's all related to each other well and a clear return in 1962, he managed to stay away from the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles, which are open to him. <br /> <br /> My main objection is that his outrageous behavior cultural underestimated counter, and you do not get a sense of how his audience experienced it at the time. Some of his power, he is still, the sun comes up to its potential. He seemed tame compared to what I remember about it at the time. <br /> <br /> The best scenes of Richard getting thrown at Lucille and write a song about it and strip bikini shorts at run time to make a point about not having a decent place to change. <br /> <br /> If they got in the "Copper Liberace" Richard used to refer to himself in an interview, that is history. Believe me, I've just seen him perform several months ago, and he still flirts with a pretty white boys, giving a particularly good dancer in the auditorium, his headband. Almost 68 and still strong, I recommend this film or any concert or appearance of the storage vessel can be found. Little Richard is always on
