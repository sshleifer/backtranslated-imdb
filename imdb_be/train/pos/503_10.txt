After 7 years of follow up that terrible delusion called Star Trek Voyager I felt quite numb. Next Gen, and DS9 was a bloody good stuff and Voyager destroyed the TV Trek. This opened up with probably the best pilot in the show Trek. The crew was really good as was the choice of actors for the parts. Scott side played a typical first-time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to already know all the captains from to. The rest of the crew were very popular in his role, and I think they went a good first season. If the show was prematurely canceled, I was very disappointed. In the mirror darkly he showed us that the actors were able to. It is a pity the film or television film has never been considered. So much history and foundation of the federation were to say, including the outbreak of hostilities with the Klingons ..........
