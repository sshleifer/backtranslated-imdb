Hitokiri (which translates roughly as "murder"), a / k / a «Tenchu», which translates roughly as "divine punishment") demonstrates Hideo Ghosh at the top of its shape. Do not miss this one, or another classic Gosha, Goyokin! Hitokiri not only one of the best films of Goshi, it is one of the best "Samurai / chambara» movies ever, and perhaps one of the best Japanese films ever exported. <br /> <br /> Be careful, all the intricate details of the plot in hitokiri can be a bit difficult to follow for those unfamiliar with the 19th-century Japanese history. Nevertheless, the basic human drama is obvious, and is open to all spectators. In accordance with the norm for Gosha, hitokiri gives yet another variation on the traditional theme of his "loyalty to his master," against the "do the right thing." . However, Ghosh develops his favorite theme with such grace that it does _the_ movie to see (along with Goyokin, of course) <br /> <br /> I think that breaks down like this: If you want more than a simple , action-oriented stories, you can see Goyokin. However, if you want more thoughtful, multi-layer (albeit gloomy) drama, to see it. <br /> <br /> (Well, well, in fact, the historical background is a massive GRAP power among various clans samurai that either (1) the work of reform, but save the Tokugawa shogunate, and (2) those who trying to establish the Meiji Emperor as supreme ruler of Japan. of course, these clans are working "for" Emperor Meiji were often less interested. in "reforming" in Japan than in ensuring their own clan more power in the "new world order" oddly enough, the whole feudal system was officially abolished as one of the first reforms Council Meiji is ironic twist, as -. Gosha big on irony -., which makes the whole story all the more bitter) <br /> <br /> what distinguishes "hitokiri" from other movies Gosha Gosha is a constant sense of cinematography. Every shot is thoughtfully and (just like Kubrick's Barry Lyndon), each frame of the film can hold its own as a fixed composition. Of course, this is typical of Gosha. Hitokiri really stands out with stunning scenery, including (as with Goyokin) many riveting marina. Just watch the opening sequence, and you're hooked! Make no mistake, this is not the English part of the period: hitokiri is extremely strong (do not say you were not warned) <br /> <br /> What else besides a cool camera work makes hitokiri stand out.? Performances, it seems (to me) a little more subtle in this. Katsu Shintaro (with Zatoichi / Hanzo Razor fame) is a star performance as the conflicted hero / anti-hero, Okada IZO. Katsu humanity manages to instill character, which seems to be almost more than the wild animals than a villain. Throughout the film, you are never quite sure if you are busy or outraged nature Okada. At the same time, Katz image with hungry hunger Okada in attitude, and his later attempts helpless ransom seems the kind of person that you can not help but feel empathy / sympathy. Of course, after watching Nakadai Tatsuo play tormented protagonist in «Goyokin», it's great to see how he plays the ruthless villain in "hitokiri". He is perfect, there is nothing more to say! <br /> <br /> As a final note, perhaps more interesting to buff than casual fans, do not miss the last screen appearance of Yukio Mishima (yes, closeted gay right-wing ultra-novelist who committed suicide by hara-kiri in front of a crowd mocks Japanese soldiers he " kidnapped "in 1970, and has been a film about his life and work, made by Paul Schrader), which actually does a pretty solid job painting a noble (for the killers) Shinbei Tanaka.
