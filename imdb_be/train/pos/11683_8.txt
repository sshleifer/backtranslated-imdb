I really enjoyed this episode, which was a great surprise, given the bad reputation that seems to have acquired. From the viewpoint of net sheet, Â«The 16mm shrine" absolute treat with fantastic dialogue and character analysis, typical Sterling. In particular, I really enjoyed the philosophical indulgence episode, the decision topics of existence and reality, while balancing it with a psychological themes such as denial, pride and desire. "Sixteen-millimeter shrine" episode about how these ideas are based around the reluctance to accept the changes may seem to alienate people from the rest of the ever-changing world. This also fantastic example cerebral Gloomy zone; one that explores the mind, not the world beyond. All of these elements come together really well to create a thought-provoking and incredibly interesting 25 minutes. <br /> <br /> The episode is not without drawbacks, however, that generally lie at Lupine and Leisen shoes. Oddly enough, I felt Lupino unconvincing throughout, and only a few scenes that could count as memorable. This, of course, be an absolute shame, considering how well Stirling wrote her character. In addition Leisen, it does not seem to know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes having them stand on the set to do almost anything -What probably explains why the poor performances took Lupino with half effort. Fortunately balm does a good job of hiding a lot of weaknesses, helping to redeem the show with the actor's point of view, at least. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, however, if you're a fan of classic film and cerebral sci-fi, it should not be as bad as it is sometimes made out to be. In addition to writing, which I mentioned above, this episode also have some fantastic photos (it still amazes me that the show looks like it's good for nearly fifty years later!) And a decent enough set design. In general, "Sixteen-millimeter shrine" is a great episode, and, above all, of course, the one to make you think.
