I grew up watching the full as a child. I stopped watching it for years, but about two weeks ago, I began again to watch it again. Now my children are watching the show, and they like to watch it. My kids can not believe that the DJ on the show, and I'm the same age. <br /> <br /> I love the show, because this show you can watch with your family. It has good teaching your children can learn. Nor is there any drug use and abuse it. In addition, if the kids on the show, there is a problem, they are always open for your family for help. These are children should receive messages from the TV Now days, turn to your family for help, but not to medicines. Children need to see more shows like Full House instead of half clutter on television is now days. <br /> <br /> I love the show because it makes you laugh, and down to earth. This demonstrates the problems of real life, and family matters. There is always a lesson you can learn from the show. <br /> <br /> I vote show 10.
