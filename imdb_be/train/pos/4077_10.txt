I first saw it in the early '90s on British television, I did, as it was then, but I missed my chance to tape it, many years have passed, but the film has always stuck with me, and again I had lost the hope of seeing his TV the main thing that stuck with me was the end, opening the lock of the really touched me, it is easy to observe, has a long history, beautiful music, the list goes on and on, his IQ to tell me how good it is, but it will take there own best bits away with them when they saw him, but the animation at the highest in zrovni and beautiful to watch, it is showing its age in very few parts, but which has now become a part of this wonderful, I'm so glad that it came to DVD, as one of my top 10 movies of all time. Buy or rent it just to see it, the best view is only at night with a drink and a meal in reach, so you do not have to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
