I watched this movie so many times in my child hood, that even in this day, I can pretty much re-viewing all dialogue. And when I look at it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh. I think it's amazing how they were able to teach the animal, especially a cat, to the extent that they can play a major role in a feature film. However, watch it now I can, unfortunately, be noted that this is not a masterpiece, I once thought it was. But I prefer to remember the way I felt about it when I was younger, watching it on VHS in my fist television that would obscure the image of yellow. And taking into account that this is a children's movie, so I would still, of course, give him 10-10.
