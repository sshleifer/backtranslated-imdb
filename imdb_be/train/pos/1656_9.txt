"Thieves and liars" present us with a very realistic portrayal of levels of corruption that affect many Puerto Ricans and force them to make difficult, if not impossible choices about their lives and their loved ones. Acting cool, considering that some of the non-professional actors; excellent choice, which increases the level of reality in the film. Photos disperse story without interference, as it should be in this type of film. The script captures the characteristics and attitude to «Boricuas» in a very deep level. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a documentary! Watching this film, you feel as if you are secretly entered into the real Puerto Rican society and are invisibly watching his compromise. I loved it!
