This is the best movie ever made to deal with the subject of AIDS. This is a documentary about two who live and die from the disease. The film is beautiful, dumb, funny and incredibly moving. First of all, it's an amazing true story of love. Make sure that there are a few handkerchiefs ready, before watching this film --- you'll need them. Extraordinary.
