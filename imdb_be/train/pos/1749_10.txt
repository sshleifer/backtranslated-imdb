Steve Carrel Proves himself a great master in these beautiful, original, unscrupulous breath of fresh air. I wet myself, how ingeniously hilarious it <br /> <br /> In general, the film's title speaks for itself :. Andy Stitzer is a 40 year-old, who works at an electronics store. He's a little nerd who loves video games and comic books, and has the largest collection. His peers, who work in the shop with him to know that he is the Virgin in quite sex dialogue-filled poker games, and then Andy has to go pretty funny as hell Odyessy gross sexual awakening, but there is always screwing up, causing it not to lose their virginity but he eventually gets lucky at the end. <br /> <br /> Leave the little ones at home, but take the whole family to see this wonderful romantic comedy for adults. He will have you hooked and crack up from the beginning, and by the time it ends, you'll be wishing you were his extra thick absorbent undergarment. The only thing I can say about it is too bad Steve Carrel was not recognized as an outgoing person 20 years ago. He, of course, won the best breakthrough male performance in the coming years MTV Movie Awards. You can bet your hard-earned dollar on that, folks! <br /> <br /> I give it a perfect 10!
