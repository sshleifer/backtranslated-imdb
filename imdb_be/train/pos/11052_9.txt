When I was six years old, I learned of a series called "the Los Campeones", and even if I was a kid, I did everything I need to convince my parents to let me watch «The Champions» and "Avengers" once week, I think it was the golden age of English series ... (I already have a full cycle «The Prisoner»!), but continued a few years later with the "People of the future", "Worst Witch" (I'm just me or is it "Harry Potter" in the girl, of course, before, as much as I want "the Campions» is located in zone 1 or zone 4, I am also waiting for "Doctor Who" (a package in a number of n abortion, UHM, maybe 300 DVD, please, I could not spend more for it, 8), "People of the Future", as well as several other "low budget", but the big story will be available within my areas of progress. I speak and understand in English, but not all my relatives are doing, including my father who introduced me to these great stories ... I hope that someday, someone may feel the attraction of these rows, and then could sell them as I watch them initially ... Named or subtitle, but in the same format, I saw them. Remember that the zone 1 or 4 wrong with my TV!
