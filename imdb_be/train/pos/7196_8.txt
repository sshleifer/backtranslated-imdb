The serials are "Fighting Legion Zorro" is one of the best action series of the 1930s. Made at a time when studios still throw a large field, this one has a wall to wall action throughout its 12 chapters. <br /> <br /> In 1824, the president of the newly formed Republic of Mexico City Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) is trying to put their new country on a sound financial footing. To this end, he ordered that the gold-rich cargoes forwarded to the capital from the local San Mendolita mine. <br /> <br /> Members of the local council of conspiring to steal the supplies on behalf of Don del Oro and the golden armored god, who with the help of a local tribe who hopes to establish himself as the head of Mexico. Against him, Don Francisco (Guy D'Ennery), forming a legion of locals to help Juarez. If Don Franciso people killed Don del Oro, in another, the fopish Don Diego (Reed Hadley) comes to town. Diego aka Zorro takes on the legion with their friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Buddy Buster). Marker plays the heroine's sister Ramona Volita (Sheila D'Arcy). <br /> <br /> Both Diego and Ramon meet local decision Counsil. It soon becomes apparent that some of the other Board members are allied with Don del Oro. Firstly there is the Chairman of the Board (of Leander-de Cordoba), head of the police Manuel (John Merton), Chief Judge Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzolez (Edmund Cobb). Zorro suspects that one of these people Don del Oro, but one? <br /> <br /> Here are some hair raising escape from Zorro and his followers of the followers of Don del Oro. We always present rolled rope bridge, a deep chasm between two rocks, over which only Zorro can move to safety as well as the usual assortment of explosions, fires and passenger and freight cars, broken or going over a cliff. Hats off to an excellent team here in the Republic of stunt men are legendary Yakimov Kanatt and Yrigoyens, Bill and Joe. Canutt performs his signature stunt jumps on the running teams of horses, and then falls under the coach, which he repeated in other films, including John Ford's "Stagecoach," the same year. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Zorro finally exposes the false god Don del Oro and restore peace in the valley before driving off into the sunset in chapter 12. <br /> <br /> Others in the cast include Jim Pierce , Curl Dresden and Charlie King, like so man Don del Oro and if you look closely, you may find bits of future production and stars Lone Ranger Clayton Moore and stunt Canutt in bits. "Big" Jim Pierce, incidentally, may be best remembered for playing Tarzan in 1927 in "Tarzan and the Golden LiomÂ» (1927) and for his marriage to Joan Burroughs, daughter of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Thoroughly enjoyable.
