When John Singleton is on, it * is * !! And this is one of his best films. Not quite as tight as Boyz-but-Hood, but close to it (and a lot of the same stellar cast). This film was very well written, very well together, and a very good shot. There's very little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial (eg: from Fudge to get money for 6 years in college and a lot of expensive things there is no mention about the rich background ... And why not a professor there Phibbs office professor of its growth? * must * have one ... and while we're at it, for students of the Faculty of engineering, the sucker or not, rather dull character Remy - I think he has a little bit more in terms of basic intelligence - he speaks and acts as a total buffoon) <br /> <br /> But that aside, the film was very sharp .. good character array and n nktav view; Singleton and does not take sides in history - many of the unpleasant characters, and it does a good job of interspersing Panther and racist scene together to show the folly of both sides with <br /> <br /> A large part of it. Film was the highest; I especially liked the scene where Kirsty Swanson gets intimate with Taryn and Wayne each scene spliced ​​together very well. Also / Deja Malik scenes were very well executed, as well as <br /> <br /> dialogue was a bit more at times. This film had a tendency to get * really * didactic at times, and it also tends to kill the point he makes over his head, if the points are as clearly, because sincerity (we really do not need an American flag with "learn" recruited it give some credit, we are not idiots ...). And to top it, even though * most * times the Singleton uses melodrama pretty good, sometimes it becomes a way * * too cheezy (Deja death, which is fine as long as it does not scream "WHY !!!", which simply destroyed the continuous effect and the scene). <br /> <br /> But the actions, in general, has been top of the line. Incredible performances Omar Epps (probably the best I've ever seen), Kirsty the Swanson (who knew Buffy can act ??), Michael Rapaport (surprised the hell out of me ... after True Romance and beautiful girls I, even though it was a one-actor role), and, of course, Ice Cube, and Laurence Fishburne is * always * excellent. <br /> <br /> Downside? Connelly was flat; although this is not entirely her fault: its role stereotyped and one-dimensional. Generic highly. And Tyra Banks, who played the role, nothing more than the reverse. She whined and whined and whined. Another in a long line of models turned actresses who fail miserably (although there are a few that prove an exception to this rule). <br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Wow! Awesome soundtrack (which is definitely worth buying!), Which is suitable for film, like a glove. Each scene has a double song (although the lyrics Tori Amos started * really * annoying me to the end ... not her best work). Liz Phair, Rage Against the Machine, Ice Cube ... as one to make a mistake ?? <br /> <br /> In general: very good watch, very strong cast, a great script, a great movie. 8/10.
