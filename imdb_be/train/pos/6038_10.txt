But on the contrary, sorry bud, I completely understand how you can be involved in the movie, because you feel about this topic (and there). This horror film, the main character will give any Charlie Brown Subtitler run for his money, he just mumbles constantly, always laughing, most of the scenes just feel uncomfortable with the characters more often than not looking over to the other with a view .. .its your line is now , I will respond. Top British comedy? Please, my friend, there is a strong word from your bad bad yourself ... at the end of the day ... the sun goes down ... and this film is terrible. I mean, well I have done to the people involved ... they made the movie ... and maybe, motorcycle enthusiasts can be in it, but the people who are still living here on earth, with a real sense of humor will fight this more smiling at the Christmas gift they bought them ... nan is that too harsh? I'm sorry ...
