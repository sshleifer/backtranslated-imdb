I enjoyed this movie as a child, when he came out, and to this day still. A simple story with the search for the stolen girl and adventurer literally right soft skills. It has actors who were better known back in the day. This should not keep the audience from giving it a whirl. Wayne Crawford stars as the protagonist Jake Speed. Of course, it may bite some elements Romancing the stone, and Indiana Jones. But this film is done well enough to keep him out of the cellar. I'm surprised not too many people know about it. This should be in the shadow of the other films in theaters as early as 86. I watched it then on cable television. It can be difficult to find as it is out of print and on VHS and DVD. I managed to get a DVD with less than $ 8 Ebay! Cool Flick.
