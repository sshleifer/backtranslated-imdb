Very funny movie. Classic movie funny Eddie Murphy 80s. I saw when I was a kid and I have a good memory. Classical irony Murphy does not fail, the film is funny, well done. Murphy in the'80s did a lot of action movies that were a way for him to joke about all that dangerous. The result can only be assessed some, but II film from 1986 is still the same. The atmosphere for the movie at that time well and good special effects for the film period. A good movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic Murphy, the actor, who recently disappeared. The final part of the anthology, the handsome actor who plays the role of a Tibetan monk. That's all.
