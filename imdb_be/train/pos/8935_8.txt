"Protective (L'Intrus)» is a visual pilgrimage to mysterious life. <br /> <br /> Grizzled Michel Subor plays "Louis Trebor," as Jason Bourne as an old man with a hidden past, to live simply in an isolated cabin in the woods on the right paranoid reasons (but rather attracts young women, which can be useful for him ). We learn more about him in his sleep, flashbacks and a journey that may unfold in chronological order or not, as well as through its harsh interaction with family, lovers, business partners and odd nemesis. As "The Englishman," the film resonates with the father / child regrets and suspicious past is revealed through the clips from old films with the same actor as a young man (in this 1965 adventure film Sex Zhegaaff in "Le reflux"). <br /> <br /> in stark contrast to the mood, we meet his son Sidney (Grégoire Colin), who must be the sexiest husband's house in the world, because it is sweet and tempting to make the repair of household and caring for a child, kid, and every it should be a working wife. Of course, the director / co-author Claire Denis has to be created by his fantasy woman, if ever there was one lesson and the other filmmakers to shoot foreplay. There's a more extended scene where he's looking for his father in the woods, carefully carrying angelic child in a bag. He kept up his father does not have all the relations of his father is not able to maintain; it is not surprising that he does not think that his father was "a lunatic". I spent the rest of the film in fear that something bad will happen to him as the true nature of his heart gradually alienated parents are played out before our eyes. <br /> <br /> The film is a puzzle, but Subor relentlessly exciting as we watch his country route and negotiations nefarious transactions, and voice-overs for Denis "beautiful work" annoying anyway. We need to find out from the horizon and by signs that he was going to Geneva, Korea, and the South Pacific. the passage of time is indicated by the seasons change and create scars and healing. There are many images of water for cleaning and to zoom out. <br /> <br /> Continuing his admiration morphing colonialism to globalization as well as to play a little on the stereotypes of the Mysterious East, and Russian criminals, Denis included elements of Stevenson, Paul Gauguin Tahiti and Marlon Brando idyll and a 40-page memoir of French philosopher Jean- Luc Nancy, the latter for the title and plot of heart transplantation, used for ironic immortality limited topics that really has an impact. <br /> <br /> while "Luis" thinks he has succeeded in the above limits, rules and morals, have some fun in the last act, as the locals do not quite know what to do with it try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey, even if it is again isolated. <br /> <br /> Some people in the audience left in frustration on the elliptical, but surprisingly beautiful, the method of the speaker history. Unconventional narrative does raise many questions about the details of the plot.
