I was waiting for this movie to come out for a while in Canada, and when he finally, I was very excited to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course, in the beginning, this is a very sad movie (and it was a new day years - which makes it even sadder) - however, it sticks with you. The next day I again thought about it, because, although it revolves around something so emotionally draining, you know, in a few days, it's such a beautiful story. How one person can be considered as a reference to so many people, but sometimes you can be blinded by so many things. And as a symbol of Diane Keaton's view it keeps the rest of them just being there. And they retain it in the process. It was such a great movie, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) provides an ideal comic. This is definitely a film that will need a box of tissues, but really stay with you for a long time.
