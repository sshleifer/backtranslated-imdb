I just watched this movie again and are still alarmed by the number of cynics that dissolve it, as soon as the New Age Dad. A great film that takes its time to develop, it keeps coming close to going over the edge, but never does, and ultimately, meditative, which affects and truer life than most films are people who reject it "coincidence" may see. I was angry at the time that such films as "The Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (although I liked the last one) were nominated for best picture this year (not to mention the fact that the "Silence of the Lambs" won!) And it was completely ignored for a nomination for best screenplay for an exception. After the revision, I think history supports his initial reaction!
