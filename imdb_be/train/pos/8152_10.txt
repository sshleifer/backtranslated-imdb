I just read the latest comments about this movie and I would like to respond. you probably are not familiar with the original story rap group N.W.A. which dates back to the beginning of 1988, he left the band to pursue a solo career in 1989, Ice Cube, and ultimately, in 1991, a group of parting when Dr.Dre left. which led to a large amount of beef, starting with the departure of the ice cube and dr.dre in 1991, the story was partly based on this. <br /> <br /> even more this movie was 90 minutes laughing spree, the way they explained dandy juice song to be a political statement was fun. not to mention the "romance" was tasty connection. and if Vanilla Sherbert got his ass kicked, as well as a record company executive and cheerful and they have managers get shot every time, too. <br /> <br /> people who do not enjoy this film could have done do not get it were complete idiots, my opinion
