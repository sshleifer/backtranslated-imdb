There are a few movies or films, I think the favorite for many years. The way the gospel was one of them. I watched it as a young teenager, and I would like the opportunity to watch it again. My favorite part was the fact that <br /> <br /> 1 / Jesus was blond, <br /> <br /> 2 / last supper was a great meal. <br /> <br /> 3 / He I loved to play with children, <br /> <br /> 4 / his death was for all people and for all time. <br /> <br /> film can not be theological sound or high quality action, but touched my heart at the time. Besides, I'm a fan of Johnny Cash, and it was a bold enterprise. If it ever comes out on DVD, I'll buy it for purely sentimental reasons.
