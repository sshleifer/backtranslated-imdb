"Did another gangster film Oh Ritchie with StathamÂ» thought the average fan, waiting for another Snatch / Lock stock; expecting maybe a few time shifts, but not too hard, "I and the children" to swallow after a few beers. <br /> <br /> Oh, look, you have to watch this movie. Not a cup of tea, no additional diet Coke from the counter, not "keep it running" scream as you nip to the fridge - watch a movie laughs, except for those, you can make yourself by significant violence (and if it floats your boat, so be it), but a sharp solid direction , excellent dialogue, and large projections <br /> <br /> My favorite -. big Pussy on The Sopranos, always reliable of the hood.
