French Naudet brothers did what no one else did, they had a video camera the day that this tragedy occurred. They were in building # 2, if you could see the documents drift down, people are hitting the ground by jumping from a height. <br /> <br /> I mean, that is so far away, when both buildings collapsed, they went to work, their camera is still running when the white dust covered them, they found the shop door and got inside, but all these footage is real, and I think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us. <br /> <br /> Ten stars go to the Naudet brothers, who were filming this unusual film that I watch every 9/11, so I'll never forget that this country has experienced. I think, if I remember correctly, it shows the first death of the priest of the fire, while it is held in the church and his honorable funeral.
