Fortunately, as a student, I was able to watch «Diagnosis Murder» for several years. It's basically about a doctor who solves murders with his LAPD's son, a young doctor and pathology. DM provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made it different from many other police show and worth watching over and over again it was cast, and the recording quality. The main cast has given good performances and artist Van Dyke roots shine through with magic, dance and humor. DM was the best aspects of a fast paced, witty script and, of course, toe tapping score. Unfortunately, it was unfair compared to the "Murder, She Wrote." DM is far superior boasting more complex puzzles to solve and more variety. Now he has left the TV worse place. Gone are the days Feelgood, family cop shows. Now there's just depressing "sandy" ones.
