I was very impressed with this film. I would have to rate it as one of the best westerns of the classical era. I say that all this :. Acting, mature dialogue, no- nonsense stories and great cinematography <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Mann, who made some good footage of film noir about the same ages, and some westerns, such as this one. It has the same appearance of the film noir. Manna and Jimmy Stewart collaborated several westerns during this period. If you like this movie, I recommend the movie Mann-Stewart «bends". <br /> <br /> In general, the story of a man, "Lin McAdam» (Stewart), who owns the prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon, he won fair-and-square in the competition. Then it is stolen and is transmitted from the villain villain. All these villains interesting characters. <br /> <br /> aiding Stewart plays this interesting story is Shelley Winters, Dan the Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. All of them are fun to watch. It was a bit of a stretch, however, to see Rock Hudson plays Indian ( "young bull"), but you can not have everything.
