I can understand those who do not like this film because of lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> First of all, these girls are not Geisha, and brothel residents, and one that does not know the difference do not understand half of the movie, and, of course, is not the end. It is a complete work of art about life and women's needs in this era. It is important to all, and, of course, how they dress, around the movie is more than words. For those who thought it was a sad geisha film, I suggest you read a little about the community before making a conclusion that because of the reality. This is the work of Kurosawa's life, and I am sure that the director knew the meaning of the silent piece Kurosawa to the right intellectual range.
