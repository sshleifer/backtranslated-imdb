Sophmoric this film. But it's funny how things come out. This shows that "the boys locker room mentality", which takes the "other side." It is good to see such tides have turned and how stupid they are. But this is probably not news to most women, because (just ask a friend), "they've heard them all before." <br /> <br /> cautiously with a small group or a batch of mixed sex and 97.3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours. And the rest of 2.7% ... have you ever really make them happy?
