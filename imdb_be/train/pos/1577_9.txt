SPOILERS Inside. <br /> <br /> It seems that von Trotta was much more comfortable with the fact that the balance of personal history in comparison with events in history than she was in her early Versprechen film, Das (1995). <, Br /> <br /> direction seemed carefully controlled and visually, I felt that it was very attractive - especially where the visual storytelling was concerned (a mixture of the title sequence and lighting a new candle in modern times to commemorate the death of the various characters in the past) <br /> <br /> in order to explain two things that many people were confused:. <br /> <br /> first, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although it may have seemed to have in mind that this is not the goal. Von Trotta told me so yourself! (And she's a very nice lady, by the way!) <br /> <br /> Secondly, timing of events was actually historically accurate (the actual dates are listed on the large memorial plan) and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film. There is evidence that Goebbels was annoyed, in doing so, and had planned to eventually return to those whom he is free. <br /> <br /> In general, what most impressed me the most was that it was an original story with a much 'on-movied' era. It seems a shame that it took so much time (for different reasons) for this film to hit our screens. <br /> <br /> More of the same please, Margarethe!
