Intensive actors like Bruce Dern, Jason Patric and Rachel Ward, combine to make this a modern film noir winner. Of these three, I do not know who was the most interesting as they offer good performance and intriguing characters. <br /> <br /> Patrick makes the story in this film noir, playing an ex-boxer and the mentally ill. Wow, that in itself makes for an interesting guy! It looks dull, but it is not. Ward is a close-fitting, attractive, cynical, clever and compassionate co-conspirators kidnapping plan, which is bad. Bruce Dern is also in the mix, and Dern never ceases to fascinate in about any movie. <br /> <br /> The film could be considered a kind of boring to the average viewer, but I found it fun .... and I do not like depressing movies normally. What I found a kind of bizarre crime film. Take a look and see if you agree. This is a fairly unknown film that does not have that status, because it is just a good story and well done.
