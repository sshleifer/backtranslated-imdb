This film is really real and casual. It's really hard to find movies like this in movies beams are now in Hollywood. I really like to watch this movie, I bought his DVD Tuesday this week, and I watched him 4 times. I love Spanglish accent Paz, who with a very cute as it is. And her actions and Morgan so funny and natural. <br /> <br /> My film taste can be very different from the others, but I must say that I really love this movie, simply the best! <br /> <br /> I have learned something more about the life of the film (well, or, at least, the US life) ... life really random ... Sometimes, we meet someone, they pass by your life and be your friends coincidence, and not spend so much time with them, maybe just for a while, but to enjoy that "" while "" with them, and then, and they will never be meet each other again, but sometimes with a truly memorable one. Just keep these points in your mind, how grateful and happy memories ... <br /> <br /> This film may Gen. s cheap in manufacturing cost, but its value is not cheap. I rarely can learn anything from the movies, but this is an exception.
