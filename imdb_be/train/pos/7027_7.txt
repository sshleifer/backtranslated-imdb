«Bye Bye Birdie» is not one of the best musicals of all time, but it's a lot of fun, and accessible to a wide audience. The original film could be fine, Dick Van Dyke reprising his signature role on Broadway, but instead they were busy with the plot, so the film is very unsatisfactory. This is a remake that aired on ABC in 1995, is much more true to the original script, and include some of the original songs, and have been used on a national tour, which this film took off starring Tommy Tune and Ann Reynking ( who choreographed the film.) <br /> <br /> Jason Alexander is very different from the type of Dick Van Dyke, but well chosen, Albert, (for him «Seinfeld» days, he started in musical theater.) Vanessa Williams is ideal for Rose. They are also a lot of work with Tyne Daly as Mae and Mark Kudisch like Conrad Birdie (a role he played in the national tour). <br /> <br /> The film is not without its problems, though. The main responsibility is Chynna Phillips, who, none the less attractive looks and feels too old to be a teenage Kim. And George Wendt somewhat insipid, like her father, throwing several among the "children" out (including the original cast member Paul Lind stole the show with.) <br /> <br /> But on the whole, that's fine, well-made film that material deserves.
