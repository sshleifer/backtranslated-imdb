I saw this film on DVD yesterday and was Gob-smacked and amazed. Untouched DDL operations with just blew my mind, and I was amazed by all the cast and his wonderful acting. All nature was so authentic to me, I really took the DDL for Christie Burns and Brenda Fricker for his mother. Go and see it! You'll cry your heart, but you will feel a wonderful catharsis! In addition, he teaches you one important lesson: Identify all. You may be crippled in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but if you are stubborn enough, then you will not have any problems. If you can only work left leg you are still good enough to be an artist or a writer. The worst thing you can do if you are mentally retarded, to indulge in self-pity. It does not go, and the only person who will be sorry that you do.
