Of course, it was a bad and useless, and sometimes banal, but, at least, the filmmakers did not try. While most TV films border on the edge of mediocrity, this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it. The cinema was pretty good for a TV movie and Viggo Mortensen Aragorn reflects shades in the film about a man who played by his own rules. Most of the historical sequences were a born poor, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. I was kind of annoying Jason Priestley role in the film as a rebellious shock-jock, but again, it's a TV movie! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was brutal. Nevertheless, it was nice to see, Tucson, Arizona featured prominently in the film.
