Although this may not necessarily be so-called "classic" film, by today's standards, it's still worth a look. The main reason why, because after going through this film, you get the feeling that you too have undergone a counter-cultural idealism of the 60s, no matter how good or bad. <br /> <br /> I had a chance to see this film in English class literature at SUNY Geneseo, and although at first it seems a pointless part 60 icons, the film is not just "thrown together". <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that if you leave the film feeling unsatisfied and confused, the film did its work: he gave the devastated look at the future, that leaves you feeling insecure and angry. It was perhaps this is the same feeling that the film sought to explore in his youth is an example. <br /> <br /> Thus, "Zabriskie Point" can not say, very good (and interesting) story, and at the same time, his characters can be one-sided and predictable. However, it also conveys just this kind of clich√©, rebellious desire to go out of existence, as Mark and Daria have to share. Even anti-establishment students are unreliable they are rebelling against the gov't.
