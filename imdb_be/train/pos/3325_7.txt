Well, I do not usually watch the Farrelly brothers movie. I can not remember ever watched one. I do not remember seeing the film Jimmy Fallon. Well, I did an hour a taxi, but I said, penance and was forgiven for this mistake. But this film was Drew Barrymore, and I just think that she is the cutest thing. I do not know what it is about her, but I just smile all the time I am watching her. It just fascinates me so. I mean, I even watched Adam Sandler only to see it in 50 First Dates. How sad is that? It was not the best baseball movie - it was not to be. It was a love story sad puppy that was hanging on a single that has never let him, until he found what he should be given that. It was a predictable ending, but there was so much on the way there, that made it worth it.
