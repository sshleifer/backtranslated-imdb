It takes patience to get through the eccentric David Lynch, but-- for change-- life-affirming journey chronicles Alvin Straight, but stick with it. Although it is moving as slowly as just John Deere, when he meets a stranger for the good of his pilgrimage, we learn a lot about the aging isolation, painful regrets and secrets, and ultimately the strength of the family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth cap his career with a real performance of the year, boring and poetic, silicon and restless. And Sissy Spacek corresponds to him as his "slow" daughter Rose, who pines over her own loss while caring for her father. Rarely has modern film preached so positively about the family.
