Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love, and Mom and Dad can enjoy watching as well. Growing up in the 80 th year I enjoyed this film, this story and all of the actors. I recently purchased this movie on DVD, so if I have children of my own, they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as I do. The plot is fun, a group of children get in the way, they did not expect, when they soared into space on overachieving robot. They were in the AUH on the ground, but when they realized that they do not have enough oxygen to make it back in panic sunk. After they had recovered enough oxygen from the space station, they returned to Earth, as even the best of friends and extracted respect for life.
