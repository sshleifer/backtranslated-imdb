"Life stinks" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. Black and white is always present in our lives. Mel Brooks performance is brilliant as always, and the other actors of the work is also good. This film has a certain flavor of Capra, is why so well. <br /> <br /> There are some memorable jokes, such as the one that Brooks is trying to make money by dancing in the street, and all the people passing by just ignore him when he meets funny crazy person who believes Paul Getty, and then they start arguing and slapping each other. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen, you do not know what you 've missed. <br /> <br /> This film tells the story of the old and the eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and the reality is that this movie has a happy ending, and the reality has not. <br /> <br /> Yes, in fact, life stinks.
