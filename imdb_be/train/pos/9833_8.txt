Terrorists are trying to steal the secret biological weapons, and in the process of trying to escape, he is infected when it containing a deadly agent is under threat. Soldiers can get a deal, but the suicide makes its way to the hotel, where he tries to escape. They eventually make it to where he was hiding, and "clean" hotel and its passengers. Unfortunately, they control their own bodies for cremation, and if you've seen the Return of the Living Dead, you know what happens next. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 widely panned by critics and fans of the zombie as a complete mess of the film. Despite the fact that this is a fair assessment, it is not without its high points. On the one hand, it has a lot of bloody death to save Gore-hounds happy. There was enough of zombies that seem to come from everywhere possible. They are in the water, roof houses, hiding in the trees, and for some reason they like to hide under a pile of dead brush, only to jump out to attack, as the heroes try to escape. There's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator. You have to see it to believe it, because it alone, that the scene does Zombi 3 requires inspection by IMO. This may have some terrible editing and some dubious ideas, especially from a doctor, which should be one of the worst actors I've ever seen, but the zombies 3 is still very interesting film. Sometimes it's nice to sit and watch a movie that does not require anything more than your time and an open mind. Zombi 3 corresponds to the account, and then some. This is even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers and watch it with some like-minded friends. I give it a 8/10, simply because of the great pleasure.
