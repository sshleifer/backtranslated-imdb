At the same tune as his Americana Drums Along the Mohawk, John Ford captures the American story in a way that is fictional, but very believable. Henry Fonda made three consecutive films in this era with Ford, and all three are in the specific time and place, with a focus on setting and culture. The Mohawk, a pioneer of America is in full bloom with the Americans fending for themselves against the Indians, and other forces. Here, Ford shows us the 19th-century America; a time when the invention and creativity start to blossom and this country is really getting big. Among all, it was a tall, thin, young lawyer from Illinois named Abe Lincoln, and the movie fictionalizes his life as a lawyer, predicting greatness he would later do. <br /> <br /> Fonda wonderful in this film, capturing the essence of what is considered to be Lincoln's person, though no one knows exactly what it was then. Set and the supporting cast is also good to work together and provides a unique balance of brilliance Ford of the American dream and its many forms. This is not a film that should be taken literally, but symbolically, showing that Lincoln was really warming up for the events in his life that were to create his legacy. We even get some of the scenes between him and the young Mary Todd; and it is difficult to see how they end up together, but that's not the point. I think this is just a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, which is widely recognized as the greatest American president. His quiet and simple behavior was rare then and it is today. In fact, our government certainly needs more people like him.
