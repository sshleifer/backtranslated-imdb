When I saw the birthday girl I liked it so much I decided to see every movie Nicole Kidman I could, only to find all of them disappointment by comparison. I theorize that while the presence of a certain star, usually guarantees a certain level of quality due to their artistic control, with Nicole Kidman impact it has is detrimental to film a delight - IMHO. For example, Dogville, even depriving the viewer of something visually detract from the existential epiphany she hammer home or other films that promote gay and lesbian, as a worthy anybody's attention, or other domestic animal causes Kidman. <br /> <br /> Here it is a natural woman, and she does a great job. I do not know how and who was able to keep it, but apparently it worked. The way the film portrays its openness, despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman. And, therefore, what makes the most desperate hopes men slightly attainable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the fact Actor goes from a shy clerk to the meme in the space of the film sounds like a male ego expansion fancy, but its transformation adequately plausible. Nha shamefully contrived, as it would be in the film designed to support the male ego. Instead, he just registers the necessary growth arising from the films in unique circumstances. <br /> <br /> It is also a very charming is the way criminals are portrayed as the perfect man, in addition to their criminal mission. Her band has colds scrape communication, which is alien to American culture. And while they are his enemies, they never really his enemy. In fact, they taught him to be competitive. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised Kidman ability to physically appear in Russian. It was interesting to me, whether its origin was Russia, but none of the photos I examined her did not show any trace of him. Maybe it's just a make-up, but it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that they beat her over the head again quickly so that it can be another great movie. Despite my gratuitous dripping Ms. Kidman Where, a message it is a great film in all respects, and probably a role in life.
