I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but there is nothing new. <br /> <br /> Everyone here grouped with other war films, this film was in the wrong section! It is not a war movie more than "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is a film about the asylum or "Cool Hand Luke" prison film. This is a film about identity, inconsistency, self-confidence and expense of this type of person. <br /> <br /> The story is the same as "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Cool Hand Luke", it in good company, and it has its own. Its these films is to be carried out against and compared, and not the "Apocalypse Now" and "Platoon." <br /> <br /> Eric
