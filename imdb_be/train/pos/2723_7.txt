Restrained skillfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it is also so bent on realist, sometimes more clinical than entertainment. Describing the brutal murder of Midwestern family, author Truman Capote on the little things, and wrapped up the reader in the subject and objects! Brooks departs wildly from this approach in favor of something closer to the docudrama. Although he films on real locations, he keeps his distance. Killer portrayed as depraved morons who, of course, they were. They did not see how strange the soul (as in the book of the hood) and the savagery of the act terribly dull. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake excellent as killers like the supporting cast, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as a reporter (in the Hood "character?") A reference picture is great Conrad Hall.
