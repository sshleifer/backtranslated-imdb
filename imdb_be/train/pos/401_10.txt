I have just returned from Hong Kong on my summer vacation and I saw The Legend of ZU. I thought I was pushed * S! It was so creative and unique. It Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, with much less drama. Even if someone thought that there were too many special FX (yeah right!), You can not complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so beautiful !!! Legend of kicks ZU ..... A * S !!!!!!!!
