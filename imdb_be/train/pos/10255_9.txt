This film is the first of six infamous Guinea Pig films and one of the best. At the same time, it looks realistic and unrealistic, just knowing that the film is a fake. The story of a woman who had captured and tortured in many different ways. Man in the beginning of the story receives a letter with no return address, and it includes mango video showing torture. People who capture its testing human limits before they die. Some scenes are shocking, such as eyeball scene and others are not shocked by the girl being beaten 100 times, because you see the punch in almost every film. This film has a lot of gore, so I would recommend it for people 17 years and older. <br /> <br /> 9/10
