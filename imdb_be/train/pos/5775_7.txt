Come on, people, look at the title! LOL! I remember this film on Saturday Late Night Creature Features years ago. This is a big, cheesy monster flick with a funny bad action and two strange village idiot, that add to the factor of schlock. The 2 guys Redneck rental boats are the movies! LOL, and you will love the boat scene, where an English guy and his wife talking about all the stars, and it's southern and sunny. Bloody hilarious !!! You can tell that they just do not care about the story, they just wanted to blow filming as soon as possible. As a result, you'll love it, if you like the 70-hack.
