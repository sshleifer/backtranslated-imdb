I enjoyed this movie, perhaps because I have not seen reviews, etc. It was delicious and a bit of a "fuss." I do not know why it did not make a big splash than it did. As far as the story goes, I might offend some aspects of the character of Paul Reiser, and I was able to "see my dad" in the nature of Falk. It made me remember a lot of the past, when I was a child, and listening to my grandparents, too. If you enjoyed films like Grumpy Old Men or on the golden pond, this is your movie. A "sleeper", in my opinion, and one of those feel-good stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser have been many excellent verbal fights, but nothing has been exaggerated. I would say that the rate of at least 8, may be higher.
