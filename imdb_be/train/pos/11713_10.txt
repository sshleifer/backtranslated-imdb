I think it took a lot of courage for her to come forward like this. Unfortunately, when a celebrity is suffering, that is what most helps people. But in her case, that she did was great. I was in the field of protection within five years of mental health, and I think it's great that mental illness is not terrible word more, and I think it helped. I always thought she was gorgeous and always will be. I am glad that she wrote this book, and that the film was made. She's a wonderful woman, and I hope that it continues to operate. She's been through a lot and came across this. I would very much like to see her more to work with children, especially children of actors. Its test is not supposed to happen, and I think she will be fine as a mentor for young people. The film was so moving that I was very moved. Suffers TBI brought the beginning of my disorder and has PTSD, it is good to know that someone has the guts enough to show her life as she did. I believe that it has helped this nation and people in general understand that there are others like them, and that there is help. Thank you, Ms. Duke, or Anna, which ever you prefer.
