Since I first saw it in the theater, he was my favorite. Since then, I've seen it countless times, and I never get tired of it. The unit has a lot to do with it (Colorado, I know I will be jealous), but the plot is original and I liked the way he used the small town of knotweed as heroes. There has not been a movie that I can compare it too. John Lithgow plays a clever villain, but I love how he is completely in his element - he must follow Tucker around, and that's what keeps it interesting. This action movie, it's better. I do not think I'm going to see the other, that is so interesting. <br /> <br /> You do not need 50,000 shots to qualify as an action movie. He just needs to keep you captivated, Sun wounded.
