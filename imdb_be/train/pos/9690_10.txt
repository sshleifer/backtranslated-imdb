Paulie was cute, cool, nice and quite complete. I went to this movie expecting to see the typical "family" film, one that points would have found me unconscious and spit on the floor. May mindframe immediately changed when I was quickly fascinated by the integrity of the film. It is rare that you find a family film that carefully and can be coined "useful." Most cheaply made, written and produced purely for attracting younger members, who will then drag the unhappy elder mind numbing 65 minutes overused gags and conspiracy. <br /> <br /> So, Paulie was a plot. He told the story of a young girl (Mary) and her best friend Paulie the parrot, who incredibly could talk and quite often are encouraged to talk with her. stupid jerk Marie's father found it unbelievable, and I thought Paulie be harmful to the mental health of his 4-year-old daughter, and quickly tore them apart. We follow the adventures of Paulie (and misadventures) as he tries to reunite with his beloved master, meeting a lot of memorable characters along the way. Oh yeah, Paulie could do (reasonable) conversations and had a quick accent of New Jersey. Cool. The site held a thick and entertainment everywhere, holding my draw. Paulie is the best family film, that I found, and truly enjoyed. Ever. Seriously. Grab a copy and sit back and enjoy a real family movie, with the whole family. A lot of sleep. I promise.
