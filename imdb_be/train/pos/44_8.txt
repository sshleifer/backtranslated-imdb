When I was told that with this movie, I thought it would be another chick flick. I was wrong. This movie sends a strong signal to judge others. I was deeply moved. All I came across, I recommend this film. No one came back saying it was bad. Busy, also did a great job with her role in this film. I do not know much about his acting career, but wow, they, she pulled off the end of the casting was great. <br /> <br /> In the beginning it was a bit slow. But once she was in the hospital .... wow, the film picks up again. I have no idea why this film does not say in the world of cinema. My wish would be for this film to be released again and touted more ... because it sends a strong signal in an easy hour and a half.
