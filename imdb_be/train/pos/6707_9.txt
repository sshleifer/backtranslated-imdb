I know that sometimes it's really corny ... But acting strange and Melissa Joan Hart as cute as a button. I like this show a lot, and I'm almost embarrassed that I have b / c shows have a reputation. for what is really corny, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be quite a low budget - sometimes the actors are changing and you just have to deal with it ... As Sabrina's father is 2 different guys throughout the film ... I mean, they do not We could simply say that he was an uncle or something? Nevertheless, I can not help but love this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a really cute couple and Salem absolutely hilarious. I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for some light and funny entertainment ... My favorite episode of "Mardi Gras Madness" ... hilarious episodes. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm really not in favor of some of the seventh season of turns ... Once you get to college, Morgan joined the group and its dialogue is painful and very bad acting ... plus it is ugly, so jokes that she is the only surviving of its beauty was lost on me ... But I think that it was designed to have a really good eighth season, and I was very sad to see one of my favorite show canceled!
