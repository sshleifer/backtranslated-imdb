This is the second film based on the life and times of ultra-hung porn star John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also roughly based on his life. Maybe someday someone is going to make a film about the life of Tommy Byron instead. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story is not very well said. There are a lot of Law & Order episodes, with more twists and turns than the miracles, and the director never received a criminal case going on with any kind of appetite. Val Kilmer has two problems - it is not as hung up as Holmes (or prosthesis at this time, unlike Boogie Nights), and it looks much better than vegetate Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director did not enter a single likable personality among the actors. Racist, immature scum he hangs out with, or his wife, and the police do not get much in the way of performance. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie Bogosian says Paris Hilton to "get lost". <br /> <br /> Having said all that, who is interested in sleaziest side of the pornography business in the 1980s, or the actual crime should not miss it.
