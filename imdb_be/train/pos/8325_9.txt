I loved the idea of ​​this film since I first saw the trailer for it. Einstein has always been one of my heroes, and his image is affectionate, playful, slightly mad genius was enough to get me to watch a movie. Spices Matthau as Einstein made it even better. <br /> <br /> history of pure fantasy, but a great friend. Auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who happens to Einstein's niece. With the help of four charming godfathers of Physics, Ed goes on a quest to win the heart of Catherine. Throw jealous fiance (who is the worst example of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower in the mix and you get a pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with wonderful character actor and perfectly sweet and Daogo performance. Matthau play Einstein mischievous imp; Cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins strangely endearing, as Ed and Meg Ryan plays a step above its normal level rom-com. Stephen Fry fun as «RRRatman» and fiance Ryan; who lack a single romantic bone in his body. <br /> <br /> The film has fallen below the radar of most, but it is a great treasure that is not sour with repeated viewings. He has a first-class writing and speech and gentle delicacy in less fragile world.
