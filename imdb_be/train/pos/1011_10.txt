I love Jack jokingly as "The cliché is ..." or "over the top cliché guy, black, oily skin, his native terrible ...". He's just hilarious! Daniel begins to catch up with him! Well, Jack is not in the team more (on the way), or else it would be sarcasm mania !!!! I just love all the sites (season 8, a little less, I must admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, I'm starting to pick up facial expression (or more) of the Jack Daniel's and Tilkogo ... it's just all the theoretically possible and exciting ... oops! Their I go again !!! Unfortunately, I am also starting to pick up traits from Carter, and all this is my parents Nutz !!!!!!! Well, in conclusion, I think it's good for another three seasons or so, especially if they keep on packing episodes with all this humor, drama, action, and so on !!!!!!!!!!! !!!! !
