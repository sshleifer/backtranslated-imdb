William H. Macy is at his most sympathetic and convincing here as a hit-man and a loving father who wants to get out of the family business without angering his imperious father. Treads most of the same territory, TVs «The Sopranos» in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (he visits the shrink), but still worth watching thanks to some tight direction by Brommel (I look forward to what this guy sends hereinafter), a great script and great performances all around. Macy perfect, as always. This is probably his best role since "Fargo." Donald Sutherland in his awful best as overbearing father. Tracey Ullman gives a surprisingly exciting dramatic turn as the wife of Mace. Young David Dorfman well as a bright and sensitive son Mace (many of his sound commercial lines libbed and excellent). Even Neve Campbell (who I usually find abhorrent) exciting as the troubled young woman who captures the eye Mace. All this is punctuated by a number of moving and crisp pace, leading to predictable, but still powerful climax and informative and moving effects. This film deserves a much wider release, I suspect that it would be connected with the audience.
