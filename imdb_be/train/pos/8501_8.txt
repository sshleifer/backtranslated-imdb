I think this is an excellent example of the differences between the two cultures. This is a great film to show in class sociology. I thought it was pretty funny, and I must say that I'm a sucker for that "allows you to combine and get a job" portion of the apparatus. It seems that most people do not realize that this film is not just a comedy. It has a few dramatic elements in it as well and I think they blend in nicely. Overall, I give it a solid 8.
