Experts snobs and pseudo consider "far from the best De Sica" Those who suffer from a serious lack of innocence, find a problem connecting to this masterpiece. De Sica spoke very direct way. It has not Italianness tortuous self-analysis of contemporary Italian filmmakers, or the most bitter parody Germi, Mario Monicelli bittersweetness acrid, celebration Visconti or Antonioni cold observation. De Sica told us stories, like his father, sitting on the edge of his childhood bed before they went to sleep. There's no attempt to philosophize. Miracolo Milano and to a lesser extent Il Giudizio Universal realistic tales, or what we today call magical realism. The film is a gem from start to finish, and Toto is the kind of character that you accept with an open heart, but it is, of course, requires you to have a heart. Movies in its pure form. Lovely.
