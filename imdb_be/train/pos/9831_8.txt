We have high expectations with this. ,, Because it ZOMBI 3 official sequel to Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. However ,,. ,, His co-director Bruno Mattei (from Zombie Night), and is not written Dardino Sachetti but Claudio Fagrasso (Night Zombies) and shot in Phillimines as the Night of zombies and reminds the zombie night (Hell living dead) a lot. as a result of it more as a companion in the Hell of the Living Dead than ZOMBI 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis, who produced Zombi 2 and its editor Tomassi (?) and EFX gianetto De Rossi gave ZOMBI 2 its magic. ,, Zombi 3 entirely magical. ,, It's like peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut butter. But over the years, I've grown to accept ZOMBI 3. I could swear I saw a version where the soldier was bitten on the hand and went to the hotel room. ,, It was a senseless Fulci cut and Mattei / Fulci cut is the one on the DVD.
