Buddy is an entertaining family film set in the time when the "humanization" of pets, and makes them cute was adopted way to get people to be interested in them. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, Buddy shows the great love that the main characters are animals, and each other, and that they would do anything for each other. <br /> <br /> While it's not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla quite realistic most of the time and the mayhem that occurs in the home, as a rule, fun for children. <br /> <br /> This movie misses the opportunity to address the mistake of attracting wild animals at home as pets, but does show the difficulties. <br /> <br /> we recommend the film, which was a first for Jim Henson Productions.
