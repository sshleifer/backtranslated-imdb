"Odd Couple" is one of those movies that are far superior to its reputation. People are becoming aware that they sing a song, they complain about living with messy "Oscar" or dismissive "Felix" ... but they are under-selling the film, not knowing he was not only a neat guy lives with sloppy guy;. This is a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce. it's also damn funny from beginning to end, but it's kind of comedy that arises from the realistic, stressful, and just terrible situations. For example, some viewers actually found the film to be a little uncomfortable, but I think it pravdapadab enstva his strength. In addition, Bulldog face Matthau, just cracks me up! my favorite comedy, cute country.
