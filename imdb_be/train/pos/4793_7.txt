After watching this movie, I feel like I know a little more about the United States. David Lynch is synonymous with shock and surprise for the fad, and in fact these elements are missing simple story. However, in the light of what I have not witnessed before by Lynch. We start with a simple family who lives a quiet life, but end up with absurd array of interesting characters with depth in their lives, which may not be apparent from their introduction. Especially touching was the scene at the bar with two WWII veterans discuss the events of fifty years ago, and how it still affects their current life and emotions. If you are looking for untamed or Dune, Sun here. But if you are looking for real people with real stories, this is the movie for you.
