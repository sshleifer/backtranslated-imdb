Ten years after the first film, James Belushi, one of the most gifted, and lighter watched comedians in the last twenty years, returns as Detective Dooley for this film. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting more than the same with the first film, you will be disappointed, but it's still a good film. Realizing that all dogs with a man of battle of wills scenario is likely to have been used in the first film, this one is a little more psychological in its approach as it focuses on the offender with the fixation with the recently deceased wife Dooley after she refused him a book and Dooley blames her death. <br /> <br /> script may not be the best, but the film allows both Belushi and Christine Tucci, to show his good acting skills, while keeping enough light humor of the first film, to make it work, and the chemistry between the two stars It is for all. <br /> <br /> The most simple, easy-going film that, while perhaps not worth the purchase if you are a true fan of either the first film or Belushi is definitely worth a look if it comes on TV. <br /> <br />
