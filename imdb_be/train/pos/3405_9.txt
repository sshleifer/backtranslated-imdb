"Garden Allah" was one of the functions of the first length, the film strip 3-Technicolor. In order to correct the previous poster first function Technicolor (after a 5-year exclusivity deal Disney) was 1935, "Becky Sharp", which was a costume drama, which used color for it is sharp color costumes. <br /> <br /> "The Garden God" looks as if it could have been shot years later, as the film industry uses not only the color, but also the use of shadows. It must have been amazing for the audience at the time, to see especially the color after seeing mostly black-and-white films for the rest of their lives. Unfortunately, the film does not stand the cinema. That being said, the movie is worth a look as a visual treat.
