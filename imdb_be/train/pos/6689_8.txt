As a reader of comics, which still sees itself as a full kid at heart, I admit that I might be a little biased towards this movie. I mean, it was not a good superhero movie for quite some time (Note: Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie). I really wanted this movie to be good, and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema (read Blair Witch) I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Mystery Men is definitely not high effects, tension-filled action flick, it was a comedy. And on this basis, it was a success. It was all in the little theater of laughter, and received applause and laughter through the final scene. Stiller and Garofolo fun together, as always, and Azariah adds just the right touch of madness. William H. Macy plays a great straight man, while Keli Mitchell and fart Paul Rubens added power just to keep my child happy. <br /> <br /> While many surprising (and sometimes it seems that stolen from Batman and Blade Runner), and some of the jokes are obvious, this is just ridiculous. There are a few lines that capture even the most jaded viewer by surprise, and bring tears from the belly-laughers among us. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this film. Although not all time classics, this is twice as funny as the last Austin Powers restored tread. Compilation of good and GREAT throw. If you are concerned, on morning and plan to pay less, but in any case you will be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who among us does not root for the losers once in a while?
