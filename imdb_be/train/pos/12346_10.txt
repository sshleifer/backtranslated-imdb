This is a very delicate and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Beautiful music score. Twice I was in Japan last year, and the film gave me a typical Japanese feeling. Camera movement is excellent, as well as actors. He delves into the feelings, without becoming melodramatic. The Japanese are very sensitive and kind, and it's all very well brought up on the screen here. The director plays with great color to light and shows the audience that it is also possible to allow them to enjoy the film with thin and fine detail. Once you've seen the movie you want to see more of the same director. This is a real feel good movie, and I can only recommend it to everyone.
