I know that this is not technically the greatest TV show ever, I mean, that was filmed on video and show its limitations, both in audio and visual aspect of it.The action may at times be too little crumby.but, I love this show so much.it scared the hell out of me when it first aired in 1988.of course I was 5 years old.but I recently bought a DVD of the first 3 episodes, which, unfortunately, I Now I hear deleted.and I also heard Warner is not going to produce more because the first DVD, bad sales.also TV shows do not have the same feeling as in a movie, actually I do Mau, it was more sinister tone.even, although the color palette like a nightmare on Elm Street Part 4 (as the movie and TV shows were made in the same year), it has a more serious tone, while the FIMS were gradually becoming more and more pungent and jokey.not bad, I love Freddy clown cracker.but wise I think it is a strength of the TV show, you had not Freddy popping up every minute cliff cracking jokes before and after he kills somebody.in fact it's more a dream feel to it, enhanced soft focus lense.im not sure if it navmys nye on the part of the creators of the show, or just with the restrictions to be lifted on the video. I love this show, and take not as a companion piece to the film can be very enjoyable.much better than anything on TV today.
