The film, which is so much in 30 warner film in an era when every studio had a specific look and feel for their productions, in contrast to today, where the audience is just getting the object. <br /> <br /> Curitz it was one of the quintessential director Warners at home working with austerity and high efficiency in the quality of time, practices that were very requirements directed at Warners, the studio, which was one of the "big five "majors in this era, which produces high-quality films for its major theaters chains. <br /> <br /> Even if we have the installation of the upper classes in Long Island there is a common style of Warners here implemented with a narrative that could "torn from the headlines." Another example is when a girl photographers comment on foot early in the film, and she says that "They are not trophies" gives the film a large work of Manet, earthy feel, since it was the audience that Warners aiming for major depression. (Ironic Columbia and Universal had two minors, these five specialties to the 50s, when they participated in the television to change their destiny - they would do something like this is very cheap and without polishing and great talent) Curtiz made a film from a wonderful script, which moves at a rapid pace while keeping the viewer with great camera angles and quick editing. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness not corny love interest in the sub-plot is so much fun to just keep rolling.
