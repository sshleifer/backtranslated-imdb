1.) This movie was awesome! I watched it while I was in town, close to where he grew up! I went and saw the building that the story takes place in. Overall, I loved this film, one of Jake Gyllenhaal best !! Also- my favorite parts were the science fair, and all the time with his father. They were as sad as it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his father did not seem to care one way or another. This tag line accurately. "Sometimes a dream is bright enough to light up the sky." 2.) The path was filmed this movie was perfect, it was so believable that he could be recorded during the 1950s. The dress was fine and they had their own jargon down too. I would definitely recommend this movie!
