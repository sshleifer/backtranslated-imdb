To my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed «Spacecamp», I remember to have seen him about 13 years ago, and recently I have hired him again. I was very impressed. Obviously, the effects of space in today's films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are far superior to those in SpaceCamp. However, this film was a very stereotypical scene eightieth story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before you hear it. But that's what I liked IT- they do not make movies like this anymore, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see, Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thompson in the early roles in order Skerritt and Keith Kepim add substance to the light and fluffy site. Absolutely loved the robot named Jinx, which was nice, but unfortunately, there was more emotion than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspired in their own way, and it was interesting to note that he was shot at NASA Spacecamp Alabama (I think).
