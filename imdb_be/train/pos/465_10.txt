Marleen Gorris has established itself as one of the greatest directors in the world. This sensitive, visually beautiful film based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures well the dark irony of this writer. John Turturro gives what I consider my best performance (I usually do not advocate it); and Emily Watson is brilliant as well. Well worth a look.
