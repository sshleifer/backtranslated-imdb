Initially, I killed Sarah's show with a good fat 8, but I struggled a bit with her humor and fine late 7 is that decided. I'll explain. <br /> <br /> You either like Sarah humor or you will not. If you do not, I doubt that someone can convince you. You people know who you are, which is great, but then you know it too. Going further, the first season gave us a fantastic bits of Sarah, her friends and family, and her lessons in life. In one memorable episode, she "pulled" to the employee Jay, whom she met for the first time. - "Do you know why I'm doing here?" He asks. "Because you got all C hours in high school?" She responds sarcastically. It seemed that the real question. - This is fun stuff in my book. Sarah can come at you from all angles. In another episode, her love affair with God has been particularly funny. God be petty and jealous added great joke. It's reasonable, it's kind of twisted, but it shows us the truth in humor, and we laughed. <br /> <br /> Then came the second season. While it is still not without some new and inventive comedy, we seem to have relaxed somewhat in the banal piece of shit and fart jokes, quite simply. I'm getting some good laughs here and there, but most of it seems like a filler while she and writers struggle to stir up some original material. Babble and tedious the feelings I have for episodes lately, but I'm gutting it for precious stones, I find (turtle) and wait for it to turn it around. I was a fan of her "Jesus is Magic" routine and would like to think that I know what it can do. Let's go back to that.
