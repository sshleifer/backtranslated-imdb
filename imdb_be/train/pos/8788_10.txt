Well, I'm glad to hear rumors that it may be finally issued on DVD. If that happens, I do not know, but I grab it when it comes out. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, it's the most entertaining film Errol Flynn, especially if the "Gentleman Jim" Corbett ring career begins in the film. Then he comes from a good movie on the big. <br /> <br /> Few could play the proud and still come off as a pretty good guy, and Flynn could and this film is an excellent example of this. Reportedly, it was the favorite role Flynn, and I believe that. You can just feel how much he had fun here. Ward Bond, too, looks like he's really enjoying his role is played by the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond also has never been better. <br /> <br /> There is just the right amount of boxing scenes action here, and they are very well done, too. Corbett family fun to watch, just as they are in the stands during the match Jim. With the arena, permanent family arguments Corbett and screams can get a little too loud and annoying, but they created the ground for the conclusion of the fitting. <br /> <br /> And if you talk about the conclusion, we Sullivan Corbett after a big fight very touching and a highlight of the film. Some criticism sneaky (Variety, for example) did not like the ending, nor the fact that a large part of the film invented, but - Spirit - most films are invented, like it or not. And in this case, it made for a good story and a good ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very soft voice, a true gentleman, entirely something like Figure Flynn, but Flynn still make him a good guy.) <br /> <br /> This is one of the most exciting classic films I I have ever watched, and I look forward to the DVD.
