Arthur middle-aged rich 'child' who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels like, and says whatever comes into his head. He likes to show off their wealth, and he knows that he is a spoiled child. He spends money to people he does not know and therefore all funny. Arthur must marry a girl of high class to make to a large fortune, but he falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (she looks very strange). <br /> <br /> This is a very funny movie. I watched this movie, because it is very well known Indian film «Sharabee» is based on the character of Arthur. Although «Sharabee», of course, inspired by "Arthur" I think it's two different films. "Arthur" is just plain fun. It's very corny at times. There are so many fantastic liners in the film. It's not a laugh riot, but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his father's fiance, and he continues to speak of "moose". Duddley Moore sure has some comical time. He is very good with words and body language. I loved the scene where he says, standing in a sitting at the hotel a couple of "small" country, and he continues to speak with the couple in two different directions. John Gielgud won an Oscar for this film. I do not know what an actor. I do not think he did a great job, but maybe if I watched more of his work, I can agree in the future. The film has some flat areas, but not very long. I am looking forward to see the sequel.
