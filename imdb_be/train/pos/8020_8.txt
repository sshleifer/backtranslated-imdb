I found it to be most enjoyable Muppet movie, because I felt that it was the most carefree and was the best comic delivery on most of its lines. Muppets try to go on Broadway, a musical to sell, they wrote, but along the way they encounter the usual problems, including memory loss Kermit here. Despite the fact that there are so many great cameo here, as in the original Â«Muppets movie" There are some, including Joan Rivers, and Dabney Coleman. Just the timing and delivery are so many great lines, and the situation turns out to have fun in the Muppets. Original songs also good here, and the ending is satisfactory. There is not much else to say about the film, but The Muppet fans should see it for sure. This is the funniest movie Muppets and will certainly be enjoyed by all. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 to ****
