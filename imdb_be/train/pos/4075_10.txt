Laputa: Castle in the Sky is a bomb. Post as much as his new works and cleaner, and fantastic flying pirates, as it could be better! Art is quite amazing, and the soundtrack, which again many times after that (im not sure if it was the first time I've heard of it), and causes me the most emotional response of any sentimental movie soundtrack. Sita, women's role in this film is absolutely amazing and the boy, Paz also a great role model - he lives alone! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I will not give it away, but the end is really great. I rank this as one of the top three with Miyazaki Nausicaa and removed. In addition, you can check Moving Castle howl when it comes out (hopefully next year) If you love Miyazaki's check this one out as it is readily available in the United States. Enjoy, Piper A
