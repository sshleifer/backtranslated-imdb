Gomez Pereira is responsible for some of the most heinous comedies of the last Spanish film (just look at his curriculum vitae), so I did not expect that the majority of Â«Cosas Que Hasen ..." ... In fact, I do not know why did I decided to see the world. Anyway, I just did ... And what a surprise. It seems that Gomes Pereira finally grown up and now he is able to make a good film. He recent work deals with midlife crisis, disappointment, and are looking for a second chance after you've destroyed it all. The last half hour of the film (a drama), the best part, and it just makes the movie worth watching. Also we Eduard Fernandez plays a major role, and I continue to think that he is the best actor of his generation (today) <br /> <br /> * My rate :. 7/10
