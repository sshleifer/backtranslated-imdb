The film is completely meaningless. <br /> <br /> But you expect paying brow intellectual film based on a comic book called Slam Dunk? Really? incumbent Jay Chou is not quite the most moving thing I've ever seen, but I certainly enjoyed the movie. It was somewhere around the level of strange that someone like Jet Li and Stephen Chow can produce? No, not really. Whether it was thoroughly entertaining, when you are just taking it to the value of the surface? Absolutely. This film is about some Chinese eye candy idols and musicians who can play basketball on the unrealistic level of knowledge. There's also an evil dude Triad style and stupid crafty person who receives Jay Chou involved in all this. Love interest. This is a pattern, but in fact, suspend disbelief for a while. Come on. This is called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think that he has signed the contract on? Do yourself a favor, if you look - I found a copy of subtitles with some Engrish, which made the film closer muffled conversation wise, but we got a big laugh out of it. They seemed to be very fixated on Jerusalem and the figures 1, 10. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I gave up. I watched it again. <br /> <br /> Especially for this fight scene in the bar. Well choreographed and well shot. I particularly like plexiglass light pool table - I like to play on one of those, <br /> <br /> Slick enough for me, but I'm digging in the trash movie ..
