Forget that it is «B» cinema. Forget that it is largely out of date. Rather than give a written and directed by Ida Lupino much deserved credit for solving the subject, which at that time (1950) was a taboo in Hollywood. As far as I know, this was the first film to touch the issue of rape and emotional and mental impact that the crime has on its victims. <br /> <br /> While most of the action of the cast is pedestrian at best, Mala Powers, who at the time was eighteen or nineteen, gives excellent performance for both traumatized young woman, Anne, who tries to escape from his "shame." Based on his work in this film, I was surprised that she did not have a successful acting career. Tod Andrews, also have some wonderful moments, as a minister, which stretches to help her. <br /> <br /> Ms Lupino, apparently working on a limited budget, is still able to create some memorable scenes, such as the pursuit through the streets and alleys lead to rape, and a lineup after police it. And it has created a bitter end, which left me wondering if Anne really could have a normal life again.
