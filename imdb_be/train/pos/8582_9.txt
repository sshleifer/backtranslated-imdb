I love the characters and the storyline. Very funny with lots of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give great performances. I enjoyed a dynamic and comical interaction Griffith and career. Donald Southerland plays very nice, and surprisingly favorably burned killer. All three actors are among my favorites and have them in this movie is made for special treatment. A nice addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this film. If you want to ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, LA Confidential, The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and The Whole Nine Yards ... you'll love this movie.
