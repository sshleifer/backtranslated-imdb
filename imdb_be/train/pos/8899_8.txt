The film 60 years really is (for those of us who grumbled around the belly of America at the time) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated, stereotypical characters, authenticity issues remains unclear. <br /> <br /> Not only the radical times of change, but also a very confusing time. The two main things that changed our world then: Law 1964 Civil Rights, and the vast influence of the media. These two new freedom began to social changes that began to emerge soon. <br /> <br /> Out of the chaos came the sensitivity of the value of the disorder come. Keep in mind, however, that most of the Americans were not involved in it ... they worked, they played, they watched the news ... and they slowly began to be carried out effort and struggle of minorities ... civil rights workers, political activists, efforts to fight the war, the war against poverty .... <br /> <br /> representation power of the press and television, in particular, is well reflected, although the conflict between the attitude of the general public and those who want to change something that was, at best, ignored ... and in the worst case, distorted .. Average stem Americans do not all stand around angrily holding baseball bats, or renounce their rebellious daughters. They were confused too. Let us not forget that, as folk singers suddenly Protest Singers, and how The Beatles began to pressure killed Folk-protest movement. There's no Beatles songs in the film, or even any mention of them. <br /> <br /> I think that if you have not lived a decade, you could not have a sense of what the film is about, the whole picture is a little dull. At some point I was holding down a steady job while my sister lived in the Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock. In another place I was in the Haight-Ashbury and the riots in Detroit while it worked and played hostess in Maine and Connecticut. Roles are always changing. <br /> <br /> The film shows three siblings in a middle class family. They represent a hippie child, a political activist and active military. The Pope is the typical attitude, and her mother is the voice of reason, tolerance, and sometimes a compromise for the sake of the world .... <br /> <br /> Black family consists of the minister and his son ... prohibitive, I think. I believe that manufacturers know all the variables, and had to settle for the limitations, otherwise the film would be a long, boring documentary. Pope's message was that anger causes bitterness, and bitterness causes chaos. It was clear that the message belongs to the youth of today. <br /> <br /> We see a unique solution to social problems, as well as the questions disconnects ... 60 years have been extraordinary, consequently, only the Roaring 20s to compare. In other words, this movie has a moral in the end. In the end, it is our collective individualism that survives. Put that in your list of oxymoron. <br /> <br /> Everyone was God, Guru, or a free-spirited genius in the 60 years. It was a time of magic and madness. Nobody ever nail the 60s right down ... it was not very diverse (this film is close). At least, we can say that we are not ashamed of what we have learned and grown from it, and that this time, the generation of forms and changed America for the better ....
