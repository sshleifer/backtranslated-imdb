It seems that it is becoming fashionable to copy the "Basic Instinct 2", to the fact that a large part of the audience (including critics) found that even scared before he was released. It seems even more fashionable to trash Sharon Stone, who ?? We like all ?? Now, fourteen years older, and ?? Unlike most of us ?? still it looks great. First comments for this film were so vicious that I had to see for myself. In my opinion, a continuation not as good as the original film, but it's not as bad as most of the comments to pretend. Michael Caton-Jones Sun Paul Verhoeven, nor Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Eszterhas. "Basic Instinct 2" is just entertainment, the average thriller, and, in addition, Jerry Goldsmith's original score, keeps little resemblance to its predecessor. Even the stone gives its character to another dimension, creating a lascivious, devilish Catherine Trimell, which may well rank among the other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She's a smart actress who is not afraid to take risks and can play with the camp at leisure. Unfortunately, it seems to be a prime target for those who like to smash that film. It has become too successful, too much of the main icon, as well as all those actors who have reached this level, it's time, and now it must be destroyed Hollywood audience. <br /> <br /> In the rest of the cast is outstanding, giving performances that are much better than the material deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and much more interesting than Michael Douglas, his action is perfect, which gives a dense and complex aspect of otherwise one-dimensional character. As it has more screen time and is the axis of the film, it can keep your attention from beginning to end <br /> <br /> I do not recommend "Basic Instinct 2" is a great movie. I just express my disagreement with the majority of comments on this site, and my belief that the agenda except the movie itself form the opinion of the majority of viewers.
