I think that everyone needs to make a comeback at some point. And that's exactly what confused resident of Taft Dundee Jack (Robin Williams) is going to do in "The Best of Times." So, the man who went all crazy on the radio in "Good Morning, Vietnam" to play football. In this case, it tends to repeat the game, which cost him the prestigious title of high school.

But Williams and Russell, in fact, a very good comedy team. And some of the names in this film is likely to give you a chuckle (to put it mildly). Check it out.
