Like the gentle giants that make up the second half of the title of this movie, the last production of Michael Obloutsa my affection, but it is also slow and heavy. The director's last outing «Mosquitoman-3D» had the same problem. It is hard to imagine a shark boring film, but they somehow managed it. Only a lure for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy it was passable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with the amazing worlds beneath the ocean surface. But even this was normal. Poor focus in some scenes to make the production seem amateurish. With dolphins and whales, the technology, but it is all in vain. Clear the stage and too much a close-up of giant entities movie do nothing to take advantage of the excellent IMAX 3D-capabilities. There are too few scenes of any depth or variety. Macro these strange creatures just looks flat and often only one creature in the camera, so there is no depth of contrast. Michael Oblouits trying to follow in the footsteps of his father, but if you have Shark Week on the cable, his thoughtful and vague treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
