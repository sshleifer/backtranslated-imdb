This movie is the best movie Jim Carrey ever made. Curry was not his ordinary person doing things in this film. He was both funny and sad. Kerry played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in his life. Then God comes down from heaven and gives Bruce his powers. As I said before, Carrey has done an excellent job. I also think that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as supporting actor / actress. The plot was good, because he had a lot of sub-items in the main. This film can be funny (dog Bruce) and sad (the "breaking"). The script worked well, too. I'm glad they made the continuation of this film. I rate this film 9/10.
