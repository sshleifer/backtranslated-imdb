If I remember, Ira Gershwin, lyricist and brother George Gershwin suggested directory for this film, and he was snapped up by producers. In many ways it was a typical 50s film musical Freed Unit at MGM and director Vincente Minnelli with great care Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> The Gershwins were, of course, among all the great Broadway musical team, but, in my opinion, George himself was one of the greatest of all American composers, period !!! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the two greatest male dancers of the musical film (One suggestion as to the other?), I do not think that his casting was ever questioned. But I think that the rest of the cast needs to be explained: Oscar Levant was marked by the person at the time and, as an actual friend George Gershwin, he was supposed to be in this movie. He was a talented pianist, and even moderately talented composer, and said, neurotic and hypochondriac, and here, as always, he plays himself. <br /> <br /> Leslie Caron was unknown at this time, and she was a French type of "Homeless". A talented dancer, she never was a real beauty. George Guétary, who plays the role of Maurice Chevalier, oh, I mean Henry Baurel, was Greek, not the French, but it is certainly more than OK as French boulevardier even if a bit too young for the role. <br /> <br /> Gina hoofer voice is serviceable here, but Guétary has better vocal equipment. Although Jean was the best cast in a different place, as is evident in "Singing in the Rain," where his character is much more prudent, even here he shows himself something Heel time (it was not in vain, cast as the original heel Joey Pal Joey , a Broadway musical.) I was not so fascinated by his «I Got Rhythm» scene with children are not as spontaneous as it was supposed, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I also found the character Foch Mila quite annoying. <br /> <br /> But the highlight of the film is obviously a long ballet at the end of the film based on the music title with scenery and costumes in the style of great French Impressionist painter. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe, Gene and Oscar, as well as struggling artists, and I do not think that the musical numbers, as well as to determine how they might be, but, in the final After all, the music of Gershwin very well served in this film. <br /> <br /> DVD is well made from a thin crisp graphics (if they suppos be edited) and mono sound good, but a bit shallow.
