This is the future that awaits us? Overcrowded, unforgiving wasteland with hellish, unwanted existence? This film resembles the problem that still poisons us doubly, since the film was released back in 1973. Let's hope that the world is not going to end up like this ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green wild a film that I enjoyed very much. It was a charming characters semi-apocalyptic setting, a compelling and thought-provoking storyline and macho-macho Est there: Charlton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very unpleasant, messy look. You almost suffocated from the stench of the city and its inhabitants dirty. <br /> <br /> excellent characters. Charlton Heston, who became one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. Man has created the role of an evil nonetheless pretty tough guy. I could definitely put himself in the place of Thorn. He sees that something is wrong, but everything around him or not listening (hearing more paid) or wants him dead. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays the likeable old Saul, who had had enough of this nasty place. Everything else is fine, especially Leigh Taylor-Young, Shirley, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment in which she lived. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. The Green Soylent factory futuristic apartments, and especially the "scoop" (bulldozers, get rid of people) were wonderful. Polluted air from the outside looks very ugly and disgusting. Empty streets of cities filled with vile and putrid people are very anxious. <br /> <br /> The last remark is the ending, which is still shocked me. It's disgusting, but if you think about it, it's a good idea <br /> <br /> The result :. <br /> <br /> An excellent 70-fiction film that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uncomfortable.
