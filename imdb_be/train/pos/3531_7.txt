Siodmak does an incredible job with this B noir starring Ella Raines, Franchot tons, and Alan Curtis. And he does it, I might add, without much help from their male actors, ie, Curtis and tone. It Rains in all the way, pretty, leggy actress who for one reason or another did not reach the status of some of its "noir" colleagues. <br /> <br /> Use Siodmak about sex, light, shadows, and the music is really wonderful how he solves this genre. Shadow, light effects and camera angles all effective. But the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexy riff drum Elisha Cook, incited began Raines. It was this scene that brings the «Phantom Lady» into new territory. <br /> <br /> The commitment to the material Siodmak matched only by Raines, who gives heartfelt performance as a woman in love is trying to save his men. Franchot Tone called it in. Alan Curtis, did not seem upset that he might die, and do not seem happy that he lived. And he never, for a short time in prison, except, apparently, in love with Raines. <br /> <br /> funny thing about many of these films is that, with the development of World War II, interest in psychiatry deepens. But these terms are often misused in such films as "The Possessed", "Spellbound" and "The Greatest Show on Earth." Tons called paranoid Thomas Gomez - tons is likely to have some paranoia attached to his chagrin, but he seems to be closer to the psychopath. In fact, as evidenced by his headaches, he might have a brain tumor, pushing his brain. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady is not the largest site, but it is well worth watching.
