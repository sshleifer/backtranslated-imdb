Made Jules Naudet and Giddeon French brothers, and told Robert De Niro and firefighter James Hanlon is a compelling and heartbreaking story about how best glittered in New York is the darkest day. I first saw it when I was a young naive 12 years old and at this age he still touched me. Knowing how seriously 9/11 did see it extended the whole effect 9/11. We know who the characters were, as there were made up everyday life, and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people will just run away and save themselves. These brave people put their lives on the line and see it only increases my admiration for him. See if you can, it's best documentary, I personally have never seen.
