Winchester 73 receives a loan from many critics for the return of the west after World War II. Directed by Anthony Mann should get a lot of credit for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job, but I think Steven McNalley and John McIntyre steal the movie with their image of two bad guys involved in a high-stakes poker games with a cherished Winchester 73 will be the winner. This is a good scenario with multiple stories taking place simultaneously. Look at the first appearance of Rock Hudson, as a bull. Thank God for a few years, we will start to play the Indians themselves in the western films. The film is in black and white, and was shot in Tucson, Arizona. I would not put 73 in Winchester Stagecoach category, High Noon and Shane, but it gets above average recommendation from me. <br /> <br />.
