Ella was excellent, Franchot was inevitably over-the-top (But he played similar parts in other films such as "The Man on the Eiffel Tower") and Alan was almost non-existent, but the film is, of course, "delighted." <, Br /> <br /> * soft * spoiler ahead: I wonder how many times Elisha Cook was strangled in his films, but I seem to remember a variety of other examples. I will not name the killer, but I think this is definitely evident from the plot, "the thriller" requires <br /> <br /> It is very well done, but by Noire film (for example, all smoked like crazy, and the police are really role. and the dead bodies never showed, in contrast to today's gore festivals.) made in the usual format of a short scene Tableaux period. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10.
