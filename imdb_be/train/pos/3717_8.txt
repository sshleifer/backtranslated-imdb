It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite, I remembered seeing Cracker fur. Just beautiful feelings and have never stooping to be sentimental. There are some stunning cinematography and a leading woman pretty brilliant. It captures more than a nostalgic time. He has a real heart to it. It's early childhood Achilles, exquisite and painful. Simple story always effective if done well. It Glendyn Ivin has a great future, and I, for its part, looking for his next project. Next up is always the most difficut thing. This is the second album, Blues for most people. <br /> <br /> I just hope that his next film is not something lame like shark movie. Hello everyone. Enjoy the movie.
