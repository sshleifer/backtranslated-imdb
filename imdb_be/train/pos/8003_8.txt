This movie is great fun to watch with his wife or girlfriend. There is laughter in abundance, and some very interesting little stories nudist happening here. The actress is all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty. Maslin Beach life is full of a variety of nudists and personality types. Australian coast scenery, just great to see. What a place to visit, to put it mildly, and one day he may become my refuge. I really like this film, and every time I watch it, I love it more. I would like to see more of these characters, and I always wonder what happened to them. Although the plot somewhat bland, this film is, of course, a great excuse to just sit on the couch and enjoy the beautiful and famous beach of olives with these beautiful nudists and their personal stories.
