The arrival of the world-famous conductor sets of unexpected events and feelings in a small village. Some people are at risk, how he handles the church choir, and the people in it is gradually changing. This film is touching and makes you leave the cinema as with a smile and tears in her eyes. It'a about bringing out the best in people and Kay Pollak wrote a great script, based on the ideas he has become so famous. The actors are outstanding, Nyukvist we know before, but Frida Hallgren was a new and charming familiar to me. It is the most striking face, which leaves no one indifferent. Per Moberg makes his role as a husband Gabriela almost too good, it is awful too see. One can only wish it will be cast to play the good guy one day, so we can see if it learns that the character, as well. <br /> <br /> This is a film that will not leave you indifferent. If you have not seen it, do it today!
