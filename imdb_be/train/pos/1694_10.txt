If the makers of this film, any attempt to introduce the story of reality have been made, it would be just another waste of time, money and creative effort. Luckily, throwing all the pretense of reality to the wind, they created a comedy miracle. Who could miss the movie in which an alien pilot spends the entire film, acting as Jack Nicholson, complete with the Lakers shirt. Do not dismiss this movie as garbage.
