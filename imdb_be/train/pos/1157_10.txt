This is one of the best comedies ever! Writing this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast, and just look at the names of the cast, and you will understand why this is so cool. If you are a fan of Kevin Kline, he is doing (as always) with a fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr. is perfect. If you do not laugh, yet seen this film, you have no sense of humor.
