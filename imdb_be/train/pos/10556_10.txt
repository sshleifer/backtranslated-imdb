I was not sure what to expect, but I'm glad that I went to see it. Smart, slightly twisted comedy that makes you think. I was not sure how the director can create a "nothing", but leave it to Mr Natali and brilliant man C.O.R.E. to create another low budget set that looks real (as real as anything can be). Well worth your time and money, if you have the opportunity to see it, please go. You'll be glad you did.
