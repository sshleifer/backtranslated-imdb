Indian cinema is the prototype of the police of the two broad categories: they are either honest or type of bad guys. Honest guys are always screaming at the top of their voices and fight the system while the bad cops are for the most part, but suffer in the end. <br /> <br /> This film, at least breaks the usual formula and provide a refreshing view of the cops and their lives. Direction is an inside look at the life of an ambitious young cop who. Music is an interesting and editing is a trend setter as far as Indian cinema is. <br /> <br /> The film is sometimes slow and the dilemma facing the Anbu, when it comes to Maya overplayed at times. But I would still give it a 9/10 just because it has many first to its credit.
