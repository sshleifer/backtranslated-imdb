It is not "so bad it's good", this is purely good! For those who do not understand why you have the intelligence of a four-year (in reply to a specific comment ...) In any case, the Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself, a parody of you, and I parody. This is the only text in the most brilliant cinematic history. I, and three prequel, sitting on my DVD rack next to the Duke and Kurosawa. It embodies the recognition of the absurd and undermines everything you or I call the standard. I'm writing a script, and the film alone opened the comedy genre for me, the likes of which we've never seen. It can only be taken in installments ... kinda exploiting ... now I'm just trying to take a minimum of ten strings. My comment is ended some time ago. Hopefully it will work when I submit it now.
