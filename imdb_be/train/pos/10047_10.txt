For all the poor people who did all that by complaining about the dialogue, the budget, this and that .... who wants to hear it? If you missed the point of this, a great movie, it's your loss. The rest of us who deeply loves this film does not care what you think. I thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own essence, in my book. It should not be documented, or completely factual account of what happened that night. This is the most amazing love story ever tasted. I know that this cynical '90s and the millennium has all the excitement, but come on. Someone comments on this council complained that he made too much money! How lame is that? He made the wads of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the main grossing film in the world. I am pleased on the side of the majority this time around. Well, the cynics, the time to crawl under a rock, I did.
