The more I look at Nicolas Cage, the more I appreciate him as an actor. Looking at this film now (in 2005), I see that it does not really fit into a genre movie, which comes out at the beginning of the 90s. I do not think it can be seen as a film noir, but it is pretty dark at times, mainly due to the lighting and the odd characters parties. <br /> <br /> The typical performances from each of the three main actors, who all did a good job with their roles. I thought, however, that the Hopper and Boyle's characters have been left undeveloped as it was sometimes difficult to understand what they do and why they do it. Hopper love it or hate it kind of guy. The plot is really good, and although I found some of the very unrealistic, there were parts where I had to pass it to the Director (that is, when he first sees the sheriff). In general, this film is definitely worth seeing. *** 1/2
