I remember when I first saw this short, I really laughed so much that, as with many other films that I've seen, no sound came out! Curly really great "singing" opera in this, I am surprised that he did not consider a career as a professional singer, because he was really good! <br /> <br /> If you notice, it was filmed at the end of a career as a Stooge curly, you could tell that he changed because he was thin and thinner, his voice deepened, his face was getting sent wrinkles, although it can still pull it off, he looked like he was fifty at the age of forty years. That's because he had a lot of small strokes before his big friend, who ended his career. If he was still able to pull it in his last one of them! <br /> <br /> If you do not mind the fact that curled really feel very bad at the moment, it is in fact one of his funniest shorts. I know that I did not have in mind the fact that Curly is really changing, because I still thought that it was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
