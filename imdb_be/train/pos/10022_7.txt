Aro Tolbukhin burned seven people alive in a mission in Guatemala in the 70s. In addition, he stated that he had killed another 16 people (he used to kill a pregnant woman, and then set them on fire). <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary that person Macaw portraits in a few interviews with people who need to know it, and in a few scenes, played by actors, based on real facts. <br /> <br /> Â«Ar Tolbukhina" serious work, so analytical, it is not abnormal at all. . Such a terrible witness, as some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10
