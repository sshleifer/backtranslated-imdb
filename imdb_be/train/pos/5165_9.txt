It is part of the ensemble of adults who return to formulative Summer Camp youth was very quiet entrant and exiter in cinema autumn of 1993, I would say that it was a shame, but then again, some of the best movies quiet releases that do not get a lot of hype and praise . <br /> <br /> Diane Lane, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, sleep Vincent, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin (who was too good here) are a group of actors who are flesh of these roles as people who are out of date with the good, bad and funny memories of summers gone by. This film covers the gambit of emotions, mostly pleasant, and the film never hammers away at the audience to feel what the characters feel, preferring to allow the viewer to enter into a memory of its own. After all, I film the viewer, who bristles at right, blatant manipulation in the movies, that's what I appreciate from the writer / director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> This film is a great cheap car, good main rent and even rather sit in a movie theater. You can run through it on TV, and I definitely would suggest to look and see.
