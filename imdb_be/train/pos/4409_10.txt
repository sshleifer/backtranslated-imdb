This film is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave it a 10 rating. The history of the famous Out «Bushwhackers» Missouri, fought on the side of the South during the war between the states. Clothes they wore were real, the story and why they were fighting very clear and well understood. I was actually one of the battles that have no place as they are shown ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors are well chosen and were either the most brilliant actors or director knows exactly how to get the best out of them. I suspect it was a combination of a great directing, super casting to find the right people and the excellent actors from performing. Not just one or two ... this movie really jelled! It has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes, depending on your particular point of view), and history all in one movie. Even a future Spider-Man and Jewel. And it's good!
