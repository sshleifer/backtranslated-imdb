Great movie this, and shame that he will receive little attention outside the arthouse circles and students, who stay until two in the morning to watch it on Channel Four. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but it works very effectively, blurring between childhood fantasy and nightmare fairly well lubricated. The budget looks quite low, but to honor those involved Hide all too often. It is also not dated that much either. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to tape it on the telly, when he was a few years ago, and it has stood the half-dozen display. This is one of those movies that do not appeal to all; although, as usual, those with a more thoughtful approach to the cinema would have got a lot out of it. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Buerke put in a good performance as Anna, spoiled brat, and it's a shame that it seems to have gone with the current scene. Cross is also very good, carrying the authority of his character very well in the context of the picture. <br /> <br /> There are some really (and I do not say that lightly) disturbing moments in this film as a half-second or more Shockers stretched tension. Careful with the lights off! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
