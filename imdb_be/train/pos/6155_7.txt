"Bedknobs and broom" is a magical adventure film with a certain charm, despite not being one of the best Disney work. It has in general a good story, great songs, great characters, good actors, magic and excellent special effects, good setting and beautiful landscapes of England. <br /> <br /> He also combines very well live action and animation. Animation itself, of course, very good. The animation is very similar to that in the 1973 animated film "Robin Hood" and the same could be said of the animated characters: there are many wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and other, as in "Robin Hood" . In addition, King (left) seems to be a combination of Prince John and King Richard, not to mention the fact that the bear looks like Little John. <br /> <br /> This film is often compared to "Mary Poppins" with the cause. Both combine live-action and animation with a similar design. Both have similar options in London. Both have their own magic and magical woman. Children (Carrie, Charlie and the cute little Paul) a bit like children banks. Both films were directed by Robert Stevenson and both throw David Tomlinson. However, instead, a very serious man, as George Banks, David Tomlinson plays fun and magic man - Professor Emelius Browne. Thanks to the magic, the film also has some small but significant similarities stories of Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Most of the songs are good. "Age is not faith" and «The Beautiful sea salt" are the best. "Portobello Road" is too good. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson great in this movie again. Angela Lansbury big as Miss Price and actors 3 children all too well :. Cindy OKallagan as Carrie, Ian Veyhill Charlie (boy "age does not believe») i Roy Snart as the younger brother of Paul <br /> <br /> I love the black cat. It's pretty cool. It looks like Salem, black cat from the TV series "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch." I find it cute when one of the characters turn into a white rabbit. Rabbits are very cute, fluffy and adorable animals. I just love them! Even funnier is every time professor Emelius Browne turns into a white rabbit, because when he turns back into a man, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. It's really fun, combined with his comic figure and a mustache. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a good film, but its end is very bad. The first minutes of the film is nothing special, but it improves a lot. The ending, however, is weak. That is my main criticism in this regard, largely because the animated knights, it's too much for me, but also because of the war feeling.
