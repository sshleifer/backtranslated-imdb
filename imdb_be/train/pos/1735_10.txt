starring debut Miss DeCarlo has all the writers could come up with - the Franco-Prussian War in the American Civil War, the great American West, San Francisco, in its heyday, ballet, opera, vaudeville, stagecoach bandits and a Chinese junk. Just when you thought it could not get the story screwier, what he does. It is a magnificent taken tongue in cheek. Dekarel character (in here called Anna Marie - NOT Salome, is the role that she dances) is loosely based on the career of the notorious Lola Montez, who was the mistress of the King of Prussia and sparked a revolution when he gave her the value of the crown, it saves on American west. There is a town in Arizona called "Salome, where she danced", based on the historical fact that Lola Montez did the dance of Salome role there. Stagecoach Cleve and Russian nobleman who falls under the spell of her entirely historically accurate, nor do I believe that it is the Chinese sage with a Scottish accent - but it's one of my favorite all-time camp classics and exciting Dekarel beautifully throughout.
