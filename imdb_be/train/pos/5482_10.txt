This is an amazing film. Shows actual footage of the key events in the coup attempt to overthrow Chavez, we gave a background image that describes the class division of society. Many of the rich, it turns out, there is a choice with the democratic choice of the people, and are willing to use military force to change the regime. "Be careful what you say in front of your servants" is indicative of a comment. The head of the largest oil companies of the country appoints himself as the new president, with the support of the United States, and these young Irish film makers have it all on camera. A great movie to educate young people about democracy. We see a clear documentation on how the media can be manipulated, and the use of force in the interests of big business, against the interests of the democratic will of the people. Riveting stuff.
