A good picture is worth all the words. This film has the poetic scene ever dreamed about people with Down syndrome. And I will not spoil it by telling you. You want to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne terrific actor. I do not need to understand a single word he said, to understand its meaning. <br /> <br /> The film has a magic of its own. After seeing it, I understood better that we put too much emphasis on achievement and not enough on the people we love. Passion and simplicity of all that we need.
