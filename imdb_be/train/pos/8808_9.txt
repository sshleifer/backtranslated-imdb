First of all, I have to give it to the people, to get this thing together. 9/11 such a sensitive issue, which makes a film that dares to be contentious about this takes a lot of guts. It's a shame, though not surprising that the film was banned in the United States. <br /> <br /> That being said, I think that the film is beautiful with a couple of weak points. The film begins with the Iranian segment that is somewhat reminiscent of a job in Majeed (in a totally different "children of heaven" and "the color of heaven"). Much like these 2 film clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of Afghan refugees in Iran. Absolutely nice clip. The same applies to the clip of Sean Penn, which is excellent as well. But just as some of the other interesting clips absolutely rigid. Alejandro González Iñárritu makes Mexican clip and just as it evert "Amores Perros," he does it as brutal as he can. Most of the video black screen with several sounds playing in the background. These sounds are the reporters and their shock, the second plane crashes, those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families, those who were angry .... and he combines it with flashes of people jumping from the towers Very hard to watch the clip and one that you will not forget. <br /> <br /> Some clips can be very difficult to watch the American, as some of the clips can be interpreted as "you are not the only ones who suffer." In particular, the Egyptian and British clips, which not only say, but to turn the tables and say how much the United States is suffering caused to others. <br /> <br /> I also highlight clips for Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (though the latter may seem awfully ridiculous it really is not). <br /> <br /> However, not all clips are great, and I emphasize on the clip from Israel, which, in my opinion, is very weak. Although the idea was good (the reporter is on the site of the terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, but the story gets bumped because of what happened in New York is that many of us who live in countries that are able to war can relate to) implementation is terrible. The video ends as soon as some entertainment reporter trying to get airtime at any cost, the guy said that he was a witness, and in the hope that he can go on television, as well as soldiers and paramedics were shouting just "because." The clip can not capture any of the drama such situation. <br /> <br /> If you happen to be able to see it, then you should not be, that is, if you are conservative in this case, »d better stay away as you might be offended. But if you do not then you could find out how many of us outside the US have experienced 9/11.
