If you have not seen this wonderful film about life in the 90s (in the memo), then you missed a special treat. This is one of the most amazing and the most powerful films ever about the lives of Americans in the 90s and even tolerated in the modern world in which we live. It covers everything from a child's upbringing, prejudice (in more than one way), love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc..and the list goes on. The story builds to a final climax, and then, if it does not matter, it always returns to the love with friends and family and love of life. This helps us to dig deep within yourself and make us look for what we want from life. It makes us ask questions yourself. Have we done enough for others, we like it, etc .. ??? Sit back and enjoy the amazingly done and emotional film, which I'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> Please note Mary McDonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover excellent performance through the whole movie. These actors are strange and really show the real luster and a sense of what the message is sent to all of us. This 3 of my favorite actors for life after watching this movie more than 10 years ago. I still use it again and again. Also enjoy the great soundtrack with it and do not forget to count how many times you see a helicopter fly and try to figure out what is the symbolism for the movie ?? Mmm ... I almost forgot it's probably Steve Martin very first serious acting role in any movie he has ever made. He also does an excellent job in this film. This may come as a surprise to most of you. Sit back, relax and enjoy really good to do a movie .....
