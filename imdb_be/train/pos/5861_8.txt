In general, I agree completely with the review Ebert. In some ways, I feel like I should not even comment, because it is so much veterinarian movies, and I am not a vet (I was a resistor). The disadvantage is that Martha poorly developed and operates sequentially. I think Stephen Metcalf himself is a vet and had her character too little planning time.
