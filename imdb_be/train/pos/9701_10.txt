Fantastic show and unrealized classic; League of Gentlemen remains one of the greatest modern comedies in recent times. <br /> <br /> With dark humor and quirky style, overlooking the tired, formulaic approach it worse, but unfortunately, it is much more authentic legal successor, Little Britain, The League of gentlemen was really something special for quite silent era in British comedy. <br /> <br /> This is not to arrive at the scene, there really has never been anything like it before the League of Gentlemen. On the surface, it would seem, simplified sketch show, the show soon unfolds as a bright, sinister, yet incredibly funny universe populated by a variety of bright comic creation. What really sets the show apart from its rivals is its approach to telling us that story. Rather than serve us again erratic sketches, little different from the next, here we see each person or group of characters go through their various trips and storylines. No visit is not one and the same to him, and every time they offer us a surprise. <br /> <br /> Gradually, three series and Christmas, the fictional town Royston Vasey rises from the grotesque yet cheerful people. And this is probably the main reason why the show such a joy to watch (and the reason why the show is easily worthy of a series) Unlike other current shows like The Catherine Tate Show, or more importantly, Little Britain, The League, both know when the character ran this, of course, it has the opportunity to deal with it. Several fan favorite, who could easily have continued to have fun on, bowed before the series came to an end, making way for the characters to grow larger counterparts, or to allow for the introduction of the new inhabitants of Royston Vasey, to make their mark. <br /> <br /> Another thing that distinguishes this show over the other is that the writing team comes to the process of the script with care and intelligence. As mentioned earlier, all four members of the League is common sense when it comes to judge the durability of his works, and when it's time to call it quits for certain signs. This understanding also means League of Gentlemen passes a bold evolution is usually not seen in a show of this nature. The narrative drive, and much darker than the third series is based on a bold move even a sketch of the first two series, and this bold move by the League really pays off. With the third series, there is less urgency for them to please the audience, and as Christmas, they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative, in contrast to a sketch based on the previous series that (successfully) the associated application with a different set of sketches in a long series story arc. <br /> <br /> The third series as a refreshing change of pace style, as well as a real feast for the fans who have already seen the first two. Despite a polarized thought of the third series, any real fan of the League to appreciate the fact that the third series has to offer and really enjoy nature more episodes on the basis that only delve into the favorite, but a couple of wine and inter- characters that may not be crossed before. <br /> <br /> This may take a little, trying to get into the change of style, but it's definitely worth it, and, in my opinion, the third series is the best and also provides a solid conclusion to the series. <br /> <br /> show is not without its flaws, and rarely certain characters and set pieces are somewhat ridiculous, but for the most part, writing genius, dark nature of the show and a host of colorful characters (which are often too close to the real life) make for a real treat and prove that comedy should be about, and puts most of the late, catch phrase slaves and often desperate attempts comedy shame
