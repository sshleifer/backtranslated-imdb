Yesterday I watched this movie, and I must say that this is the best horror movie made for $ 36,000 I've ever seen (Unfortunately Steckler) film, of course, should be sought if you are a fan of zombies. The film reeks of soul and atmosphere. Some of the best shots zombs ever committed to film. VERY horrible looking dusty ear corpses slowly drag their feet screaming victim. Brrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Hot saggy Canadian women with sexy accents will keep you busy before HORROR raises his undead corpse eat head. This movie was entertaining from start to finish. I could not ask for more. My only complaint is that it was too short.
