<br /> <br /> I have to admit that I was something totally different from my first viewing «Cut» last night waited, but was delighted with the unexpected gem of Australian horror. I'm a real fan of horror as accurately as they come, and found «Cut», to not only be the best of the genre Australia ever created, but one of the greatest parody / comedy films in recent years. <br /> <br /> My only concern is that the mainstream audience can not look at a lot of comic elements - the film was not too smart in this application, but it made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in all possible clichés of the horror genre, they could. I'm sure it was meant as humor .... I hope that it was intended as humor. <br /> <br /> And, of course, there was blood. <br /> <br /> use of "customized" clippers were shine -. addition to the expected impacts and slashes short, there is a wide variety and creativity in many cases of violent death, enough to satisfy even the skeptics of this movie is worth <. br /> <br /> The appearance of Kylie Minogue (short that her appearance was) and Ringwald was just another reason to see the movie -. both performances were fantastic and Simon Bossell ( "Castle") in brilliant role as the playful techniques <br /> <br /> in general, I think the floor the film is one of the best horror products over the last couple of years and, as well as a beautiful satire / parody -. toungue in cheek to the very end <br /> <br /> I liked it Go.!
