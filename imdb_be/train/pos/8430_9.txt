It's always nice to see Angela Bassett getting to do the role that it can really immerse their teeth into. It is sometimes intense, funny and even sexy in her role as Lena in the "colored" woman forced to make a home in the desert mudbank near Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good at not very nice role of his partner, Boesman. Willie Jonah provide subtle nuances of the performance as a stranger opens a new live Boesman and Lena area. It's not often that you get a chance to see an intelligent film business with adult themes. Although it is based on a play by the late director John Berry (who also directed Claudine) opens up the material, having a film shot in widescreen cinemascope format. He also keeps things visually interesting through creative blocking of the actors, and showing us the things just mentioned in the play. Just as Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry can be sent to Angela Bassett in the Oscar nomination. This is definitely a film worth seeking.
