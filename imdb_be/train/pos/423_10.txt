I just read the plot summary, and it is the worst I have ever read. It does not do justice of this incredible film. As an example, a good job, read the list on the «Turner Classic Movies». Anyway, it was one of my favorite movies as a kid. My sister and I could not wait for each of April, when we could see it on this TV one of the best horse movie at this time. This is one of the great classics, the whole family can watch. Romance pure and endearing. The storyline is interesting and great songs. They do not make movies like this anymore. Good action and not excessive. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones at his best, along with many other great actors of character.
