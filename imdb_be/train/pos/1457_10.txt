I watched this movie twice - and though I am mostly a movie buff, most documentaries do not hold my attention. This film, however, was mesmerizing. Nearly every shot perfectly - says much more than a voice memo (which this film does not have) <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is strange, I can not praise it enough .. Mardi Gras necklace - who would have thought ?? <br /> <br /> Amazing and wonderful selection interviews - film materials plant in China - the film makes you feel like you're actually there <br /> <br /> I am a political unknown. - and I "have read several books on globalization, so that there was nothing in this film that was a surprise for me. Nevertheless, it made me think so much. <br /> <br /> I just want that the world was better <br /> <br /> A million kudos to director - .. and thank you for making this film also <br /> <br /> I I want everyone to see it.
