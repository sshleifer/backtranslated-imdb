I do not think about it this way, but my friend said that the first thing he thought when he heard the name "Midnight Cowboy" was a gay porn. At this point, all I knew about him was any, made to him in this episode «Seinfeld» Jerry tries to get Kramer in Florida on this bus and Kramer all patients with nasal bleeding. <br /> <br /> the movie was great, and surprisingly optimistic, and not all pretentious Pissy pessimistic, as some movies, I can not even remember, because they are all crap. <br /> <br /> plot basically consists of a naive young cowboy Joe Buck is going to New York trying to be a Hustler (male prostitute, mainly), thinking it would be easy prey, only to hit a brick wall is hard when a woman ends fuss hIM, accusing him of their intercourse. <br /> <br /> Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, called "RATS" all nice and funny guys who make fun of him all the time. You think of him as a villain, but a cute one (as Han Solo and Lando Calrissian) and surprisingly he and Jo become friends, and the film is so sweet and touching watching them to be friendly, and such and such. Rizzo reveals himself to actually be boring, miserable man, who is very ill and very depressed and shy, hates called "Ratso" and wants to go to Florida, where he thinks that life will be much better, and all his problems solved, and he will learn to be a chef and be known there. <br /> <br /> It is touching to see Joe do all that he does, along with a lot of funny moments (as Ratso tries to steal food at this hippie party, and caught a woman who says to get both of them to Florida: "Gee, well, you know, it's free you do not have to steal it..", and he says: "Well, if it's free, I do not Stealin 'it', and that classic moment completely unprepared and unplanned where Hoffman almost gets hit by that taxi and shouted: "Hey, here I go, I go here!"), and the action is so believable, you never such I do not think Joe Buck rise marked and respected actor Jon Voight, and Ratso Rizzo grow legendary and beloved by Dustin Hoffman. This is not the first time they worked together in the lead roles, but the chemistry is so dense and intense. <br /> <br /> Then, the sad part is, I believe, it is no exaggeration to call it "depressing". Ratso Rizzo falling apart all throughout the film, can barely walk, barely eating, coughing a lot, hurt, and reaches the point of the head on the bus on the way to Florida. He is very harmful, and only miles from Miami, he finally died on the bus. The bus driver convinces everyone that nothing has happened, and continues. It is sad, but not in the sort of way that would make you go home and cry and mope around miserable, as if you had just lost his dog of 13 years. <br /> <br /> In general, a great movie. And quite a lot of soundtrack consists only of "Everybody says '' played throughout the film at the right time. The odd move, but a large one as the song is good and fits the tone of the film perfectly. Go it, it's great to go out and buy it
