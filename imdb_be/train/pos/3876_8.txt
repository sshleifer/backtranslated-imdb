Beautiful Danish actress Sonja Richter steals the movie from under the noses of everyone, not a small feat, considering the excellent performances not surrounding it. <br /> <br /> Anna Richter plays in the work is independent in nature, a few neurotic (and possibly suicidal) actress who gets desperate job looking after the wheelchair-bound, subdued, elderly father named Walentin (large Danish actor Helmut Fritz, who died at 77 shortly after this film was made). <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> Walentin refuses to answer someone --until he confronts the talented Anna, whose picky and naughty way brings poor old battered devil back from self-imposed death sentence. <, Br /> <br /> The author / director / actor Erik Clausen made a strong film about the complexity of the stodgy businessman son (Jorgen play Klauzno) is a loving father who never took it. The film sags to the end, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of love and care, and as one man, restless, Anna, can change the course of human life. Highly recommended. Sonja Richter's performance alone is worth the price of admission.
