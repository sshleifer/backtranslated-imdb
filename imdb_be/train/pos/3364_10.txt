I was also very surprised at how little people have voted on this film, and just had to write something about this, although my comments are very similar to those already written. <br /> <br /> I like many things about the film. Superb acting between Mastroianni and Loren. The way the film is narrated: Humanity and love develops slowly between the two outsiders, and in contrast to both extend continuously marching pace inhuman fascist radio announcer (who happens to be a colleague of the Mastroianni), and supporters of the "collected and based on the show." For me it is a very good movie that he must be a man. Maybe some of you would say that the "message" antifascist very precisely placed, but I did not destroy the film in any way. My voice is 10/10.
