What with all the European (especially British) comments here? All I have to say that when I saw this film for the first time when I was like 13, I thought it was great. Of course, this is nonsense. This is the point. You have to see the movie Dr. Streynzhlav men in black to get all the fun of this movie, but come on people that you expect to see? I can think of many films that are much worse than this, and they were expensive Hollwood movie with real actors in them. For what it's worth, the man in white is very silly, funny layout of the movie. And all the stupid ridiculous things that England has been making for the last half-century, I am shocked by all the negative comments. We are stupid Americans like our stupid humor. P.S. See "Team America: World Police" for some laughs true that Europeans especially like HA.!
