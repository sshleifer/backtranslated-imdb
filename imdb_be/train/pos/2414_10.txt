Monarch Cove was one of the best dramas on Friday night, shown in a long time.I asked the writer to please write a long series of air and its life expectancy, SOON.Each man was very interesting and did an excellent job with their lines, to make the story come true. However, the film has to last for a long time. I would like to see Bianca and Jake's child grow up and get the lead role in the film, along with the new grandparents plan their educational future. Also, bring Kathy back to see her niece and strengthen its life.It was great to see grandparents work their problems, but the family business must be restored to working condition, and let's see how Jake and Bianca to go through the marriage of the year .
