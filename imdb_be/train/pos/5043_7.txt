Very promising directorial debut of Bill Paxton. Very dark thriller / someone really done, he recommended Stephen King. It is a strong, well thought out horror story of the pious, but the mad man in Thurman, Texas, who goes on killing spree after receiving orders from God to eliminate the demons that are trying to control humanity. A few twists and macabre finale makes your money worth. In the majority of cases of violence, you do not really see, but still enough to double your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays a twisted person to be known as the Killer Hand of God. Matthew McConaughey as impressive as the eldest son of a mad man who ends up telling the story in the Dallas FBI agent (Powers Boothe). Booth, as always, is a solid and flawless. The intense white knuckler! Highly recommended.
