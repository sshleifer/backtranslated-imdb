This is a great movie with a funny, clever plot and the dynamics of cultural differences and fugitive subject of what is important in life to make it very underrated film. Do not let the cynics of the world hold you to see it. Keaton has great moments, and I wonder what comedy is never appreciated, because actors like Keaton make the transition from humor to serious bits look extremely easy. Great movie all around!
