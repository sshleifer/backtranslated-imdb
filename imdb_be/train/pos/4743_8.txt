It is very strange HK film in many ways. Firstly, many of the action sequences, is not really so much fun. The very first gun battle going on in the movie was just plain stupid. Nha cool silly or funny, even silly, but silly. This does not mean that there are some great scenes, but most simply do not come up to the level of some other movies that I've seen. The opposite side is that this film actually has characters, not just people. All the main characters are interesting and most of them worked pretty well (of the head bad guy, which is as flat as a billiard table, except). All the main characters in this film is just fun to watch. The dialogue is quite witty, and does not seem to lose a lot in translation. This film is worth seeing, but I hope that the uninitiated American audiences do not think this is the best offer HK.
