It was one of my favorite series, when I was a kid. Swedish broadcaster has decided to broadcast it again a couple of summers ago, when I had just finished my first semester of medical school. I was surprised to see the depth in which the authorities explained. Of course, some things are simplified, but most of them were good (though it was done 22 years ago!) And it is understandable. I would suggest that all fast to be a medical student must watch. This is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words, for example. Now I'm in the 7th semester, and I think I'll watch the series again, as soon as I bought the DVD-box :-)
