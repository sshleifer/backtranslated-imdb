Made in 1931, this foreign film to be seen and enjoyed most. <br /> <br /> We open on a quiet little French village, scanning the rooftops of sleeping citizens. Then we hear what sounds like a party. When riot investigation, two adjacent men told the story of two men, presumably friends, who picked up two numbers in the lottery. <br /> <br /> Our star pattern has its own number and a friend of his. When he asks his friend, he would have to share half of the test, if the ticket is the winning number, his friend quickly says no. In fact, HE double hockey stick is not present! It is how he acts on it. <br /> <br /> So, when our man discovers that he has a winning ticket, and what was lost, no fault of his own, he is mad. Every man for himself, looking at the ticket, in some ways, as a precursor of «The Great Race». Despite the fact that it's all a memory, I was constantly in knots and got so upset over every little thing in this all for me-show-me-money film cash in bank. Hours Le Million today!
