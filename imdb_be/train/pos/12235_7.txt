"The Incredible Melting Man" fantastic gross stuff and vigorous production of Z-class, that every self-respecting horror freak camp just have to see him / herself! The perfect way to describe this low-budget 70's gem as a shameless copy of Hammer «Quatermass Xperiment» ... only a thousand times dirtier! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor from the disaster of the space-mission, but it is the bearer of a terrible disease, which makes it radioactive, and ... makes it melt! In shock, he saw his face in the mirror (you can blame him?), Steve busts out of the hospital, leaving behind a trail of sticky manure and fell off the body parts behind. Dr. Ted Nelson has to find it in a matter of urgency, as the disease is also set Steve with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may sound downright silly, but this film is very interesting and contains a large make-up effects from the hand of Rick Baker. Face melting dude looks like rotten pizza and his heavy breathing makes it sound like Darth Vader! Another great advantage is the fact that William Sachs scenario does not waste time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. Disgusting starts immediately and continues until the last moment of the film. Just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to eliminate the activity of the brain as much as you can, because when you start contemplating the many ridiculous in the script, you miss all the fun mannerisms!
