In the history of the movies based on comic books, «Mystery Men» is one of the most underrated of them. This is not a regular comic superhero movie! Hence the exploits variegated crew intentioned imitators, which include Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller plays), pot (Janine Garofalo), then (weft-shoveler William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azaria) and spleen (Paul Rubens) . "Mystery Men" substitute some aspects of superhero movies like "Superman" or "Batman", such as meaningful sayings, and questions about secret identities. Most superhero Sun billionaire Bruce Wayne, but the types of blue-collar workers with low-wage jobs and neurotic life of the house. So it looks as if directed by Kinka Usher makes heroes cross the audience can relate to. I found «Mystery Men», to be visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it does not turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to watch!
