I was waiting for this movie to be a worthy and perhaps a clich√©, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I've never heard of it until now) played incredibly good performer starring; He was so serious and romantic, my friend and I, who have seen the movie with me completely in love with him. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes, which I did, as before (loved her Romeo and Juliet), made me love her even more. Her acting was fantastic, I could not even tell that she was an American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was very good, the casting was perfect enough <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well cast. DeNiro as a gay pirate ... priceless, priceless. I laughed so much that at one stage where Septimus arrives on the ship ... My God, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I loved her as a mother sketchy in Hairspray. But she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In general, it was interesting (but not stained stick at all!), romantic, special effects were not very often, but if they were, they were great; cameos from Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well placed. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this film to anyone who likes fantasy movies like The Princess Bride or even Lord of the Rings. He has kept my interest all the time, and I'll buy the DVD, when it comes out!
