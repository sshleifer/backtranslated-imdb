Independent function can now be viewed as a work of cinema and video resumes. Enter Broken and aggressively advertised, twenty minutes short of style and enthusiams regret. But it's no good as a movie, or it works only in demo part? Ah, there's the rub. <br /> <br /> Broken Story Bonnie Clayton, who kidnaps after waking up from a nightmare one night repeated "sadistic stranger and its picturesque surroundings" (quote from the video box). How it in captivity, it becomes obvious that her captors know that about her, that she did not even know about yourself. While they question her black-clad soldiers gun their way to their hideout in an attempt to save her. Mayhem stands. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, the Ferrari director Alex, seems to know what he is doing, or at least he pretends to be very good. Overwhelmed does not suffer from any lack of visual flair that is particularly flattering, given its budget and the lack of experience of all participants. What he is really suffering from the weak and the type of derivative letters. Think Long Kiss Goodnight meets the Matrix, written in ten minutes after reading Fight Club. The good news for Ferrari and producer / writer Jorge Rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored by a lot of eye candy on display. There is a story really matters that much in a short twenty minute meant to demonstrate the technical skills of their creators? No, not really. <br /> <br /> While it would be unfair to me to ignore any negative aspects in the light of the film's budget and length. Broken Sun genre classic. The biggest problem is that he really would have worked better as a feature. The final "turn" does not get to build enough time to be shocking. If Ferrari has allowed the time to slow down the burn function as required, story elements will seem less random, and the film is more complete. Here's knowledge, he gets a chance. <br /> <br /> Broken Audio's Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation second to none in the indie world. I have never heard such an aggressive environment with such a small function. Matrix soundtrack inspired by a very rich and deep, arrows have hit, and even dialogue falls into the surround effects. From all represented on this disc is the sound that tells praise for the modern independent DVD production. There are also just as impressive Dolby 2.0 surround track, which appears by default menu. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are literally an hour functions of solutions can be found on this disc. There are so many extras, in fact, that I find it impossible to list and describe each of them here, while still waiting for his readers to continue reading. Whatever the shortcomings of the actual short can have, the DVD is unprecedented in its information resources. People who enjoy the film, you can learn everything you need to know about their products, including everything from concept art to the campaign. Those who are planning to do an indie film alone can know almost everything there is to know of these functions. <br /> <br /> The extras are divided into categorical menu. These include: pre-production, production, post-production, and after a short cast and crew bios. From a critical point of view, I found that some of the sites were pretty short. If they had been edited in a short film on the menu, they have been less frustrating to navigate as the default before the selection curser with each return to the main menu section. This, of course, just nitpicking, but perhaps for a future DVD-releases filmmakers will take my advice to heart. <br /> <br /> He has six audio commentary hour interview staff and talented people, and in spite of the sale of goods in a consonant, their true colors really shine through. <br /> <br /> desire to share their film-making secrets with those who raise this DVD is pretty generous. With extras, I learned that for editing and effects software is the most reliable and effective that the camera brand to create the most professional look to the lowest price, even if you get cheap air soft guns. Besides, I got a few alternatives when I discovered that it is not able to find any products used in the production. Wannabe filmmakers do not want to read books on the subject should watch this DVD. <br /> <br /> In general, I killed the actual short as 6 out of 10, but I wish there was an option for a full-length potential and effort, because I would have killed him 8 or 9 in these areas. I recommend the DVD to their functions and, as a perfect example of what can be done with only eight thousand dollars. Those who buy a DVD may think of themselves as ghosts manufacturers for a larger project, as much attention these guys get, the more funding the full-length version will receive.
