One of my favorite movies, which was missed too many movie buffs, observation, which confuses me. Not only the director of the acclaimed Ang Lee, he had a lot of young actors who were to become major stars such as Tobey Maguire (up to Spiderman's), Skeet Ulrich (Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (to Tudor), Jim Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson, and Jewel. All the action was lovely, and each of the actors referred to gave memorable performances, especially Meyers portraying the evil villain who killed for the sake of killing. <br /> <br /> If the biography and achievements of the director (even if he received an Academy Award) and the actors on the list, this film is usually removed from their past performances. I found the movie on DVD by accident and it became one of my most frequently watched movies. However, rarely seen on every cable. I look forward to reading what others offer reasons this film is not very well known.
