As a popular sport like surfing a lot. Only after watching this film, I realized how dangerous it can be. In fact, surfers too afraid of big waves. Even someone was killed by them. But they were still surfing and having fun. Only daring people can do it. <br /> <br /> According to what is said, surfers, we knew exactly how they felt when a big wave came to them. You have to adapt to your best and avoid a direct impact with large waves. If you win it, obviously, it will bring you great pleasure. <br /> <br /> Strange cinematography can not be overlooked. This is absolutely a visual delight. <br /> <br /> A great sports documentary. 8/10
