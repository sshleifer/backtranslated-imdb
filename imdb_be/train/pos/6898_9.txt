It's ironic the film from the beginning to the announcer that makes fun of all the French, and then produces a rather naive, but very brave hero Fanfan La Tulipe. Actor gorgeous Gerard Philippe, dashing young man believes in fate does portend great Lollobrigida - in particular, that he married the daughter of King Louis XV! The problem is, La Lollo quick outs she too is in love with Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> Propelled good swords, cavalcades, and other energetic action sequences of the film moves at a rapid pace, and many comic moments. The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect, but the movie is so easy and takes himself so seriously-not that I could not give a second thought to these shortcomings. Look out for NoÃ«l Roquevert traditional heavy in French films, trying to steal the La Lollo, making himself a nuisance, and by providing the scenario to a fortune that reads La Lollo in hand! And what a gem it as Marcel Herrand megalomanous and the lust of the initiative of King Louis XV! That's not all: so many beautiful women in one movie makes me wish I in France and on the set back in 1952! The film may be released this year, but its liveliness, the cheek, great story, impeccable photography and memorable Gerard Philippe, make sure that it remains modern and pleasant to look at. I would not hesitate to recommend his grandchildren not to mention those who love cinema in general and, in particular, the fencer! How to see it!
