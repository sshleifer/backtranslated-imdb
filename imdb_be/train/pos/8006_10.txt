This is a great game! Well, maybe it was not some of the features it should have had, but Digital Anvil still come up with a good game. There is a certain resemblance to the Elite (you can trade, pick up weapons and cargo from destroyed ships, missions), but this game has a highly scripted mission. This is a great mission. The control system is different, it uses the mouse! You basically fly your spaceship around the system and work your way up! The game has some pretty good graphics, even after it was made in 2003, it should work well on even modestly named computer. History differs excellent voice acting from John Rhys Davies, George Takeo, Jennifer Hale (she appears in every computer game). Stick with the story he's getting better and better as it goes. There is even a section of the race, where you and the enemy should rush their spaceships around the course (it involves you going through the ring). In this section, it took me some time to beat. This adds variety to the game. Some sections are a little tough here and there, but overall you can beat this game. The game has an active scene modes on the web. Take a few mods to extend the game. I have not played any of the mods again. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the continuation of this has been canceled, the shame!
