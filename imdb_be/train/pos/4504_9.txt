Here I was thinking that "Nanook of the North" was the last word in "Eskimo" movies archaic semi-dock. How wrong! As an avid sea kayaker I stayed until 330am to look at it, hoping to get an idea of ​​some man-made, "the skin of the boat." The film did not let me down. Any student kayak construction / umiak should look-see here. (Note colleagues SKers: they appear to use Norton Sound kayak paddles with single blade) <br /> <br /> But the film went far beyond this narrow true interest .. Even though there were other celebrated some small bit fakey ago shot the film has so much heart they are just a minor annoyance. It was (in terms of this very amateur anthropologist), probably the perfect time to make this film. The beginning of the thirties: in the "" reason to so new that they (including Louis B. Mayer!) In fact, let the Eskimos speak their native language. And there are so many that it was still, in spite of the brewed melodrama present. They are really the beating that the polar bear, whale and the Caribbean. Fiftieth version of the film would be as a cheese with the "stars», Technicolor, etc., to the elastic band of his. Version of the seventies? Not even. Very good companion piece of this wonderful film "The White Shadow in the South Seas" (1928) Geograpically mirror image in "Eskimo" is also dealing with a ruthless and profound destruction of Western culture / technology on the unsuspecting people.
