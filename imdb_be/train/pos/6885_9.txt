He came unexpectedly. , .The influence and resoloution this movie was on my way automatic reactive to people and situations. Most clearly was confused emotions of anger. Much like the way a spoiled child will react, if not getting his way. ,. Hysteria, if you will. Thinking I was hiding the anger from others was the funniest comedy of all. What does it cost me? Soooo much love. , .Sooo many blessings. Now I attend, as an incredibly humbling feeling, and having a constant attitude of gratitude for life. , .For what is happening in the moment, without my wild life expected to be in a certain way, the way I think life or people "should" be. This film is promoted freedom I now feel, to connect with others without any restrictions and expectations. And to connect with real love. , .Bez fear of loss. , .Just like the first, and to accept that love is given.
