<br /> <br /> Have you ever felt like your watch as someone keeps tabs on every move you make? Well, just keep in mind before you decide to break the law, the FBI will always be there. At least, that's the feeling you get after watching an exciting, but slightly juicy crime drama, the FBI's history. He traces the roots of the organization from a small office in one of the most modern facilities in the world (in 1959), telling the story through the eyes of one of its agents, Chip Hardesty (James Stewart). <br /> <br /> Chip FBI from day one, and he gladly puts his work above everything else in the world, sometimes even his family. FBI history traces his life, drawing what he does as an agent, and how to be one influence on his personal life. The film does a poor job, showing which handles cases of the FBI and how they cope with them. The audience gets to see Chip Ku Klux Klan to stop the riots, to go undercover to solve the murder of Indian scandal / estate, to bring refugees into custody, rescue hostages, and helped fight in World War II. He even helped the Communists spies justice. <br /> <br /> Stewart in uncertain complex performance, the star (as always) as a slightly neurotic agent who loves his job, maybe too much. One of the best parts of the film is that we get to see the inside workings of family life as the Chip and his work. We see him suffering through the death of his best friend, and then his son. We are also seeing his wife, abortion, and his marriage, which has a rocky time. Almost all of his personal problems are caused by love for their work. Vera Miles gives spotty performance, but this is not very convincing, however. It has never been a brilliant actress, but has always been something very attractive and tempting about it. Well, maybe it's just me? Unfortunately, none of the other performances are not worth mentioning, but attention-grabbing stories failed to save me extremely interesting. <br /> <br /> cinematography of this film is impressive, especially the scenes in the South American jungle. Color all had a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film. Perhaps the biggest part of this film was an incredible direction Mervyn LeRoy. Each scene was so fluid, they just rolled a brilliant story to tell. This is a complete genius camera shots, some with very Hitchcockian sense. <br /> <br /> In general, the history of the FBI spectacular, but lose sight of the film. Clocking in at two and a half hours, some viewers may be intimidated, but if you get the chance, I recommend jumping into this. I enjoyed the impressive performance of Jimmy Stewart, and a fascinating story.
