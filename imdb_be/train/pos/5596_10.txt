"Resident" is a great film by Roman Polanski IMO. And I love the "Chinatown", but this one is so much more original and unconventional, and very terrible. This is also a great black comedy. Some people I showed this film was very disturbed * * after it so be warned it affects some people like that. Polanski does a great job acting the lead role in Â«The tenants' and direct it.
