Hey, people, what's the matter. This man that I am, the one and only Mike Â«Sonny Sakura Killer" Kelly. You know ........ you can not write a review scenario Sakura, cause there we are not alone. As far as I know, this story has just been made, as we went along. I had the best time in my life that makes this film, and received so much stink that I ran out of JISM ........... fun times. So glad that you enjoyed the film. I really did not get to make the fights that I anticipated. Every time I set up a few steps, the director continued to fight to change them. Nevertheless, I had a blast and met some really great people. Especially purple female ninja, who seems to get from shooting scenes.
