Ghost Train is an excellent and entertaining film, typical of the best of British comedy coolers 1930s and 40s. The antics of comedian Arthur Askey is not as funny as they used to be, seems to have been, but it can be overcome, considering it as a period piece or curiosity. <br /> <br /> For a low-budget production of wartime, Ghost Train atmospheric, effective, and it provides some real suspense. Great fun for a dark (and, yes, violent) night. Light, taking off his hat criticism, and enjoy.
