Concentrated in the center of the city and with the skirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be a terrific new comedy duo. "Noriyuki Pat Morita" a very funny man, who happens to be a police officer from Japan following industry thief of secrets, who stole the "type of proto" turbo super charger, reluctantly, he goes to the US to follow the thief, after the order of his commander. Pat character faces with character "Jay Leno" quickly said, "but up to business-to-player Detroit cop. If they overlap, though, dear "By" Japan meet total old school Detroit police investigations "Way." Two tripping and tripping with each other at first, but then develop «rythym», which turns into a two-layer command explosive plant, which solves the case, cold. After a fight with the boss urban crime stolen «equiptment» and closing the case, the two go on despising each other, to be friends and work together. A little worse for wear and in need of extended stays on top of all this, they were able to come to a victorious close. I appreciated this direction 9. A Lewis makes it almost perfect comedy. Fun for all ages. I highly recommend it. (***)
