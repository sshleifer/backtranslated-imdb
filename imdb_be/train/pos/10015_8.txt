Popular radio storyteller Gabriel is no single (Robin Williams, skinny and talk in hushed, hypnotic melodies) meet and make friends with a fourteen-year old boy from Wisconsin named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin), who wrote a book detailing sexual abuse by his father . To boot, the Pitot AIDS, and it makes even more Gabriel as his partner Jesse (Kannaval good) happens to survivors HIV itself. <br /> <br /> He also familiarized himself with the trustee Pete woman named Donna (Toni Collette, brilliant!), and when Gabriel decides that he wants to meet and talk to the two of them personally and sent to Wisconsin he reveals some of the secrets he was (of course) did not find it. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story that happened to Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the script with Terry Anderson) and director Patrick Stetner, this film moves much faster (90 min., can be a few minutes longer) than one might think a film of this genre will work. This is good in that it keeps the action and the plot is lean and clear. This is bad, that it leaves the various holes in the plot and does not sew up any portion of the openings or history. I'd rather not go into details, except to say that if you are not familiar with the works of Mr.Maupin, or his personal history, you feel a little out of the loop here. However, the performances the Williams (I would have liked to hear more of his story, personally), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin and most of the supporting cast (waitress Donna Restaurant Collette in haunts does a great job with the fact that a small part of it) with ' it is top-notch and set the mood here - namely, cold, lonely dark exterior Wisconsin and New York - to an amazing setting for this story. He may have ends that are not connected with each other particularly well, but it's still quite a convincing story to follow.
