During the first three seasons, Sabrina was a gem tucked away in the TGIF (and later, at the beginning of the school day, after lunch repetitions). Each episode was manic, idiotic energy and rapid fire pace that sometimes overcame an uncomfortable joke. Melissa Joan Hart radiated lively flair for physical comedy, especially in her facial expressions. Her two aunts, playing the "straight man" or as straight as the two witches could have had a great time and overall comic chemistry with the Charter. Salem, CÃ´te ,, was free to dabble in which whatever mad he was interested in, and one could laugh and take it all in stride, because he is, after all, who says the cat. friends Sabrina widened social experience at the school, which also housed a typical "evil cheerleader" and "totalitarian school." Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was an opportunity to combine pop culture (eg, age band, Jerry Springer), archetypal human / moral status (for example, the importance of friendship, the spirit of Christmas), and a literal representation of related metaphors in the Magic Realm. Unfortunately, like many other shows around the age of television, the show reached its peak during the first three years, which coincided with Sabrina to attend high school. since the fourth season, the transition to college notes that will be a sharp decline in the overall quality of the show, especially if the authors have chosen to submit Josh Harvey as a competitor, and concocting subtle excuses for u so Hilda and Zelda, to stay on the screen as the key players. The final season where Sabrina works in the magazine of pop culture, was clearly disappointed. However, in the end, Sabrina (especially school years) is a unique entry in the hybrid situational comedy with magical elements, elevates it above the exhausting rate, which is produced in this genre every year.
