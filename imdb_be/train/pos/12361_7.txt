Bellocchio treat this as basically a political film, a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy, but it seems that more metaphor than reality. Well, almost everything in the film seems to be a metaphor. Revolutionaries, of which we see and about which we know very little, could also be a mafia. . With the old and the new <br /> <br /> Papa Andrea, the analyst seems to stand for the usual traditional bourgeois values. - morally upright, quiet, clean and tidy, carefully ritualized <br /> <br /> Giullia, girlfriend revolutionary, it seems is something that can happen to someone who needs a very bad reason to support but not able to pick up this kind of loyalty obligation requires. (I believe that here.) Andrea teenager boy seems to be the only guy in the movie that is not in some way to the restless «upatz.» He respects his father, but was also against. He loves Giullia, or because we believe that although it is not really old enough to have learned to control their reflexes optimally, but it leaves it to show up in school and complete their final exams. His course between this controversial way of life can be described as "the media." He is a man among them, who know the value gradually, which can keep it in moderation while screaming about it. <br /> <br /> Most of the time this is added the oral part of his final, when he was asked to translate and comment on the excerpt from "Antigone", which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the concept of secularism and free will <br /> <br /> this brings us. - on no particular course that I know - to Marushka Detmars. She reminds New Yorkers cartoon a few years ago. Two hippos neck deep in the river, looking at a gazelle drinking from the bank, and one hippo says to another: "I hate it." She's a good actress. (Let me get that out of the way.) But everything else in the film. It brings with it, in his speech and manners, rich sequins open fainting. And all this comes from the actress is also not out of the director's help. Detmars Sun nuts as Catherine Deneuve was nuts, "Repulsion". The walls do not apply to rubber and rising hands. Instead, we see it Animated - sometimes too animated. And it gives us a shocking jolts when her mood changes dramatically and becomes threatening, as the approaching thunderstorm threatens. <br /> <br /> The critic described it as hot, but this is probably not the word he was looking for. It irresistibly beautiful her fluffy brown hair, her wide white ready smile, her giggle impulsive. And her eyes were like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs. Sexual pretty sexy part, not so much because one of them is obvious, and because we got to know the characters involved. (It's more fun to spy on a honeymoon couple next, we turn to a slight movement of the skin.) In fact, not so much sex. There is only one scene of simulated sexual intercourse, but the director allows him to play in what appears to be real-time. At least, for a real-time in the eighteen-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The young man who plays Andrea also good that the necessary thing, because the film is almost entirely dependent on him and Giullia. They have to wear it, and they do. If it were not for their performances, I'm not sure that it will be as exciting or as a wonderful movie like this. It could easily be turned into fairly slow, boring novel. <br /> <br /> It is worth.
