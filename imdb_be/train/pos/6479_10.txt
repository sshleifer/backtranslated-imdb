This is a fantastic series in the first place. It is very well done and very interesting. As a huge WWII buff, I learned a lot before going to see this series. One of the best things it has going for it is the entire interview with the last person back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking, that is. He has nothing against the people who you see getting an interview in the program today, it's just that most of these people were not really involved in the upper echelons of what happened then. One of the best parts are telling Sir Laurence Olivier. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the Second World War, but in reality only think hards (like me) want to buy this or watch it multiple times. My only real complaint about this whole series is that some of the facts are not as accurate as we now know. Especially with information about the Soviet Union, exaggerated or simply inaccurate in places. This information is now different now that we know, because of the fall of the USSR. Overall, a fascinating look at the Second World War and a must see for any serious World War II historical professional or personal, so.
