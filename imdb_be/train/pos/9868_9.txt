This is obviously aimed at the same market as Shrek and Monsters Inc, but differs in a less cartoony feel (despite a deliberately cartoon characteristics lead beings). History is not the one that was massive in your face at the end of morality (he was more like his pull on your shirt), but chooses only to tell a story about the relationship between "animals." You know the outcome, but you can not help engaging. <br /> <br /> characters themselves are much more than their voice (the advantage of lesser-known actors who do voice), unlike most Disney films. They are well-rounded and plausible, oddly enough. Group dynamics brilliantly well presented and the nature of the testimony, and fads are subtle and pleasant. You will find yourself rooting for them much sooner than you would think. <br /> <br /> Animation brilliant, as you would expect, and you will pray for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie. You fall in love with the characters, especially the comic prehistoric squirrel and his desperate attempts to bury their nuts. I left wanting to mandatory product, especially toy laziness, only to be disappointed the next day, when I could not find anything remotely connected. <br /> <br /> What is, oddly enough, makes the film all the more clear. <br /> <br /> Better than Shrek or Monsters Inc.
