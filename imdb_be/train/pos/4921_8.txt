Like A Streetcar Named Desire (also director Gadg both on stage and on the screen) Panic in the streets reflects New Orleans, where his main claim to fame - the birthplace of jazz - not even mention the speed. It was the seventh film Widmark and may have passed a long way toward creating it as a wonderful actor, he was in fact, not just a psychotic killer. Gadg himself appears in the credits of a small role in the morgue attendant, but the film is rich in talent, starting with Jack Palance (still billed as Walter Jack Palance) as a local Mr. "Big" side kick followed Mostel, Barbara Bel Geddes Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig plus unshakable always reliable Paul Douglas as police, walking around to the DOC WIDMARK perspective. This is very useful for the film more than a little to see. Catch it if you can.
