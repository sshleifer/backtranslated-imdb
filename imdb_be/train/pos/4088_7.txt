there is one. Not much to say about it except that it deals with a topic seldom touched in beastiality movies. I can understand why this film was banned for so long, the themes that are dealt with in the film a little taboo in most countries of the world will say eroticism in the film deserved and fits into the mood of the film. This is a good movie that is well acted and serves to shock the audience ... and cross the border, we do not often see in the movies. I came across this movie on the internet, I thought I would check. I liked the film, as a thoughtful and somewhat erotic at the same time. Something you rarely see in movies today.
