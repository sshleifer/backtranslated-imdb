I enjoyed this show for two reasons: 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Tapping. These two artists carried the show with the skilful support of constant and recurring actors. Replacing the RDA in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show. <br /> <br /> chemistry between all the main characters is huge. You get the feeling that actors like to pal around after stopping a rolling camera. This attitude is transferred to the program we will see. <br /> <br /> RDA gives his character "ONili" credible person. He never knows when to give it a rest wiseass. You see others roll their eyes in despair at some of his statements. However, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is dangerous. <br /> <br /> There is a lot going on between "Carter" and "O'Neill" beneath the surface. They manage to keep the bit on, but how often do. This episode «Solitudes» Season 1 was one of the best dramas ever seen on television. The love between them made the prospect of death bearable, because they are faced with. <br /> <br /> «Carter" and "Jackson" often have to smooth some of the turbulence created by "O'Neill". But tactical instincts "O'Neill" always seems to sound. He knows what to do, not to think about this question. Team several times been put at risk other without listening to his orders. <br /> <br /> The quality has declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. The original story arc was used mainly and new villains never really caught my interest. Ben Browder was much worse than the RDA in the show. He had the rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Tapping ringing in her performances, these two seasons. You could see it much changed looks after the child. She's probably thinking more about the child than the show. <br /> <br /> spin-off «Stargate Atlantis» has a few moments, but mostly weak effort. The main characters do not have the chemical composition of the original actors. Villains (Wraiths) so it is unlikely to be a clown. Maybe Tapping can breathe life into the program, or it will not go beyond the fourth season. <br /> <br /> There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. In order to have a spacecraft shaped like a pyramid design is a malformation rarely equaled in Sci-Fi. Using a torch to illuminate these ships are just as bad. Mannerism use of decoration from ancient Egypt hides an ultra-modern technology is just as difficult to agree. <br /> <br /> I wonder about some of the continuity of the show, too. In the season 2 of the knife, 'Daniel Jackson removed his uniform and has a gaping hole where he was wounded. He climbs into the sarcophagus and treats his body and regains its shape, he just went on a rack in a wardrobe closet. The episode "Hathor" is the sarcophagus into the hands Yes, but it is never mentioned again. This device can be used in the last few episodes on "Daniel", "ONill" and "Dr. Fraser.
