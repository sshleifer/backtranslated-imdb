I saw this movie back on the international film festival in Palm Springs in 2005 and 14 films I saw there, I would rate this as my # 3 movie. I had initial interest to see this creature of Swedish descent himself with many of my ancestors who come from the Norrland region in Sweden, where it was filmed. Also, I grew up in a rural area of ​​the northern forests of America, where there are many small towns were the same as setting the film. Nice to see more films with the use of the countryside as their parameters, such as catfish SÁ I himmelen. It was a very good movie, and I'm sure it's very difficult film to pull off with its large ensemble cast, but the director Kay Pollka really pulled this leave after nearly two decades of absence from directing. Helen Sjöholm in her debut film as an actress movement was fantastic, and I'm looking forward to more of her on the big screen. I enjoyed Nyqvist in a string of well-rounded cast. I highly recommend this film and evaluate it at 9.0 on a 10 point scale.
