This film is a kind of Kerry meets Heavy Metal. We are talking about high school kid who gets picked on a lot, and he fully gets revenge with the help of the ghost of Heavy Metal. this is a classic. Soundtrack A ++++. You got a living legend in her metal. And Mark Price was great in this movie. It should be metal fans.
