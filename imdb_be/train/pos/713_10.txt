this film is amazing. like. it actually says Associate Professor lot or do a lot, but it's a wonderful film to watch because of how stupid it was. High School takes evil ms.togar, he hates one thing that all students love, rock & roll. Riff Randall get tickets for Ramones show and the movie peaks with taking over the school I brought my riff Randall & The Ramones. This movie has everything a bad scenario, questionable direction, bad actors (ie, Clint Howard and pr soles), an amazing soundtrack, extreme campyness, these items & much more come together to do it, it's a classic. <, Br /> <br /> note - literally Ramones set, note that Darby collapse of microbes is in front of the crowd. Neat-o.
