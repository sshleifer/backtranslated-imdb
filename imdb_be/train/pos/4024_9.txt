I loved this movie. He kept me guessing until just before the end, what will happen. One of the best films of the section, I saw. Matondkar gorgeous too. This is one of the most personal and down to earth movies that I saw on the wall. It is slightly smaller than the mainstream Gadar, and it's really an emotional roller coaster, where you start with one opinion about what is happening, and to leave all alone on the other side. This is not a typical Bollywood fare, but rather a type of art-house cinema. The best part of this movie is that it dehumanizes not one of the parties of the conflict of separation when focusing on the history of others. He did not blame or castigate, and allows you to draw your own conclusions about things.
