Paulie sounds like the most saccharine, maudlin and sentimental junk you could find, but it really is much better than one would expect. Daftness plot could easily set the tone for the whole movie, but in fact most of the other departments of movie magic. <br /> <br /> In case you're wondering, Paulie the parrot. Bought for a little girl with speech difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend, and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on his shoulder during class speech therapist, and eventually he became a super-intelligent speaker. But Paulie sent the mother of a little girl, and he spends the rest of the movie trying to get from New York to Los Angeles to reunite with her. <br /> <br /> So why is it sounds terrible success of the film is good enough? Firstly, it has some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. The second (and much more significantly), it has the courage to embrace it ridiculous premise and said truly, that moves, often humorous stories, without worrying about the obvious flaws in the storyline. Third, it has a somewhat strange strong performances, including Jay Mohr as a cunning deceiver, Gena Rowlands as a kind old lady, and Cheech Marin (yes, dope-harness Cheech Marin!) The musical immigrant. This may not be a classic, but Paulie sound entertainment for children of all ages.
