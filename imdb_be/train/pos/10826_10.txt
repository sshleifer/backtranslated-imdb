I rarely got out of watching a movie with such a warm, happy feeling. I felt as if I were very good friends and had a great time! I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The acting was great, although I would mention Bill Nye, in particular, gives an absolutely flawless performance. Bill is an excellent actor and would like to see him in more films. Timothy Spall, Jimmy Nail and well loved and always love to see them, as they give a good performance. Billy Connolly, as always, is absolutely gorgeous. It was a wonderful ensemble performance by all stakeholders. Such a refreshing experience to see the well-written, superbly acted and beautiful film.
