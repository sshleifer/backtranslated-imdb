Some have compared this film to deliverance. I think, Of Mice and Men is more appropriate. Our leading man, Heaton, of course, loves Spike. It is irrelevant, and immaterial, that is whether sexual love. This is the reason Heaton leaves Spike. He needs it. They need each other. As brothers, as a family, as their only connection to humanity. Installation scenario, the minimum throw all folded into a thin film. Frankly, I do not care what happened to the characters. But I worry that the filmmaker did with them. It is well with them. I spent some time wondering how the end will resemble mice and humans. Soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing.
