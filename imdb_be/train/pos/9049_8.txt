There is an old saying that applies to the petrol of the new film by Joe Johnston, which goes something like this: "The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can not both be right." It is very presumptuous statement with reference to Statement motivation and faith in a man who, in this film is so, even after the road blocks and the family trouble get in your way. <br /> <br /> "October SkyÂ» is about a young man who believes in himself, as a young man Homer Hickam, grew up in a strict, traditional family in the 1950s. Homer loves small coal-mining town where almost every man grows to be a miner. all his friends, Quentin, Roy, and ODell all think that their life will be like everyone else after high school. Homer did not come out that in the future. <br /> < br /> one night, while everyone is looking at the sky, a Russian spacecraft called Sputnik passes overhead. This is something new to Homer, and he finds in an exciting and overwhelming. From this point of view, his outlook on life will never be the same. <br /> <br /> First of all, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the field of rocket scientist for the profession. Startled out he says, his family passes this idea on their heads and continued life as usual, his friends, however, believe that this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin very smart individual, when it comes to this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> If the four friends are beginning to test the model and the missiles to blow up a white picket fence to the ground, something that seems a forest fire scared them, they are forced to stop their progress. <br /> <br /> performances in this film is absolutely riveting from start to finish. All the actors give performances, as if this is a real fetish here. Standing out in all its glory: Laura Dern, Miss Riley. It very well may be Academy Award material, when judges can remember back to the beginning of the year, when the film is released. <br /> <br /> The characters are also very well developed. Not only filmmakers provide a clear, apparent reason why Homer is interested in this subject, but they also explain the audience how they succeeded in their studding rocket. We clearly understand all the motives and beliefs of the characters, especially his father, who leaned on the eternal tradition. <br /> <br /> The film unfortunately loses some of its momentum in the mid-point of a foolish, romantic podagovor processed with the love interest of Homer and his brother stole it from him. This type is becoming so terribly common in secondary schools movie is not what this film is aimed at high school students. Actors looking at each other mad, as in trans. I put up with it without complaining in 1997 year in "Inventing the Abbot," but I've had just about enough of this. <br /> <br /> But this is only a minor complaint. With authentic looking period of time, film clips worth an Oscar and the real life of Homer and friends at the end of which all hit it big with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great film of 1999. <br /> <br />
