Carmen is one of the best films I've ever seen. It is difficult to say whose performance best: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol is superb.They dance with your soul. This is a beautiful story about the continuity of life and myth; myth penetrates into everyday life. Dance becomes life and whole life dancing. Real people at the same time to live your own life and become someone else, play part of the old fans. Magic continues.
