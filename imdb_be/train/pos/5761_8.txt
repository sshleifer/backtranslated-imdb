I swear, that was killed by a zombie than twice, and kept coming back. I made this film in person 8. Let this people, this is exactly what the other reviewers say it is, "user-friendly camera" shot the film. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to complete Indy film making. The fact that Todd letters received more than 700 zombies to appear in this film, a tribute to his talent. Yes, history has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies again and again, but who really cares? Take it for what it is, a fun and bloody horror film, one to share with the kidneys, or the gross of the people you really care about LOL. Mellow of people, I think you'll like pieces of garbage like "Titanic" or "Twister" instead. World, and support the decisions of the independent film !!!
