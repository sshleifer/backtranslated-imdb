I like this film because it is a fine work of cinema, made by people who care enough to make an art, not just home movies. It is filled with homemade video Super surfer Greg Noll and boat amateur videos from other people who join his 50-year-old passion. However, it has been expanded to such an extent that it is close to the aesthetic glory. It is filled with artistic talent and sports talent, however trivial you might think surfing to be sporty. Surfers Sun astronauts or test pilots. And they are not surgeons (possible) or candidates (again, maybe). He believes that in the search for a surfer. He believes in the beauty of the human goofiness. He believes in the great gift of peace that comes from ending the war. Surfers marks the termination of the war in the north beach on the Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years ago. He notes down the time in the country, which fought the Cold War, instead of a hot war - with the Russian socialists. Surfing is the ultimate narcissistic. It's dangerous, but only a little historical. I suspect that Alexander the Great is celebrated on his surfing technique. He had to go out and win a few dozen countries to get favorable press that he received. This film does not have a military heroes. It has no weapons. The only beach head surfers conquer a beer stand and and surfboard shop. This is not a problem. The world is not desperate. It is the joy of exhalation.
