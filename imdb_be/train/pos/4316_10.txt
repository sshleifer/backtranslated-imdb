I must say that the Grand Canyon is one of the most moving films I've ever seen. I watched it a few times now and I still feel like I have for the first time; that this film is, in itself, can make the entire curriculum in graduate school in film directing. <br /> <br /> A long time ago the movie trailers used to promise "This will make you laugh, it will make you cry." This is a very trite and abbreviated description of the method that makes the Grand Canyon. It takes you to the best places in the human experience, and the next moment will bring you to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is stimulated to cycle back and forth between people who are close to the same happiness and the people close to the horror. It is always a short step, too. Just to manage this swing with grace and without making it look false or exaggerated is the directorial genius. <br /> <br /> Spoiler (sort of) comes up. Upon receipt of the audience, which is used for rocking back and forth across the emotional spectrum, the film throws a curve with a sequence that does not go from good to bad and back, but instead exacerbated the usual marital spats, through casual self-inflicted knife wound, which may or may not It may require stitches to the earthquake, which has the characters to escape from the house. At the moment of their relief, the argument forgotten, cut fingers forgotten, he survived an earthquake, a neighbor woman screaming that her elderly husband collapsed. Couple rushes to his aid. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw him. I cried. Do not be sad, that does it for me. It is not particularly boring sequence. What breaks me that it is a few minutes of the film were perfect. It's great! Strange. (End spoiler) <br /> <br /> There's so much to say about the Grand Canyon. It reflects the relatively ordinary people experiencing enlightenment and allows the viewer to experience them indirectly. They are not flashy or exaggerated, and there is no long pause to carefully consider this point. The film moves on to the rhythm of life. Even if the characters are really trying to understand what has happened, they are not sure what to get from the experience. <br /> <br /> The Grand Canyon is very human film.
