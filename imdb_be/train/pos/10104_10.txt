Speech by Om Puri, Patil and Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off well, along with a minimalist approach to the story and the direction of Govinda Nihlani. Dialogues Vijay Tendulkar also great. <br /> <br /> I have not seen another movie like this. This integrally formed, each part fits so well in the plot. You can not help but be impressed by this film. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri comes off as overbearing husband and «BAAP» Om Puri. Om Puri is a young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv Rama Shetty gives just about the right touch to the film with his smile and soft speaking villain. The first meeting with Anand Velankar Rama Shetty in place Sadhashiv absoulely is stunning. Patil does not play a major role, but part of it also does not distract from the main plot. <br /> <br /> And to add to all this Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a police officer who came to an agreement with the system and its operation. Saying the right things in the right places and know how to keep yourself out of trouble. He is also a "guru" with Om Puri and helps him when he gets in trouble. <br /> <br /> The film not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by the police officer, trying to do his duty, but also the other side of the atrocities in the police station. Om Puri captures the hopelessness and a burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> treat for all avid fans of Indian cinema.
