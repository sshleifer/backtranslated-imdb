Stephen King movies curiosity with me. I really like them either, or I hate them. Some of the more complex productions (such as despair and Storm of the century), I did not use. Some of the smaller ones I really liked. Sleepwalkers is one that I really enjoy and watch it on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They Sleepwalkers, werewolf creatures that, although man, as external shift in the cat's mind as being. They are resistant to scratches and cats every time they move to a new city, lay traps to catch and kill animals. If they move to their last city, they should look for a virgin and when Charles finds that he actually falls on her, but his mother should feed from her to keep up her strength. The story revolves around what will happen to the girl. Will Charles regret it or use it to save his mother. <br /> <br /> While this story has overtones of incest, which some may find unattractive, he actually plays a role in the history and, therefore, is not simply released in the cinema for the scandal. Like most stories of Stephen King it is based in a small town with lots of interesting characters. Act is not the best, and the special effects are not, however, one way or another, all this has a tendency to "gel" and is very watchable and enjoyable adaptation <br /> <br /> For UK readers :. These products have been shown most recently on BBC1, Sci-Fi and / Horror channels Sky Thriller.
