While in fact, another chapter in the history of "the US supported, the Latin American revolution", this film chronicles in real time, which can happen when the poorest people, armed with unity, political savvy and courage! <br /> <br /> political ideas proposed by this film are priceless. Creates illustrations private media as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. We see that the poor people of Caracas are struggling with the harsh reality "of American politics." One gets the distinct feeling of hopelessness, when people are not able to address the blatant tyranny, which was suddenly and illegally, hard on their accomplice. We also see the arrogance and fascism, with the CIA-supported, private media, plutocracy, and the generals who have conspired to bring back to Venezuela under US domination. Although adept under the leadership of President Hugo Chavez, Caracas residents are forced to operate without it, after Chavez was forcibly abducted by renegade generals. Their reaction is the climax of the film. If one is looking for a great portrait of the US government, Hugo Chavez, and revolutionary Venezuela, all of this film it!
