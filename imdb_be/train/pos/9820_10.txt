It is very good, made-for-television movie. It reflects the problems in the suburbs around the 1970s, and one kind of neighbors, of course, does not want to have around. The worst and most upsetting part of the movie was when punk teenagers killed the family dog. Teens do everything to annoy and harass this poor family. But boy! Makes protagonist vengeance on those punk teenagers, after all. Father / homeowner, of course, do not take all the aggravation of punk teenagers easily and quickly to retaliate after the lack of help from the police, that is. He appears to them and protects your home and your family. Very good actor..I might add. <br /> <br /> I watched it on TV when I was 8 or 9. I have never seen it again on TV, and I would like to. Definitely a good friend! This kind of film one can catch a very late on a weekday evening, night, and can not stop watching or afternoon movie on the weekend. This is the kind they just do not show more. <br /> <br /> This is definitely worth a look!
