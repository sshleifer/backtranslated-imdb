This film has always been my Favorit Disney movie. Then on 11/21/01, I saw 30-aniversy this DVD movie. WOW, I remembered why I loved this movie. DVD is so great, it has an additional 30 minutes, which originally was not. I did not know about it when I first started playing. The film has made everything so much more since then. The music they were cut to stay. You have not seen this film, as long as you have not seen the full 131 minute version. Many people say that the music is forgotten. I remember every song in this film in the memory, each song has its own charm on it myself, and it comes together as a hole. I remember when I was younger, I had a "Brier" song stuck in my head for several days at a time. As well as "brine of the sea" (the song was intended to marry poppens, but was cut from the movie), please refer to the new director 30 aniversy film and re-vote for the film. 10 that it is in fact.
