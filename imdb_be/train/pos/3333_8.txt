I have to see it on a plane to New Zealand last week, and was wondering how he would measure up to the UK as a film and a book. I must say that I was a favorable impression. If something fanatical commitment to the Red Sox for years of poor works even better than the original commitment to Arsenal, who have had success for many years. I was also interested in the Brit to see that you do not need to understand baseball to get what's going on. One question comes to mind - the script was written using the Sox as a team before they finally broke the Curse of the Bambino? There was another team in the frame? As a supporter of Red Sox themselves (strange, I know, a Briton who understands baseball) I must say that it has added to the pleasure.
