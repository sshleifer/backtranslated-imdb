Anna (Charlotte Burke), which is just on the border of puberty begins to feel strange dreams that begin to affect her in real life. - especially with a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers), who she meets in her dreams <br /> <br /> It is very unusual fantasies with some really scary moments. Despite the fact that this is about a teenage girl and is rated PG-13, it is not for children. Also, if you hate fancy stay away. But if you play something else it fits the bill. <br /> <br /> Well, directed by Bernard Rose from a beautiful score and some good, terrible shock. The only thing that prevents this from being a truly great film Burke - he's not a very good actress (it is not surprising that this was her only film), and it harms the film. Nevertheless, all the rest is just fine <br /> <br /> spire very well, as Mark. Glenne Headly (faking British accent is very good) is also very good, as the mother of Anna and Ben Cross is both terrifying and sympathetic father. <br /> <br /> Anna sleeping hit when released in 1988, it has since disappeared. It's too bad - it's actually very good.
