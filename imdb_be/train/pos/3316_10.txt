Bette Midler indescribable in this concert. She gives her all every time she is on stage. Whether we are talking laughing at her jokes and antics or wipe the eye strains of one of its huge ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can not see it live (what is the best way to see Betty), it is the next best thing. An interesting thing to look at how incredible her voice changed and matured over the years, but has never lost its power. Its more "vocal correct" version of «Stay With Me» never lose anything in the spirit of a rose or the Divine MADNESS, this is just a cleaner and as a heart as never before. I will cherish this concert for a very long time.
