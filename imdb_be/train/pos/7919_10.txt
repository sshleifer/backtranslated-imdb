Without a doubt, is conceived as a fully mannerisms joke, «Full Moon High» reflects a 1950s teenager Tony Walker (Adam Arkin), accompanying his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Of course, Tony gets bitten, and grows fur and fangs, when there is a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect of this film is that it can not age as long as he is a werewolf curse, and that he must fulfill destiny. - even if it takes twenty years <br /> <br /> But otherwise, the movie is just ridiculous when he gets going. Ed McMahon character is more patriotic right Yahoo (he believes that everyone should listen to Joe McCarthy ~ d), Kenneth Mars coach / principal is busy weakling, but there's more. One of the actors is instructive Demond Wilson - best remembered as the Lamont on "Sanford and Son" - as the bus driver, who gets a big surprise. But perhaps the funniest scene of the change of presidents; the gag with Gerald Ford summed it up really! Anyway, it is a real pleasure. Given that Alan Arkin - who plays a funny psychiatrist - has just won an Oscar on Sunday evening and thanked his sons, wondering whether or not remember that he co-star with two of them in this film (except for Adam, his son Anthony also has a small role). Pretty funny. Also starring Elizabeth Hartman <br /> <br /> PS :. Director Larry Cohen, probably the most famous child killer movie, "he's alive."
