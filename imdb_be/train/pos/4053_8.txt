I remember it like it more than Nausicaa of the Valley of winds in an age when the tone of the story was too serious for me. Laputa, whose name seems to have affected his release in the US, in order to avoid confusion with the broader Hispanic audience has a cartoon agility debut directorial production Conan. In fact, Notch has thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan - who jumped thousands of stories that carry his girl in his arms and landed on his feet, and then began to work. This makes it the most animated and pleasant character to watch. The Techie Nausica fans may be disappointed flying beetles and retro technology through the exit Laputa - the only exception might be a robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and the Valley of the Winds, the theme of Laputa is not directly connected to the environmental protection. If there is a theme for all the anti-war. The importance of wildlife - this is due to the flying castle is dismissably discussed shortly, and in fact it was not until the end. In general, I am now considered as part of at the crossroads between good health and banal.
