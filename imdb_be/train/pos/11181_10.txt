This is one of the terrible, terrible and most heartbreaking horror movies EVER! <br /> <br /> Dr. Creed (Louise) and his family move to a new house with his wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie) and young son (Gage) All seems normal, until Dr. Creed does not lose one his patient, who had a terrible head injury, while he chases the ghost know how Viktor takes him to the Pet Sematarty and show him where the dead come back to life. <br /> <br /> Louis, not knowing if this is all a dream and talk to Ellie, who are concerned about your cat, it can be killed by a truck, and then Rachel says Louis, it's really hard to talk about the death of her sister Zelda, who was very ill (as we see in flashback as the patient her sister, in fact, and this is one of the most terrifying scenes ever!) <br /> <br /> the next day Luis gets a call from Jed saying that the cat was killed Jed truck and take it to the place where Victor Ghost told him not to go! And bury the cat, his wife and children have to go to see their grandparents and Louise home alone shocked to see the cat back, and now he is evil in it's eyes, so he goes to Jed then Jed told him that he He buried his dog there too (as we have seen another flashback). <br /> <br /> Later in the movie with the family having a picnic, playing with a kite Gage and Gage Sea I throw it, "the wind blowing the rod side of the road where the truck is on a fast past, Gage closer to the road, Louis rushes to get it, the most heartbreaking scene in any horror film will leave the jaw on the floor or Shivers go down the back when you hear Louis screams, he soon enough it so much, Louis then hides Gage in the same place where is buried the cat. <br /> <br /> the worst thing in this movie is the fact that some of the scenes in this film are not so far from real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is simply amazing and acting on all was great! 10 of 10
