# 3 in the trilogy, the young John Travolta blockbuster. He dances disco, rock and roll and country. He's heading to Houston to find a job and love. Jill is a hot spot, and the time of mechanical bull. Not to be outdone, I was riding a bull at a club in Nashville. I recently saw this almost forgotten film on television and remembered how good it was and how good the year 1980 was. I wore a black cowboy hat in this year as well as Travolta. Debra Winger was in his prime. She looks great in her red top. There is a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy seem the perfect couple, even if they are garbage trailer. They broke up just because it feels so good together again. Urban Cowboy has an amazing soundtrack. We will hear from the Eyes The Eagles and Lookin 'For Love Lies Johnny Lee.
