If this is an American film, I would rate it 7: we have seen this before. As it is an Argentine film, and, himself an Argentine, I would give it a 10, because it is the kind of quality I was hoping -rather than expecting- for. This is an excellent quality of surprising, considering all the restrictions imposed on the third world ... <br /> <br /> I can not forget the scene where Diaz makes the groom Silversteinsa admit-you know what I mean in mind if you've seen the movie. I think this is the key moment of the film, it is not surprising, perhaps, but original. That's when the real action begins. <br /> <br /> Before viewing the film, I always try to gather some preliminary information. As it is the mainstream, satyric, commercial, pressing «Play» and make the suspension of reality and logic, I would say that the best state of mind to enjoy a movie like this. It is impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole story, but it looks like too. As for me, I could not help but laugh at every joke and comments - "Sos apple" ( "you are stingy") ... to put in the mouth of Diaz, the greatest one <br /> <br /. > I'm pretty tired of seeing films "intended for" Peretti. I know that he is a great actor, but sometimes I feel it is unfair role opaque rest, the role of Louis Luka in this case. I do not like the Argentine television, so I did not see much of the work of Luke, but it's pretty obvious that he's a great performer. Its physical role, his views, the content relationships in this film made me fall in love with his performance. I think its role should need upgrading, just to let him show us how great it can be! <br /> <br /> I do not know whether Szifrón plans to make a sequel or not. I know that he will not do it if it is to follow the rule that "the second part was never good," so that if he does that, I will certainly go see it. And I hope that in the future, taking into account the possibility to Peretti colleagues in the same chances to develop their roles. <br /> <br /> Great movie, great performances and lots of laughter!
