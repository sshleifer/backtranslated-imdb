Bette Midler again Divine! Raunchily humorous. In love with the burlesque. Are able to bring you to tears or old jokes with new dresses or just with old songs with more power and punch than ever. All in all the new sing ballads, the power of good old / perennial those singing, such as «The Rose»; "Stay With Me" and may even "Wind Beneath My Wings". The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always Liebe - as it is the next best thing to it, I strongly recommended that all adults with a mixture of fascination and appreciation naive and mischievous child's desire to push the boundaries of all!
