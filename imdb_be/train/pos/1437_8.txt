We often see films about unwanted things happen in politics, but I still recommend «City Hall». In the role he was born to play, stars Al Pacino as New York mayor who deals with shooting the boy. But it does not work, there is nothing that he will actually have any effect. In this film, the characters, as the rough, as one might expect from those who are involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust any given policy, you may have your doubts after seeing this film. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can not name a single specific example of something similar to what reflects this film, but that's not the point. If we had an idealistic impressions of those who are at the top of the tear film such ideas down. Of course, the one that I encourage you to see. Also starring John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Franchoza and David Paymer.
