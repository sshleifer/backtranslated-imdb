Recently, I came across this movie on TNT five minutes into it, while on vacation in Florida ... (hey there has to be some down time at the hotel, right?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any feature film on TNT. I mean «Drive Me Crazy» is not that old already, right? <br /> <br /> But I stuck with it, and was quite amazed and entertained. Melissa plays its role as a psychotic Jennifer fine. The supporting cast (Nick, ex-con boyfriend, Karen, her best friend, and her life is controlled by the parents) all add a great degree of plausibility. Twist at the end was a nice closure to the story of a girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, check it out! <br /> <br />
