American icon Henry Fonda reflects the "Elegant" John Howard, who grows old truck driver, who was his favorite big rig "Eleanor" repossessed after a long stay in the hospital led him to miss his pay. Deciding that he would like to make only one race, he breaks out of the hospital, stealing back Eleanor and intercepts with an old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who needs to move her troupe of prostitutes. <, Br /> <br /> Excellent work FONDAS 'it is a natural anchor for a movie that tugs at the heartstrings as effectively as it tickles the funny bone in a comic scene. A wonderful cast including Robert Englund as the reluctant young sidekick, Susan Sarandon (who also received co-producer credit), and Dub Taylor (wonderful ham, as always, in the most overtly comedic parts of the image) helps immensely. <, Br /> <br /> ultimately life-affirming nature of painting and sharpness of the way to carry the weight of the incredible; this is a picture, then under the condition that you are in it, you can remember a long time after the end <br /> <br /> The promises open roads clearly displayed here. countryside just looks beautiful. Install Craig Safans' perfect score, this beautiful picture in terms of aesthetics. <br /> <br /> It loses something in its final act (characters played by John Bayner and Austin Pendleton, a little more than the intrusion), but it still retains its good vibes thanks to the appeal of its central characters. <br /> <br /> Not all operating / drive into schlock image one would expect from the name (especially the alternate title "Big Smokey Hurdle"), it is useful experience of the movie that I can recommend without any hesitation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
