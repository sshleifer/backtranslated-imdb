I saw this movie the day it came out good deeds in the past year. Cheerful I thought. Well, now it's on video, and I saw him again. I love this movie! What they do is sometimes dumb, but that's what makes my third favorite film of all time. Special effects in the order, but the witty dialogue you will be rolling. I am a man who will say that I am inspired by this film, so if you like drama and other things to avoid. But for everyone else, enjoy! Action is excellent. Hank Azaria is hands down the best (he neither Communists nor fruit) followed by Ben Stiller (well, do not correct me. It disgusts me), and then by William H. Mays, who deliver their best performance (obscured Fargo) Everyone has praised all of the Mace to garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was pretty good as invisible Boy. Two problems: The most unfortunate part of the film is a plot romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani, and the parole hearing of Casanova. Some scenes are absolutely advance the story in any way, but they are a blast. Kinka and especially writers tend to drag on the stage as long as all this fun there, but bam they switch and you're ready for more. I swear I saw it, you'll get tired of the explosive climax (which I thought was pretty cool) The camera is pretty cool, and moving at a furious pace with the actors. In addition, Tom Waits delivers excellent performance (he has a kind of cool bad character coolness to it), and as someone said, that the best part, when the characters show some humanity to them. Capital of the country is quite funny (especially his speech to Casanova about his perfect plan-I rode) and the peak is pretty cool, like Casanova. One of beef: the funniest comedian ever (Izzard), almost nothing, but his heart is in the right place. So all in all, an interesting film. I give twenty stars and hope that one day, everyone will see the sparkle in the best parody of the film, The Six Million Dollar Man alone. Laughing right now as I think about it. 20/10
