«Magic» is not too strong a word for this film weaves a spell. You find yourself relax, and see the other in a more friendly light ... Any movie that has that civilizing influence on the audience, deserves serious attention. Occasionally we soaked in the beauty, . as it is as if that were not enough, it's funny performances, without exception, unusual, but special mention should be made of the excellent Miranda Richardson and a wonderful Josie Walker -.. as open as roses <br /> <br /> Why not this movie on DVD? He deserves to live forever.
