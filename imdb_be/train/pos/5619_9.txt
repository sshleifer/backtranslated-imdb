I once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide, and our apartment was in the house, where you could get the violation on fifty dollars noise of sneezing after midnight - so, needless to say, I can easily relate to Polanski's "resident". <br /> <br /> But I like the film for other reasons. I'm not sure that it works as a whole - the origin of the character Polanski into paranoia and madness, which takes the final half hour or so, it seems rather harsh and strange. Ebert, for example, was completely convinced, and he hit film with a vicious one-star inspection. But I think that some scenes and moments work beautifully, so that even if I do not quite understand the whole movie - it's what Egyptologist has to do with it, for example? - I still have an overall positive impression of it <br /> <br /> I love Bernard Fresson reflect back to each, for example .. My God, how many times I stopped that stupid friends like that, rather than to have no friends at all! I love the movie theater scene - the funniest "making out" time in the history of cinema, I would say. And boy, I love Isabelle Adjani - she is so foxy in this movie, it's almost unbelievable. And it gives a great performance as always <br /> <br /> Polanski good actor, too. I do not agree with a few disparaging remarks about his performance here. His character must be reserved and thoughtful, so it is suitable restrained performance. For example, I found it quite sympathetic - though he lost me a bit when he started wearing clothes for no apparent reason, it is clear <br /> <br /> So, the film is unclear .. And slowly. But it captures the quality of life alienates apartment - what I've done entirely too much - so I dig. Funny how all you need is a common reference point, and suddenly eccentric movie like this becomes deeply significant! Definitely worth charging for pocket change on DVD.
