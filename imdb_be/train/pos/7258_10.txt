I was lucky enough to get a DVD copy of the film in recent years and now saw him for the 2nd time. The first time was on a late night TV in Australia for more than 20 years ago, but I could never forget this amazing and dark movie .. <br /> <br /> Not too many people like this movie at all, because it is so unconventional - the fact that hardly any spoken dialogue in this movement - we just hear the thoughts of heroes - this is only one aspect of his unconventional <br /> <br /> looking for a copy of this movie, I learned that the manufacturer was . died, the main actor was dead, could not resist in any British television and film archives, it has never been released on video or DVD, that television networks around the world destroyed it after their copyright ran out in the 80s. When he was first shown on television in Australia has not been recorded for consumer devices. <br /> <br /> On the second view in the last time, I could understand why it was unforgettable. Sometimes it is very busy and unbearably claustrophobic very similar to Harold Pinter. <br /> <br /> Again, if someone wants a copy of this DVD, please email me, and I'm sure we can work something out Regards Adam (whiteflokati@hotmail.com)
