This movie is a lot of fun. I recommend you see it yourself, and then see it again with friends. I did last night and it was very interesting how well Norma Khouri could get everyone in your world! I feel a little strange watching my friends go through the same roller coaster as I did the first time. But they all thanked me and loved the movie. You know, it's a great movie, if you spend 2 hours after the film talk about the film! <br /> <br /> Once I saw the fraudster almost to the level toNorma Huri, but no where near the same size of the ring. He fooledtons very trusting and wealthy people in my old Berkeley CA AA a group where everyone trusts everyone else. He "sponsor" the only people who seemed to be doing very well. Who knew that he would have stolen more than 100K (in 1987, when it was real money) once in just 1 month. His victims were very fragile, as they were in the first month or week of sobriety. He was not angry with a big laugh and a big smile on his face. <br /> <br /> above crimes is nothing compared to the fact that Norma Khouri made his old neighbor. But I do not want to give anything away. <br /> <br /> I just found this one night on Channel movie late at night, «Showtim» I think. It is always the fans the most experience to be fully tricked to see something and have your mind blown. Just drag your friends to see it and do not tell them a thing. This is a very interesting film, it moves quickly and you never get bored. <br /> <br /> This should be an international classic for all ages. I believe that all the great movies will eventually rise to the top. Time will be very good for this film. I just regret that no one had heard of him yet, in a way that makes the surprises even better. <br /> <br /> The director and editor were fantastic. They deserved to win best documentary. <br /> <br /> Just to see this movie!
