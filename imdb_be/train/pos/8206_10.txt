Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the 4th series of the film Dirty Harry. Clint older, but he's still got it, Harry said to have a rest after some of the problems that have occurred because of the robbery (where a memorial «Make My Day» catchphrase comes from!) But the city he took leave was worse, the woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in rides and is starting to get the punk one by one. The last movie to see Sandra Locke Clint Eastwood! Improvement after enforcer, who was a little more comedy and less severe. Points Clint Eastwood were gargoyles, which are best known for sunglasses that are Shwartzeneger Arnold in Terminator. Worth watching if you like Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry movies or thrillers like crime scene.
