Any true fight fan would have to consider this Wrestlemania be one of, if not the best of all time. It was packed with excitement and surprises. One of the greatest matches of all time was between Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin with special guest ref Mike Tyson. It shows that Michaels put on was incredible, especially considering the form that his back was in, and that it was his last match.
