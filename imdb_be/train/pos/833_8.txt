First of all let me say that the director has an excellent use of the names in his set shots. I really enjoyed it. I really liked this movie, but I have to say, next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear pretty lackluster. Brosnan melts into this character so well that it's really hard to remember that this is the same guy who played bond. He also shows his range and depth as an actor. It's kind of an indie film, and it was very nice to see, especially with all of the mainstream films that flood the movies this time of year. I found that the characters should be well thought out. Turn in the middle, I feel particularly good. I also liked how the characters come off realistic. How many times do we have in the film, these caricatures of people who do not really characters, but stick stereotypes ... I love the different approaches that the film takes. I think that somehow sideways, when I think about this movie, but I think it's more watchable and best film as a whole ...
