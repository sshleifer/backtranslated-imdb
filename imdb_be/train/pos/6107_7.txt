After I watched the movie ... I thought: "What the hell is this movie such a high success in the Korean Box Office" Even thought the film was a smart / unusal script, acting is not that good and the characters they were not very interesting. Korean movies ... I loved the action scenes. If you want to watch a movie without thinking that this is the movie for you. But I must admit ... the film was a kind of childish ... 6/10
