This film is an eye opener for those who can only glamorous lifestyles of the stars. It tells you how people who wanted to do good not. Plus bombing scene is very real. <br /> <br /> The fact that you have read and learned just does not happen !!! <br /> <br /> It can raise blood pressure by 10% <br /> <br /> All the actors very well have played a role. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes may / could have been avoided, to include adolescents. <br /> <br /> This film is quite adult in nature. <, Br /> <br /> Do not film that you can see with your family. <br /> <br /> Casting great !!!
