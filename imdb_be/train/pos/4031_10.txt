I have been fans of Hindi cinema with the 4-year-olds, but never in my life have seen such movement and affect the cinema, especially in the film in Hindi. In the past few years, I stopped to watch contemporary films in Hindi and returned to watching the classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.) But this film has changed everything. This is one of the best films I've ever seen. I found it not only to move, but found it to be very informative for someone who is the first Indian generation is growing in America. It helped me to understand my own family history, which has always been something very abstract to me. But in order to "see" it, feel it and understand that it has helped me empathize generations before me and the struggle that the Indian people have endured. The film helped put many things into perspective for me, especially in light of current world events. I never thought that a film could change the way I think like this before ... it's done. The plot is fantastic, wonderful acting and direction perfectly. Two thumbs up!
