I watched this movie on Friday, April 7. I have not seen the last scene (because I was talking to my bro n Mother-in-law, at the same time). Anyone can tell me what's wrong with her? I watched a little bit, that her husband could hear someone talking to his wife in the bedroom, and then he opened the door, she was already dead. <br /> <br /> What happened to her? She committed suicide? How could she have to prepare everything, like phone calls, in that it is at home, when her husband was talking to this strange admirer? Can anybody explain to me, please. I'm so so interesting !! (After all, I read that she was suffering from a personality disorder Multiply). <br /> <br /> Thnks before.
