Sensitive film does not have enough brightness and, to some extent, the narrative structure, but nevertheless perfectly lifted and carried. However narrative structure point is controversial. Although it gives the impression of tying of loose ends nicely in the final scenes, and relates his thoughts with what can be described by a contemporary audience as "history", I was skeptical to * Whether this feeling * need for a "narrative structure", which It is true and detectable. Inevitably, it will be compared to tumble in the center of the main character (I'm not sure that's the right word!) Appears young and very young-looking woman who has recently discovered sexuality as confused and gives her - though, of course, the film Cate Shortland in addressing this aspect better. But while it is possible to reject the unwary viewers this film like a clich√©, peaches, in a sense, it is much more ambitious than the somersault. Maybe where it's not quite do it. This, of course, very different from the first function in Monaghan - INTERVIEW! I'm not quite sure how sex scenes between weaving and Lung added to the story. Who knows - maybe they did. Of course, they rammed home is compromised and to the character flaws in weaving. - although I personally believe that this has been achieved without the need for these scenes <br /> <br /> ***** ONCE AGAIN I saw the movie ***** **** <br /> <br /> on the second viewing, I can see how some would dismiss it as telemovie dressed as a feature. But I'm not sure how these different "categories" are more, or even if we should make this distinction. In any case, I think that there is a sufficient number of layers in the film, to distinguish it from the Hallmark effort. On the other hand, the structure of the film is very formal and its contents almost not difficult, at least in how somersault, TOM WHITE, three dollars illustrated family doctor LOOK Both Ways and human contact. Performances are good, but I have come to the conclusion that the main reason I enjoyed the film because he is coming to "Australian" genre without necessarily adding anything ... and I can understand that it may be a pretty good reason for the other person is * not * like it! In fact, it was not until the Lung is not included in the room from her Vietnamese dress, that the film really starts to pack a punch. But this leads us into another debate - * should * we expect that the film should challenge us all the time? Of course, I like to be challenged by the film (or the books, or others), but there is no room for the fact that it's just a good story? <br /> <br /> I did not deleted my original post on this film, because I'm too aware of Orwell overtones of such an act. But I would lower my initial rating of 8 to may, 6,5 <br /> <br /> As for the AFI nominations for Best Picture, my vote goes to the human TOUCH, three dollars and look both ways. - and I think that the LOOK Both Ways to win.
