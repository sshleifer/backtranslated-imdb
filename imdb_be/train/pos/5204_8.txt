I do not watch a lot of porn, but I like a porn star. And I love the bloody movies. So when I heard about the porn star movie gore, I was very pleased. Of course, it was many years ago, and when I heard about all the problems with creating and finishing the film, I never thought I would actually get to see it. But I'm not ashamed to admit, I liked it, even with all its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the shortcomings. The story is set in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the history of it, seemed to want to say about Bean Clan Scot from Scotland. So why not just set it there, and to pass the third grade report of of Samhain / Irish immigrants / Halloween? In addition, it violates its own rules, that you are safe on the slopes, but then cannibalistic mutants just start running amok everywhere. It's never clear how many cannibals, we are dealing with. There is a large stone castle, which is obviously old, but no one noticed it before. Links horror movie self-conscious and therefore annoying characters. The heroine has a flashback montage of all their dead friends, which include character, she has never met. The ending does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> So what works? Blood! Of course, I would like to have more, but it was nice to see such an unpleasant film that was not afraid of nothing more gore film. Two murders are waay over the top and Taylor Hayes has a nice disgusting scene. Two wild murder even given extended footage on DVD. I was always in mind that the blood can overcome stupid story and Evil Breed reinforced that.
