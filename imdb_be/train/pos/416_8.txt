Plainsman is entertaining Western, without a doubt, this is a classic that is still relevant today. Gary Cooper, Wild Bill Hickok, is perfect for this role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart, they were the best actors who have played Western heroes of its kind. Jean Arthur as big as Calamity Jane, no one that I know has played it better than she. Even if it can not be historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important thing about Hickok and about the time that happens. Sometimes you have to sacrifice the story to make your point, and that's what makes it here DeMille. Friendship Hickok Buffalo Bill, selling guns to the Indians a large manufacturer to compensate for the loss, it will be due to the end of the Civil War, Custer and the Little Big Horn, an uneasy relationship between the wife of Buffalo Bill, religious woman, with Hickok man who killed many as well as an unusual love affair between Hickok and Disasters all this makes «The Plainsman» rather than the usual and interesting film. Anthony Quinn is a very short view, that already shows that a great actor, he was going to become. A lot of trouble has been taken to show the original device at that time.
