I'll be honest with you ... I liked this movie. This is a great zombie movie that is packed with action, original ideas, good actions, but also packed with bad zombie effects. Part IV, entitled "After Death" is also good. I would recommend this horror film fans around the world. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> A supporter of horror movies as it should check the puppeteer, skinned alive, bachelorette party Massacre, sleep away camps, and other Full Moon Pictures clicks.
