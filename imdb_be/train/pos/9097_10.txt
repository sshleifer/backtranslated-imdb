I made this film such a high mark, because it was very nice, very funny, all at the same time unpretentious. I went to see this movie, when he played in the Philadelphia area, and it was a central great evening with friends. The film is well written and well acted, and although it feels a bit like a comedy, and then a movie that does not take from the film. You just do not find comedies like this anymore, where you do not have to shock people, to be funny. The film is centered around the Ukrainian economy, which finds himself working for a young couple who are in need of assistance. Although initially it helps, it soon adds madness in your life, it's time stated. Things get further and further away from the monitor to .... you have to see! Banter me laugh, even after leaving the theater. This film just put me in a good mood. I can not wait until it comes out on DVD, because I want this movie to my collection.
