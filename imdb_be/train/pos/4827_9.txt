And that is why the historical / biographical films are very important for all of us, in addition, if they are so well done as this one! <br /> <br /> Before I saw "The Young Victoria," I knew something about Queen Victoria, but in the end I got a lot more knowledge about this. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt just great as Victoria (Who would have guessed that!), and she is likely to receive a nomination for an Oscar this year. Personally, I'm rooting for her ... <br /> <br /> For technical questions, I am happy to say that it was very successful, with a beautiful Art Direction / Set decoration and, of course, as it was expected, stunning periodic costumes! <br /> <br /> One drawback is that I want to see more and learn more about this exciting Queen, but above all, an incredible woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
