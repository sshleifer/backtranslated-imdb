This show is amazing. I thought that these two episodes, when he died, Paul is so upset I actually cried. But other shows were strange; Kerry was my favorite character, because she was in the "dark side." I also thought that Bridget was funny because she's perky. I also thought that the guy who played Kyle was very, very nice. I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute, and Paul, played by John Ritter, it was really funny. All this is all funny TV show, and I want them to still shown on TV. when they show on TV, but I watched it every time it was on. The next time it shows, I'll watch it again and again.
