The first explanation of what makes a great film for me. Excitement, not knowing what will happen to make me enjoy the movie for the first time I watch it (the case of own point: Twister). There are other things that go into a great first view, such as a good sense of humor (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), a good site with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), figurative narrative (all George episodes of Star Wars Lucas MAN ), and good music (again, all the episodes of Star Wars, the Wizard of Oz, the Sound of music). Which leads me to watch a movie, at least six times in the theater and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Symbols. With that said, I represent Cindy Lou Who and the Grinch. Excellent performance of Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, especially Jeffrey Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But every scene with Cindy and Grinch-together perfectly and very funny and / or heartwarming. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this film, and the most compelling reason why the film is best animated film. Grinch has a strong storyline, good conflict, and a very good topic (I can not start, because I do not want to spoil). Jim Carrey was very funny as the Grinch, especially when he interacted with Cindy. And the music! Wow! Great music by James Horner. I loved his tools and composition choices. Very good job Jim Carrey, I do not know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Wow! Your voice is reason enough to watch a movie at least once. Your Solo - Where Are You Christmas - Your voice just as high as it sounds? It sounds like F #? This indecent range for 7 year (Obscene meant in the best possible way). Excellent work. This is the best performance of a child I have ever heard in the film (Taylor beat out the Von Trapp children is no small feat!). And now the actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny, and surprisingly very sensitive (it really stood out in his scenes with Taylor Momsen). unspoken expression of Taylor Momsen (one of the secrets to a good performance of the action) is very strong, it really becomes Cindy Lou Who. And when it does it is a dialogue even more <br /> <br /> ****************************** danger .: Spoiler *************************** ********************* alert * ******************************************* <br /> <br / > Examples: An expression when she first sees the Grinch. This is a classic quote ( "you", and then poured line Grinch Â«yes yes Grinch-, after which it is tilted in the sorter, and then saved Greench). The "Thank you for saving me," the citation and the subsequent reaction of the Grinch was also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie, when Cindy invites the Grinch to be a holiday Cheermeister. This scene two great actors at their best and expressing interact with each other. Little Taylor Momsen completely holds her own with Jim Carrey in this place. I sincerely hope that we can see Taylor Momsen in many other films in the future. in general, everything was perfect about this movie (except, perhaps, legs and noses)
