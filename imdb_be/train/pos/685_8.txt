Ghost Story (New House) terrific horror story. It's the circle of fear and the history of the series Ghost seventies.The early start and the end of each story tells Sebastian Cabot. Remember that it is the beginning of a series of family, Family Affair in the 1960s? This story is Barbara Parkins and David Birney as leading actors, and, as the main characters in story.I saw it recently, and I was so scared! When you're alone, I would not recommend watching this.This story is terrific, either Gore or curse words, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played a young bride. David Birney played it husband.Both actors were very good in both scary fun of parts.If you horror stories about ghosts, then you'll love this little gem. I have given this high rating.I highly recommend this story.
