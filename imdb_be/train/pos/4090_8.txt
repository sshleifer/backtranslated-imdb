This film is simply incredible! I was expecting something completely different, form a film that I actually saw. However, it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its relationship to the behavior of animals. Let me warn those who are among the readers of this article that are easily offended by content that is too sexy for explicit sexual content of the film feels like a kind of highbrow pornography. It even shows a scene that comes very close to rape. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I strongly recommend to see this rare work "Sexual art". Every minute of the picture breathes the spirit of the seventies sexual way. Do not forget, how times have changed! <br /> <br /> Go it! Winked worth your money and time!
