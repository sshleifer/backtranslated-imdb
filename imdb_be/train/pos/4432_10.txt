I am happy to admit that I'm a sucker for a great movie, and quite creative camera movements and angles may be enough to keep my interest in the film is quite long. Not one GoJoe length, though, despite the fact that in some of the finest cinema I've seen with the Korean side MUSA period. Nevertheless, GoJoe provides much more than just pretty pictures (both MUSA ... nya which implies a contrast) - this is the second big force perfectly actions, and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy. I must admit that not knowing that the point she was trying to do, in the end, but it certainly raises some thoughts on the way. Those vague, but definitely thought: p <br /> <br /> One department that the film could have been better is the effect. There's a huge amount of blood-letting in the film, but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close-up, and often obscured by objects in the foreground. It does create some very intense and impressive visuals, but it would be nice to see some more concrete steps, something to make it more likely that the thieves could only wade through an entire army of devastation all. <br /> <br /> However, the film is certainly one of the most interesting and most beautiful films I've seen for quite some time. Recommended!
