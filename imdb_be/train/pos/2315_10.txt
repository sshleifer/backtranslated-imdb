There is so much worth in this movie, it's hard to know where to start with praise. Allow me to express my admiration for the perfect way Reese Witherspoon. It is her performance stands out excellent cast is praise. Robert Mulligan rarely disappointed those of us who admired his work. Each frame Man on the Moon shows filming at its best.
