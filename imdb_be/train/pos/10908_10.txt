I could not hold back the tears when I saw this beautiful documentary. It was heartbreaking, disturbing, and inspiring all in one. I recommend this film to anyone who wants something that will make them think about what they do with their own lives. Or just something that will make you think. You look like John lives over the last few months of his life. You see, as he goes through his day with a positive attitude. At some point, you start to see what it's really strange individual. You begin to realize that it has something to teach us all. His life and the struggle will make you cry, laugh, and think that life is much easier to live, if you just take one day at a time.
