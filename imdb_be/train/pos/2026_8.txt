I first saw this mini-series a few years ago on British television and was immediately fascinated by the history. It is rather surprised me, since I'm not a big fan of either "Jane Eyre" and "Wuthering Heights"; I think the former heroine be complacent boring, and the last part of the work, as the inflated nonsense. <br /> <br /> «resident Wildfell Hall», the aforementioned work, as several disappointing in part. However, the darker parts of the film were offset by the excitement shoots Elena, stunningly wild and beautiful landscape of Yorkshire, and sexual magnetism Toby Stephens. <br /> <br /> In this film successfully reflects depressingly restrictive lifestyle, all women of that time. At best, they suffer from low internal form of tyranny, as the treatment of women is drawn in Markham family. At the other end of the scale, there is an unfortunate Helen, who is married to a wealthy man of high position, but it is subject to violence and humiliation alternate with long periods of oblivion. She escapes and is going through a brief moment of freedom, but as a single woman of secrets in a rural community, it inevitably becomes the subject of malicious gossip and speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald fine as long -suffering Helen Markham. Not only incredibly beautiful (although it is very bad hair) with the strange cheekbones, it is also more than capable of playing a central role in the film. Tara dignified and aloof, and at the same time, allowing us to see that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable. Rupert Graves vicious, but surprisingly attractive Arthur Huntingdon - after meeting him, I could never imagine another actor playing this role. Pam Ferris deserves special mention for its role as an indulgent mother of Gilbert, as well as the actress who played his sister Rose, and Simon Carter, who is mercilessly vicar tasteful good things in life. Finally, I could see this movie just for Toby Stephens; He is so good, strong, sexy, sensual (but not sickeningly sentimental way). I'm not even sure if he's a good actor, like my hormones let me judge it objectively! <br /> <br /> If there is an error with the film, the use of flashbacks, which I felt interfered with the flow of the story and made it a little confusing. Other people who saw the film with me, too, had problems with it, and I found that I had to explain to them that some of the scenes were in fact a retrospective. <br /> <br /> I am very grateful for the people responsible for the creation of this film. Not only do I puchase video (rare), but it led me to buy a beautiful novel Anne Bronte. Of course, it was better than the movie, but only by a narrow margin. I recommend to anyone who is interested should watch the movie and then read the book, in that order. <br /> <br />
