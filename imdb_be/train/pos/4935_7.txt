In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves the game of poker while winning smalltime criminal Black (Walter Jack Palance). He persecuted black and his men, Fitch Raymond (Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by black and his body thrown into the sea. During the autopsy, the family man, Lieutenant Dr. Clinton Reed (Widmark) US Public Health Service said that the deceased was pneumonic plague caused by rats, and he needs to find out who had any type of contact with the man for forty -eight hours to avoid epidemic. The mayor appoints a skeptical Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), to help Dr. Clint to find the killers, who are infected with the plague, and to plant them. <br /> <br /> Â«Panic in the streets," reveals a simple story, but it is still effective, and with a great villain. Attractive plot does not become obsolete after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance performing contempt scale in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape from Mostel is still very impressive. My vote is seven <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :.
