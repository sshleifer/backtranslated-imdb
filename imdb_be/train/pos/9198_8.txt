B Movie? Yes. DIY? Yes. The first film? Yes. But Aestheically A +. This film definitely had some bad sound / editing / lighting / current / etc .. etc. problems. However, this film has a lot of positive things about it. Firstly, the most annoying character dies first! Secondly, it made a parody / B Rated funny horror film. Comments killer makes his victims had left me and my friends rolling on the floor laughing. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people try to take every independent film, and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it for what it is, a bunch of kids right out of high school made his first film. For what it is, just that it's really good.
