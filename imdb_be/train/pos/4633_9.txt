Here is another in a series of remarkable beauty director Eytan Fox films. The film is the story of lovers of Accidents (one Israeli, one Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The effectiveness of the film comes not only from its image of cross-ethnic conflicts, but conflicts within the personal and political ethnic groups. For example, there is a clear moment when one of the supporting characters, openly gay, is visited in the hospital with his friend, who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his family visit, and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room. It is obvious that the young man is not as open as it seems, and the family does not like to take as he might want them to be, while the man is confused and discarded. A good deal of complexity is packaged in a moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a master of efficient packaging emotional and psychological difficulties in a short sequence. The film is also effective for impartial, as it is reciprocal atrocities that cause Israelies and Palestinians alone. If you do not heartless, you'll cry until the last third of the film. Although the plot melodramatic, it is reasonable written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be.
