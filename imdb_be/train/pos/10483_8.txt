Yes, this movie is predictable and certainly not awarded the material. But then he is not trying to be something it is not. Fun filled romp with real funny jokes, star and very funny performances by Peter O'Toole, grounded and down to earth performance by Joan Plowright. the band was in place, each of which plays a role in agile comic image. Music was good, though not great, but fills the film nicely. With some of the negative comments I have concluded that the subtlety of the humor went over their heads. A good example is the comment about "strange baseball as a game," and my dear American who was cricket which -iza baseball derived- and explain his ignorant US group was very funny for those who really know, cricket, In addition, nO, you do not have to wince when Charles broke a window; It was interesting how the Lord Foxley said: "Oh yes!" to get more money for the damage, and the manager said at the same time, "Oh no," also referring to money. Jeez, it seems that every joke has to be caused by some people ... All-in-all, I enjoyed it and had some great laughs! Well worth a look.
