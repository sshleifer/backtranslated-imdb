Possibility Spoiler - In a certain sense, "How to dispose of each ...." is a "loser learns to adjust, it is successful and finds that something else works" type stories, situated in the celebrity business. - END SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not know the original book, but it provides some good comedy moments.
