<br /> <br /> I believe that this is not the best movie ever made, but I voted for it 10 stars yet. Mainly because of my feelings at the end. I and all the people around me were just touched. This is something you do not often feel. We all get a little cynical and tired of sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in contemporary films. The film's story centers around a young woman Jane in the latter stages of the bass and the friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man on the verge of collapse. It could so easily have been dull and worthy piece, but it is so humorous, humane and lacks sentimentality, she captivates completely and no matter what it is feeling good movie. <br /> <br /> Acting by Branagh and Bonham-Carter lovely especially the latter, which is always true and strong in their roles. The chemistry between the two also raises the film. <br /> <br /> The name comes from Richards masterpiece aircraft with trash and old paintings. Flying here is a symbol of how Jane Richards and live a full life, to be able to continue and others may face the end. <br /> <br /> beautiful and funny movie that I would recommend to anyone. do not let the subject put you off.
