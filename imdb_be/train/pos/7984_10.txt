Man on Fire, this is definitely one of the best thrillers, drama / crime I've ever seen. Despite a slow start to the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it adheres quite well. This is an ideal role of Denzel Washington, in which he plays a bodyguard called crisis, tormented by his past and an alcoholic, but never gives it a duty to save his latest protégé, Pete. Dakota Fanning plays Pete, very intelligent, enthusiastic crowd of a little girl who loves so many things, and operates in a very convincing way, she has a great future ahead of her. As I said, the story is quite complicated to fully understand it, you have to watch it a few times. <br /> <br /> The film is in two parts, is the first hour where everyone is happy, nothing happened, everything just live their lives happily kidnapping Pete does not occur and where Creasy almost killed. And then there's the second part, the rest of the film, where suddenly everything becomes difficult and several disgusting and disturbing when the crisis recovered from his serious injury and begins to stalk and kill many criminals and «La Hermamdad», who were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping Pita . <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us his latest acting talent along with many other talented actors who have a great future ahead. It's a real shame that this film was not recognized enough, Washington really deserves another Oscar for his work, as well as Fanning and director. And even, perhaps, the visual effects, which were of very high quality. <br /> <br /> If you are a great, a little unbalanced, tense thrillers, this is one to see. The most amazing thing is that the elements of this film is actually based on a true story and real characters! 10/10
