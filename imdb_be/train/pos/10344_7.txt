Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondel roles in Â«The Amazing Mr. Williams' 1939 mystery / comedy, which is pretty good, although forgot, probably due to the incredible number of films released in 1939. <br /> <br /> Douglas plays a talented police detective married to his work, and his girlfriend is waiting for the wedding, which is constantly delayed. What happens in this film is no exception. - it is called at the murder scene just as he was going to walk down the aisle again <br /> <br /> Both stars were perfectly in a comedy together worked well (and often), and help to make this a fun battle of the sexes. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride on hand for the great support. <br /> <br /> As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas does not make a lot of women. <br /> <br /> entertaining if a little on the long side. <br /> <br /> One of the comments here defeated Melvin Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally sailed effortlessly through dozens of films, the other person, and the best one, before coming into his own in the film, as the old. He was not lazy, but rather a very hardworking actor (who made it look easy), who had a career on Broadway at the same time with his film career. He just was not cast as a leading man in the movies or gave a very complex role within the studio system. I challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in "Hud" and "I never sang for my father," and called him lazy or make reference to him smirk.
