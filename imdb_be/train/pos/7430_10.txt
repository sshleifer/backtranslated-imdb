Personnaly I loved this movie, and this is especially touched me. The two main actors give us such great performances, which in the end is really heart breaking to know that finally happened to their characters. <br /> <br /> In alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson amazing, and the song just fine as they are. <br /> <br /> That is why I am not surprised when I learned that won five Golden Globe (the most awarded film at the Golden Globes), Oscar and even a Grammy. This film is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. Great movie, which has often been criticized (perhaps because Streisand decided to participate in it, of course, as a "co-director"). Her artistry is the biggest, and it is sure to please you!
