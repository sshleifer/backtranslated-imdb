I saw the movie recently and really enjoyed it. I was surprised, and wept. This film is in the same niche genre, as "far from it" - or even "Bucket List", but treats the whole topic of aging with incredible accuracy. It is really very difficult to have the main character, as unpleasant as Agar. The director does a masterful job with this task. Agar is difficult to understand. Her world has hard edges, and it does not warm endearing women in general. <br /> <br /> The first scene gets it through without any compromise. Agar (Ellen Burnstyn) driven in a nursing home, her son and daughter. It appears his route and the frills. Its edges are very difficult. She's mean. She prejudice and selfish. It is a stone. I do not love her - not even a little bit <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we get the idea .. We'll find out why she does not like petunias, why she prefers one son over the other as its losses have shaped her character ... I started to see an angel ... and I started to love it. I especially liked when she poured her secrets to the boy in the hut. Helen Burnstyn, you are a great actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene! <br /> <br /> This is not a "feel good" movie, but it's certainly a film that brings the viewer empathy. I understand more clearly that the hard edge in human life are there to protect, they are there for a reason ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother - she was not even my mother-in-law or neighbor, but ... part of it is present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts, somehow more sense to me now, when I looked Stone Angel.
