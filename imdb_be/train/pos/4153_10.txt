it was a fantastic episode. I saw a video of it on YouTube, and I promised that if she ever shown on TV, I would glue themselves to the set in order to watch. I wound up watching it with my friend, who is gay, and the two of us were crying at the end. it was really well written, heartfelt episode of forbidden love between two cops, who, I felt, were really (in the words of COOP) "lucky." it is episodes like this that really make Cold Case is one of the most charming and well loved works of television magic on CBS. I'm anxiously waiting for more episodes, and re-run with the «Forever Blue», because I will always watch it again and again.
