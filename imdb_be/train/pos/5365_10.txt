Running Man is often dismissed as just another fighter Arnie full blast, bad puns and guns, and to be fair, there is a lot of that in it. People are used to looking at it, and compare it to the Terminator series, saying that it was one of the poorest Schwarzenegger movies. <br /> <br /> But, to give him 18 years, and you find yourself in a position to evaluate it in a different light. Instead of just being another brainless action movie, it works very well as a parody of the reality show. This is very different from the Stephen King book, true, but I doubt that Hollywood, with his love of upbeat endings and so-called "ordinary guy" who turned out to have the skills of a qualified commandos, would take it in its current form. <br /> <br /> But, with a tour. <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop working in the dark of the United States, where democracy is a thing of the past, and the country was ruled by a conglomerate of enlarging the government / media. The economy is in tatters, the food is not enough, and the government keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to see how jumping into dollars, where people jump for the money over a pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular is The Running Man, Gameshow organized slimy Damian Killian (Richard Dawson plays a fascinating), where "criminals" supposedly haunted theater, on-selecting-squire "stalkers". <br /> <br /> Some, however, try and speak out against the government. If a group of hungry people hold a protest in the city of Bakersfield, California, the helicopter piloted by Richards goes "good" (ie kill) the protest. If Richards refuses to shoot at innocent people, he was arrested and charged with the murder of people in the crowd. He was sentenced to slave labor camps, but escapes with the help of the resistance leader (Jafet Kotto) and goes on the run. <br /> <br /> However, his freedom does not last long, and after he kidnaps a network Fellow Amber Mendez (Marit Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to avoid those who pursue it, he finds himself a prisoner again but this time he was forced to appear in the running. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the whole movie kicks in standard mode, Arnie. Richards launched into a post-apocalyptic wasteland in Los Angeles (why LA is always destroyed in these worlds gloomy?) And forced to flee the "Stalker", along with two other inmates who escaped from the labor camp with him. Amber gets interesting Richards protests of innocence, and finds out that he was framed. Guess what happens to her, then? So, as amber, Richards and two other guys running around, trying to avoid stalkers, we soon became aware that Richards is not an ordinary policeman. He is super Arnie in unkillable one man army that can destroy evil corporate dictatorship and fight obesity people covered in Christmas lights all at the same time, just your average American guy with an Austrian accent. <br /> <br /> So, for the rest of the movie numb, loud, classic 80-Arnie fun. There are many interesting fight sequences trademark dreadful puns ( "He should have been broken down," my favorite), and the total final stereotyped opposition and a happy ending. It is very fun to watch Killian respond to a typical "heartyÂ» Gameshow host the way, as well, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolves around the contrast between his interaction with the crowd as seemingly benevolent owner (watch out for abuse of the old woman!) And cold, cyncial person he really is, who will do anything to improve the rating. <br /> <br /> If you expect a high forehead, intelligent film, you will be disappointed. But if you want a great 80s movie, well, this is it. But the great thing about this film, it was pretty prophetic <br /> <br /> If you look at the fun we are today, you notice the way the reality show is happening in our time. - a show featuring people who want to put himself than at any time during the five minutes of fame, and manufacturers are too willing to allow them to humiliate themselves on TV. It's not too far a leap to imagine that some lousy TV Exec there trying to get the right people show will be carried live on television. We already had that, nevertheless, with a disgusting al-Qaeda hostage beheading video posted on the Internet. It seems that in the current environment, at least some people are fine with watching the real death on their TV sets. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, and in conjunction with the fact that these days seems to be a revival of the '80s, you have to be impressed with the far-sightedness of this film. Of course, we have not reached there yet, as the terrorists, not the media, who bought us a readily available programs that show a man a real death, but you just have to wonder how long before some Exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching the show, which combines the people's desire for fun and the desire to follow their morbid curiosity ...
