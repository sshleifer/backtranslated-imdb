Fay Grim is a true example of what I call the completed puzzle film. It has all of the action, the direction of the storyline, and entertainment. They all fit together, and when done to create a masterpiece, Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> This film is behind the single mother Fay Grim is trying to raise her son not to grow to be her father, who ran away from the law and has been missing. Soon Fay CIA contacts in a desperate quest to find her husband Henry 8 magazines. These magazines were filled with declarations of his distant past in the CIA and its participating countries and their public affairs. Faye goes to find these magazines, in turn, to release his brother from prison and sent to the cat and mouse chase across Europe to restore these logs and discover the hidden secrets of her husband in the past she never knew about. <br /> <br /> Posey already was an actress, I loved it when I looked at her, he in Ohio and Best in Show. She brought liveliness of these two comedic roles in it, but Fay Grim was a far different role than in the other two films. Posey made me believe in what was happening on the screen, I felt for her, I was rooting for her, and I would like to know more. It grabs you while she is on the screen, and when it is turned off, you can not stop thinking about what was happening to her. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other previous works of the author / director Hal Hartley, but I guess I'll look at the view of some of his earlier films when they are half as good as Fay Grim was. <br /> <br /> If you decide to make a reasonable choice next time you decide to rent a movie cinema or your DVD-I urge you to choose Fay Grim. If you have any common sense, the film should be, you'll enjoy this movie very much.
