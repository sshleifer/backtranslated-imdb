This film contains one ingredient that all revenge films should have, and this is the true emotion. Sadness, love, laughter, anger. There are so many emotions, abandoned in this film. From beginning to end, this film is very exciting. The plot on paper sounds like the usual rubbish that basically thrown in the faces of the audience, but do not be mistaken, this film is powerful. Washington, as always puts on a great performance <br /> <br /> The plot in a nutshell :. Man suffers from depression, a young girl brings into his life, children are kidnapped, people want revenge. It does not look like anything special, but it's much better than any other similar film there. For instant, adopted a similar film, but if you compare them both, MAN ON FIRE wins hands down. Characters interesting and everyone puts in a great performance and great direction. Mexico feels alive, it looks like Mexico City, Mexico smells. All brilliantly drawn. style of direction was that I enjoyed and brought the best out of Mexico <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies you return once a year to see the movie again, or that you will ask your something 'and and friends to watch. From start to finish you are introducing to the main character, making it a roller coaster journey. There's enough action to keep you happy, there is the development of character enough to please you, and then there's the Washington to bring a smile on your face. Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed
