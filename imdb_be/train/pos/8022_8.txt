Muppets Jim Henson have been my favorite since childhood. This film makes me feel like a kid again. Well, that returned Muppets Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and friends. A prerequisite is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but in New York. You will see cameos then-New York Mayor Ed Koch. In any case, the film turns 25 this year and I hope that today's children learn to appreciate carelessness in Muppets Gang. The problem with the show Kerman disappears and the gang must find it in New York. It's worth looking at the children and even adults sentimental as I am.
