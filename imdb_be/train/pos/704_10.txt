This film is as low budget as it may be, this is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you agree that this is a low budget from the beginning, you can evaluate how well the story it is, as a very well-written script, and how great a director had to make something so beautiful with so little money. <, Br /> <br /> All the elements of a great film here. Visually, though shot on digital, they were great places. Surprisingly, dreamy feeling of the film is particularly well reflected in a scene from the talking dog, the scene was simply astonishing. It's such a trippy piece of work, but it is not done in a pretentious manner, and because of the fact that I have a whole lot of respect for this film. This is highly recommended for those who are looking for something unique and exciting, and a great many repetitive films that are out there.
