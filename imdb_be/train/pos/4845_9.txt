Welcome Playmates.I recently watched this movie for the first time ever, and this is also my first experience of Arthur Askey, I must admit that I was very impressed with this film. As a supporter of black-and-white films, in general, Pimlico passport, lavender hill mob and Tommy Trinder (which seems to be a distant relative), the film appealed to the fact that it provides a good old-fashioned British humor. I noticed that some here who criticized the work of Asuka, but in my opinion, stands the test of time as a fine example of the forties comic action, and if something adds to the image, creating characters that are more than just a stereotype, it seems so dominant now.If movies you can get this film I would recommend you get it, these movies shame does not appear in the Sunday afternoon anymore.I also happy to have had the opportunity to observe another part of the work of Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in his father's army) .I thanks
