Many American people would say ... What ??? in his opening comments. Yes, I know that my comparison is no doubt an insult to the fans of the master Akira Kurosawa, but if we analyze this film, my comment right. We have a farmer who goes to the city in search of aid against the horses group who wants to steal the harvest of the village. The big difference lies in the fact that the story takes. Our samurai, a group of circus performers, as the original is a very complex mixture of individuals, but in the end what the village needs a hero. Please look again this incredible film (Seven Samurai, obviously), and find other movies that stole the story and trying to get the same magical effect than the masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa. The tip is the 13th soldier with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied this story wrote his bestseller, but he did not find the cat a third leg.
