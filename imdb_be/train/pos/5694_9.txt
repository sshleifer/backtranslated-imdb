Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are terrific. I saw Kilmer on the door, but his interpretation of John Holmes is excellent. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights, which was kind of slow. Wonderland is a film that is able to show you the terrible history of crime from the perspective of a guy who just echoed in his grip of drugs and painless that ever happening. At the same time, the character of John Holmes shows very smart Hustler, who is able to go through the ugly and nasty situation almost healthy. The film deserves to have seen more than once. Seventies atmosphere of sensual and full of strange drugs.
