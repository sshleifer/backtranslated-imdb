Not having seen the film in the original version of the theater, I was pleasantly surprised when the DVD arrived, as this film does not have wide distribution it deserves. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington's directorial debut and finished product has nothing to envy the other films on the same subject from more experienced directors. The film has a very professional look. This shows that Mr. Washington learned a lot being on the other side of the camera. He brings another angle to this film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the film is, without a doubt, a wonderful performance by Derek Luke. He is an actor, who, with the right leadership, will go a long way, no doubt. It takes on a troubled young man, at this moment of his life, in the vanity and misery for poor hand life, so far, hit him, very precisely. His Antwone is a fine portrait of a man in pain, which is generally very good and has so much to give, but none seem to see the other side of his character. <br /> <br /> In the worst time of his despair, Antwone is sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, in a very sober, once won the way. Because of the fear in Antwone, he loses the ability to open themselves this man who wants to help, but because of the restrictions placed on his office just three sessions and then have to dismiss your patient. <br /> <br /> Things work because Antwone is able to convince the doctor to continue working with him. Antwone past is revealed in detail. The abuse he suffered at the hands of Mrs. Tate, his adoptive mother, tough, to say the least. Trying to hands of an elderly woman in the household Tate sexual molestation, Antwone gives a bitter taste that remains with him throughout his adult life, since he was injured shame, he carries with him. <br /> <br /> Antwone finally finds love with Cheryl, who is patient enough to make him see a different world, love it and support it gives him. <br /> <br /> The leading performances are very good. Denzel Washington Dr. Davenport also has its own problems. He was not happy holidaymaker anything. It can help Antwone, but he can not help himself, or his relationship with the love of his wife. <br /> <br /> The talent in the film is incredible. Joy Bryant makes a great Cheryl. Novella Nelson, who is an excellent actress beautiful Mrs. Tate, ridiculous foster mother. <br /> <br /> Reunion Antwone his unknown family too cloying and sentimental, but, of course, if one believes that Fisher finds happiness at last, it is necessary to recognize that part of the movie as well.
