Something about «Paulie» touched my heart how to make more films. This witty, funny yet emotional film. I'm late to the counter to become a supporter of the film. I've never seen «Paulie» until May 2004 and has since ordered a widescreen DVD by Seller on eBay. <br /> <br /> special effects featuring Paulie to speak perfectly. My son asked me how she knew so much bird phrases.Probably my favorite part of the movie, when Paulie Gena Rowlands in the company (Ivy), and then Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Shalhoub (Misha) plays a prominent role as a good-hearted person. You root for him all the way through the film. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong for rent or purchase the movie !!
