Prix ​​de Beauté has been made on the threshold of the transition from silence to sound, which was released later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally planned as a silent, he was released from the soundtrack dubbed in France, with the French actress Louise Brooks says the line, but was released as a silent in Italy and other European countries. I was lucky enough to see the impeccable new restoration in the Cineteca di Bologna, the Italian silent printing at the Tribeca Film Festival. I did not see the radio version, but I think it's safe to assume the silent version is much more fun, as all reports rewriting poorly done (Louise Brooks clearly says in English, so there is no way her lips might be appropriate ). in addition, the film made entirely in a quiet style, with a small number of titles and little need for dialogue. Prix ​​de Beaute tells his story visually, with an exciting, imaginary camera-work. Opening instant kinetic, fast-cut scenes of urban life and swimmers splashing about on the public beach. Throughout the film there is an emphasis on visual details, clothing, car decoration and symbolic images, such as a bird in a cage, a pile of torn photographs, a diamond bracelet. This silent film techniques on top of it. <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks, of course, is responsible for the preservation of the unknown film. Seeing this makes it only more distressing to reflect that this was her last starring role. Brilliantly beautiful, it dominates the film with her charisma and gives a very natural, but highly charged performance. Its role is more than the Pabst films, for which it is best known is the woman that we can fully understand and sympathize. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a typist from a relatively groom who wants to get more out of life and secretly enters a beauty contest, with immediate success. Then she is torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for a man who insists that she give up or lose it. All characters are depicted with nuances. The groom is a pity, and not just a beast: he loves Lucien, but limited to a person who can not cope with her to have a life separate from him or to attract the attention of other men. Even the "other person" in the story is not just a bag of shit, we first take it, even though his intention may be as relative as. <br /> <br /> groom in ********** *************** NOTE: Spoilers below *********** ****** <br /> <br /> film is replete with fine set pieces, including Lucienne triumph in the contest "Miss Europe", shown through a comic reaction assorted members of the audience, which is wound up to throw the heroine with flowers; her suffering, as housewives, peeling potatoes, and the pendulum of the cuckoo clock marks time for it; nightmarish trip to the fun (in the silent version, it happens at the end of the film, after her marriage), where Lucien, crushed among the low and depressed lives macho antics of her husband, decides that she can not go to her present existence; and especially the final scene in the projection room, where she sees her test the radio screen. Louise Brooks never looked more beautiful than she does here, with a beam projector flickering on her alabaster profile, her shoulders wrapped in white fur, her face incandescent black hair under the helmet as she watches herself singing on the screen. Double shot her exquisite corpse and it still lives the image on the screen is particularly acute: the image of Louise Brooks as Lucienne years, is immortal, despite its depressing aborted film career.
