Sirko directs this drama acted more about the unfortunate wealthy. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are childhood friends with different views on life. Kyle philandering son of oil tycoon; Mitch works for the Hadley Oil Company. Both fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; but Kyle, who has the means to wow her off her feet and married her. Marylee sister (Dorothy Malone), seems to be a nymphomaniac city and carrying the torch Mitch, which always seems to be the one to clean the unrest in Hadley. Ambitious with the claim; little over the top, but the stars are doing this movie to see. Most of all I was struck by Malone. Rounding out the cast: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilk.
