I love and admire the Farrelly brothers! How can I only got to see this stunning film 3 years after its release? It made me laugh, it made me cry and reeeaally warmed my heart. Big Time. It is difficult to describe in my rotten English - but I have to try anyway: <br /> <br /> cast perfectly in everything - from lead to supporting roles, acting big, dialog boxes are great and the film entirely directed and edited <br /> <br /> I think that the Farrelly brothers films are often overlooked. - they do not light comedies - they deeeeeep! . They say that life is all about (I will not tell you!) <br /> <br /> In my case, this film was confirmed to me that the relationship is all about: <br /> <br /> If you love someone, set them free, let it be - try to share the passion and pain, and always be faithful to each other <br /> <br /> I'm not a sports hater, but definitely sporty ignorant. But in this film - you fluids. Smelled baseball atmosphere. Finally, the film told me that the future sports fan could mean for you and what a cool family fan should be there. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much, Bob and Pete! <br /> <br /> PS: If you have not seen it - please check the Kingpin!
