This film, the last ten years, has become one of my favorite experiences pseudo noir. Three story thread gave us Kazan have their own unique and individual pleasure. Domestic chatter between Bel Geddes and Widmark, movement between rooms, small gestures, such as a phone book Barbara place on a chair under her son so that he could get to the table, these little intimate contact between husband and wife, are all well developed and natural. Most of all I love their porch, the second living room, where it is clear that they spend most of their summer time. The second stream is a professional relationship between many in the film, but especially between the characters Widmark and Douglas. This may not be entirely original and does get a little windy, but overall, it comes across as real, respectful and effective. The third strand, the gritty story of Blake and his ragged little band, gets us closer to a dark and terrible Noir Black world.Palance is as cold as a block of ice. This self-proclaimed business man, the man himself is made, obviously, has a complexity we only briefly touch to. For me, this film continues to be completely satisfying experience.
