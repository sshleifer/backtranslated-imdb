If your idea of ​​a thriller car chases, explosions and dozens of people who are mowed down arrows, and then "House of Games" is definitely not a movie for you. If you love and appreciate the psychological drama and suspense, then, of course, see it. <br /> <br /> «House of Games" tells the story of a respected psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help the patient and is involved in the shadowy world of crooks, led by the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna). To say nothing about the plot to destroy the intrigue. Frankly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says that they have seen the twist is. Just as a clever crook, this film draws you into the Network and lull your vigilance. <br /> <br /> The story of longing and well-crafted dialogue clever and laconic acting is uniformly good (Mantegna's great charismatic). Some of them complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character, and wondered why Mamet Lindsay Crouse look as physically unattractive. But Dr. Ford must be cold and indifferent; In addition, its ordinariness, in a sense, necessary for the scene (at some point, I believe that the trauma of her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation ... I will not say no more). <br /> <br /> «House of Games," a dark look at the bottom side of human nature, which concludes on a note of ambiguity disappointing. It will keep your attention every moment while you are watching, and stay with you for a long time after that.
