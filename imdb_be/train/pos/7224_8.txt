If the trap was first released, poster - reproduced on the cover of a DVD - offered graphic akin to a Rubik's Cube. This is a convenient image: originally written for the stage Ira Levin, who is the author of such memorable works as Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives, the play was one of the most famous Broadway Twisters, and under the leadership of Sidney Lumet, he puts on the screen very well. <br /> <br /> rotten it is one of those films that is very difficult to discuss, so how to do it in any detail violates the very subject for which he is famous. But the discovery of the room is extremely reasonable: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) are well-known author of mysteries, but these days he seems to have lost touch. After a particularly tough premieres old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sent him the script for the play he wrote. This is called «Deathtrap» Sidney and recognizes it as a sure hit. Just kind of hit that would revitalize his career ... really beat to death. And if Clifford visits to discuss the game, events suddenly begin to turn in the most unexpected way. <br /> <br /> As with the equally tortuous detective Anthony Schaeffer, rotten story is really more at home on stage than on screen --to reach full power it must direct that offer live performance. However, under the able leadership of director Sidney Lumet, this makes it more than a respectable showing on the screen. Much of this is due to the cast, which is surprisingly good. Michael Caine gives a truly brilliant performance, Dyan Cannon funny and punished as relentlessly disturbing wife Sydney, and Christopher Reeve gives what may be the single best performance of it, unfortunately, short acting career. If you can not see it in a first-class theatrical performance, it will more than do until one comes. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, known GFT, Amazon Reviewer
