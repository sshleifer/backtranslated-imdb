I stopped giving "Mr. Blandings builds his Dream HouseÂ» 10/10 thanks aspect that makes us in the 21st century a little tremble: the fact that a black man faithful servant (somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit), but other than that, the movie is a hoot . Drawing of the middle class in New York a couple of Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) is trying to build a house in Connecticut, this film has something for everyone. <br /> <br /> The grant her usual frivolous self, while Loy does very well as a wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs, Jim and Muriel lawyer Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he makes clear. As for the house itself ... for most of the movie, you'll probably feel ambiguous whether you want to or not, to live there. Builders, contractors and others also provide a fair share of laughter. <br /> <br /> In general, a comedy classic. Also starring: Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Horses Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
