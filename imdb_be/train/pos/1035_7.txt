This film was nominated for Best Picture, but lost in Casablanca, but Paul Lukas to beat Humphrey Bogart for Best Actor. I do not understand why Lucille Watson was nominated for best supporting actor, I just do not think she has done a very good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas, and their three children left Mexico and came to the United States in the first scene of the film. They are going on a train to the Davis family home. Davis and Lucas was in hiding to stop a Nazi, so they are very tired and need rest. But when they come home, they live there is a Nazi, and not so much as can be done. It turns out that the Nazi cares only about money and is ready to make a deal with Lucas. They are more to the story, but you may find that for yourself.
