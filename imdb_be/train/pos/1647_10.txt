Excellent. Gritty and true image of the pioneer ranch life in the western plains, with an emphasis on the role and place of women. A moving film, made with love, and based on real people and their practical experience. Low budget, independent film; We never made any money. Definitely not romanticize unrealistic Hollywood version of the pioneer life.
