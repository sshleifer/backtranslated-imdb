This show is so incredibly fun, that I could not stop watching the marathon on Comedy Central this evening (despite the fact that I've seen all the episodes earlier). I have always believed Silverman as a great talent, and it is finally the car that talent to be accessible to a wide audience. I watch the show, and I laugh very large percentage of the time ... I can not say that about a lot of TV shows ... can you? This show is finally something new and interesting, and (most importantly) ridiculous! This show, which I will never get bored, and it's one I'm going to buy on DVD, as soon as it comes out. You owe it to yourself to watch this show ... I predict a long run for this series ... And just to be clear, that people who are offended by this show just does not get it ... maybe they do not enough intelligence to understand this ... they should stop making fools of themselves, attacking what they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "fanatic" with reference to Silverman, or who claims it only seeks to 'shock' to mark ... the path ... It is just the opposite; Just Google it and you'll quickly realize that it is a great champion of civil rights, etc. If you do not know what it is ironic covers all these glaring point of view, you do not get. And if you do not get it, do the rest of us the grace and be silent about it so that we can all enjoy the fun ...
