I believe that it is meant to be some sort of alteration or renovation "Beauty and the Beast," but I can not say I've ever watched the movie, which began with a few minutes of graphic sex horse. Wow. Anyway, it seems that the young woman and her..aunt? We visited the castle in France, where a woman should be married to the son of the owner of the castle, which is the person who takes care of making sure that the horses get their rocks off. It seems that there is a legend in the area of ​​the animal, which was quite, well, soon, I guess you could say, with the houses, or at least one, in particular. There are all kinds of links hidden in this regard, but each time, quickly to be kraeysya young bride gets her curious hands on one of the groom's father takes him out of his sight. In any case, the young bride be going upstairs to bed while the family waits for the Cardinal to show up to the wedding (a family member, I think), and how she dreams she dreams of an animal in the forest, which has its own way to her . The consequences of this leave much to be desired, and any attempt to erotica (not that I know much about that) is a kind of is ridiculous, especially when some of the featured processes are about as realistic as a bed or column of baseball bat. It is quite strange and unexpected, but the twist ending, with not so much build any clues to it, but it was kind of fitting and definitely not what I expected. I do not know, it's kinda hard to get through it, but it has its moments, and certainly strange. 7 10.
