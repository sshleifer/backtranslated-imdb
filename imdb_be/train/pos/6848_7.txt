Very stupid film, it begins with a sequence of soft porn, farcelike ventures into comedy in the Art Gallery, added with the opening of a shocker in the hotel room and then enters the accidental killing without any reason. <br /> <br /> less strange and surreal (stopwatch scene, in particular, exquisitely unnecessary), which led to the unmasking "twist" ending, which is as obvious as it is unfair to the audience (see things for really why it deliberately unfair). <, Br /> <br /> film goes out of its way to be offensive as many groups as possible - transsexuals, the mentally ill, and a great «Huggie Bear» -style racial stereotypes on the subway - and easy on the viewer like an idiot in the final scenes, the characters endlessly explain each one in detail, and again and again, what just happened in the movie. . While the characters background women in the restaurant scene in the end there is a joy to watch <br /> <br /> In fact, the entire film is a joy to watch: In spite of the many, many flaws, just the whole package, good work.
