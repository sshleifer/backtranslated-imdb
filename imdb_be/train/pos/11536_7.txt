It's hard to watch this movie without thinking ahead to the TV he would, especially if, like me, you happen to like the TV show more. But there is a lot to be said for the source. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Matthau) is one of the major New York sports, who lives in an eight-room apartment itself, the victim of a divorce and his own hard sloppy thinking. Enter his friend Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon), who needs a house after his wife kicked him for his hard neatnik thinking. As a result of a train accident, and one of the most beloved films adaptations Neil Simon plays the scene <br /> <br /> The first thing first :. I love this apartment! Poker table, novelty darts, oblique photography baseball, empty liquor and beer containers, even a couple of Roman columns. It is a place where people can be boys. Simon and directed by Gene Saks do a great job, opening the stage play by one set, living room Oscar, moving the action to the bedroom and the kitchen and giving Tension between Oscar and Felix more angles to bounce off. <br /> <br /> familiar cost Neal Hefti was heard on TV shows, but not as rapidly as it is done here in a number of different mechanisms that make the hover effect on the screen when it is played. Real place of work and night shots of Manhattan gives the film energy common to films made in this place and time ( «Buddwing», «The World Of Henry Orient", "Midnight Cowboy," "The Manchurian Candidate", "Rosemary's Baby" and Mr. .d.) <br /> <br /> and Lemmon and Matthau too heavy compared with Tony Randall and Klagmen? To be fair, the film is meant to be a more serious matter when dealing with the then unusual state of mid-life divorce and disappointment inherent in not being able to make the relationship work. Simon has more sense than putting Felix and Oscar in the game "password" or a battle of wits with Howard Cosell. But I do not know ... <br /> <br /> And Lemmon and Matthau were terrific comedians watching, especially in the middle of the film, as I have often in their individual films, but I never understood why they are regarded as excellent comedy team. Here, in their best valued partnership, they seem to operate in two different movies; Lemmon in a comedy-drama and farce Matthau. Matthau great in the beginning, charming us with his teddy bear manners at the table in poker, but closer to the end of the film he takes a turn as well as in Jack Torrance "Shining" responds to Felix cleaning his apartment and serving delicious food for her friends so that completely violates the fragile balance of guilt. <br /> <br /> while ending bother me, part of many consider the most dramatic, early, works fine, as I see it. Watching Felix stumbled trying to kill himself is not a big comedy, no, but it's a good way to get into a great comedy, setting us with some real pain, before you bring in the warmth and laughter. (Also, it has some great shots of the seedier parts of the city.) In the middle of the movie, this scene would have been a miscalculation, but it works as a way of establishing the suffering of Felix and a sense of relief to come, when we can see, Oscar and his poker friends quarrel and enmity. <br /> <br /> This is where Simon's lines are so great. They are the main film strength. He gets banter exactly correct and real, and still makes it funny. "I do not mind telling you, Felix. Do you have something to say. What scares me, I start to listen. "TV show demonstrated how wrong it is to assume that the film is always better at the" judging "reality TV show once made a good point about anything at all, but the film makes a solid foundation and joy in its own right,
