This film seems on the surface to be running the mill children's film that parents can watch with regret their mostly young children entertained. The film seems to be, and are mainly aimed at children, as long as it does not stop at this level. I watched this movie first, as a small child, and found it to be fun, entertaining and friendly and had not seen him for several years. I watched it again recently at the age of 18 years and found that it's almost as funny, but just as touching and interesting. This film is strongly undervalued and contains many reports of real life. This film is an inspirational story quests, which is made for kids yet epic in its own right. I recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
