This is one of those films that explore the culture clash of East natives in the pro-Western cultures. <br /> <br /> Love in Tokyo during a boring film about opposites inability to attract due to considerable cultural differences. Ken, rock-n-roll fanatic marries Kyoto, a Japanese girl, so that she can stay in the United States, upon expiry of her visa. Marriage is only expected to be temporary, that is, to Kyoto again acquires legal status. But, Ken, who seems to be lost in all respects, takes a liking to the Kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out. This, in spite of his friends, arguing that dumping Kyoto and getting rid of all obligations to the poor girls for a rock 'n' roll but cause some lyrics to write about broken hearts, and all that. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto comes from strict traditional Japanese upbringing, and not wait to be married to Ken all that long. Not only that, she was homesick and wanted to return to Japan. It's sad that it's finally someone Ken thinks that he can love and be with them, and all that, except for one time, he thinks that he has found someone to feel that way about the girl does not wait to stay so long. This does not mean that she does not like Ken, it's just that it is used for a "rugi lifestyle. She says: "I can not tell him what I feel in English, and Ken can not tell me how he feels in Japanese" It's pretty sad love story with a killer 80th nintendo techno soundtrack.. <br /> <br /> I took Loving on Tokyo time, because it reminded me of one of my favorite movies of the 80's, Tokyo Pop. And for those of you who enjoyed Loving on Tokyo time, check out the Tokyo Pop (New York singer travels to Japan and joined the Japanese American cover band), except that it is a movie with a happy ending. <br /> <br />
