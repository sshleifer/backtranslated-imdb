Sly best, and the film action. This superbly enjoyable film with some interesting characters, rigid projections and the direction of Rennes Harlins stylish guaranteed. Stallone is rarely interested in their fighters, and he certainly looks the part in terms of scenes. It was one of the best fighters of the year and one of the most exciting and enjoyable with the 90s, some classics of the genre. As a supporter of Stallone's one I look back on with fond memories. Many different actions and Sly in prime shape human action. Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the attributes that make a good film aciton. The film looks great and has a lot of support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
