Von Trier once explained how he created such a strong involvement from the viewer with his movies, putting it in the cinema of the world around the middle of the real world and the imaginary world. As the audience, we think we have seen the "real" story while we are actually carefully manipulated, often to such an extent that the film works hinder (Dancing in the dark) or ill (Idiot / Idioterne). Of course, Dogma movies acted only as a vehicle for this theory (besides creating some welcome attention to von Trier) <br /> <br /> The story is typical of von Trier :. Our hero is an idealist, seems to balance its relations with all the others, but it soon becomes a victim of the problems others created in the past for themselves. Idealist must inevitably abandon society to remain idealistic and becomes a terrorist. Mankind spoiled and purity leads only to a (self) destruction. (These elements were also very ubiquitous in Breaking waves and Dancer in the dark). The film is also full of cynical (even humorous) half a ton about the role of the Germans and Americans in postwar Germany. <br /> <br /> as the technological advances the film superbly designed: Shifting blurred and fading colors, screen overlays, effects on various overlays (when shooting in the near future to be the mayor, as the most interesting). In this film, we can see how good handle von Trier's film as a technical environment. In later works he seems to get away from it (as if it is no longer interested in technological advances, because they have become so readily available).
