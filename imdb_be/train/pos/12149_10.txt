I agree with another person here and I must say that this is one of the best films ever Kung Fu! I watched it as a kid, and absolutely loved it! Scaffolding magnificent scene, and you can really empathize with this guy because he is regarded as an outcast. Good humor and a fantastic kung fu this movie rocks! If you would like kung fu you would like it !!!
