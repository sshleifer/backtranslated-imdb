Now My minor quibble with the film I grew up knowing as a stairway to heaven, is the fact that the great Raymond Massey is given the last twenty minutes or so before the first stage. But the process itself, IMO, is the least interesting part of this exciting fantasy. <br /> <br /> David Niven and KIM HUNTER perfectly cast as the young lovers, but it ROGER Livesey, which gives lively and most reliable indicators, French accented MARIUS Goring pleasure (he even gets in a note of Technicolor) as a heavenly messenger, sent to bring back Niven when his wartime deaths are not reported due to an oversight. Goering has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with gusto. <br /> <br /> Seeing it today on the first time in twenty years or so, I think that it is the supreme example of what a great 1946 was for the film. Technicolor picture somewhat subdued and not flashy at all, excellent and as it moves done with great imagination and efficiency in B & W for heavenly sequences. <br /> <br /> opening scenes look that really draws the audience into the fantasy aspects of the story - and a tense conversation Niven radio operator Hunter while his plane crashing into the side of the ground, suddenly lead to a memorable romantic encounter. Really great movie from start to finish, another triumph for Michael Powell and Pressburger.
