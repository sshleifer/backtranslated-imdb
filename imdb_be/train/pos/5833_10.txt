I can not believe that people are looking for the story in this film. It Laural and Hardy. Lighting already. These two are a riot. Their comic genius as funny today as it was 70 years ago. Nha corrupt word out of the mouth either, and they were able to keep the audience in the trail. Their comedy was not difficult by any stretch. If whoopee cushion can not make you smile, there is no reason to look any material, these guys did. It was easier time, and people laugh at stuff that was ridiculous without a plot. I believe that it has a simple mind to enjoy this thing, so I claim. Two human comedy team does not calculate, we just too complicated ... Have not we taken?
