The first was a good and original. I was not a bad horror / comedy film. So I heard the second one was made, and I had to look. <br /> <br /> What really makes this film work is the character of Judd Nelson and sometimes clever script. Very good script for the person who wrote the Final Destination films, and the direction was right. Sometimes, there are scenes where it looks like it was shot with a home video camera with a grainy-eye. <br /> <br /> Great made-for-TV movie. It's worth the rent and, it may be worth buying just to get that awful feeling good and playing Stanley Judd Nelson doing what he does best. <br /> <br /> I suggest a beginner to look first before watching the sequel, just so you have an idea of ​​what Stanley is, and get a bit of background history.
