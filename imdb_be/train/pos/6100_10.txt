It's really funny (and sexy) film - it's not just stupid, but it has a lot of action. This is a film where the characters are so interesting that you feel like you're connected to everyone in the theater. I saw him at the festival cinema Boston, and I've found that often laugh with everyone else, as well as moving some of the more serious parts of the film. This is a unique film about two doctors, and I do not want to give anything away, but there are some powerful scenes, and actually funny - plus great dialogue. Wood Harris character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mia also funny and sexy in their roles. If you get a chance to see it - to go - you will not be disappointed. It is worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves a reward.
