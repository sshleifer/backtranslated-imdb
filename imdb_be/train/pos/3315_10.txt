Bette Midler demonstrating their talents and beauty in "Divo Las Vegas." I am very glad that I taped, and I can watch whenever I want. She has what it takes to keep the audience captive. Her voice is as beautiful as ever, and will really impress you. You can feel the emotion in the song and in the end, the ants. The show will leave you with a desire to go and how to make a movie Bette Midler or go to the nearest musical highlight of the show was her singing Â«Stay With Me" from his film 1979 "The Rose". store and buy one of Bette Midler albums.
