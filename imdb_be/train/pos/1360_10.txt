This is one of probably the most favorite movies. Posey's character is more top entertainment and librarian motive will not be lost on anyone who has ever worked in the books and stacks of the world. <br /> <br /> If you are a student library, Car ETA. Then buy a poster and hang it on the wall. The soundtrack is also strongly recommended. I showed the film to a Friends of the Library than any other - they all fall in love with him.
