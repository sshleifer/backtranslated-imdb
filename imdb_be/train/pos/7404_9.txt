Just saw the Australian Prime Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. Program notes said it was - a perfect delight -deftly did, touching, funny, dramatic and sarcastically meaning. I could not agree more. I just hope that the rest of the films of the festival come to this standard of entertainment and I'm looking forward to see the planned show in Sydney more Chinese movies in the coming months.
