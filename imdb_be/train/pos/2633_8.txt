I must be honest, I expected to fail so badly because it really sounds like they are trying to milk the original film, to get money. But it was not so with the rather amusing (sometimes odd) film. I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumba, the story of Simba and his sleep problems was funny. Jacuzzi bubble, and if FUIB leaves stop the bubbles. It's all harmless fun, good for children and some adults. I think this film will take some time, because it's pretty good for a direct to video and DVD movies. While the film does seem a little strange and kind of dies down to the end, it works. 8 of 10
