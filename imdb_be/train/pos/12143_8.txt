Brilliant film, the next best film The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on the original VHS and I have not seen this film for 15 years, but so far so good, as it was then. The acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse, but these are the features that make this film (as well as many other old-fashioned Chinese kung fu movies) high. The choreography is surprising and is the main storyline. I have never seen the 36th chamber of Shaolin, but I know that it's the same movie, but Gordon Liu plays San-Te, but San-Te in Thr return to the 36th Chamber play a different character. It has a great value and a brilliant comedy kung-fu.
