It deserves a 12 out of 10. Absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories. The show must go back, I've seen every episode, and it's real quality. <br /> <br /> show centers around a few people in New York, playing with the concept of six degrees of separation and intelligently weaves their lives. Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are stunning and so charming Caseman. The scenery is striking and elegant cabinets. <br /> <br /> We need more shows like this makes the audience feel that they are smart people, not mindless drones. <br /> <br /> If he never comes back, six degrees will be sorely missed.
