This kind of film that will stay with you for a long time. Saha Ali and Abhay Deol both look very nice. Saha reminds you so much of her mother Sharm Tagore. Abhay born actor and will grow much in the near future. <br /> <br /> The ending of the film is very different from most films. In a sense, you are left unfulfilled, but if you really think about it, in real terms, you understand that the only reasonable ending was shown in the end of the film. Otherwise it would be a complete injustice to everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in court. Her boyfriend does not show, and she ends up helping the witness. Gradually, over time, he falls in love with her. It is not clear whether she had such feelings for him or not. Watch the film for more information. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Abhay. I'm looking forward to see more films from him. Saha pretty, but not much to say in the film. Her eyes, her innocence has done most of the talking.
