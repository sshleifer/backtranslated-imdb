The third film McMurray / Carole Lombard is a bit more serious than a hand across the table and Princess comes. This is another game adaptation of burlesque, which, apparently, was popular back in the day. <br /> <br /> original game Burlesque ran on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 performances, and this is the role played by Carole Lombard, Barbara Stanwyck appeared on Broadway, which brought her to Hollywood. Version starred Nancy Carroll in the early days of radio, and later Grable and Dan Dailey took another option is when My Baby smiles at me. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have a vinyl album version of the radio that Al Zholson and Ruby Keeler did for Lux Radio Theater. It's an interesting job, believe me. <br /> <br /> In any case MacMurray Lombard and do well from the old chestnut, the story is now set in a nightclub, where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpeter. Pay attention to the good performance, Dorothy Lamour as the Latin fox that gets between Fred and Carol. In addition, Anthony Quinn in one of his early films, like the wolf on the makeup for a pawnshop. <br /> <br /> ups and downs keeps excellent today and I would not be surprised if we see another burlesque version of the twenty-first century.
