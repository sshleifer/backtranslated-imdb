Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to American cinema is huge. His legacy is an outstanding group of films that will live forever, as is the case with "The Shop Around the Corner." This film was remade in other less prominent movies and musical play without the charm or the elegant Mr. Lubitsch and own specific version. <br /> <br /> Sallavan and James Stewart worked in several films together. These characters are allocated in this film as an example of how to be in the film without being almost act at all. Both stars as an excellent pen pals who do not know each other, but fate decided who they work together in one shop in Budapest. <br /> <br /> The reason why these classic films worked so well that the countries supporting casts a studio together in the picture after picture. Here, we have an excellent Frank Morgan playing shopkeeper. In addition, we see Joseph Schildkraut Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, do a poor job in making us believe that yes, they are in Budapest. <br /> <br /> That is why these movies will live on forever!
