This film was very interesting. Soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is the Bryan Adams does all the songs in French as well. Cost is also uplifting and dramatic. <br /> <br /> film is made from a mixture of traditional animation, in combination with the computer images. The result is truly stunning. I watch this movie at least once a week with their children, and we never tire of it. History convincingly and well told. <br /> <br /> I do not know anyone who would rank this film is less than 7. Definately a keeper in my family.
