This is what I call "pre-Sci Fi, Sci Fi» cinema. It gets no better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good movement type "mood" of the picture. These two artists present their very best, like this story. <br /> <br /> Karloff does a terrific job as a scientist who sees himself caught in a vice of vanity, pride, and scientific competition. I was taken to the idea of ​​watching the man as he drowns himself in the three previously mentioned concepts. I was upset i at the same time, captured with two stars as they claim. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of movie that asks for a remake. At this time, I put Harrison Ford in terms of Karloff and possibly Kieffer Sutherland as the role of Bela Lagosi. It would be possible to do it nearly as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best that Hollywood has ever produced. As I said..it it becomes better. No way.
