The memory of «The Last Hunt» stuck with me since I saw him in 1956 when I was 13. It's a film that was far ahead of the others at the time, he appealed to the natives, environmental treatment of the environment, and is always present the contrast between short-term and long-term effects of greed. It is as true today as it was in 1956, in a discussion cinemagraphic limit the depth and significance. On top of setting is beautiful and the cinematography is excellent. The memory of this movie will be with me the rest of my days.
