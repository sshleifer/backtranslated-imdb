Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, «Scarface» is a film that will not be forgotten. Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) arrives in America for the American dream. Montana becomes the "king" in the drug world, he ruthlessly controls his empire of crime in Miami, Florida. This gangster film is very strong, and some scenes are unpleasant to look at. This film is about 180+ F-word and a length of almost three hours. This film is entertaining and you'll never get bored. You cheer for the drug lord, and in some scenes you will discover that Montana has not as bad as some other crime lords. It is a masterpiece, and I recommend that you look at. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
