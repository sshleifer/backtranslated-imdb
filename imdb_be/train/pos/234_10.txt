I always knew that Anne DeSalvo was a great actor, a hero, now I know that she is a great writer / director too. I've been a fan since I first saw her in the «Perfect» films, "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab» and «Stardust Memories». <br /> <br /> It's so rare to see Grant Lee these days than ever. She disappeared from the screen for too long. It is also great to see Leachman in something other than a sit-com. This is her best work since "The Last Picture Show." If you grew up in an Italian American family, you will love this film. I was not expecting much when I started to watch this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you get a chance to watch.
