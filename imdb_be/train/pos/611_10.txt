I contend that those who ultimately is responsible for the creation / approval of the trailer of this movie completely blunder. NOBODY I know I did not want to see this film based on the previews, and all those who actually saw it (I know) absolutely loved it ... Campaign disgrace / disaster / miss. <br /> <br /> opened in # 4 for ... <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush Hour, which I have not seen average score IMDb 7,4. <br /> <br /> # 2-The Bourne Ultimatum, I saw a strange film, but the third week, with the average score IMDb 8,7 (worth I would say). <br /> <br /> # 3-The Simpsons Movie, which I have seen a good film, but the fourth week, the average IMDb rating 8.1 (a little more in my opinion). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, GPA IMDb 8,4 (lower than Bourne, but it was our 3 weeks). <br /> <br /> whether it is poor planning or bad advertising, I think that the powers that be screwed up big time for this film! It was advertised as an amazing film that happens to be a fantasy / fairy tale and not advertised as another tale ?? Sorry :( Anyway- Now that I've talked to very aimlessly and-on ... Amazing film, watch it!
