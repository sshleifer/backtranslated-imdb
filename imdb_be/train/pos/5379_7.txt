There's a lot going on in College Girl murders. Mad scientist creates almost imperceptible toxic gas. Before it can reap the benefits of its discovery, the scientist killed hood, stick welding monk. After the editor of the killed in the church of gas, Scotland Yard called to investigate, but the killing continues. Who can stop this insane killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases, and out of college? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - killer. I do not like a murderer who sneaks around wearing bright red KKK looking outfit, complete with red gloves. White whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out beautifully against the bright red dress. Although the idea of ​​a killer in a burning red, pointed head dress sneaking around the school girls are pretty far-fetched, it is one of the most ominous looking costumes that I've seen <br /> <br /> -. Groovy 60s music. I really would like to find the name of the music College Girl kills. He got jazz, hip, 60s feel to it, I just loved <br /> <br /> -. Bizarre touches. For red dress killers and the hood, the film has a sliding fireplace, his alligators with handing over the head of the cell, poisoned by spraying the Bible, is strategically located mannequins, mini-skirt, a third-go boots and a mile high hair. I would describe it as a cross between Batman TV show 60 and Italian Giallo. Murder college girl is a real treat for the eyes <br /> <br /> -. End. Let's just say that there are more than twisted mountain road. Just when you think that the murderer was discovered, here comes the turn ?? .. and the other ?? and the other ?? and other <br /> <br /> What does not work: .. <br /> <br /> - the chief inspector Sir John. I know that the guy was supposed to be comic, but his character is funny too much screen time <br /> <br /> -. Why are alligators? Earlier I mentioned the alligator pit. And while they are nice to touch, they provide very little benefit. Why go through all the trouble and do not use them? <br /> <br /> - perseverance Plot. Some of the killings College girls have no flow or rhythm to it. There are too many moments throughout the film, when inexplicable things come to a screeching halt. It would be better to walk made it much more enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> I have not seen that many of these German krimis but with a bit of what I saw (Phantom SoHo Strangler of Blackmoor Castle, Dead London eye), this may be my favorite. This one has a real funky feel to it that I really go to. If the story flowed a little better, I could have easily gave the college girl kills 7/10.
