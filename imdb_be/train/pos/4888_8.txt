It's just been broadcast on the BBC, and I am absolutely happy with what he saw. As the rolling credits, the cast alone convinced that I would give it a go. Just five minutes later, I was completely immersed in this wonderful film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was formulaic and predictable, but something added to his charm. Memories in the forties were well located and captured the feeling equalized in several productions. <br /> <br /> real feeling of a good film, punctuated throughout with outstanding music. When she comes out, I'll buy it!
