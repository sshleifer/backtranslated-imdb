this is a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie when it came out. Most recently, I saw this movie once again, and he still holds in his memory. Many movies we watched when we were younger, do not seem to hold when we see them later in life. The film is actually an example of a large 80-type films from the pores. Keaton at his best, all the actors really did a very good job, and Ron Howard was a very good story to give impetus to the movies together, rather than to make it. The pace of the film is very fast with a few slow spots and see the cars from the 80's too funny. As the 80's, I loved to see again the ugly Pacer. The film is a great movie for all lovers of comedy and movie lovers 80s.
