That's funny. Garden. Magic. All these words that floated through my mind as I watched this beautiful, simple film. <br /> <br /> It's rare that a movie really touches me, but «Shall We Dance?» achieved that with the grace to spare. Light humor mixed with a rare fine flour made it easily one of the best experiences of my movie-viewing history. He left me with a quiet sense of joy, but with a little touch of sadness mixed in. <br /> <br /> And dance, oh yes, dancing. Even if you are not an art lover can not put one foot in front of the other steps shown here are breathtaking, and you want to do is to sign up for classes as quickly as you can. It was absolutely magical, even the parts that show Sugiyama (in touching drew Koji Yakushev) stilted steps, when he was first learning to dance was beautiful in a humorous, childlike way. Nevertheless, this film is not really about dancing, but more about the intricacies of human behavior and emotions. We are seeing a shy person learns to express their suppressed feelings through dance, a great dance instructor again his love for art, and personal growth of each member of a great supporting cast. <br /> <br /> beauty. Pain. Emotion. All the love and a bit of the agony of life here appears with a subtle sense of beauty of Japanese watercolor painting in conjunction with the emotional power and grace of culture. <br /> <br />
