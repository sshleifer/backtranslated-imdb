This movie has great acting, great picture and a very strong storyline that really makes you think about who you are, how do you define yourself as you approach, you agree to play the role or free ... There is already great comments, related to these aspects. I want to comment on the formal setting of the film. In general, these two men on the roof. There is a unity of time and place, with 2 main characters, and radio, acting as the choir. Many directors have made the Greek tragedies to the cinema, many filmmakers filmed contemporary stories as if they were Greek tragedy, but no director, failed in my opinion as good as Ettore Scola in the approach to the purity and power of the big Greek tragedies and in the subject line and the formal setting. Masterpiece.
