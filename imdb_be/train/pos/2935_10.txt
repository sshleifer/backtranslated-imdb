Eddie Murphy Delirious, of course, ridiculous thing you've ever seen in your life. You can compare it to any movie, and I garuntee you decide that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This film is about 1hr. 45 min., And were in a bit when I did not laugh during this time. You will laugh for a few hours after it ended, reproduce highlights over and over and over again in your head. Eddie Murphy has given so many ridiculous statements during his career (48 hr., Market places, Beverly Hills, Raw, Coming to America, The Nutty Professor, Shrek, etc.). But it is certainly his most fun moment. I've seen this movie so many times, and it's funnier each time. It never loses its edge. From that day on, every great performance stand will emulate from Delirious. ***** and two thumbs up!
