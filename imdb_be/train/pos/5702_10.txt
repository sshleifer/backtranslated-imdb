I did not expect, Val Kilmer, to make a convincing John Holmes, but I found myself forgetting that it was not a porn legend himself. In fact, the entire cast turned in an amazing performance in this film is significantly undervalued <br /> <br /> As some have mentioned, to seek out a two-disk set and watch «Wadd» documentary first. it will give you a lot of background on stories that could be helpful in understanding the film. <br /> <br /> Some people are unhappy LAPD crime video included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons why it can be included, one of which is the fact that the trial for the murder of John Holmes was the first in the United States, where such staff have been used by the prosecution. If you do not want to see it, it's easy to avoid; it is clearly identified as «LAPD crime scene Personnel" in the menu!
