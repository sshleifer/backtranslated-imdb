Last of the Blond Bombshells is an entertaining bit of fluff. Dench plays Elizabeth, recently widowed woman on the free ends. She spent most of her life next obedient wife and mother, but was never really happy. <br /> <br /> Shortly after the funeral of her husband, Elizabeth with her regular lunch dates with her inert children when she sees as a street performer. It ignites memories of when she was a member of the all-girl band swing in London during World War II. We soon find out that the band was not sure all girls, as a drummer was a man dressed as a woman ala jazz. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth pulls her saxophone (which she secretly practicing throughout her marriage) and joins forces with the guitar playing street musician. Elizabeth is much more talented than the guitarist, and the money will come. It does not take any money, as it is rich and does not need it. Her play is strictly for artistic performance. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth saw one day Patrick (Ian Holm), who was the drummer in the band-resistance. It seems that Patrick was - and still is - quite a womanizer, and Elizabeth - being only fifteen at the time. - I was the only member of the group who has not experienced Patrick's "talents", in addition to playing drums <br /> <br /> Elizabeth inspired granddaughter to get the old team together again to play at a dance school in her granddaughter. So begins a wonderful trip down memory lane in conjunction with aspects of the humorous movie Road Trip. - all completed with some really good swing and blues <br /> <br /> I think I'm at the age where I really like the old actresses doing their job, and this film is a treasure because it is not only a star Judi Dench, but it is supported by no less than Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron, as well as many experienced British actresses character. All this is crowned by an extraordinary voice Cleo Laine. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is fluff, but very beautiful and very interesting fluff.
