What is really sad, it shows how the six degrees of x and brothers and sisters are the true reality TV, not the garbage that is nothing more than a glorified game shows. I think the groundswell of discontent were there over the last few years with very premature cancellation of the first of many shows with cult. But with a vocal backlash supporters Jericho (which I also like) and other shows, the network can begin to reverse this trend. I, like others, I will not support any new shows until they are given a second season. Then I might decide to watch and catch up with the help of DVD, and online viewing. By the time ABC, you have lost me as a viewer to any new show.
