In fact I am surprised that so many comments about this film. I saw it as part of the Slavic Film Festival in a major American university. But no one in the US have not heard about it, it's a real shame! The dynamics between people is what makes it funny and sad. They glued on a long bus ride - which is something most of us have had !! But I've never been one like it !! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one where they stay for the funeral. Then the man and the woman to escape for some Lovemaking in the forest, but everything is going to look for them without their knowledge! Just as she lifts her skirt, and he enters into it all the way - TB begins hacking and they understand that everyone is watching !! It's about surprised! But ... you really have to feel for them, even if it's funny funny! If you can see the end is kind of ironic that they had fun while they did! Serb humor at it's best!
