The most famous film is Depardieu (1974) groundbreaker by Bertrand Blier. It has lots of very sexy scenes bordering on the X-rating, including one from Jeanne Moreau makes the hot version of the 1970s her Jules and Jim threesome with two French hairy hippies (Depardieu and Deware). There's no such thing as a holy area in this film; all fair game. <br /> <br /> It is very strange that the Americans, as a rule, do not like this film a lot while many French people I've met consider it a classic. Something about this is against what the Americans have been programmed to "how." <br /> <br /> Gerard and Patrick are end Deware two bitch slaps, Hippy drifters with plenty of sexual insecurity, going around molesting women and committing petty crimes, they anticapitalist and legs, the Euro-Communist, slacker "freedom ". Blier ridicules hell out of the two guys at the same time making the bourgeois society itself look ultimately much funnier. Best of all, though, it is as an outstanding cost Grappelli transmits troubled soul drifters, a deeper awareness of the subconscious or "higher ideal", which motivates all the madness they are involved in.
