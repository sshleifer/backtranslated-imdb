Crush provides a combination of drama, humor and irony, such that I find the English set very well when it comes to matters of the heart. Mainly known for directing John McKay wrote this great script about three forty-something friends in a small town in England. All three professional women buck took men formed a ritual house night gathering with gin, phage and consumption of sweets, complete with endless chatter faulty behavior or need their libido of their date. Andie MacDowell again thrown surrounds Brits (which is where I find it exudes the majority) is absolutely magical, as the head mistress of the prestigious schools involved with a young man. Small town gossip and disapproving jealous friends (a lot of support CAST) conflicts with her relationship. The deployment of a series of violent and unfortunate events showing us a lot of difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness. Keep in mind, the main reason this film is the friendship and the end shows us exactly that. This type of film, you either love it or hate it, so I think a lot of reviews and the mix is ​​not that the greatest success in the end, when the film was released. I am sure that most of them simply take your movie right now. I really enjoyed this film and would highly recommend for those who love films like "Love Actually" and "Three Weddings and a Funeral". Not to mention the unusual soundtrack perfectly capturing those important moments.
