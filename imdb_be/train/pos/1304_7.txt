All right. Yes, it was a very impenetrable-budget film with continuity errors (as a single scene, apparently filmed in the sunlight, and then in the shade, and then mixed with each other), as well as how much I love Nick Mancuso, he was often a little too well of the burned-out and some minor supporting cast was pretty bad (plus at least one actor has been used for two different, but notable roles). But come on. Richard Creek hysterical (only his hair is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very nice. Mancuso had some great lines, while Nancy Allen, ironically, was very bland and uninteresting. Classic? No. The bad part? Yes. Exciting? Great to. I wish it was on the set the day, they decide what hairstyle would Creek. "You'll soon?Â» ... "Y'ain't so quickly."
