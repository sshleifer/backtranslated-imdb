This film is really nerve racking Cliffhangin movie! Stallone was good, as always! Rucker put on the unexpected performance and John Lithgow plays a great villain! The music is fantastic, especially the theme! Action movie and never boring! If you see the fan Stallone Cliffhanger, you will not be disappointed!
