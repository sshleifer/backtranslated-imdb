"Chinese Ghost StoryÂ» is one of the most amazing Hong Kong movies I've ever seen.It brilliant mixture of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and military arts.The film has some great visual effects and amazing fights.I like to especially fight scene between Ma Wo and wood demon tongue.Truly original and refreshing film and excellent recommendations of other embalmer.
