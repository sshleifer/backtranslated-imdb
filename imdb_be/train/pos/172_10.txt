I saw this movie on Comedy Central several times. This movie was pretty good. This is an interesting adventure from the life of Sunny Davis, who arranged to marry the king Ohtar, so that the US can get a military base there to balance the power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including «Sunnygate». I also just loved the ending theme. It gave me a great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this film.
