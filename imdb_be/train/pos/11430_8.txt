Unfortunately, because of the tendency of American audiences shunned subtitles, the film did not spread, nor the attention it deserves. His thin threads of belonging, identity, race relations, and especially as colonialism harms all sides, leaving the obvious dramatic tension, nostalgic memories of childhood protaganiste and exoticism of her relationship with her parents "Houseboy", perhaps the only "real" people, she knows. We will not even look at the mother's relationship with this elegant man. There! I hope I gave you enough hook to take it, you say, French or subtitles or not. I urge you to be brave, strong and know as La P'tite.
