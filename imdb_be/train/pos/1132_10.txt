His Hollywood imitating Daytiem TV series at its finest! His most interesting is that we never see. Great characters and great lines. Vupite paddle ..... Sally Field as top .... Gary Marshall line of riot .... that's what I love about good comedies. Never be afraid to laugh at yourself !!!!!! A lot were great .... wardrobe was on the point and Backstabbing «Montana Morehead" was a devilish delight. Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico» do not have enough lines, but nevertheless still a great and fun when the screen. I would like to know how the idea of ​​this film came up. Never have I seen a man has cast so much fun in making comedy work! Large foam it should be, and I'm waiting for a DVD !!!
