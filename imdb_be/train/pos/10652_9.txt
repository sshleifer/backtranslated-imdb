I do not know why critics trashed the film. I hardly ever agree with them anyway <br /> <br /> The film might be a little frightening. - I usually do not go to horror movies! I even had myself psychologically to see it in the daytime. I do not have bothered! ;) (The movie was full of kids too, x;) ... Lee were great, as always. I also liked Katarina Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nelly) <br /> <br /> The house was very gothic and beautiful in a terrible way. Special effects and sound were strange. I also liked the score, especially the gentle melodies to Eleanor and her journey to save her child, she grew up with his stagnant life and life and finally get its power, peace and freedom.
