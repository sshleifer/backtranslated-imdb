The storyline here, Aditiya (Kumar) is a spoiled son of a millionaire, Ishwar (Bachan), the toy industry has, in the eyes of Ishwar and his son Aditya can not do anything wrong, Aditya mother Sumitra (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar bring his son responsible way, before it is too late for Ishwar is the patients with lung cancer and has only 9 months to live when his son runs away and marries Mitali (Chopra), Ishwar Aditya easy to forgive, but if the happy couple Aditya and Mitali returned from their honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant, and it makes Ishwar push Adi yu of the house to make it more accountable, Aditya does not know that his father is suffering from lung cancer, and he does not know that his father kicked him out of the hose, to make it more accountable, Ishwar can not bring myself to high Aditya that he was going to die from starvation and a pregnant wife. it is a race against time since Aditya is doing its best to prove that he is his father, and the climax comes when Aditya gets his big break in the film industry, and his father tells him that he is going to die. <br /> <br /> this film is absolutely brilliant, this is a breakthrough in Indian cinema, which was needed for the industry of Bollywood, Shah direction nearly flawless, but the film has none of the disadvantages? The best part, if the film is the son of his father's relationship, which is sentimental. sideshow song just fit at the right time, the scenery is good, only the part where the movie fails, where jokes between Bohm Iran and Razhpal Yadav jokes too long, and after a bit they are annoying, but overall it's brilliant film, I advise anyone reading this review to go and see it, regardless of the other reviews. 9/10
