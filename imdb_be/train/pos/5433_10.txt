This film is one of my favorites. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. ... that casting. Not to mention the Jaff, Dean of the Ganges. Drama, action, adventure and comedy all rolled into one. The final scene of the battle is still to this day gives me chills, and ending always leaves me in tears. If you have not seen, I highly recommend.
