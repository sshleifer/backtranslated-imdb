"The classic War of the Worlds" Timothy Hines is a very interesting film, which obviously goes to great efforts and lengths to accurately recreate the classic book by HG Wells. Mr. Hines succeeds in this. I, and those who watched his film with me, appreciated the fact that he was not a standard, predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year, for example, the version of Spielberg and Tom Cruise, who had only the slightest resemblance to the book. It is obvious that everyone is looking for different things in the movie. Those who imagine themselves as amateur "critics" look only to criticize everything that can. Others appreciate the film more important bases as entertain, so most people will never accept "criticism". We enjoyed the efforts of Mr. Haynes to put loyalty to the classic novel H.G. Wells, and we found that it will be very interesting. This made it easy to overlook that "criticism" perceives as its drawbacks.
