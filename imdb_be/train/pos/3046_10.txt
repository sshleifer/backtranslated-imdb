All good films "inspired", some right on the video copycats Flick. I was afraid that "Gladiator" was not really a good movie, because I have not seen any movie that had anything remotely resembling anything Roman at the new releases shelf for several months. Then I saw the last sentence of the full moon, Demonicus. I am a fan of the series PuppetMaster Full Moon, and Blood Dolls, but never saw them not killer puppet films. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus chronicles what happens to a group of tourists in the mountains of the Alps. One of the tourists, James finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts and feels prompted to remove the helmet from the corpse and try it. He becomes obsessed, and, as a demonic gladiator Tirana, sent to kill their friends to revive a corpse, which is a real tyranny. <br /> <br /> Of course, like in many films Full Moon, it has little or no budget. From time to time, editing and direction was so amateurish, I swear I watched Blair Witch Project. Attempts to amputation of limbs and head reminds me sketch Monty Python. Weapons, although, apparently real, look really in plastic. It literally looks like it was filmed a group of friends with a digital video camera for the weekend. Of course, there is nothing wrong in this film just does not rent it waits for a technical masterpiece. It seems that there have been attempts to study the script, too, because, despite the tyranny did not act in the same way as a gladiator to the end, at least, he speaks Latin. <br /> <br /> All smashing aside, I really liked this movie. Not so much as a puppet film killer, perhaps, but Full Moon still delivers! The only thing that disappointed me was not there Videozone full moon in the end!
