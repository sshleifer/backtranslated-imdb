With an excellent actor with a very impressive cast a reasonable written (and very cited) scenario, a generous film to excellent scores of Carter Burwell, Rob Roy offers a rare experience in the movie takes place: the one that is almost impossible to find fault in any area. <br /> <br /> There have been few comparisons with Braveheart, which was released in the same year. With all the loan Mel Gibson, Braveheart hit me with too much self-awareness and enlightening epic to rival Rob Roy, as a kind of movie that I would care to see more than once. While Braveheart works hard to be a serious epic, Rob Roy just grabs you and absorb you into its tightly edited narrator. Neither the scene wasted. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy provides a perfect balance of dramatic tension, action and even occasional humor. The characters are well fleshed-out, perfectly conveying the lingo and mannerisms that anchor them in an authentic period setting. <br /> <br /> In addition, they are not caricatures of good and evil, as we all too often see in modern even a movie. <br /> <br /> For example, while we hope prevails heroic Rob Roy, we understand its heavy products of his own pride and sense of honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most hated bad guys in the history of cinema, but there are times when we can understand how the events of his life shaped him into becoming what it is. Rob Roy uses the level of character development, which makes his story even more believable and grip. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy wonderful treasure, featuring one of the greatest goals ever fighting choreography and climatic ending, worthy of all suspense.
