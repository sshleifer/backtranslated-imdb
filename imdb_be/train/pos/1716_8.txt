Abhay Deol meets an attractive Saha Ali Khan and greets her, "Hey Sister" !!!. It sets the tone for a great debut film Shivov Naira. Saha, middle class girl ran away from his home in Nainital and come to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Manche. But Shan plow to turn up leaving with a broken heart and one in the big bad world. , Abhay, lower class neighborhood guy is protecting a vulnerable Saha and helps her get a job & refuge in a nursing home. Romance blooms and Saha agrees to marry Abhay slowly. Shan then comes to life again. <br /> <br /> And in the Sakha prudently made a film with a very unusual storyline, lovingly shot in Delhi, it revolves around the fragile Saha. This well-researched film has moments that will forever be kept in memory ?? uncomfortable first kiss and rapid remission Abhay; Abhay Saha describe as Â«Ladki class wali" and hastily adding, "that he does not like it"; his giving in to the Churidar Saha and ask her out on a date. <br /> <br /> Music is good and great background music. In the scene where Saha reeds and covered Abhay soundtrack disappears. Property transfers as the awkward tenderness & relationships. <br /> <br /> bitter sweet bitter ending makes the movie, the memory of which will linger for a long long time. <br /> <br /> I have to see it to assess 8.5 / 10
