I was so excited to see this film, because I always heard that it was very scary. <br /> <br /> What's interesting is it that a Japanese film, they decided to bring to America, but they actually shot it in Japan with the original team! I think it made the movie ... more Japanese (which is probably why it turned out quite successful in contrast to most of Japan to the American horror film flops), but it also made it a bit inaccessible to American audiences. The difference is that frightens the Japanese culture and what scares American culture felt present throughout the film. It worked well in those moments when they had to pretend to grab the nervous fear of the protagonist: a frightened fish in a big, busy, unfamiliar, Tokyo pond <br /> <br /> The storyline was pretty confusing, but .. In a typical Japanese fashion is extremely complex and intricate. The beginning of the film is actually the middle of the story, and from there we move constantly back and forth until the end of the film, we see the end and the beginning of the story. This constant flipping over time was very confusing to me. Also, I do not think that some things have been explained so well, and I had to ask my friend to explain it to me (she had seen him, as well as the sequel, which seems to reveal more of the story). <br /> <br /> as a whole, there is a lot of love for an American audience, tons of bizarre imagery and gruesome details, a healthy splash of hopping scenes.
