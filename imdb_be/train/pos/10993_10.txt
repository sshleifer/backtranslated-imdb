The plot that you have read the other postings: the average white-collar guy, looking for change and adventure, signs on for corporate espionage work. Just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit data inside. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the background walk-- surreal tan corporate frustration that twines itself the quintessence of which is at the heart of suburban paranoia. <, Br /> <br /> Then she begins to accelerate. <br /> <br /> working on all parts of superb-- and yes, some actions are cartoon characters. But all of them are suitable, and they entertain.
