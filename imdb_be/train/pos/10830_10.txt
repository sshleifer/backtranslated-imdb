I enjoyed the more crazy, more than any movie I've seen in years. Successful group with 70s decided to give it another try. They begin to play several concerts in some seedy European markets, with hilarious results. The music is fantastic, the script and acting are horrible. The symbols on the spot, especially vocalist with high heavy metal voice, make-up and personal problems. Concert in the end it was impossible. Go and see it, preferably in the film with a good sound system :)
