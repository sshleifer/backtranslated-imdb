Guys and Dolls is a unique game based on the characters. Sky Masterson <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a high-class player who takes a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) to one thousand dollars. Nathan needs money, so he can <br /> <br /> run his usual game of shit and make a fortune. The rate that the sky will not be able to take just any girl in Havana, Cuba, and "doll", he chose Sarah <br /> <br /> Brown (Jean Simmons), who was responsible for the missionary. Sky finally impresses <br /> <br /> enough Sarah to go to Havana with him. They eventually fall in love with each other, but she later accuses him of something he had not been involved. Nathan ran crap games in the missionary night they left. Nathan '14 groom Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) disapprove of gambling Nathan and tries to stop him from doing so. However, when the film ends it all ends happily with a double <br /> <br /> wedding. <br /> <br /> The songs in this film is not just beautiful, no matter who sings it. Marlon <br /> <br /> Sun Brando singing voice at all, and the truth is that they could have called it, but it does not matter. He has done an excellent acting job (obviously, seeing as Brando) and played his character very well. I've seen a few movies with Jean Simmons and I thought that this movie was its weakest one, it too could not <br /> <br /> sing at all. However, singing is of Frank Sinatra, Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye also in the original <br /> <br /> Broadway production of Guys and Dolls. Vivian Blaine had a great voice and was a perfect Adelaide. If you love music, and even if you do not, I suggest you look at it.
