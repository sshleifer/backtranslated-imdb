I have to totally agree with the other comments about this film. The visuals complement the supernatural theme of the film and does not detract from the story, besides, I loved how this step was not like Crouching Tiger, because this time the ball did not have any action obligations and most of the time you can see the action close. <br /> <br /> I think that Western audiences will be very confused 2 scene one of which includes the monk tried to burn themselves to death, and the other in respect of villagers chanting, it's the end of the world. These scenes are derived from certain interpretations of the text waving Buddhist (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan), as well as other transactions in the story of strangeness in the Japanese calendar ... if people really thought that the world would come to an end .. . GoJoe has action, story and visuals mesmerize any viewer. I firmly believe that with some skilful editing it can be sold in the US in May, one complaint in the last scene of the battle (I can not give away - sorry).
