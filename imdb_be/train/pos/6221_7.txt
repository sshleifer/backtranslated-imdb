If this film was put together a little better, it would be up there with the best Astaire and Rogers. As it is, it's a great film, but too long a tedious plot, ie, Randolph Scott Rogers takes care of his sister, played by Harriet Hilliard (the wife of Ozzy Nelson to you baby boomers). <br /> <br /> Aster Scott and two men of the fleet. Scott Hilliard meets for the first time it looks like the stereotypical librarian, and later, after Ginger Rogers asked his friend (blond, but unmistakable Lucille Ball) its glamor. Meanwhile, Astaire trying to pick up where he and his old partner, finished dancing. As a result some great dance numbers, with Astaire and Rogers as a team and individually, "I put all the eggs in one basket», «Let Yourself Go» and «I would rather Bring Band". Hilliard sweet, but a bit sluggish as plain Jane turned glamor girl, but she sings well their two songs, "But where are you?" And, "Get behind me, Satan!" - one poster did not care for the song, but I love the title. Rogers is a living, and the young Aster is a dynamo. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film takes place at the end with "Let's face the music and dance," one of the most aching beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly executed Rogers and Astaire. In it they embody the '30s glamor and fantasy. It will really be saved and viewed again and again.
