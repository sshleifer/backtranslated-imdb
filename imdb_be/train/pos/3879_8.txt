Typical Clausen film, but again not typical. Klausen writes, directs, and play a leading role. It really is a great film about normal people who live a normal life, trying to make the best of it. The 4 main characters faces were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Hellmuth was convincing. Do you believe that he was really sick. <br /> <br /> Sonja Richter plays a nurse who is actually an actor, but it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the old man. <br /> <br /> each have problems, and those who do not believe anyone in the end, be happy. But nothing good comes easy, they have to fight to win his love and life.
