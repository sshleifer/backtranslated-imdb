You probably all know that now, but 5 additional episodes never broadcast can be viewed on ABC.com I watched a lot of television for many years, and this is maybe my favorite show ever. It is a crime that is beautifully written and acted in the show was canceled. Actors who played Laura, iota, Carlos May, Damian, Anya and OMG, Steven Caseman - all incredible and so natural in these roles. Even big kids. Great show. So sad that he's gone. Of course I wonder about the reasons was canceled. There is no way I will allow myself to believe that the pregnancy of Mrs. Moynahan had nothing to do with him. It was an ideal time interval in this market. I watched all the episodes again on ABC.com - I hope that they all come on a DVD-something. Thanks for reading.
