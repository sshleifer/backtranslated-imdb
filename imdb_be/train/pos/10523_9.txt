Emma true romance. If you love sentimental stuff, loaded with intelligence and stupidity, you will love this movie! Its true to the novel, which is very important, with a few twists thrown in for fun. Gwen is not one of my favorite actreesess, but it pays tribute to the role that you want everything she had to offer in spades. It shines in the role, I think that no other actress could not do proper justice. <br /> <br /> North as a hero. how shocked you? I never looked at it as a beautiful open, but what the hell! What is the right role can do for you! It looks as good as clever, royal, Mr. K, I just look at it in a new light. He makes a lovely and romantic lead. Charm and character, which leads to his role perfectly! <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, Scacchi brings alone. good throw. Good movie. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, see this movie, along with Pride and Prejudice - And most importantly, buy the book. It enhances the film height, which are extraordinary
