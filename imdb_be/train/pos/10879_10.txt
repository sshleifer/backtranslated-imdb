I would like to see cut from that day, I heard about it, which was once in the past year. Anyway, I need to see today, and when the movie started I thought it started quite a week, but it's even better after 10 minutes or so. I thought that movie was pretty good. but the thing I did not like the killer has been created, I thought, before I rented, it is likely to suck, like urban legends: the final version, I almost died of it. basically all that is necessary to increase the UL in the final version. CUT 100 times better than UL: Final Cut. CUT The best part is the killer and the death scene. Killer kicks MO F *** ING OPS. <br /> <br /> I give cut 8 of 10
