My family watched Arthur Bach stumble and stutter, since the film first came out. We have most of the rows in the memory. I watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled in a simple and humorous look at the life-reflecting Dudley Moore. Liza Minnelli has done an excellent job as a side impact - even though I'm not the biggest fan. This movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur visits the bride's house. His conversation with the butler and the parents of Susan is a side-spitting. The line from the butler, "I do not want to wait in the library," and then answer Arthur, "Yes, I would, bathroom out of the question," my NewMail notice on my computer. "Arthur really" fun stuff "!
