Fragility - 8/10 - This is not a header and used senseless "Bill Paxton Routes" heading in the side, it's quite a good old-fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller. In the end, you may end up just being inbred Southern Gothic cousin Kubrick's "The Shining" --- but hey, it's pretty damn entertaining performance. He also received a Doozy plot twist ... and very ambiguous moral message. This kind of film that years people will catch late in the evening on the main cable and scare beejesus of watching yourself. It is a pity, director Bill Paxton had to go hire a star ... oh well .... still damn good rents.
