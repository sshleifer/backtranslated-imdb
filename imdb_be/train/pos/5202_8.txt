Just look through this version of "Samhain", and although I still like it, it's nothing like a "rough" version I have. If you check the message boards, you'll see an apology from the director of this cut-off version, 79 min., And he says he has nothing to do with this R-rated cut down edit screwed with a brand new ending. Christian does not have to look far myself that much, since the basic elements of Gore are still standing, even though much reduced. It is very sad, because it had the potential to be one of the best goriest and gore films in recent years. He still has a porn star, and inbred, and some of the extreme gore may be at least partly visible. I'm just glad that I have is that the "rough" because for me, it is a jewel for any gorehounds library. Christian Viel, certainly has the skills and vision to deliver the goods, and I hope that his next project will be better made. Idiots were almost classical in their hands, and has done much harm to all. "Samhain" may be one of the most controversial and stuck horror films ever, and too bad gorehounds entirely get to see what the director intended. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* *** Just so you know what you missed, this is my review based on "work print" Samhain. <br /> <br /> film runs a little more than 90 minutes and does not stop the head. There is absolutely no music soundtrack, and some scenes are not the audio in a dialogue, because I think that they are intended for selected later. However, most of the film has a sound with a sound effect, and if the effect or scene is not available, a message appears as a signal to turn on when the film will be completed. It is true, as he says, "to Rough Cut", but only the uncut version of "Samhain" you are ever likely to see. The reason, because the blood is extremely graphic, much more than even an NC-17 will allow. Yes, there are some porn star, but they are only there to kill, and to add a little sugar and spice. The story is quite standard, American tourists on holiday in Ireland, and ended up staying in a house in the middle of the forest. The area that is heavy on folklore, with the participation of the ancient Druids and the celebration of Samhain, or, as we call it Halloween. (Ghost) <br /> <br /> The film begins with a huge dose of gore like camping pair is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants. This is a big gusset scene, the guy found his girl hanging from the cliffs, with her cries for help. All he sees her head, shoulders and arms hanging in front of him, and when he pulls it, it was completely split in half. This is what I would call EXTREME GORE guts, blood and severed limbs all places. We are in the territory of Herschell Gordon Lewis people here, except that the effects seem much more realistic. I'm going to just skip the story, because it's your standard stalk and kill the story. <br /> <br /> next scene clotted blood something to contemplate as one taken first killing the cave as location (TCM-2 stuff), and associated with the table. This freak circumcise his entire limb from (away from the camera with a stick to insert the scene), and then we see his torso on the barbecue pit, turning slowly over the fire, and the body has an erection (if you can believe that). Yes, very bad taste, full, disgusting, you have found the right word, and it is probably also suitable. <br /> <br /> Later, Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and all that will be cut off from the neck to the groin, and all its entrails are stretched in graphic joy, and it drains the blood into the pot. Yummy, a real twist on it? <br /> <br /> But the best scene of the blood takes place inside the house, and I must admit that this is one of the best blood gore scenes I have ever seen. This guy (no matter who) caught because of a geek, and cut into ass hole. Freak then puts his hands and pulls out all the guys innards, guts, and what the hell, where else there, right out of his ass. It goes on forever, like the guy screams and more and more interior stowage Dragged across the bathroom. It is so extreme, so on top of that, I found myself laughing all to hell. Obviously, you will never see this scene up to the DVD, the IMO, along with most other really extreme gore scenes. <br /> <br /> So, what to think about all this. Well, first of all, although I doubt that this film will ever be released that completely uncut presentation, it does so «Rough Cut» rare gem for gorehounds. Yes, it's a little difficult at first, no sound track, a few scenes, will continue to be inserted, and loans that have no names everywhere. But that's what makes it so unique, and I would not trade it for anything right now. Extreme blood, yes, extreme extreme gore. This makes «Haute Tension» Disney film look.
