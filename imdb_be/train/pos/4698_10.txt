Just like wine, "Johnny Dangerously" getting better and better every day. It's smart, witty, well acted film is very well able to stand on its own - but as a parody of the gangster genre, it's really remarkable. In fact, it is quite obvious, the best film of its kind ... the funniest parody movies of the crowd, and even the relevant period - although, admittedly, this position is probably easier to achieve if its main competitors such primitive, vulgar and stupid pseudocomedies as "Jane Austen's mafia."
