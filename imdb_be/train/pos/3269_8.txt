Most likely, this is a magical romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd), husband (Christopher McDonald) was killed shortly after learning she was pregnant. Then we see her husband in the sky letting containing know that it was too early, and that his wife needs him. He said that he can return to the ground, but not himself. Remember 19 years, where we see the Shepherd's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) is preparing to graduate from college and met a young man (Robert Downey Jr.), who turns out to be the reincarnation of her father. The film is a little on the predictable side ... the story goes all the places you would expect, but it is so good i plays an energetic cast (especially the Shepherd and Downey), that you can not help but get wrapped up in the fun. Shepherd rarely seen on screen, more usefully, and it is backed by Downey and talented group of character actors in supporting roles. Excellent and charming fantasy that will absorb and captivate you.
