As with most Off You Might Seen from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi Off You May Know Him A good film, but as you saw in the video They M | could have a party at the end, and they just probable, End The Movie with the party of no and the spirits or anything, but on the original (Live TV) if they hung out, but before I say more, when Ben Kenobi dies in Imperial ship or the death Star saw him disappear, and Yoda dies of any age or internal medicine but as Luke had killed Darth Vader (real name: Anakin Skywalker) if they are all celebrating at the end, when Luke or someone stops off Ben spirits and Yoda stands Actors him and smiles during the Spirit which is his Darth Vader, but I do not to the Sith as the Old Normal Selve with him and began to smile with Ben and Yoda I think that made the film the ending a little interesting but manufacturers or someone has to leave did the spirit from Padm√© and Mace Windu and the other Jedis that was killed younglings Under there is a weapon in th e back ground
