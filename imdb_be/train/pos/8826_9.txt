If you are pleased with the straight face of the habits that are logical in this illogical situation, you will enjoy this bizarre 8-minute Spanish film. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. The scene looks normal, but the steward, customers, and two musician seems oddly subdued. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, musicians playing and one man starts to sing the title song, dancing on the table top with the musical comedy of gestures. Customers, on the first fixed at intervals of the chime (bad but safely) with phrases from a song, consider with sheets of paper in his hands. Enabling and disabling they jump and dance (clumsy, but frankly) to dance motions as backing vocalists. <br /> <br /> But why ??? Woman surprised. The answer is revealed as a soloist opens his jacket, and she sees that attached to his chest - just before the explosive climax ... <br /> <br /> Even if you do not catch (probably ironic) lyrics, the situation should give a perfect performance you smile and laugh ... I would like to see it again!
