I agree with "Jerry." This is a very underrated area of ​​the film (of course, like a lot of good low-budget underestimate?) If I remember correctly, the solution to the mystery was a kind of variation (but not "rip-off") in 2001, because the spacecraft control computer was actually a man, which had somehow been transformed into a computer. And the HAL, they tried to turn it "mind", but not the mechanical parts of it, and as with the HAL, it led to disaster. There is at least one interesting moment. If the character Christopher Cary, who can not find any food, finds an abandoned pet bird, there is a kind of sinister moment, but then it is obvious that it is not happening after all.
