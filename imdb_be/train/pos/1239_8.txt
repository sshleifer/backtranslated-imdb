I think the movie was pretty good, will add it to my "collectionÂ» Clasic after all this time. I believe that I have seen other posters, reminiscent of some of discriminating people that until now only in the movies. Maybe some of the more esoteric points of call "logic", but many religious questions are taken "on faith" does not pass the smell test. If you are going to accept that faith you have signed up you can certainly take the film. It's just me or anybody else noticed that Aya-Yee Dagger same demons knife Lamonte Cranston had so many problems gaining control in the "shadows." No mention of it in the section fines for any film here (IMDB), but I would bet a dollar on donut is the same support.
