When I bought my Toy Story tape when he went to the video after the release in theaters, I saw the trailer for it that from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that, I knew it was going to be a good thing! I was right! A Bug's Life, Toy Story is like a great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are dull Rhinoceros Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich Caterpillar voiced at the end of Pixar Storyman Renft. My favorite scene is when a cane Slim (David Hyde Pierce) raises Hemlich trying to distract birds and Hemlich, you hoo, Mr. Early Bird. How about a good-tasting worm on a stick and Sliema as I will break! I tear off! I just died laughing at this stage. Being a big fan of insects, I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar, although I know that many people believe that the worst Pixar movie ever! I do not know how you could hate a movie Pixar! I think they are all very good films! Good work PIXAR!
