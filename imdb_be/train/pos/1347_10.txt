Huge, exhaustive summary and hot American cinema, seen through the eyes of Martin Scorsese. Needless to say, there is never a dull moment in all its 4:00 running time. Many genres, periods and director of all the investigated, discussed more in terms of film fans, not the modern director. For those who are even remotely interested in American movies or a movie as a whole. Masterpiece, and the best of the century in the BFI Film Series. <br /> <br />
