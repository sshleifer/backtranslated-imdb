This film is an unusual and strange, and it is almost unusual and strange in a very good way. I give this short 7 times, because it is so unique and off-the-wall, but most of the time he seems as if he is a fancy for the sake of being strange. If the film has turned out to integrate their more fanciful moments in a kind of story, it would be really fantastic. <br /> <br /> The main problem here is that it looks as if the creators simply mixed together a bunch of crap on the spatula, and then threw in a whole heap more crap that sounded as if it would be funny sounds from the mouth of the spatula. <br /> <br /> This is definitely worth checking out, but this is not the maximum bet on any part of the creators of the wild fantasies.
