I saw this movie once or close to the Year 36 years ago (1969). Although now I can only remember bits of it, I long to see him again. The parts that I remember, right or wrong, include mustard gas in the trenches and Suzy Kendall as a German spy, offering some Bloke sex in the back of a closed truck to obtain military information from him. The score was particularly memorable and stirring emotions in the league Gone with the Wind, and I'd like to hear it again. There must be some kind of commercial or author the reason why this movie is not available. Does anyone know why? I doubt that it has something to do with the lack of quality or interest.
