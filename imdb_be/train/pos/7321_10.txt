Halloween is one of the best examples of independent cinema. It is very well done and has more psychological element to it than you might realize at first glance. This is a simple film told very well. Music is perfect and is one of the most fascinating assessment ... If you have not seen this movie yet, you should check it out. Throw all great. I wish that they had never made a sequel after the continuation. The first of them was the best and had to end, as it was no sequel. It was interesting to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She did not seem to age (she is as magnificent today, without the seventies hairstyles and clothes). Scene through the mask is one of the worst things ever!
