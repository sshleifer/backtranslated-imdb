The nature of the first part of a beautiful story of fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal; the second part of the dramatic story of hatred, revenge and loyalty. Solid script with perfect character development, excellent performances and an amazing troupe direction of Fritz Lang released another epic advance. Margaret Sch impressive overall another woman possessed and inflexibility in their desire for revenge. Costumes worn by Kriemhild is also very impressive, and its action is based on her face and appearance. I was a little disappointed with the reaction of Attila after the death of his only son, as I found it too passive. . My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Nibelungos ?? Parte II: Vingança de Kriemshild" ( "Nibelungen Part II: Kriemhild's Revenge")
