Entries words <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not really! What Madher Bhandarkar brave and brilliant «Page 3" does destroy the myth attached to the glam and high society, that the color of the pages of our newspapers and whose life (read party habits) we go with such a maniacal desire that only our domestic spying band can explain < br /> <br /> page 3 phenomenon as sad as it is mysterious. How exactly does that get such control over the printed word, and when it begins to encroach on the first page is a subject for another debate. Bhandarkar cleverly avoids this. It concerns only the existence of mechanisms of the grotesque. And at the same time, he pieces together the various elements of this lifestyle. Robert Altman (although I do not compare to the genius of Altman Bhandarkar), Bhandarkar uses a myriad of characters to further his motive. Is this page 3 wannabe Siro, shutter-Crashers, newly rich, the forthcoming model, secular politicians or erotic story writer; all the characters are entered for the purpose, and each of them has a separate sign-sketch, even if the parts may be scanty. And therein lies the appeal of the film. <br /> <br /> Concon September Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for the nation today. Initially, the content of their work, she soon begins to see the underbelly of this abomination that covered his fake cosmetic and wasteful. Bhandarkar but resists the temptation to make this theme in moral policing film and avoids focusing on one character alone. Therefore, the film is not only about Madhavi, but equally about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - Editor Madhavi, who passively accepts his role as a cog larger equipment, Ange Thapar (Soni Razdan) - socialite choking on the social environment, Abhijeet (Rehan engineer) - makeup artist and homosexual roommates Madhavi Pearl (Sandhayya Mridula) - Airhostess arrogant and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) -an aspiring actress. It seems like an impossible task to master so many characters (and more) in a single story, but full credit Nina Arora and Manoj Cravings for paddock tight script. Dialogues by Sanjay Dutt and Bhandarkar were written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any story, no matter how good, can fall flat with the absence of these representations. Fortunately, «Page 3 'edges with the actors, not stars. Konkona passes through its back Author roles with effortless ease. The same Bohm. Sandhayya Mridula gets the best written part, but almost overdoes it. Atul Kulkarni is wasted, although with guaranteed nature. Sometimes the director seems too keen to include as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the conditions in which they are used, do not they look rushed. <br /> <br /> In the end, the attempt to Bhandarkar is to saturate our voyeurism, but it goes a step further. He takes us into the photographs and exposes us to the terrible realities of the sect of humanity, oddly enough, seems to live in a different and distant world. These are the same people who were given rampant in the new year, while several hundred kilometers of their compatriots were devastated by the fury of nature! Clever writing, skillfully included songs capable of speech and a real sense of sincerity that makes this film worthy, despite the lack of grace and the poor production values. 'Page 3' is the best way to enter the new year movie <br /> <br /> -.
