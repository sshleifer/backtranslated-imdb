Additional to play at all in the film about the Russian Revolution. However, it is not any ordinary optional. He Serguis Alexander, former commander of the Russian army general, who are being forced to relive the same scene, which he suffered professional and personal tragedy to meet the director, who once was a revolutionary in Russia and humiliated Alexander. Now it may be time for this broken man finally "win" his penultimate fight. This is one powerful film with a meticulous focus on background Sternberg, providing the greatest irony in the character of Alexandra in every way he can. Jennings earned an Oscar for the role of a very exciting performance plays a whole at its peak, and in its deep valley. Powell gives ominous support as directed by the thinking of revenge and Brent perfect in her role from her face and movements, showing much expression as the love of Jennings. Everything shine. Rating 10.
