What a waste flow director Emile Ardolino was! He could take the easy script and with the right casting and editing, to put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star. This particular star may not be the brightest in the sky as big romances go, but it is certainly one that keeps you tuned to the end. Do you really want to know how things will work. <br /> <br /> scenario is ideal for Cybill Shepherd, who at the time needed to capitalize on its «Moonlighting» success for the new generation, which was (fortunately for her), probably do not know how many large screen main duds she had after a very promising start. In this film it every bit back to form as still misses widow living indirectly through her daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson at the peak of fame, which will peak with "Fried Green Tomatoes" two years later). Perhaps she looked too young for the role but it works well on the way the story unfolds. this is her movie, but she will not cross its borders, such as lead. <br /> <br /> Shepherd graciously allows Robert Downey Jr. to bear most of the film and shows a more mature comic talent, than he had in his previous films at this point. And there are enough support from Ryan O'Neal (in his best role in years) and Christopher McDonald. natural charm Masterson's pretty much the coasts of itself, or that, or she has a way to make her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every word. <br /> <br /> Ardolino makes good use of his sex appeal to the throw the same way he did with "Dirty dancing", but this movie is not quite as hiss, so you can still watch with their parents when they were in room. (Use your best judgment, they are your parents after all.) I give this film high praise, because it is very comfortable, romantic comedy enthusiasts will find the sublime, and those who just look together with them have to find a lot of humor to enjoy from as well. <br /> <br /> Again, the merit of Emile Ardolino to create the most beautiful script and Randy Perry Howze. (Where are they now?) Ardolino's next film would be called for "Three Men and a Baby," but his last theatrical release (Sister Act) finally give him a nine-shaped box-office hit that he deserved. Mr. Ardolino, your cinematic touch is missing!
