If you loved the Long Way Round, you will enjoy it nearly as much. It is educational, funny, interesting and tense. Charlie shared the screen with two interesting teammates, tired two mechanics, two prominent cameramen and too many tiers. Ewan makes few appearances, but Charlie really pulls it alone. He was funny, engaging and even a puddle of stress and doubt. Great stuff! <br /> <br /> The series wraps up at 7 episodes. As LWR, the drug is almost as interesting as the race. Although they cover all the ins and outs of the race well, there may be a little more explanation of trucks and cars that only specified and even rarely seen race. This is a motorcycle movie, albeit one on two wheels will love this. <br /> <br /> The series features great photos, as well as several interviews peoples mouths. Slave. There is another very catchy song as LWR, but this one is not as good as the Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the United States God knows when it will be released so buy it on Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer, like me. Oh, and be prepared to buy another motorcycle.
