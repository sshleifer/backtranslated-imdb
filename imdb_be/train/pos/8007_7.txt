This game is very addictive, I went on to play for a few hours straight until late at night, but also the fact that you can not save the game if you're in the area contributed to this, and sometimes I just had to play not to lose all the data games. <br /> <br /> So, yes, "Freelancer" is addictive, but also very wrong. In addition, for example, is something that really bothers me is that you can not miss any of the cut scenes with the result that sometimes you had to watch for the same time a little cut scene minutes after the time. A great opportunity for me to multitask, to check their email or chat with friends and more things like that, while I had to wait until the cut scene is over. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a promising, but the further you get more ridiculous it all becomes. In addition, the game also ends fairly steep, at least, he did it for me. It is obvious that they hint at the upcoming sequel. I do not know when the sequel in the works at the moment, but I am sure that most likely, I will choose one as soon as it comes out. <br /> <br /> The gameplay is very easy! Even for those who are not familiar with the game of the flight. To put it boldly, every fool can play this game. So, some of the levels are quite complex and require a lot of effort. It took me about 1-2 weeks for me to finish this game, which can be a bit too short. But thank God for the multi-player option! This allows you to continue to play a short mission, as well as a single game, once you have finished the way. <br /> <br /> While many of the missions are the same, it just stays cool to be in the middle of the time of mass fights. <br /> <br /> The graphics are good, but not anything revolutionary or anything. <br /> <br /> addictive game, but beware of its flaws. <br /> <br /> 7/10
