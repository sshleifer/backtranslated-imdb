I have never commented on a film before. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. I read the comments, saying that the film stays with you. He does. It's been almost 24 hours and I'm still completely affected. This film left me in doubt his own personality. How can I compare myself with the character, such as Ben, who is completely selfless. I loved this movie. I love movies that keep me guessing and not interesting until the end. I feel two emotions mostly happiness and sadness. A strange feeling good film and very sad, too. I like Ben and Emily, to be together, but in the end, they were good. If you have not seen this movie, get it and see it. Just make sure that you have no distractions. You want to see every detail in this picture. One of my library.
