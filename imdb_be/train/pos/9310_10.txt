wow, how can I even discuss this film without tears coming to my eyes? It was certainly the highlight of my year - no - my life. As if Raptor schedule was not amazing enough, the editor of awards continued to use the same frame throughout the film, even if the background is actually not the same scene settings. Wow, what a genius. And while the film is full of plot holes (for example, some clips type of animal T-Rex, where the raptor should be another key moment when the Popes is a torture chamber, shouting "Colin's a girl!" And runs out) I will never forget the glitter, that Raptor Planet. Thank Sci-Fi for another classic.
