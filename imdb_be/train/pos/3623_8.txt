Disney may just be on to something here. Firstly, they were "Remember the Titans" with Denzel, a story based on truth involving sports and small town in Central America. Now that Quaid and rookie ... another sports story based on truth. <br /> <br /> Both films will move you to tears again, and both will make you smile and feel all the heat after a meeting with them. My wife and I picked a rookie, and we expect it will be a great feel good type of film. We did not let down, when he was asked if we will buy it on DVD, when it comes out, it was not a no-brainer. Most definitely.
