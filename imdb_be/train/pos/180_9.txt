If Gundam0079 became a trilogy, most of us know, a lot of it was the action itself and less of everything else. This OVA is sort of the opposite. Although you are only a half-dozen episodes, it is not filled with action, but the emotional stuff. Two major action sequences in this, I believe, enough to satisfy me. After watching so many Gundam series, movies and the OVAs, I was fully prepared to civil-squire film. This film did a fantastic job with this. What makes this film released that shows both sides of the war, there are good and bad people. This made Zeons seems more human, rather than the original film, where they are depicted as the second ascent of evil Nazis. Most people who do not like anime that I have to watch this movie (laughs), like this. So I would recommend it to a lot of people, only for the anti-war history. If you Gundam fan and have not seen it, you should not read it; You should already see right now.
