I want to warn you that there is a very bitter quality to this comment. In addition, this comment will be much more meaningful to you after you've seen the movie. <br /> <br /> While tragically sad to say that the film has similarities with my life, so amazing, it's really scary. The rest of you will never know how exactly what the film shows how people who have been in situations like this act and react in advanced life <br /> <br /> It can not be artistic. it should have been based on personal experience. <br /> <br /> My testament to how well the film was shown by the fact that, although it was one of the best films I've ever seen, watching my life portrayed on the silver screen was so searingly painful experience, I'll never see him again. <br /> <br /> But I support him wholeheartedly all others as an opportunity to look into the soul of another person to the extent that you probably have never experienced before or will ever be again. I know that, in fact, because it's my soul you will follow-up.
