"Cinderella" is one of the most beloved of all the Disney classics. And it really deserves its status. Based on the classic fairy tale as told by Charles Perrault, the test film and tribulations of Cinderella, a good girl who mistreated her evil stepmother and stepsisters are equally unpleasant. If the royal ball held and all eligible young women invited (read: the king wants to marry a prince), Cinderella left at home while her stepmother took her daughter with her horrible. But there is a fairy in the hands ... <br /> <br /> The history of "Cinderella" by itself will not inflate in particular, as well as generally staying true stories otherwise quite random animal characters, which uses the well fairy, to help get the name of the symbol to the ball Cinderella become real pal. Mice and Gus Jacques are the main sidekick, and their own nemesis be stepmother cat Lucifer. Their antics are usually interwoven with the main fairy story, and for the most part excellent. It should be recognized that the film is really a bit slow between the main characters and the introduction shortly before half-sisters go for the ball, but after this recession, the film really gets going again and suddenly (after "Cinderella" is the most worn-out story of all time, probably ) ends up as one of the most Disney-related stories. <br /> <br /> animation and art direction is outstanding. All the legendary Nine Old animated at this picture, and Mary Blair color design and concept art (she also did concept art and color style for "Alice in Wonderland," "Peter Pan," "The Three Caballeros" and many, many others) manage to wiggle their way to the screen. Colors and designs are beautiful, especially in the scenes of fairies and ball, as well as in quite a few points here and there. <br /> <br /> In general, the "Cinderella" is considered one of the best Disney fairy- tales and comes recommended for young and everything that embodies the philosophy of Disney, that dreams really do come true.
