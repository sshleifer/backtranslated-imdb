After watching the "break a leg" in Vancouver in the release party, I thought it was a very enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> I had a few laughs right abdomen and some of the cameos (Eric Roberts in particular) began to shout. I have not heard a single word about the actual release date, although I've heard that it's close. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but mostly a vehicle for the characters and situations. The script is smooth and seamless, the story develops quickly and conveniently acting fresh. This film has won at least one award from each of the festivals he was in, which is about 10 -. 15 or <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend "break a leg."
