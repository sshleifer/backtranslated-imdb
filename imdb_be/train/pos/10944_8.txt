Sarah Silverman Program is ... better than those other shows. A lot of laugh track, no morbid jokes, just a program. Sarah Silverman Program. If you're like me and you love comedy, this is probably the show for you. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman brings because it's funny, and right-here-funny table with ease. The combination of different styles, making it their own. <br /> <br /> This program is not what you want to start a war to compare with, seeing as it has absolutely nothing to do with them (other shows), this show is his own person, and I I think that most of the comedies of the head like this is just great. <br /> <br /> Go look and see.
