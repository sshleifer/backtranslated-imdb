Absolute classic !! The direction is flawless, the acting is simply gorgeous. The word do not hold out for this great work. Most definitive film about Mumbai police. This film has stood the test of times. <br /> <br /> Om Puri does not give a stellar performance, Patil, no less. All the actors did their best and movie exciting races on you at any moment. This film track all your being bad and makes you rethink about the many problems facing our society. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the police (Om Puri), who started his career as an honest man, but eventually degenerates into a killer. The first attempt in Bollywood, to get behind the scenes and put a depressing truth about the Mumbai police. Kudos Nihalani !! <br /> <br /> After this film, to kill those Bollywood movies got released that revealed the criminal-politician nexus police. Thus, this film really was a trendsetter. This trend dominated the cinema scene in Hindi for over a decade. <br /> <br /> This film was a moderate box office hit. <br /> <br /> A must see for the discerning film fans.
