Alan Rudolph's "Breakfast of Champions" slides into theaters with little fanfare and much ridicule it makes me think that in 1996, when Keith Gordon "Mother Night" was released. Now, all the talk about Kurt Vonnegut be «unfilmable» it is surprising that it has received two remarkable cinematic treatment (other "slaughterhouse Five"). "Mother Night" is definitely one of the most underrated films of the decade, and I can not understand why. That's fine! He is almost completely true book Vonnegut (without being unnatural or overly literary) and adds to it the poetry, which is a purely cinematic. How many adaptations of the work of any author can argue that? Vonnezhim even put himself in a cameo near the end of the movie, and you can ask for a better endorsement than? This is not only a beautiful film, it's great acting, wrote and directed the film, and it is one of my favorites for the top five or so American films of the 1990s. It's sad, inspired, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected. I sincerely urge all to see "Mother Night" - it does not even take a tour to the Vonnegut to fully appreciate it (as a "massacre five" sometimes does). It is a powerful piece of film acting.
