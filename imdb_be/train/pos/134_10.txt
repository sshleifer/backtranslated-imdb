Someone to release the film on DVD, so it can take its hallowed place as one of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years, when critics and film historians look back on so-called films of the 1990s and see how meaningless they have been for more part, and Lars von Trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece. As it stands, «Zentropa» (or «Europa», as it is known outside the United States) is one of the most interesting and artistic views of gloom and almost psychotic uncertainties that arise from the aftermath of World War II in Europe, namely exterminated German landscape whose physical horrors were matched only harm the psyche of the people. Von Trier clearly draws its vision on the screen. You'll feel like you're watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940s with very lit black-and-white scenes, while at the same time it seems that you are on the verge of something behind the cutting edge, especially in the scenes as murder on board the train. Literally, when you see this movie, you have witnessed the evolution of the art form. <br /> <br /> For some reason, von Trier was captured in its motion dogma shortly thereafter. And while his "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" is a classic in its own right, that is, "Zentropa", he really picked up the art of making films to new and exciting heights. 10/10, age, like good wine, and asks for the DVD release.
