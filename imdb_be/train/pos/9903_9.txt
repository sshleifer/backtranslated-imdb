Wow, praise IMDb and the Google, because I was trying to remember the name of this f'ing amazing film for over 15 years. Slaughter High, man! Hells yeah! <br /> <br /> I will not bore you with a short story, and the actors, and Yadda Yadda Yadda, because you all know what happened. That's why you're here anyway. What will I do, however, explain the loving memory I have of that quintessential 80-D-Movie joint shredder. <br /> <br /> In 1987, when I was about 7 years old, my father rent all these horror movies. Will he not care that his children were watching them with him? No. So, in this young age, I saw Slaughter High. What I saw in this film stuck with me big time. I have not seen him since, but I still remember the most absurd murders in the film. For example, after the sex scenes (why is there a metal bed in school?) Gets electric current. Or, the guy drowned in the pool th tax. Come on! My personal favorite, though ... explode stomach from spoiled beer. Amazing! How can you truly hate the movie where one of the characters is a beer in an abandoned school, like, 10 or 15 years later, and thinks that it would be a good idea to drink? Then his stomach explode? What? And it's a great line: Let's take my car ... it always starts. Classic shit all the way. <br /> <br /> I mean, I look back almost 20 years, and laugh at him. But when I was 7, I was scared sh! Tless. This jester hat (or a mask?), That the killer rock around freaked me e * ck over! <br /> <br /> In general, yes, dirty film. But nostalgia factor and humor purposes, this movie gets 9 out of 10 from me. Either stay every night, real late, and I hope to catch it on the Late Late Late show the film, or to track down a copy of the VHS and dust from your VCR.
