I saw it as many times as I could, before he left the stage. Beautiful and entertaining film with some of my favorite stars. Only I wish I could find it again! I will, of course, to buy / see if I could. Please, someone, get it back. McMurray was committed in its role as a patriot during the Second World War, and its leading home, Joan Leslie, and especially June Haver were beautiful and charming. It was music, but also romantic, funny and smart. It was my favorite movie, starring June HAVER, although I have always loved her. Her dazzling smile lit up the screen, and her beauty and talent were an asset of any film. The supporting cast has lent their individual roles. Well-balanced and light-hearted film; just I wish we had more like it!
