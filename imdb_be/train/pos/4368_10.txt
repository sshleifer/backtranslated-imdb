This is a very interesting and romantic movie. I saw him a few times and never get bored with it. Everything is real, and it's a good story. Actors perfectly Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> I like the movie Braveheart, like Braveheart contain so many historical misstakes. There are many exciting scenes - to monitor the bridge scene and the last fencing scene. It's really good and amazing scenes. <br /> <br /> music is beautiful ... it's really suitable for the film. Setting the country.
