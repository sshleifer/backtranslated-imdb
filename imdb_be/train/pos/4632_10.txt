Directed and co-written by Eytan Fox, writer / director of the highly acclaimed 2002 feature mini "Yossi & Jagger" (2002). This comparative epic in 1Hr 53 minutes, is another great romantic drama in which we have to deal with the tragedy, as well as celebrate the beauty and joy in life. Westerners, especially the urban gay men, like me, need to be moved outside our zone of security and to be informed about the real life and death struggle in the other place, to be able to love justice. <br /> <br /> While the "Yossi and Jagger" is focused on a pair of gay lovers locked in within the Israeli military service, "Ha-Buah" focuses on a group of civilian friends, both straight and gay people who share unit in the center of Israel at all gay tolerate, but do not always gay capital of Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> «Ha Buah" offers a dramatic border checkpoint scene in which Noam (Ohad Knoller ?? Yossi with "Yossi & Jagger") first meets a handsome young Arab Ashraf (Yusf Sueid). Romance blooms in the near future ?? but that the political climate opportunities should be seized quickly or lost altogether. <br /> <br /> From here we walk intricate interaction between the members and the people of fans and the inevitable effect of a very conservative family Ashraf. If you follow the dialogue of the film closely enough, you will not have any reason to be disappointed with the ending. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack to "Ha Buah» is dynamic and visually beautiful and harsh ?? that is, in real life in the Middle East. <br /> <br /> English subtitles are very easy to follow and you will quickly relax and appreciate the world cinema at its best.
