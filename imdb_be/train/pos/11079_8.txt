I always love to see movies that make you think, instead of just dropping the answers to these audiences. "Revolver" is one of those films, and although many observers have stated that it is difficult to follow, with a bit of concentration and an open mind, I got it. For the first time. However, it does not compare with other mental shit like "The Usual Suspects" and "Memento", but in its own right and its intellectual reflection film. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really liked about this movie is pretty damn it. Every scene, every camera angle, it seems, was the thought of centuries. If you see it you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So to conclude ... watch it with an open mind, and you can enjoy it. If not, well, no one ever said, "Revolver" for everyone. And here's my 2 cents.
