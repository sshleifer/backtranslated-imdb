In August 1980, the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain in accordance trial of her parents Linda and Michael on suspicion of the murder of a child caused an uproar around what was then very angry people. The media and the public have already been convicted and accused the pair were out for blood. This was followed by a gross miscarriage of justice. <br /> <br /> Michael and Linda Chamberlain argued that while camping near Ayers Rock, central Australia, the dingo that took them ten weeks daughter from his tent as they were preparing to have a barbecue in the area. Nobody believed him. Linda has been charged with the murder of her child, and Michael, as an accessory after the fact. The whole country is abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing. The trial of Chamberlain was over before it began. <br /> <br /> Lindy never proved his innocence, so that she was found guilty. There has never been enough evidence to charge her, but the jury was swayed by public and media pressure. How could we as a nation even to sit in the court? From where we are, how we could possibly presume to know? If there was no absolute proof, and no reasonable doubt that Chamberlain should be acquitted. <br /> <br /> The film Skepisi in clearly and wholeheartedly supports the argument of the novel by John Bryson, that Chamberlain had been completely innocent to the charges against them. It is actually a dingo was to take the baby Azaria that fateful night at Ayers Rock. <br /> <br /> Schepisi brilliantly captured the mood of the blood thirsty nation possessed the "truth" is brought to light. It shows in Australia rather indecent light as people who have been completely obsessed with seeing to pay Chamberlain! His script, co-written with Robert Caswell, vigorously evokes emotions and probably find an audience frustrated and angered travesty of justice that occurred. <br /> <br /> The outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the worst of the acts. It brings to life the most convincingly tough little Australian who was willing to stand up to the allegations and to establish a world straight. Even her accent is almost, but not quite in place. Very good effort to master this trade. Sam Neill is as good as the Strip, as in the first of the faithful, but then became disillusioned with Michael, who can not understand why their world is falling apart, and he begins to doubt his Christianity. He, like Streep, is a demonstration of great emotional force that will move you deeply. All support cast is also excellent, with some of the best actors and actresses of Australia plays a role. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is brilliant as a director of photography Ian Baker capturing this great land with glitter (especially Rock). Editor Jill Bilkok holds the whole film is very intense and emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton provides a clear account. <br /> <br /> For all Australians, this is a must see, shocking look in the mirror, if you will, on what we as a country made for a family who wanted justice served, and the truth to be known. As Michael Chamberlain, "I do not think anyone really understands what it means innocence ..... innocent people." <br /> <br /> On Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video <br /> <br /> Even at the expense of return Visits Skepisi parody of justice that befell the eunuchs, who have lost a child Azarov Ayres Rock in 1980, according to -prezhnemu emotionally powerful and honest move. <br /> <br /> Schepisi and Robert Caswell are professionally translated novel by John Bryson on the screen, saying a simple horror story about a vacation gone horribly wrong for Michael and Linda Chamberlain, whose newborn daughter Azaria was taken on the form of family tent Dingo moments after being crushed. <, Br /> <br /> Among the media speculation and a vicious public hearing Lindy was accused of killing her baby and Michael was charged as an accessory after the fact. What followed was a little more than the court of the media, as well as with the Australian people decided that it will be clean, Linda was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor, even if the charge can not imagine any motives and personal but circumstantial evidence. <, Br /> <br /> Meryl Streep in the best shape as the accused woman that fights Australia head to prove his innocence. It is really awesome, and one thing that can not be her true blue Aussie accent, although she does her level best sound Ocker. You may ask why a top Australian actress was not cast in the role, but the star power is probably the answer. Along with Meryl is just as impressive, Sam Neill, outstanding as a man who sees his world is falling apart before his eyes, while he feels unable to do anything about it. Strong Aussie dropped to lend convincing support. <br /> <br /> Editing Jill Bilkoka is very timely, cinematography She Baker rocks and other rocky places visually bright and the music of Bruce Smeaton ideal for this role. . Indeed mandatory for all bona fide Australians <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
