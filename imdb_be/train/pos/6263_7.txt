The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a compelling documentary about the migration tribe Bahtiyarte Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals crossing rivers and mountains, to get to the pasture. You'll feel like a spoiled wimp to drive their animals through the icy water after seeing these people and walk barefoot in the snow to cross the mountains, trying to get their animals to walk on the steep and narrow mountain trails.
