Jerome Crabbe plays a leading role in this film. I saw this film in 6 times, and I'm still not tired. This film is similar to the Flesh + Blood in a sense. Gerald Soetman great writer. He wrote all Dutch films of Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I've seen all his movies all except Showgirls. My mom does not like it so much, but I do not agree. I think that all of his films go see especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith did some of his films, which include Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I want Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different, but still nice.
