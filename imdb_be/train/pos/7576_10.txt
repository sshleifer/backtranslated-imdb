The third and final part of the «Hanzo Razor" is the most specific ones. "Education" will even be completed within the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film details Hanzo investigation on usury is performed in order of blind monks. It also makes a historical commentary to the proud rejection of the old Japan to incorporate Western technology. If the first film Hanzo was ridiculous and the mountains to ride with little communication with this story, «Hanzo 3: Who won the Gold" manages to combine everything and brings it all home in the end. Definitely a perfect ending. Oh yeah, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there is a lot of unnecessary blood and violence (it * is * Razor Hanzo eventually).
