The channel 4 is a channel that allows more cranky material than any of the other channels, the show was certainly mischievous one. Leading this sometimes gross adult talk shows, four BAFTA Awards and the British Comedy Award win (also twice nominated) Graham Norton was just the perfect host for the gay-good shows like this. It was one or more well-known celebrities in the middle. They basically had the idea for the adults who are either rude, humiliate or humor guest, but some of them are not for the faint of heart. They had women playing the recorder with its parts, people use their cocks to play the xylophone, the women were laughing up in the bath, in men with or without pants under their kilts, and many other gross but funny ideas. This is only for adults, but also to enjoy it! He won a BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment (Program or Series), he won the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Entertainment program (also nominated), Best comedy talk show, he won an Emmy for episode # 18 (?), And he won the national television awards double the most popular talk show. It was number 52 on the 100 Greatest funny moments. Very good!
