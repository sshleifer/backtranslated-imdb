It seems more than strange that such a complete dreck like "The Dukes of Hazzard" and "The Hills Have Eyes" (new version), you can find a DVD-sharers, and the old - and far superior to the product, such as the movie - nowhere to be found . With all the ongoing debate about the morality (or lack thereof) of war, as well as interest in espionage (consider cartoonist Jack Ryan, Bourne, XXX, and "Mission: Impossible" productions, it would seem an obvious choice for release on DVD. However, it looks like one thousand nine hundred sixty-eight film, because it is the opinion of one thousand nine hundred sixty-eight movie. But style aside, this is still a production that actually have something valuable to say, and has many plots twists to keep the audience amused. If nothing others, will anyone ever la ka consider getting the soundtrack at some drive, whether it's a compilation with other Morricone music or as a stand-alone. I do not know when the industry people bother to read what we fans have to. say about their products, but if you are reading this and other comments, please take us seriously, we are paying for your generous at home with our hard-earned dollars spent on tickets, DVD and CD - to give us what we want all that said! If you are reading this and have not seen this movie, to lobby for his release, so you can see that those of us who have seen it say. You will not be disappointed.
