When I heard Patrick Swayze was finally back to his acting career with the Lo King Solomon I was very excited. I got a big Indiana Jones type adventures. What I got was 4:00 long (with commercials) epic, which was very slow. The second and third hour could have released the whole story and would not have suffered for it. The ending is good (no spoilers here), but I still want more. All right, a guy can do is sacrifice, which makes Swayze Â«ROADHOUSE 2", so that he could return to the action genre that made him famous. Yes, than when your a fan of King Solomon's Mines, than reading a book or playing version of one thousand nine hundred eighty-five with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is also not very good, but its only an hour and forty minutes of life have gone instead of 4 hours.
