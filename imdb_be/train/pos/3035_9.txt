MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great man ?? General Douglas MacArthur. This, of course, the story of one of the greatest military leaders of America, and a figure familiar to me from the earliest moments in my memory. Although there is a problem of continuity (there may be others), for example, speech MacArthur portrayed in the film, as well as his 1962 address at the US Military Academy, accepting the award Thayer does not contain the phrase "old soldiers never die, they just fade away." (It was in his speech to the congress after his dismissal by President Truman) in 1951 on suspicion of disobedience (the two do not see eye to eye!) Gregory Peck Peck im-state as the General, who promised that he would return to the Philippines during the second world war. The film quickly and easily move camping with the general, his family and his staff from the beginning of the Second World War to the end of his service career. The film will have a much greater significance to one familiar with both World War II and the Korean War. Still, the image Pekka this great man, who fought two disasters fascism and communism, and who hated war as only a soldier can be a memorable one for sure. "In war there is no substitute for victory."
