Two years later, and basically everything looks different, some for good and for worse. I still enjoy as much as I did the original, though. <br /> <br /> Some of the disadvantages they had, though, as the Joker changes it no longer has red lips and looks more blackish hair and black pupils, he's still voiced by Mark Hamill, which is a plus, I think. They have done more white Poison Ivy hinting that it is becoming more like a plant and Catwomen looks very different and not as "attractive", as it was in the original. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and Scarecrow look badass, especially bogey. <br /> <br /> show is not as dark as the original, because Batman does not work alone, like he used to. Most of the time working with the new Batgirl and Robin, Tim Drake. While Nightwing (Dick Grayson) comes in often. Batman logo has issued a yellow and black wings on his suit and it seems that it has become a bit more, but still tons of ass legs. <br /> <br /> The show is not as good as the original is mainly due to updated some of the characters, but the story is as exciting as ever and the dialogue remains an elite. "On Edge" can be one of the greatest episodes of Batman ever so make sure you check it out. <br /> <br /> In general 8-9 / 10
