There have been many Zorro films made for decades, but it's a shame that one of the best, probably one of the least seen. <br /> <br /> Fighting Legion Zorro is a little different from other Zorro movies. First, it is consistent republic in 12 sections. And this time, Zorro does not play the top stars studio as Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but instead, a workman, as an actor Reed Hadley. While Headley does not cast as a strong presence during the proceedings, like others, he does an adequate job, helped by the fact that he was not the only hero here; as the name implies, it has a fighting legion to call. <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that setting sun of California. History takes place here in central Mexico in 1824, when a man makes as a living god incites the native Indian population and a band of criminals to help him in his plan to overthrow the newly created Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro, and several followers are planning to do something that they can stop. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, there is at least one point in the incredibly cheesy episode of template «Twang» onion funny sound effects in action. But overall, this is one of the best series of all time, and probably the best one Zorro. <br /> <br /> The plot is stronger than most TV shows and never becomes unclear or meander, and there's a lot more action -. moviegoers Indiana Jones notice many bits borrowed from this series.
