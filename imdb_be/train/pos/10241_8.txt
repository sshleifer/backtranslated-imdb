I try not to take the IMDb ratings to the heart, but I was amazed when I saw a rating of 5.4 to one of my childhood favorites. It does not wow me as much as 17 years, but as a family film, it's sweet and well-meaning movie. Children will surely love it and will not mind the shortcomings, and adults can guess the actor for each character and enjoy the subliminal message of the film. None of the film was not morality in any way, in fact it has a great message, which is added to its sweetness. I admit, however, that history is on the thin side, and some scenes as Screweyes death (which still excites me), maybe a little on the scary side. But the animation is well above average with good color and good character animation. Music by James Horner is very beautiful, and the song featured a memorable, catchy and fun. I really liked the characters, of Louie, is probably the most profound of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least interesting. clown Martin Short was both cheerful and clear, the part where he says Screweyes Â«I quit!" in my path. My favorite Screweyes although effective villain who is crafty, and I think smart. If anything, though, I want the film is stored in the part where he explains how he lost his eye, and why he is afraid of the crows, because, as he could have been more developed in terms of depth. The script, not Oscar worthy, has its funny and heart-warming part, and the need to keep children and adults entertained. The voice acting for me was what made the movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendal and Yeardley Smith all gave solid performances, but any special needs to go, Kenneth Mars, it was absolutely delicious as the Screweyes and almost unrecognizable. Overall, this is a good movie. I do not get the rating to be honest, I do not. Of course, this film is not perfect, and it's not as good as a dinosaur movie, such as The Land Before Time, but it's good fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
