I'm surprised by the work of Jim Carrey. I keep getting this movie stuck in my head. Grinch sympathy March-May, Cindy Lou (which is very annoying, its sweet innocence), who is trying to get the Grinch in the Christmas spirit, childhood Grinch, and besides a faint apparent end of Christmas ISN Â»(very funny!) T all about gifts. I must say that I felt stupid move out of the theater with a bunch of babies and toddlers, laughing, and so on, but the film was a good full lengthed tuning Dr.Seuss and shorts for all ages.
