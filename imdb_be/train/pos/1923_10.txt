8 Simple Rules were auspicious start. The highly talented Tom Shadyac participated in the project. This meant that the comedy will not be anything less than spectacular, and that's exactly what happened: the show is one of the freshest, funniest, witty show made for a very long time. Each line, facial expression, choice of casting, stage, all sow goodness. There's not a single episode, after which I thought, "Man, that was not as good as the others." Each of them was outstanding. Again, this kind of perfectionism that we've come to expect from Tom. For those who do not know Tom Shadyac is the director of Ace Ventura (first film) The Nutty professor (the first) and a liar, liar, pretty recover producer it is not a director, but his magic touch is felt in every episode.The family consists of:.. < br /> <br /> Father: Paul Hennessy (John Ritter): nice, slightly neurotic, it can be a weakling from time to time, working as a sports writer, John, unfortunately. Ameur in 2003, leaving a fond memory and is almost certain that the cancellation of contemplation costume <br /> <br /> Mother :. Cate (Saga): Come on, who does not fall in love with Kate if she played Peg on Married With Children? al Bundy was our hero. We the audience gave him the respect and love he never had. But without the carefree, parasitic, lazy way of Pega life would be al, was probably just another Chicago father instead of clutter that Peg (life, actually) made him to be. Kate MILF ago and still is: Brune now (instead of red), and just as strong as ever. Cate is a conservative mother and a loving wife. I know it sounds boring, but comedically, it is ideal. <br /> <br /> Ditzy Blonde Daughter: Bridget (played to perfection Kaley Cuoco) is almost never an idiot playing so well. Aside Gob on Arrested Development, Brigitte could well be in the shoes of any prizes awarded in this archetype. Bridget shallow, self-centered, not very bright and a bit slutty in his eyes. She plays the role of dumb blondes are better than absolutely any MMO. Perfection. One of the high points of the show <br /> <br /> Overlooked Geeky daughter :. Kerry (Amy Davidson) and Brun and ugly, it does not receive the love of life or circumstances. Included attention underestimated and neglected most of the time. She is the younger sister Brigitte (in fact, she is older than her), and two very opposite personalities and brain cause endless collisions, make the most of our entertainment <br /> <br /> The son :. Rory (Martin Spenzhers) was the second funniest character MI before making Ritter, and then John goes, new characters come and Rory is not a wise cracking verbal firebrand that before: what went mostly character David Spada. <br /> <br /> These characters were the chief of them while John Ritter. enough, unfortunately, incredibly cheerful Larry Miller (one of my favorite) did not get much screen time. He played Paul's companion / competitor. After dissection of the cost of his life Ritter in 2003 (11 September), the show was paused for a while. No one thought that it might come back, but it was later, with a couple of new additions. This is the second stage of the show, and new characters: <br /> <br /> A strict, confident school: Ed (Adam Arkin): I've seen Adam here and there on a talk show. It was the first time I've seen him do anything. Vulnerable is the word I use. His speech was very impressive. Sadly he was not brought in earlier. It also plays a potential love interest Cate after Paul passes. Gradual progress at this point (which has already sounded crazy at the beginning) is the creators of much praise. This was done slowly, carefully and well, with constant respect paid Paul (Ritter) <br /> <br /> The relationship grandfather :. Jim Egan (James Garner): strangely a welcome addition to the series, he was cannon fodder for endless "old" jokes, basically, ... <br /> <br /> 35-year-old unemployed wise cracking brother-mom: CJ ( played insanely ridiculous height David spade), I knew that the shovel was funny, I just did not know what it was that funny. Anyway, a very familiar presence Spada felt inside his character (unlike separable character), which is understandable, since it is a comedian and he's on a comedy show. It's a horrible feeling kind of like seeing someone learn a lot of stuff from David Spade performances in the movies, talk shows and functions (award shows, etc.) and delivery of voice and the perfect embodiment of Recession comedy style, except that it's a shovel. By this I mean you know that he is not trying to play someone else, or a brand-new character: he is blunt, funny Spade, we came to know, and it takes it's nice humorous formula absolute top. Each line, he said, every sarcasm he became the father of all the classic, literally. Spade was CRAZY-funny; Yes, that's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> show humor and drama, both increased after the show was back, but the audience thought, "John was, he was not going to be the same again." This is understandable, given that we are talking about a group of people (American audiences), who gave the "Yes dear," free ride, but caused Andy Richter Controls the Universe to be canceled at short notice. As you increase the quality of the show, the ratings fell. Soon he was no more, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> And I saved the best for last: Married lovers with children during treatment. And boy, what a treat it was. I'm still shaking just remember it. It's strange, so good, that it would be crazy for me to spoil it, even if I legally do so under the "spoiler ..." pretexts. Suffice it to say that this is something that you will never forget. I know that I will not :-)
