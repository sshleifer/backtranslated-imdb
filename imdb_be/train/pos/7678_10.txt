I just watched Holly with another film about human trafficking and sexual exploitation of children under the trade name on the international film festival of the sea. I have to say that Holly blew trade out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and surprising film on many different levels. From a purely artistic and cinematic point of view, it's weird. Sound mixing angles, directing and acting are all in place. <br /> <br /> In addition, it handles the subject with taste and not operational. It is the issue of sexual exploitation of children in a way that is both educational and accurate. The filmmakers paid a number of exquisite attention to detail, really capturing the nuances of the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and human trafficking. Too often, when dealing with a subject of this kind, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly is able to achieve all this without falling into this typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching the hall into two separate festivals, when the United States and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never seen an audience more moved. Just listen to the talk after the screening, people ask what they personally can do to combat the sexual exploitation of children. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend it to everyone for their cinematic value and its subject.
