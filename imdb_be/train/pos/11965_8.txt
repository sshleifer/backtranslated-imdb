Reading a wide range of "scoop" reviews over the past few days, I went to the theater prepared for the irregular release of Woody. Fortunately, I could not be more wrong. Of course, Woody singer slows down a touch or two, but Woody writer / director is in great shape - and found a reliable way to integrate its 70-year history in itself. Judging by the laughter and laughter, the audience ate severity and Elena dialogue in a way that I had not seen for several years. <br /> <br /> In the film, the landscape is dominated by software approved by the story arcs, Twentysomething tastes and conveyor tariff formula for children, and is a source of pleasure and inspiration to see Allen spends his very personal and still rewarding way.
