Once you see, Vertigo, and then watch Bell, Book and Candle, made within a few months of each other. <br /> <br /> My second favorite movie with Kim Novak Picnic, coming as the third. <br /> <br /> The three big appearances, Vertigo, is the best of all. <br /> <br /> They came to me anywhere downtown Kansas prairie, near, in Salina, Kansas in the 50 years to remove the picnic. <br /> <br /> Bell, Book and Candle score, I believe it is one of Alex North. Perfect for this little comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak made this comedy is amusing to note the sharp contrast. <br /> <br /> It is worth your time if you like Kim Novak. Greta Garbo of my youth.
