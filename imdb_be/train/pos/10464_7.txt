For all of you who do not speak Swedish Swedish [original] title of the film; «Rånarna» means something in the "robbers" line. This fact is the main problem I have with the film, because it is not really about the robbers at all. It is about a young woman who works at the Swedish police investigating the robbery. Regular sedentary work one might think, but this girl is quickly go on the field, taking matters into their own hands, as the story goes, even shooting one of the robbers ... In fact: We've seen this before. The fact that there is quite an interesting plot twist halfway through did not help, as the end of the same block as the first two-thirds of the movie. <br /> <br /> What saves him from just another main movie is the fact that he skillfully executed in all respects, the actors as great as they are, and do not overplay, and that the director really unable to save it as quite fascinating as it is for most of history. <, Br /> <br /> One thing I really liked about this movie is the fact that the music sets the right mood when you need it but not in the rest of the time, that gives a good sense of reality to the shootouts and machine- chases spread throughout the film. A nice touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors, who often tend to become sad typecasted hurt the film, how do you know that he is not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine's character and is the support in the background, but it is that you should neglect. <br /> <br /> In general, it is an entertaining film that steals more money in this story than the time from you. 7/10
