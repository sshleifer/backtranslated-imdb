Now that's what I say. Finally, the low-budget horror outing, which uses its own limitations in their favor. Wendigo, and sometimes disadvantages, it is the triumph of imagination. . Of course, it leans heavily on the Evil Dead style camera moves to its capriciousness, but it's still a damn sight better than 99% of the direct to video scaling <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: the family takes vacation to a remote area and threatened one particularly frustrated hunter. But the director Larry Fessendno knows exactly how to build suspense and add layers of disturbing horror through the use of mythical Wendy. Is it real? Is it all in the imagination of the boy? Whether it is the externalization of the child's emotional state? <br /> <br /> Some quibbled, the film is poor, because left to you to decide. Do not be put off by such a petty nonsense. A film that makes you think, not one to be avoided. This is one to enjoy.
