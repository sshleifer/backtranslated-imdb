Excellent 90-Flick! Posey incredible in this story about the night life in Manhattan, which requires so much cash. Posey gives an amazing performance as a librarian and a night crawler. This is a good, light movie on a Saturday night before going out. Soundtrack rock outfits of the world, the script is funny and the actors do a great job. Merit: you can make it in this world, if you try to just find a niche. I believe that Posey is the perfect actress for this kind of character: the young, fabulous and broke. (You have to see the movie «Clockwatchers»). If you look Party Girl you have to have a good time. Enjoy!
