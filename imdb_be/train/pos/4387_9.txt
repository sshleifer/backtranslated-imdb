This powerful film from a historical and epic perspective. Although the story is simple it is pure and simple. In fact, this is the standard story of a simple, honest man whose honor is in conflict with the more educated and wealthy people of the time. <br /> <br /> The poor against the rich, against the shame of honor, classic but well-told story without much glitter of Hollywood smelly screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen. :)
