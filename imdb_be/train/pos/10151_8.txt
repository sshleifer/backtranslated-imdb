Beautiful card New York. What I liked most of all was able to observe it with my whole family, and not expect silly crawl toilet humor jokes appear. He never did. My teenagers also liked. My son for Henstridge and my daughter to Vartan. My wife and I noticed that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something. This film tells a story that felt comfortable, but not old or do. The ending came with a twist, which we all loved, too. If you are not only cynical person is willing to let the story unfold, then this is for you. As a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest, when it comes to romance, and this one did. I recommend it, and we need more of these films to watch.
