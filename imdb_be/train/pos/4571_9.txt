The most important thing in this movie is a brilliant performance, Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh OKonor like Christy Brown, guineas artist and fighter, who, despite her physical condition to overcome all odds. As a person who has done work with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance was surprisingly convincing. The huge support that Christie received form his family, low-income, working class the Dubliners, urged him to do the impossible and the picture painted by this support did not read the book brilliantly, but the dialogues were written with a mind to grab witty arrogant person Christy Brown, I recommend this film to everyone, especially to the classic movie-lovers.
