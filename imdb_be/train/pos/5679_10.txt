After the success of the second Party, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton I decided that Blackadder has to be the third appearance. This time, instead of the Tudor or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson), lives in the French Revolution. Now accompanied by silly but cute Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the "correct" the butler, George, the Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). During this third series to well written sitcoms Blackadder tries everything possible to become rich and powerful. He tries for the election of Mr. rotten town, trying to sell the book, trying to win a bet on Al primrose, he tries to be a highway and people finally puts Prince. This is a very good contribution to the popular comedy. It includes performances with Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. He won the BAFTA for best comedy series, and he was nominated for Best Design and Best Makeup. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on the 50-Greatest British actors, he was number 24 on the Comedian Comedians, and he was number 8 in the Favorite Comedian UK Edmund Blackadder was number 3 on the 100 greatest television characters, and it was number 3 in the world's largest comedy characters, and Blackadder (four series) was number 2 on the UK best Sitcom. Excellent!
