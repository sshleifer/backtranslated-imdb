This film inspires everyone who is or was in a tight jam, be it financially or emotionally. You will definitely laugh, that is the best medicine! :) You're in a bad financial situation when her husband dies, Grace must find a new way to make money, and it is not quite legitimate, which adds to the humor. Even my boyfriend loved it, so I do not think it's a chick flick.
