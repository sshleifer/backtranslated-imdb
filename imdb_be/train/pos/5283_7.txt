The premise for this film is simple and therefore the scenario: an elderly Muslim gets his son-teenager to drive it into him as an older station wagon from France to Hajj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so that it can perform its sacred Muslim duty before he dies. Father explicitly furiously religious, but the son was not impressed; He takes of the duties in relation to his father, and not on religion, he would prefer to be with his (non-Muslim) friends. The father is stubborn in a lot of things that the son does not understand, and moodiness in between is a device that supports the drama, though it is often tedious. However, as with any good road movie has wonderful characters that occur along the way; for example, the woman on the backroad in Croatia, which are asked for directions to Belgrade simply gets into the back seat and points with her hand uttering a single word, which they take to be the place, but I can not find it on the map. In Bulgaria, another man, whom they asked directions confirms that he can speak in French, but then provides a commentary on the Bulgarian language. There is also sometimes the humor - in a country tired son eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they gave a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer) runs before the father can perform the Muslim ritual of cat. They eventually make it to Makkah - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a much larger scale. For the West, this is all strange, but fascinating. The film is not surprising, but charming in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with the soul.
