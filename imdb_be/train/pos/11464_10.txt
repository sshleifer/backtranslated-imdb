What is most disturbing about this film is not that school killing spree as depicted actually happened, but the truth is that they are carried out by teenagers as Cal and Andre ... normal children with normal families. With the hand-held camera techniques at the Blair Witch, Ben Coccio manages to bring us into the lives of two friends who have some problems with the high school, but we never told exactly what is behind these issues. They seem to be a typical -a lot of people hated school, so what? Some of you just do not believe they will ever perform very well thought out massacres on day zero. camera scene observation at school all the more powerful for that reason made while shooting. You can not believe it's really happening, and that it actually happened. Handheld camera technique also creates the illusion that it is not on the script of the film, a brilliant idea, considering the subject.
