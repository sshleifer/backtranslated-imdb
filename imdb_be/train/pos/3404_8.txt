Audience back in 1936 must have been stunned that they looked: a large, beautiful full-length film Technicolor. I can not say for sure, but it may have been the first one (3-way). Anyway, it still looks beautiful for more than 70 years later on DVD. In fact, how well it looks strange <br /> <br /> The prestige it will have to go to the director Richard Boleslowski, cinematographer Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures, and for DVD -. MGM Home Entertainment. Everything works together to give us one of the most beautiful films of the classical era age <br /> <br /> I thought the story was so :. well in the first half, stagnant in the second. This gave a good message, in the end, even though many people may not be happy with him. I can not say more without spoiling things. <br /> <br /> Marlene Dietrich never looked better, I do not believe, and, of course, have never played such a soft-hearted character ( «Domini Enfilden»). Smoothie Charles Boyer was a male star and the Domini an object of love, but some of the secondary characters were the most interesting for me. People like Joseph Schildkraut as the «Batouch;" John Carradine as "The Sand Diviner;" The most memorable for me, at least, was a dancer "Irena" plays Tilly Losch Wow, has a face and a dance will not soon forget I am.! never seen anything like it in thousands of films that I watched. just to see her do her thing is a DVD price. Looking at her IMDb resume, she was only four films, but they were all well-known films. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, the actor who really became famous for playing "Sherlock Holmes", is also located here Aubrey Smith, another well-known British actor of his time. Schildkraut, by the way, will be recognized as the classic movie fans as the man who played the snooty sales clerk in a big hit, «The Shop Around The Corner» Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. <br /> <br /> beautiful direction, and color photos, and dance Tilly, are things that I will remember best about this film, which is a lot of good and not so good things, all rolled into one If the last half hour was the best -. although I admire ending - I would rate it higher. It is definitely a collector wants to add a movie to your collection.
