Just kidding about the weight loss thing; Well, you can lose weight, you never know. In any case, I can say that I love this movie. It has the same meaning as youth and innocence found in movies such as Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's Closet shows the beauty of the simple things of life, and how often we do not notice them. The film reminds us of what it is like to see the world through the eyes of children and all the magic, mystery and horror they perceive. Jake's Closet is definitely a story man in his compassion, that anyone who has had a child can both relate to and fall in love. Careful with your friends; watch it with loved ones; build a fort - wine extra.
