Thus, what is the reason? Is there a vendetta against this amazing show, or who are involved in it? Why do the best show I've seen in recent years is canceled? I'm addicted. I saw this show on the accident last fall, and immediately fell in love with it, and watched it every week. Then he left, and I tried to the TiVo, but it was not on the air. So I forgot about it for a while, until I found the episodes on the ABC website. Now I want more. I agree with everyone else - the rest of the junk on television today, it was refreshing to see something like a well rounded and developed like this. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric comedy fix, and the house of my intellectual mystery Jackass correct. My wife loves Gray's Anatomy for its "realism," and I love / hate the show, but this could not be further from the real to me. WAY too much drama. Anything that can go wrong, does. But this time, there's drama, it's really real. Real people, real problems. Of course, there are some extremes, as former gangster turned good, girl running away from the crowd, and so on, but these people (especially in New York) is really there, and I treat each of them. I can not get enough. I just hope that ABC will get their heads out of their butts beans were enrolled and continues to show. Get some respect for what drama there QUALITY. It may be one of the best shows of all time. If someone just let it.
