This is a good film, but this is not recommended if you do not like intelligent movies. It's about two guys who want the world to get away, and that's exactly what they get. Whichever is greater, the ending was not predictable, and it was actually a good story, unlike most films these days. People complain about the film is too simple or too sad. I think they should just follow films such as The Toxic Avenger (I actually like B movies) or Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. Note: If you notice it, it is the same from the bottom of the actors, but four actors. Make it two notes: Wait after the credits (Trust me on this). Enjoy the movie.
