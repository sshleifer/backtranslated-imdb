I've seen this movie a while ago, after ordering it for my friend who is a big fan of Dominic Monaghan. The film itself was very interesting, although it had its positive moments, which for me was kind of Donnie Darko «WTF?» Factor after the movie ended. <br /> <br /> Of course, the positive and negative aspects come. For me, a young girl in the movie was incredibly good, and Dominic Monaghan did a good job as well. Unfortunately, I do not have such an opinion of Daniel Burke, Lonnie played. It may just be me, and I do not pretend to be a serious critic, that I do not feel experienced enough, but it just does not seem convincing as an actor. But perhaps it is even more surprising because, though I'm not a critic, it really gets my attention. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, all I think this is definitely a movie worth watching. It's interesting, complicated, and you just have to see it.
