I saw it in the theater, and I immediately thought it was good enough to be in the video. I'm a big nut for click action Sci-Fi, although in any case. <br /> <br /> Without giving any story is far, it is worth a look if you like Sci-Fi, without requiring a lot of thought. The story is basic, but the plot is very good. It is worth your time to see it! <br /> <br /> Maybe they will make a sequel? :) <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
