Gung Ho tries to express a variety of ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time. The result is an uneven, but generally interesting. Keaton balance all three aspects of his protagonist is pretty good. Wantabedde even better. One warning: George Wendt is very bad in his supporting role. Otherwise, it's pretty enjoyable time capsule.
