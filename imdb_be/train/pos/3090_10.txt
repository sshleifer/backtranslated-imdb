I was so upset that ABC give to another show, which has a chance to be a real winner. This show is so well written and the story line was great, the actual original idea for the show, not another boring reality show. Casting was spectacular! Not only do the characters and the actors right on, but it's a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea is really new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us share the whole idea of ​​"connections". I love the characters of Stephen, Laura, Whitney and Damian. But to be honest, not one person connected to this show that I do not like, even those that were only a few episodes (Shiri Appleby, for example). Actions and characters is so easy to love, and so talented !!. ABC I want to give it a better chance to show, and the show is not interrupted in the middle, and not announced enough. Really unfair !! all !!. This show was going on hopefully. For example, I let ABC know how I feel, and will continue to send e-mails to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know that we can do it. He worked for Jerico. (By the way, where there is the episode 13? I want to have the last show!). Please support this show and send e-mail to ABC, we can do it !!! This show is well worth it !!!
