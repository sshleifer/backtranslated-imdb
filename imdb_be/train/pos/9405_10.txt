While Hollywood was kind of stagnant for a few years after World War II, Britain developed a very prolific film industry. In "The Man in the White Suit," inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a suit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that some other companies are now probably go out of business! As Sidney deal with this and to maintain their dignity? This is an example of one of the great films, which starred Alec Guinness, before he became Obi-Wan Kenobi. It's a good look at the total absurdity of the business world. If you plan to start any kind of business, you might want to consider watching this movie.
