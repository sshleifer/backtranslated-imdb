He gathered some of the characters that are not normally to be considered together (not mentioned, try to save the man's child and return him to his father). They start out as enemies and finish as the best friend. If this sounds like a Disney film, he (made only by 20th Century Fox). Trailer for the film was one of the best I've seen in ages, but the film does not live in the expectation of many trailer. The problem lies with the fact that the filmmakers have not made up your mind, which is the target audience of the film. Yes, there are some jokes in the film that only adults would understand, but the film is more focused on the children. Parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 minutes. attention to their children focused on something other than them. Backgrounds are excellent and the voice is good, but it's nothing a good movie. Kids will love this film, just like adults.
