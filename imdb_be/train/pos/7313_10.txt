Some spoilers If you are a big fan of horror movies, then you will know that Halloween has paved the way for many films crusher. Often imitated, never duplicated, this film is a true classic of horror, and definitely one of the worst movies ever made, if not the worst. <br /> <br /> I actually saw this movie after watching the rest of the series (do not ask me why). I honestly saw 7 more movies before seeing this one, it's just how it worked out. But I must say, this is one to demolish the rest away. It's really scary and seeing Michael pop out from behind a bush or walk in darkness sends chill down the spine. My favorite part of the film was when Michael stabs the guy and tilted his head to one side. This is one of the eeriest images in cinema history. <br /> <br /> Later slashers such as Friday the 13th movies were more fun and less intense than this film. I like the series F13 is better than a series of Halloween, but this film is better than all the films F13. Michael Myers such a terrible villain, because it is realistic, you can imagine the mad man how he's going around killing people. I admit that this film gave me nightmares after watching for a few nights. <br /> <br /> What is good about this film is that it does not depend on gore and humor to entertain the audience. It's just pure horror. It's too bad, late series of films swayed by this, because it's so good example thrilling slasher film as they come.
