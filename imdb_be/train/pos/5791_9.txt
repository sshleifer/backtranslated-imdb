This must be one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes, especially for images of two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment. <br /> <br /> Web strewn shops and rubble-laden streets terrible in that particular way of gloomy area does better <br /> <br /> while the parable can be a bit unwieldy by today's standards drama, it's a great one. - using the option to make a statement related to the human experience, as well as geopolitics, so that is eternal. The whole drama rests solely on the shoulders of Mr. Bronson and Ms. Montgomery, who did not disappoint. (Maya both fluff.) <br /> <br /> true classic.
