This is a refreshing, enjoyable film. If you liked it, "Four Weddings and a Funeral," "Peter's Friends" and so on, you will see a number of famous and talented actors. He made me laugh, made me sad. I watch movies for entertainment, and the English set of films typically fits that bill for me. Enjoy!
