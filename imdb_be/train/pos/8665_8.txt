I scooped up a name at random from the Grindhouse Vol. 1 collection of pure Euro-trash films. But this film has a good seal of approval and should deserve a better transmission than what is there. Stupednous it does not satisfy it ...! Watching this film, I could not help wondering ... how did Sergio Martino Sun to make this film? It has his signature on it, and punctuated Edwedge Fenech (unfortunately not as well known as it should be, but it does get a nice cameo in Hostel II). Double and triple crosses and crosses underly this cement film from beginning to end with Li Wan Cliff seepage cool under pressure of 1 second. Maybe this guy should go to Italy, to finally reach its potential, or studio system let this guy slip through? In addition, more famous Lee films, film-lovers should try it for size and see as if Sergio Leone has lowered epic scale down once in America to work half-time (and 1/4 of the budget) is that it would be it turned out as. So refreshing, it must be taken during the day at home and make it to the couch matinee
