Spoiler This is a great film about Conure. He goes through quite an ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner. He learns a lot through his journey and met a lot of other beautiful birds. If you like birds, like my wife makes this film for you. The film also has some boring details that make the tears flowed. In the end, it all works for Paulie and his Russian friend. Rent it for the whole family, everyone will enjoy it.
