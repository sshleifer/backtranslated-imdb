For those who have commented on the Patriot is true (which is basically satanised in English), it was interesting to see this movie. Apparently it was the most bloody war that the Americans have never been involved, and they were the only nationality there. Therefore it is very nice to see something resembling historical accuracy comes from the other side of the Atlantic, do not paint or America as martyrs or rescuers. In general, although the fact that this movie did bring home was the true horror of any conflict, and how, as all actions committed in the war to breed worse acts, often culminating in flour innocent. This is not a movie where you greet someone on but both pitied and hated by all.
