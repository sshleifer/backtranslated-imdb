I caught this film at my local movie channel, and I rather enjoyed watching the movie. It has all the elements of a good teen movie, and more - it is a film, aside from the struggle with the boy-girl relationships and sex, and the like, and also addresses young people's use of steroids <br /> <br /. > The film is, in real life, do not feel to it - no loud music, no special effects and no crying scene - which, for this film, he was right. This feeling makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film - .., some of which we may know where we live <br /> <br /> In general, a good film, it is interesting to look <br /> <br /> 8/10
