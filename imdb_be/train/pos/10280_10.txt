House of the game is spell binding. It's so nice sometimes watch movies that are perfect scores. There are some movies that I've seen that can grab you so fast. From the first scene, this movie just gets you. <br /> <br /> I'm trying really hard not to give a lot of information for those who still can not see it, but there will be some SPOILERS SO DO NOT READ ANYMORE If you do not want to know. <br /> <br /> I would say the House of Games is not just a great film, but it is the best film about the scams I've ever seen, bar none. Since then, a movie on it begs to be defeated. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse Margaret Ford just perfect, from her manners to the intonation of his voice, she gets into the role immediately. Joe Mantegna was also excellent. The dialogue in this film is almost unprepared unforced quality, and these two people to communicate, how to look like they do with their voices. I also loved how the film was made, in this type of grain surreal way, it's great and helped to make a film that was it. <br /> <br /> There were a couple of movies that I've seen and loved that it reminded me of those Grifters and The Usual Suspects, but in reality, House is completely different games in this way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbed by the characters I've seen on the big screen and not only do they have a screen chemistry is strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but the buildup, which starts from the time when they eyes on each other electrifying. You know something is going to happen, but you have no idea what. And just when you think you have already guessed, that "something" is, you realize that you have not even scratched the surface .... <br /> <br /> House of Games is one of those films that can be focused in a certain type of genre film, but in fact a film about human nature. The study of nature is not only about a rogue consciousness, but the victim as well. As the film moves, and we get to learn more and more about the main characters, we learn about them, not only because of what they say and how they say it. This is a great character study and flawless in the way it accelerates to this conclusion. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would rate it 10 out of 10, let's call it (though not my favorite movie is quite high on the list), most definitely outstanding and will go so far as to say that it It does rank as one of the best character studies, and contains some of the best "twists" I have ever seen, as well. Despite the fact that I love all genres of movies, when we are talking about is not really getting the human psyche films are much better than this. Watch this movie.
