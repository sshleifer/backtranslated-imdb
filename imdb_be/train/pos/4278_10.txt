This is a film that I have seen several times than any other (I guess I saw it on average once a year, since it was released). And every time I see him, he is equally fantastic and always reveals something new for me. The cast was, most likely, a combination of the best there ever was in the ex Yu cinema. This film is an absolute must for any self-respecting movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni Krug, Balkanski spijun and OTAC on sluzbenom Putu. This is a poker movie, everyone should have in their private video collection.
