Large bandit film.Sam Mendes sent this wonderful film that shows another father-son camaraderie.Brilliant stellar cast, leading Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) did a terrific job.Great, which acts on him again.He is acting legend .Great also acting from Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig.Casting just too pretty good.The plot good.You will enjoy movie.A great way 1930's.Set gangster in the 1930s, it certainly stands out as the zenith of all gangster films of era.Soundtrack quite well suited to movie.A large movements in aggregate and it shows that a father does to protect him son.Way underestimated my liking.Deserved fully deserved 10.
