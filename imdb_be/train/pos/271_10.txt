It's all about Mitzi. I loved her in this. And did she looks fantastic! I love this Lifetime Sunday afternoon popcorn movie. It's like one of those nailbiters, where they always go into advertising in the most annoying times. Richard character was completely awful. I am from guys like this. Well, not quite like that LoL. I want Zack did not get killed. He was a cutie and very easy on the eyes. I love these stories stalker type. It always makes me stand up and make sure that my doors are closed. My husband usually does not like these kinds of movies, but actually sat through the whole thing with me, and really liked it. I can not wait to see what makes Mitzi on!
