In fact, I liked it. The room was fine, the story fits, where the corresponding series finished, and that's my favorite part. Mary and Valera is not bitter! They are not like the others that have become synonymous with a particular series, and then refuse to talk about it, or make it possible reunification (A prime example is Susan Dey, "Partridge Family"). In fact, Valery says that she will be delighted to make another film, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I would look for another ... but if it is not quite possible, then they can re run this.
