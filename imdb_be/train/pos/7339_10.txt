Ever since I heard about Ralph Bakshi version with the "Lord of the Rings" I was wondering: What the hell, "rotoscope" animation? !!! Well ... I finally found ... I've seen this film three years ago, not having the slightest idea who Bakshi it ... And I liked it ... a lot ... Very good story ... it even has a little character development, which is great for cartoon ... Look, if you get bored with modern animation .... do not get me wrong ... I'm not saying that this is just a nice cartoon ... it's quite a good film and ...
