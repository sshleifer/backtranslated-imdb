The sharpness of a small episode played mostly for laughs, but with reasonable spoon uncertainty. Once Martian suddenly on board the crashed bus on the road to nowhere, but his passenger, (which is to talk about their illegal immigrants!). All-Star Support actors, wild-eyed Jack Elam (hamming it up shamelessly) to sexual Jean Wills (if a Martian, I say, let's open the borders!), Hard face John Hoyt (the most obvious suspect), along with familiar faces, John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a good turn by Bill Candice as the bus driver). It makes for a very interesting half an hour, even if the action is limited to one set.
