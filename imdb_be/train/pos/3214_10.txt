I fell in love with this mute drama activities. Kurt Russell Kurt Russell and only could play it so well. Raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting, Todd (Kurt Russell) is dumped on the planet after the obsolete genetically engineered soldier. <br /> <br /> The stage is set, and another classic action movies icon was born - SOLDIER. Nha Rambo, Sun Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, Sun, Sun, Jason Statham - Kurt Russell owns this role and made it fully it - the original, daring, and all too human. I release that a sequel has not been made. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> -ld <br /> <br /> _________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com / ny5 / jbc33 /
