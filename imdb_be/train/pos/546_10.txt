I thought it was one of the best sequels I've seen in a while. Sometimes I thought that I just want someone to die, Stanley murder of annoying characters was brilliant. It was so well done film that you were happy, if so and so died. My only problem was in some scenes he looked like someone from a home camera to shoot, and it was amazing. Judd Nelson cute, at least in my opinion, and he was very rich in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Brilliant film.
