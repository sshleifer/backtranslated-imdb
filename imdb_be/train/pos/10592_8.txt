Nice story Pimlico community in London, which, after unexploded bomb explodes WW2, to find a Royal Charter that the area they live in forms part of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> This film works because it appeals to the fantasy many of us about how to make our own rules and not having to listen to them. A solid cast of British young men, especially Stanley Holloway, makes it more believable. <br /> <br /> There are some very good moments in the film, for example, when people ran out of supplies and other Londoners on the other side start throwing food and other things to them. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that you will always know Pimlico would become part of the UK again, people Pimlico and as a result, the viewer does not mind if it takes place, leaving a good happy feeling. <br /> <br /> strange to think that these low-budget films with a small studio in London are still so popular fifty years later. Manufacturers must have something right.
