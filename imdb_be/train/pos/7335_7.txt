Ralph Bakshi most of his films, seems to be a double-edged swords. You get something strange with it, but only if you put up with stupid and unnecessary cheezy. Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the stories that may not always shine in the animation department. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice is a great achievement to Bakshi in terms of animation. Rotoscoping much more detailed and the animation has a bright look to it. You still get some of the faintest fixed cells and slightly blurred background of the picture, but on a more-all look definitely felt better after the last fi epic in Bakshi. The animation is almost realistic naturalistic style to it, and in contrast to the LOTR, where this style is often at odds with the actual content, here it enhances the unique atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the film, the film can not create a meaningful story of its easy installation and in fact most of the motivations of characters is quite blurred. Lorne and Tigra easy cases, but even the main villain Necron was difficult to follow, not to mention the fact that the guy with Furry Face Mask (also known simply as «That Guy»). Although the majority of voice actor was appropriate, there are some odd quirks in the audio department, and especially Tigra sounds really scary when she cries. <br /> <br /> However, I believe the inherent entertainment value of the film outweighs its execution too stupid storyline. Poorly dressed characters is that you never get more, but it will help you remind yourself that maybe this film is not intended to take too seriously. It is still Helly cool and very funny.
