After watching the «Batman Dead End» In short, I do not know what really to expect from World Finest. Of course, Superman and Batman. All my world in Finest comics have them as teammates up. <br /> <br /> After watching this third and a half minute trailer, it made me want to make someone ordered a movie fan for World Finest, if not the actual feature film. <br /> <br /> Of course, some things Superman was bad, but the movie trailers in theaters always teaser that gives you only some aspects of the entire product. It looks like it needs a complete product. <br /> <br /> In addition to the director Sandy Collera relative poor aching played Perry White, most of the actors were unknown. If the actual film was made, the actors will be cast into the appropriate accounts for the film, although I think Nina Kaczorowski would be a good Lois Lane, especially if given the closer-to-character dialogue. <br /> <br /> good to see Clark Bartram wearing Batman costume from Dead End, but it needs to be updated a little more and not be like the 40s Batman of the 80s-90s leather jacket and hood. His behavior is a Batman-like, but I still wonder about the authenticity of white contact lenses instead of just letting his eyes to show through the mask. I believe that the goal was to get it as close to the comic characters than the film persona. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn can not play Superman, period. He stands around with a stupid look on his face that just says, "I face." And the shipping line seems to be a problem with him. <br /> <br /> In general, though, I would like to see the full story and a film based on this brilliant piece of work. There was a rumor of the world's Finest movie made, and with the right additions to the script, it can be. I hope that more like it's done.
