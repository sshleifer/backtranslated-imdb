This one tends to get slighted by many critics and fans of Kurosawa, but I thought it was great. This episodic character study of a multi-Tokyo poor, living in the city is literally made of trash. Although it looks like the A-bomb just hit, the film takes the form of quiet beauty thanks to the use of the glorious Technicolor. The name comes from the sound made by an insane young man who is seemingly the truck through the slums. All the characters were excellent and all the stories exciting, but perhaps the most tragic problems of man and his young son, who lives in an abandoned car. When not in search of food, they spend their free time using your imagination to build your dream home. Emotionally moving and beautiful film.
