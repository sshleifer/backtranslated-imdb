So I snapped a couple of years ago one night on digital subscriber channels and thought to go in half an hour to watch «Girlfight» waiting for "Hart's War" to get started. With the title, I assumed it was some sort of operation «B» Flick of inner city girls gang. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, it's not that at all. Instead, he worked well, and the script is the story of a young woman who almost accidentally falls in women's boxing. She is responsible for making his younger brother to his training and interested in watching his attacks. He really does not want to be a boxer (just after the breakthrough at the request of his father), she convinces her coach to take her in his stead. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in an intelligent and believable as it passes through various tests to look for her. Firstly, the coach of her brother does not want to take the boxer. After reluctantly does so that the problem of lining up games for her. Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what's going on. So, the love interest develops, but it serves to enhance the scene, meeting more interesting reaction between a person with their consequences related to the fight. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great little sleeper movie a few seem to have heard. After a while, when I saw a lot of advertised and recognized as «Million Dollar Baby" I thought, "Wait a minute, it seems kind of familiar," Needless to say, I was not looking, "Hart's War" that night..
