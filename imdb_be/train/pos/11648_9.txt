There are people who say this is another "bad language" ultra violent Mexican film. They are right, but more than that, this film is an invitation to create an awareness of what we have become. The awful truth is sick or tired, if you have already accepted paradigm of the Third World as the only possible life goals. One of the most important things «Cero in Van Cuatro" is an open invitation to a deep reflection on our current identity. This is what we all? This is all that we want to be? I am abroad, I realized how spoiled Mexican society if Tlahuac The incident came to light. I still can not understand the audience witnessed the mass murder in the air. I almost threw up when I saw some of the images. It was not Irak or Rwanda, a tiny village near Mexico City when the riot was performed with the media and the indulgence of the government. Restoring a similar situation in the film deeply impressed me. Other stories were well drawing other situations of corruption, meanness, treachery and violence, but I think «Tamales de chivo" is the best. <br /> <br /> The film is deeper than some «Cabron» and «pendejo» cries. It is meaningless compared to the actions of people. With a few exceptions, they are all excellent examples of human garbage. Just as in real life, honesty is becoming the exception rather than the rule in our country. In addition, only honesty rewarded in a strange way.
