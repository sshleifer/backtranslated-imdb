I understand that Paramount wanted to make it with the number of Rodgers and Hart, but could not understand copyright issues, so Burke and Van Heusen wrote most of the songs between them for Bing Crosby contributed to a very good score. <, Br /> <br /> I read Maltin that this film, "Crosby fit like a glove," and I could not have it better. No, this is not a satire of Mark Twain, is a film and Bing Crosby in 1949, Crosby was the star in the Hollywood acceptable. This time is used Paramount Technicolor and Rhonda Fleming has never been sweeter on the screen. It was a woman, which was invented by technicolor. <br /> <br /> Brooklyn William Bendix origin of its kind to stand out, but it's a good comic effect. The trio Crosby, Bendix, and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have a rollicking good time with Busy Doing Nothing. Bing is one of his patented elevated numbers of Philosophy If you STUB the toe on the moon. <br /> <br /> In the third song he sings again and always, he and Rhonda Fleming. The song was nominated for Best Original Song, but lost the baby it's cold outside. <br /> <br /> It is also gratifying that Bing was able to record the expense on Decca with Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwick. <br /> <br /> One thing I love about this movie is that it shows comic talents without Crosby, Bob Hope. I like the pictures of Road, but Bing was the comic talent and this film demonstrates better than any other. <br /> <br /> This is Crosby on top of their game.
