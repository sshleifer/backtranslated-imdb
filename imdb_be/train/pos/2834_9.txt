I have not seen a lot of German comedy, but if this film is anything to go by, I am forced to see more! Simple, but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy after Eva, an unemployed mother of two children, discovers that her husband, the artist deals with the wife of a wealthy lawyer. I will not reveal anything further, but that the results are very funny series of events with a perfect conclusion. My interest in international cinema has expanded since I first saw this film. I recommend it to anyone (any adult ... do not allow the inclusion of young children to trick you into thinking that this is a family film) who love comedy - even those who are not familiar with the language.
