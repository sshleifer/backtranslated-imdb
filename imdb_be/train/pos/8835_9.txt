Sharp political commentary posturing as a coming of age story is that this movie. Annoying thing is that it works effectively at both levels. It not supposed to, but it does. This is the story of four boys and a girl, who grew up in the 1953 communist Belgrade heart warmer. This is what the Lord has called classical cinema. Obviously, the 1953 Belgrade is not as harsh, dictatorial and fascist environment as a communist society is often drawn. You can listen to rock and roll, one of the songs played song Â«Hey Baba Riba" a la the movie title. But jeans can not be bought, nor are some medications that are illegal to possess. In contrast to the critique of despotic communist society, this film does this by showing how it affects the lives of the five main characters belonging to him, as we are four. The girl, who has a father-in-exile in Italy and waiting for a passport for his mother, and she travel to join him, the piano that will be taken away from the use of the sacrament of one of the boys, suddenly giving homes and neighborhoods to the new comrades, because they do need. The guys spend a lot of time listening to music, and it is clear that they despise fascism, communism created, how they are involved in quarrels with the Nazi charlatan who has tattoos on the hands of Stalin. All this leads to actions that they take later and the memory of the time disappears as the film was released in 1986, the twilight of the Soviet empire. Great movie worth seeing again and again.
