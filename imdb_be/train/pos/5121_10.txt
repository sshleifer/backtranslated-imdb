I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think Travolta and Winger are carried to a higher average interest rates, I think that sets are a representative location and times, I liked the sound track and the Charlie Daniels Band. Nevertheless, I believe that the photo was amazing! Since the interior scenes were filmed in the club and Jill had low ceilings - perhaps 10-12 feet high, and the smoke, which was supposed to simulate the "smoky bar" hanging 2-4 feet below the ceiling. The camera failed to take pictures through the smoke and focus on the actors, bull bar, women, dancing, low-level light that was actually in the bar! What a feat! Of course, there were the auxiliary lighting, but in order to maintain the atmosphere in the bar, he was supposed to be a low-light shots. Ray Villalobos (camera operator) was excellent! He got a few shots, he did not have any hope to achieve, and their influence has brought a sense of reality to the film. Thank you, Ray - Nice work!
