Stanley plans to find out. <br /> <br /> I never had any intention to monitor the "hole", and I must admit that I only really watched the film, because I'm such a fan of Shia LaBeouf, but even if you're not a fan of his, it it does not matter. "Hole" is one of the Disney film that the whole family can enjoy. Story beautifully written and includes a wonderful idea of ​​including flashbacks to the past. It is not distracting and really gives a great history. All the actors are great. Young stars are good, and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver are a joy. Shia LaBeouf shows that even at 17, he can act without any flaws. This is one Disney movie, you will definitely enjoy as a family. <br /> <br /> «I learn from failure." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
