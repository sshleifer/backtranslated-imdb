Eddie Izzard is not nothing but a comedy genius, and that Eddie at his very best. Its material is extremely witty and cheerful, and it supplies some of the best ever seen on stage. Instead of insulting the intelligence audience, he relies on it to make humor from their preferences, Hitler's wardrobe, moon landings, and the British. With so many memorable laugh, one can not help but to repeat some of his lines. Forever more, "Do you have a flag?" It is considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standing routine. Each fan has to see top notch comedians "dress to kill." By far the best British comedian I ever saw Eddie Izzard struggled for success off the live scene. However, his lack of commercial success of the film must not reveal how very talented he really is. "Dress to kill" is a treasure, one that, fortunately, found its way to home video, and can and should be enjoyed again and again.
