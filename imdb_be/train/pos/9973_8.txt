I really liked this version of «Vanishing Point», in contrast to the 1971 version. I found that version of one thousand nine hundred seventy-one quite boring. When can I get in the middle of the film a few times (as I did with the version of 1971) than me, it is not so great. Of course, this may be due to the fact that I was only nine at the time of release one thousand nine hundred seventy-one was launched. However, I've seen a lot of remakes, where I loved the original and the older one is better. I found that the plot 1997 version was more clear, and it mostly remained faithful to the original, entirely undermining the meaning of version 1971. In my mind, I felt that the 1997 version was more excitement and it was not so "supersaturated." (Sad)
