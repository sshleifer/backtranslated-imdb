49. PaperHOUSE (Thriller / Horror, 1988) Sick in bed with a fever of 11-year-old Anna (Charlotte Burke) has only his drawings, to keep her company. Her health gradually deteriorates series capture the mysterious "black outs" it. In each of these episodes, she dreams of a house in a deserted field, just a painful disabled boy named Mark (Elliot Spiers), which inhabits it. If dark, the unknown danger threatens its idyllic «PaperHOUSE», Marc life is threatened. Her life is also in danger, as these dreams reflect her own health <br /> <br /> The criticism :. Haunting the first debut of British director Bernard Rose. Taken from the fable ( «Marianne Dreams") Catherine Storr, it leaves many other "original" fantasy works in its path. Each time the story has to do with dreams and nightmares, it's hard to give him a mixture of tales and reality, to make it work in the form of a film. Director Rose successfully captures the children's fantasy world aspect, together with the darkness that seeks to capture them. <br /> <br /> feverishly killed Glass, Rose knows how to use music wisely with skillfully timed "jump out of your seat" moments. Most thrillers are very negligent in this all-important aspect of scaring the audience in not knowing what the next scene will bring. I also like the way he captures the suspense and never lets it go to stumble or inert in the following sequence of events. In addition, his mastery of the placement of objects in the frame (as in his P.O.V.shots) Cinematography gives an extra dimension to it otherwise, it would seem, it is not enough. In Europe alone, you will find such a sinister looking locations, such as those presented here: the lonely houses, fields, coastal cities, watchtower, etc. <br /> <br /> Rose will stick to this film with "Candyman" (1992), a true "thinking on the" jewel of horror and a bona fide cult favorite horror.
