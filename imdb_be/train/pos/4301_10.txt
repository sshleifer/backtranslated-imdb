In my opinion, the best movie ever. I love it when people ask me what this film. I usually smile and say, "Life." They shrug their shoulders, and probably never give it another thought. The fact that each of all backgrounds can relate to any part of this film makes everything that much more bizarre. Definitely a must see for everyone.
