just watched it on Sky TV missed the first half hour. I wonder if it was a real story so watched it till the end. there was a short in the end to say what happened to all. it reminds me of the speed, but in the end I do not think that it was released in the cinema, as we have seen the following error message. goof, we saw that they remove the bonnet (hood), and then there are two shots from a car with a police car in front, trying to slow it down when the hood back. it had me on the edge of my seat, especially when I thought that the child is going to hit the bridge and, of course, if the bridge will not be reduced, and then he was. I'm afraid I even cry, so that was not so bad !!!!
