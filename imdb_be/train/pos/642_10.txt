I was involved in this film about four years ago from a friend of a French actress. <br /> <br /> During the first half hour I was sitting in his uncomfortable chair in the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood, hating this movie, hating and even hate the French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened, but I was involved in the film in a way that I have not been in years. And this despite the fact that one of the projector broke down and they had to make a transition manually. I was in the theater for nearly four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I believe that the big films to pull you into the world that you are part of it, and then drop you talk with friends over a cup of coffee or a drink. This film is made. It was one of the best experiences filmgoing I've ever had. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
