A lot of people unfairly Sh! T on this series, but some of the video Guinea Pig quite interesting. The experiment of the devil, in particular, has some truly fantastic effects work - not just the infamous eyeball scene, but also a piece of skin is very realistic and toenails breaking hammer is very realistic - especially for older and low-budget video. <br /> <br /> Let me now begin for those who do not know right from the start: This film is an "extreme" of torture / fake Snuff that appeared in Japan in the mid 80s. This is the story as it stands is simple: A young girl holds several men and forced to undergo a series of brutal torture, to see where her breaking point. This entails brutal violence -. All effectively realistic effects, including those mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as the use of painful looking hot oil on his hand girl captive and placement of the larvae in the next puff wounds <br /> <br /> the least effective sequences are at the beginning of the video and consist of unconvincing slapping session where three men alternately slamming yo girl, her head falls and about a second sequence, where the three men took turns pushing the girl and pushing her to the ground. These two scenes, obviously, put and detract from the realism to the end of the proceedings. <br /> <br /> The actress, who plays the victim of an "experiment" pretty convincing at the time of pain and takes a good amount of swearing and coarse material on the camera. Her reaction as she has headphones attached to her head and loud sounds are played for hours on end is frightening. Some of the other abuse she receives now hung from a tree in the network throughout the time it is given to rest. There is also a disturbing scene where giggling thief through the gut into it and one more ugly sloppy scenes, where she moved in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels, until she pukes. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the series, I hope I have helped you to decide whether you want to give this episode a shot. 8.5 / 10 for the devil experiment.
