For a long time, I liked this movie better than the original Care Bears movie. So last summer, I looked at both of them together, and decided that I was wrong. The first of these is the best Care Bears movie (as you may have guessed, if you read my review of it). This one is not a bad movie, it's just ... very strange. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, as several people have already mentioned, it is completely disavows any knowledge of the first film. I can not think of another sequel, which is contrary to the original is so obvious (especially with men and women some of the characters and how they all met). When I was little, and looked at it, I was a little embarrassed and confused. I felt the same way, watching it as an adult! <br /> <br /> On to the reasons why the film is actually very good (if you disconnect it from the first film). I can not think of another film for young children with a demon, as Villan! Now I'm not suggesting for a moment that the evil demons who want to steal campers and bears Care of the soul good, I just find it great that there Supremely evil exist in a movie for small children! It's like Bizzare Â«Santa Claus against Satan," a film from Mexico you hear about sometimes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the name of the demon is Darkheart, and he wants the chicken to help him get the Bears Care in exchange for his giving her special powers. Very dark and kiddie flick? And did I mention that it seems Darkheart girl often as WHINEY voiced 10-year-old boy ??? Freaky! At the same time, some other children are in the Care-A-Lot Care Baby Care Bear! Oh, man! Daemons Care and bears in a film !!!!! <br /> <br /> Needless to say, all are cleared at the end (but not before we see Darkheart traps shower caring bears this terrible thing in one chandelere [surprised] great concern to the scene). But I was left with the question of wether this film has found a cult audience, so richly deserves. I could just see it again myself.
