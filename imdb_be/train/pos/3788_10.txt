This film is beautiful. It's real and down to the heart, but at the same time completely crazy. Easy to fall in love with the characters, because they have so many different minds, but each of us can relate, at least. In Canada, we do not have a lot of films from Eastern Europe, as well as for the few I've seen, the Loners is one of the best. It's very funny and magic. If you want to see something new and refreshing, it is going to see single.
