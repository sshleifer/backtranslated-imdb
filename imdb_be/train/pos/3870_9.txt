It is extremely dense, dark, and complex film that unravels rather slowly, revealing painful detail how the attention given in the novel, and to watch the movie «IS», like watching the novel unfolds. While I did not care about the narrator, as I felt that he was out of balance with the other projections, this film features some of the best ensemble of action I have ever seen, and the lead, Summer Phoenix, the fabulous. Her innocence and naivete, some might find it incredible, a sort of cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy this criticism, but it is still fantastic, partly because it is unlike anything I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly beautiful, shot by Eric Gautier, and part of what this unique this film, he never shows what you would expect. It is always strange, and in spite of its length, the film never shows more than is necessary. 163rd minute, it is extremely short, to a shortage, I would say that this is one of the wonders of this film. It is filled with brief moments that are stunning, some of the best you're likely to see all year, and all these factors are in the end an extraordinary experience of the film. Family moments are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant, and the fact that this film has to say about the theater did not have seen in movies, starting with Cassavetes "Premiere", or perhaps, "Limelight." Chaplin But, believe it or not, this film is much "less" than usual. I never knew where this film goes, and now, having seen it, it still has several options. It is a powerful, incredibly provocative film.
