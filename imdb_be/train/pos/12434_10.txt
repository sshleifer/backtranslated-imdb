For the first film in a proposed series he achieves the right balance. This is done with style and class, showing the early days of modesty as a refugee and the beginning of its rise to power in the criminal world. I think this is a very honest / true image of his character as a writer Peter O'Donnell intended. Alexander stage as Modesty stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice. It operates very convincing as hard to survive outside the cold / reasonable / innocence. And full marks to Tarantino to choose an unknown actress for the role - much more believeable have a new face, creating a part. I look forward to the next film.
