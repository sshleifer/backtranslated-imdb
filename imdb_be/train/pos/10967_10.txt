I first saw this film in my plays and the playwright course at Tulane. I was in awe how beautiful and raw, this film was. This sincere look unchanged reality of loneliness life. The family is exciting, and I think it really showed Little Edie in its core. ** As the remarks of my professor even he told me that during the filming, Little Edie became seized with one of the camera men. ** beauty, I think, comes from the natural family dysfunction. Obviously, in the relationship between mother and daughter that no one can not function in society alone, and you begin to desire the rehabilitation of Little Eddie society. In general, the film captures his aesthetic quality, and this image of great beauty. Two thumbs way up!
