I love this movie. It's silly, funny, violent, surreal, played out in my head insane, and definitely not your usual comedy. <br /> <br /> If you can not find the movie funny, I think it's just not to your tastes, so it is very difficult to write a review for. <br /> <br /> For your reference, some of the other comedy I like is The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride, and Zoolander (that one just me for the second time). There are others, but my taste, of course, to the unusual, and I am ready to admit that the majority of people just do not tend to like that kind of thing. I will not apologize for the fact that an unusual sense of humor. - at least I have one <br /> <br /> stage and this particular movie characters are well put together, verbal humor funny, intriguing situation, work very well (as one would expect from the cast), although the regulations in force, Shot entirely imposed script are particularly high. The total package makes fun, funny, watchable even violent entertainment.
