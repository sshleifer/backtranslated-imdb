Kids - any age - do not want to know about the sex lives of their parents. And adult children are often seriously puzzled and puzzled any evidence that aging parents have an active libido. Finally, many of the audience is very uncomfortable to look untidy, ugly widow, will pass unnoticed almost anywhere to find it the patient's ability and need for raw passion with a handsome man half her age. <br /> <br /> «Mother» is a provocative look at the barely filmed reality - a woman who is not ready to stay home, watch "telly" and vegetate after her husband almost three decades, and a controlling, dominating the chapter is that packs it with a massive heart attack. <br /> <br /> May (Anne Reid) and her husband have two children, each dysfunctional in its own way. The man's son lives with his beautiful wife, who may well be driving it into bankruptcy court, with its extravagant commercial enterprise. Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw), a teacher with aspirations of success as a writer. She is attractive, not very much, and she seems to have a close relationship with his mother. - in the first <br /> <br /> After returning to his home after the funeral of her husband, May is determined not to stay there. Rejecting the typical widowhood with its legacy of sad days and adventures, she comes to stay with Paul, who has a young son. Paula's boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig), is roughly handsome contractor who seems to take a lot of time to complete the addition to the house of his son Mai. Can be fully accepted with a solid pitiem, coke sniffing Darren Paula which treatment should be alerted in May that he, of course, a member of the Royal Academy of Cads. <br /> <br /> This is followed by an ardent love affair between Darren and drugged and now live bubblingly (dare I say it resurface?) widow. Graphic love scenes, but take second place amateur artist Mego pen and ink sketches of his visits, which can then play a role in the enfolding drama (or breaking of the ice, take your pick). <br /> <br /> In the theater in Manhattan was packed in modern early afternoon show with well over half of the audience in the age range from May. The fact that some were in shock or distorted, to see her disporting himself with erotic abandon in the hands of a much younger man, is an understatement. <br /> <br /> It is blindingly honest look at the passion of an old woman woke up after decades of dutifully obeying the desire of her husband that she stay home and raise children (she also mentions that he did not want her to have friends, that man) the surface of a number of issues. While May's flirting with Darren is not incest, there is a real psychological aspects, as well as issues with the mother of bedding his daughter's lover. And Paula is not made of hard material to start with. The point after opened, allows the peeling open in the mother-daughter relationship, which, from the perspective of Paula, left much to be desired. Ms. Bradshaw perfect in the role of a daughter who wants to support his mother and her love, she dealt a terrible hand in life, but it is not a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> May is strong in its resolve to both acknowledge their sexuality and wait for that, indeed, the future happiness demand. But she also steadily vulnerable. She fishing in uncharted waters emotional. Who controls her relationship with Darren and why difficult questions for her to understand, much less resolve. In her sixties, she is still in the development stage. <br /> <br /> «Something's Gotta Give," has recently demonstrated a mature sexy, but entertaining antiseptic way guarantees entirely the viewer will be embarrassed. In the end, it's Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton always beautiful jumping into the world of the rich. And to make sure no serious psycho-social problems have not been studied, young girlfriend Keaton, Amanda Peet, Keaton's daughter, not only blesses the match, but it ensures that the public knows that she and her old (ER) future lover never I have not danced in a bag. <br /> <br /> Nha easily here. inspired by the power performance discomfort Anne Reid for a time, drawing respect from others. Her naked body is bursting with sexuality for one and it seems absurd, as an object of physical attraction to other (comments of audience members leaving today, all these views are reflected). <br /> <br /> Kudos to director Roger Michell to solve exciting story with enthusiasm and sympathy. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
