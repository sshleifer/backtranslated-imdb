I just reached thirteen, when I first saw this series, and I see it again on DVD, over thirty years later. Images of the opening credits have never left me. It affected my view of the world and the people in it. My parents were with me long enough to see the series with me, and we have always discussed the program later. He gave me a love for the study of history and high ratings that I received in public exams in our school! <br /> <br /> the voice of Sir Laurence Olivier and delivery is eternal and perfect. I get the feeling that the people who lived through it will feel that this is their version of the history of the Second World War. I can not imagine when it gets boring to look at him. It may be similar to the series of the Cold War can now be provided, though, who would replace Sir Laurence is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Buy!
