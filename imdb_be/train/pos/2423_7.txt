Once in your life it means that once a bully, always a bully, and no one gets in or out of `The LifeÂ» for free. Neighborhood bullies in New York selling drugs and running a scam, because they can not make it to the legitimate world, maybe because they have a criminal record or drug addiction, or because they are simply lazy. This simple story with a few twists on the basic despicable characters manage to attract the sympathy of the audience for its main players due to his devotion and compassion to one another. The film was written, produced, and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also stars as Mike 20/20 (all bullies have nicknames), and based on his play, 'Riff Raff. It feels like a game from beginning to end, especially during the longest stage where three main players square off to decide who you can trust. dialogue often goes very fast, much faster than it would be on the stage, and I think that's the biggest flaw of the film. Mixed as flashbacks throughout the film verses from the street, a kind of turnip pentameter that hard and flags of the world opens the film. Poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these people, these hooligans who kill, cheat and betray each other as not worth our attention or our contempt below. The alarming thing about this film is that it shows us the realism of not only how these people live, but how they are affected by the same reasons as all of us. One of them is too stupid to other addicts, and the latter suffers from a consciousness, and a miracle audience, or even laugh at the irony of the executioners, requiring him hanging on the gallows tell jokes at the height of his death.
