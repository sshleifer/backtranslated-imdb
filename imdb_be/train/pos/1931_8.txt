Community pool in Connecticut is a place for that, "under the radar" of the film, which is charming, funny, entertaining and attractive. Despite the fact that the prizes at major film festivals, «The Big Bad Swim» was never released in cinemas hordes across America, but was distributed in the form of a DVD and shown in theaters selectively. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, «The Big Bad Swim» never had the marketing hype about the Hollywood issue, considering how much shipped Hollywood released this year, such as "I Know Who Killed Me.» «The Big Bad swim, "a really good independent film, had to swim upstream of its own. <br /> <br /> However, in« The Big Bad swim, »actress Paget Brewster is punished and believable, Amy, wired up to the breaking point math teacher who not only threw her husband, but is going to lose his job, and eventually made the call on the newly e life. The television series actor Jeff Branson--, HOT-- who plays Noah, a deposit, a vulnerable swimming teacher who goes the extra length of the pool to help their students overcome their fears, and discovers that he can learn from his students. Quite sexy Veyksler (I just saw her in a bank advertising?) deftly plays Jordan, swimmer-be, who works two jobs, one as a pole dancer, the other as a blackjack dealer. Her character provides a catalyst for change among the ensemble, but it is the least understood of the characters, because of the lack of "background" or motivation of why she does what she does. Jordan is young enough to still live with the ubiquitous video camera, summing up his younger brother, who is spying on her. However, her parents were not shown to be associated with her life in any way that seems strange. There's no drunken abusive father or mother here to explain why normal, attractive girl from the suburbs of Connecticut would choose to be self-pole dancer who humbles himself for boorish Bachelor. <br /> <br /> Despite this pun, «The Big Bad Swim» was a success, largely because it is a happy, feel good film. <br /> <br /> As you would expect, learning to swim is a metaphor for life. In the end, it is better to jump with both feet and get in the swim, and not to sit on the deck, because life happens to you in any way. <br /> <br /> Big Bad Swim is the perfect movie date, most of the hostel cinema, a big "I did not see" a movie, and men like him, as well as women.
