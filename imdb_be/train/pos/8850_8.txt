Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his best films in his historic career in this very intense, and ultimately shocking stories about the family, which includes dysfunctional as one of the children. With A-list actors, led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (Oscar worthy performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has captured not only the elements of unsuccessful stories of crimes, such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family history, such as ordinary people . <br /> <br /> Many viewers might be confused and feel joy at the construction site Lumet left here. Instead of showing it in a linear fashion, he went to Tarantino's route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view, everything is in order. I personally found it very satisfying and left me constantly wondering what will happen next. The script is very strong with some wonderful scenes between spouses Hoffman and volume, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors look completely attractive and Lumet are obviously having fun in the directing style, he does not usually delve into. Plenty of action and suspense to keep the audience in two hours running time, it is a rare film that doesn "t disappoint on one point.
