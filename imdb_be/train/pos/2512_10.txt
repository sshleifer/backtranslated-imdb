Being a big fan of Japanese singer Gackt and Hyde, I was very excited when I found out that they made a film together, and have made it my mission in life to see it. I was not disappointed. In fact, this film far exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde singers, not actors, I was ready for a bold yet not quite that fulfill speaking engagements, but I am happy to say that both of them were able to keep me captivated and believe in the story of how it went. Moon Child has just the right amount of humor, action, romance and serious, heart-wrenching moments. I can not say I've ever cried more on the film, and the more tender moments perfectly acted in a couple of, in my opinion, of course, prove their skills as actors. The fight scene is quite stunning, and although there are a few moments of uncertainty, to begin with, you'll quickly get into the film and start communication with the characters. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who are supporters of Gackt and Hyde.
