One of the ten best comedies ever <br /> <br /> It seems so joyful comedy and light that sings. Keaton comedies is _innerly, harmonically, intelligently sorted, thought. <br /> <br /> Well funny, deliberately wonderful and inventive, THREE CENTURIES must belong to the project in the comedies of the top ten, when I sketch one. History thrice love enchant audiences; I want to bring here this approach ?? Keaton comedy comes DESTINY Langa up ?? down ?? or Ã€ Rebours. Again, a couple crosses the time the water ?? and age ?? in the Stone Age, in Rome in the time of Keaton ?? into Mohammedan, in Renaissance Italy, and China. The same device operates in both films ?? one dark, awful melodrama; --the other light brilliantly ?? comedy tempo. In Keaton is essentially the same pair; and, perhaps, the same with Lang. Baby desire like Buster and Beery nice. I found THREE CENTURIES well written and intelligent, without being deliberately difficult; the plot is basically a very hitting ?? how ?? baby is a piece of furniture, but the main characters of the two rival men ?? Keaton and Beery. <br /> <br /> Keaton film is incredible nice, and maybe one would be tempted to say this looks ambitious pleasure ?? but it is not so, but it is a great pleasure, great pleasure, quite fun. And Wallace Beery makes a great nemesis.
