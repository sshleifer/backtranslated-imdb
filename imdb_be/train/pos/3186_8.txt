I believe that this film is very enjoyable. The plot is simple and easy to digest, humor, light and clean, and because the plot involving mistaken identity is a fairly common phenomenon, I believe that I look forward, like this film to flesh the story. It turns out very nice. Actress perfectly; her portrayal of innocent, naive girl trying to make a few white lies the complex role of David was very nice. I also think, Faith dances are very, very well done. I consider myself to turn her toes as she jumped around the stage easily and flawlessly. <br /> <br /> For those who have had enough of the abuse filled the cinema today, you will thoroughly enjoy this film.
