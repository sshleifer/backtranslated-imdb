I thought it was absolutely charming film. History seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of John Waters: the greatest gift of the beak is its ability to find beauty in the most unexpected places. Edward Furlong succeeds in number, but the best performances of his grandmother, Mink Stole (hilarious cameo), and all the people, Patty Hearst. I think that the way to leave the reviewers on this base. They seem to have taken the worst assessment of the beak of his work as gospel, when I think that the film is quite clearly stated that he really is a promising artist.
