I decided to see it because of the recommendations from this site. I would like to say that it is worth the effort. However, you should take into account that this film will go on for 210 minutes. If you do not have the endurance to get it on tape and watch it for a few nights. <br /> <br /> At the moment in the film, what I say will contain "spoilers", and if you do not mind, here goes: <br /> <br /> Alexandre is a diverse tramp a womanizer and a gigolo. He lives with an older woman named Marie. Marie has a retail store, and it provides Alex. Alex spends his days in cafes and restaurants. History shows that Alex previously impregnated with Gilberte that he used to live. Gilbert threw it less attractive man, she does not like, because Alex abused and beaten her. At the moment, Alex was ready to get a job and to help and to raise your child, before he knew Gilbert was interrupted and it was planning to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> By coincidence, Alexander meets nurse nymph named Veronica, and they strike up a relationship. Veronica fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the dirty sex she had with men in the past. Dreams and Veronica Alex fighting for commitment and were three to download. Finally, in the end, he showed Veronica pregnant baby Alex and Alex asked her to marry him. We assume (as indicated above, the situation in Gilbert) Alexander even get a job and to be a supplier for its new found love and family. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title «La Maman et al l Putain», I bring Eustache was due to the nature of Françoise Lebrun about Veronica. She was a whore, and then she became a mother. Thus, the mother and the whore by the same person? Anyway, I know! French films in the main (not all) are very chatty, aimlessly political preaching, theater, unleavened, mourning and full citation. Lebrun and Léaud played well his stubborn character and had a film together, like some part of the script was a little lost and inconsistent. <br /> <br /> Nha bad effort. 7/10.
