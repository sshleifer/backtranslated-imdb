"Crush" examines female friendship, for the most part, avoiding the saccharine quality that spoils so many films with the same theme (e. G., "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, it shows the effect of sudden passion to destroy and surprise. The events depicted were very unlikely, but the underlying emotional truth seemed very real to me. not a film for the crowd-speeding vehicle and explosions, but adult women are sure to answer both laughter and tears.
