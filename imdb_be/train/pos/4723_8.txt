Really enjoyed this little movie. This is a touching film about the struggle, sacrifice and especially the ties of friendship between different peoples (the child actor who plays Mick especially good). There are so many large-scale impersonal films set around the WW2, it was convincingly told a little story a real break from the norm, and in the original. I would also add that this movie is not boring, very far !! Horse of course excellent and scenery is breathtaking. For those who really consider their pets as part of the family (I have), you will find this film is particularly useful. Recommended movie lovers who are looking for something a little different.
