it's hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling it. I enjoyed it because I was not expecting what I saw, but regular sex drama so .... It pscyho-sexual thriller in which nothing is what it seems. It has Seigner, is no stranger to the genre (and poverty), in which her husband, Polanski, he sent her. And a terrible performance (I said terrible / horrible yes) from Toreton (Bernard Tavernier actor). It seems that Pascal Bruckner met Roman Polanski (better Bitter Moon), Chabrol seems lost or Clouseau thriller (I saw someone mention the devil), but closer to Les Yeux Sans Visage in Fran (Eyes Without a Face, brother of Dr. Phibes and more). A gem! I'm just afraid that they will blow it in the Hollywood remake of like they did with Nighwatch and The Disappearance.
