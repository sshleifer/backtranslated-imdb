I first saw this film when I was about 10 years old. Unfortunately, I could not watch it until the end because it was aired late at night. Now I bought it on DVD, because I remember that I liked. <br /> <br /> This is really not an ordinary horror film. It has some elements of horror, but I classify it as a fantasy rather. I liked it, but I was hoping for a bit more of horror and scary scenes. Especially the scene when Anna's father comes in PaperHOUSE trying to kill her little short. <br /> <br /> At the present time on the site. This film is about a young girl named Anna who falls ill. Despite the fact that she is sick and must lie in his bed because of its high less than she turns on the finished drawing at home - PaperHOUSE. When she knocks off to sleep, which is often strange occurs only once, it is next to the house on a large green field. She knows that the house is the same as the one that she addresses, and each new piece also appears in her dreams. Once she draws the boy into the house to have someone to talk to. As she forgets to do his feet (because he sits outside the window), the boy can not walk. Later she tells the doctor that the boy has a strange disease, and she realizes that the boy she turns, she also has a boy in her disturbing dreams. She also notes that it is becoming harder and harder for her to wake up from his dream. How she misses her father, who Ofter abroad, she pulls his father's house. She makes a mistake, and her father is looking very angry in the picture. She tries to rubber it, but realizes that she can not do anything to change the already drawn. And the next time she goes to sleep terror begins. Her father mad and blind (because it's S *** paint color to indicate it as "invalid") and tries to get into PaperHOUSE and kill Anna and his friend. Her dream became a terrible nightmare. They manage to escape and kill her father and Anna can finally wake up. The Anna finds her himself to the hospital, where her parents sitting next to her bed. The doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so. They say that Anna the other boy died, and that they want to go into the ocean, in order to overcome these tragic events. Anna draws tower and notes that the same tower located next to the hotel, they went to. She runs to the tower and meets a boy (I just can not be named, because I can not remember it and do not want to go back to the previous HTML page) and I can say goodbye to him and to forget those terrible dreams forever. <, Br /> <br /> were some that I did not understand the film. First of all, it was the final, which I absolutely do not like. I think it is too long, while the bulk of the film becomes a bit too short. As a boy flying a helicopter and talk with Anna, he should be dead? Why did you have to put a silly radio on the wall? I hated that scene he was so stupid to me. It almost destroyed the main horror scene. <br /> <br /> The things I liked were the scenes with photos of Anne's father, who was the first real scary and horror scenes. I liked the boy. The actor was awesome. It was even better than Anna. I also like the way Anna is trying to get her father out of the picture, while she slept, and she is looking for it in the trash. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie. I give it an 8 out of 10.
