Young, beautiful, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) is moved from Texas to New York, thinking that he would earn a living by being a stud. He gets there and finds out quickly that it will not be easy - it passes through a humiliating experience after another. At the end of his rope, he intercepts a crippled, running Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to Florida. But will they do it? <br /> <br /> A very dark, disturbing yet fascinating film. Director John Schelsinger draws very messy portrait of New York and its inhabitants. So it's from - the city, perhaps it is bad in 1969, but it is now cleaned up considerably. It also uses every camera trick in the book - color turn to black and white; Trippy sequence of sleep; Flash-forward; Flash back (particularly those involving rape); cuts shock; strange sound effects ... you name it. It keeps you disoriented and from the center. - but I could not stop watching <br /> <br /> There is not much of a story - it basically focuses on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is a subtext that they might have been lovers (the last type of shot shows that). It's just a portrait of two damaged characters who are trying to survive in the cold, cruel, urban jungle <br /> <br /> It was originally rated X in 1969. - the only reason that the MPAA did not think that parents want their children to see it. Nevertheless, it was a big hit with high school students (then X was not referring to anyone under 17). He also was the only X rated film ever to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. Hoffman and Voight was for acting awards, as was the (mysterious) Sylvia Miles, who had been in the picture for a total of (possibly) in 5 minutes! It was eventually reduced to R (unabridged) when it was re-released in 1980. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, excellent song "Review Talkin 'Â» was provided in the film. - and it became a big hit <br /> <br /> excellent film --- but very dark. I'm giving it a 10. Do not see it on the TV commercial - it is cut into pieces and incomprehensible.
