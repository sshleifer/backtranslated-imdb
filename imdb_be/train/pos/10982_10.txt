I found the Gray Garden to be an exciting movie, surprisingly intimate <br /> <br /> look at as eccentrics who basically have the right idea: forget <br /> <br /> the company and do not live in a dilapidated house with no heating and a huge <br /> <br /> brood of cats and raccoons, persuing their own interests, and <br /> <br /> mundainly, constantly banging on the camera. <br /> <br /> Big Edie and Little Eddie are two crazies that Mazles Bros. <br /> <br /> chosen to document. They seem to be characters from <br /> <br /> Fellini's film, only someone else, if that makes sense. Old Eddie is <br /> <br /> almost completely bedridden, a pile of papers, clothes and dirty dishes <br /> <br /> grows around it. Little Edie is even more interesting. It <br /> <br /> reared around the house, always wear baboushka type <br /> <br /> dress around her head, completely covering her hair. We <br /> <br /> never seen her hair throughout the film, and we do not ever hint <br /> <br /> she still has a lot. At the age of fifty-eight, but it still <br /> <br /> beautiful and full of life. <br /> <br /> The Gray Gardens, we get the feeling that these two women <br /> <br /> life has become a lot less than what they once were. Not only <br /> <br /> Eddie, probably more boring with two. While her mother, her <br /> <br /> earlier years, married, has a family, and lived luxuriously <br /> <br /> even made some recordings (the scene where, in 77 she sings <br /> <br /> along with a record of "Tea for two," she did a few decades ago, <br /> <br /> one of the best scenes of movies), Eddie left her career promicing <br / > <br /> model to take care of his sick mother. At 58, she still craved <br /> <br /> find her prince. If something Little Edie is still a little girl, <br /> <br /> full of dreams of glamor and glory, as well as domestic and romantic <br /> <br /> pleasure that remains to be done. <, Br /> <br /> Highlights of the film include the initial moments where Little <br /> <br /> Eddie explains her outfit for the camera, "tea for two" sequences, <br /> <br /> birthday , the climax of the argument, groceries delivered <br /> <br /> scene, and the scene in the attic. All of this is incredibly <br /> <br /> sincere and unpretencious. It made all the more remarcable <br /> <br /> because it's all real. <br /> <br /> I suggest to see Gray Gardens back-to-back with Kenneth <br /> <br /> Anger Puce short time. Criterion DVD is $ 35.00, but it <br /> <br /> worth every penny.
