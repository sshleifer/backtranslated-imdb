I saw this film in the pre-screening and found it excellent. <br /> <br /> New York, I Love You the true spin on a novel that explores the smart, funny and sometimes shocking situation around the strongest emotions of the human race. <br /> <br /> cast a huge, real Oceans 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. they all give performances stand out in one way or another. <br /> <br /> This is not to mention the fact that there is someone who is a director intertwined stories in clever and interesting ways. Ratner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean -WOW! This film is not just romance or romantic comedy, although it is romantic and funny. He also has significant history and notes. But that's okay, in my opinion. Go yourself and answer my review, I want to hear what others have to say.
