This film is outstanding and wonderfully killed. Prince Oscar for the music deserved (many people do not know that he had won one). I think this is one of the best movies to watch, like a couple of late night on DVD. Big surprise: Prince does an excellent acting job, and very good in the transmission of pain to the camera. Day Morris, Wendy and Lisa are good in their supporting roles. Very cool movie landmark.
