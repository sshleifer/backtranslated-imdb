When I was shooting Domino I expected that it would be very foolish. I hate movies that are really flashy editing and cinematography and Domino also just received very bad reviews. The only reason I watched it because I like it like Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, and Tony Scott, and in other cases. I also just enjoy the adventure on the basis of facts. Yes, editing and cinematography was frantic, the story was weak, and the acting was mediocre, but I still loved this film for some strange reason. Domino was very, very exciting and often very funny. It was terribly underrated when it was released, I think, because everyone wanted more emotional journey like Scotts latest film People on fire, and instead just got great entertainment. I actually understand why everyone hates Domino so much, even though I loved it and recommend it.
