This fantastic detective story is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular genre of the film. I was glad to see William Powell processing detective story with charisma and charm, and without the silly attitudes of his character Nick Charles (from a series Â«Thin Man"). While the story is good in itself, I think what really makes this film interesting to watch fantastically creative direction Michael Curtis. " From a visual point of view, it is fraught with textured film with Curtiz showing an incredible team environment; from the split image screen to the strange angles and creative retrospection, Curtiz shows that he was one of the best directors in Hollywood. It is highly recommended if you're a fan of this type of film.
