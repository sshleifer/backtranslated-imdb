Thanks to a clever script and a steady hand from Writer / Director Kevin Meyer, «Perfect Alibi" is an entertaining and very nice mystery thriller. The film begins methodically and creates steam, as the keys are beginning to reveal that nothing is what it seems. Harry and Terry Elizondo bad as they come together to solve the mystery, reminding me of Nick and Nora Charles of «Thin Man» movies. Quinlan well as the tormented wife Alex McArthur and the role of the character, played by veteran actor Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris is well done and provides many moments of light at the right time. There's even an episodic Rex Linn. Overall, I felt like I was reading a good book in the fire.
