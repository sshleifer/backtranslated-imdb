This film Batman is not as good as Batman mask Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze Subzero But it's still a good contribution to the cartoons of Batman, I say it is equally good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This film is good for all the same reasons storyline well not as good as the other, but still very good that there is a lot of action in it effects Cartoon good voice actors really good, such as Kevin Conroy as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal, Robin. The villains are good, such as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as The Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed batman mystery Batwomen. So make sure that you rent or buy Batman mystery of Batwoman movie, because it's really good <br /> <br /> Overall rating :. ******* with ********* * <br /> <br /> *** to *****
