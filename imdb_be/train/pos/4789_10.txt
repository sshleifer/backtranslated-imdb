(1999) a film by David Lynch's story John Roach / Mary Sweeney is in Iowa and Wisconsin for some time, long before the final release of the film. <br /> <br /> We came to life Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) later in life. His state of health is poor, his life is mostly behind him, and he knows it. <br /> <br /> It does what he decides to do even more beautiful and conquers. He decides (and at each point in the movie his name echoes through his actions), to put a few things straight. <br /> <br /> Alvin, still in his life, a man of great experience, but modest means. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) is struggling with a speech impediment, which makes communication a lot of effort on behalf of the audience. But it's worth it, because the history of the Rose can not help but come out in the course of the film. <br /> <br /> This film is a story of adventure. But like all journeys is a journey in a geographical sense, and in the human sense. Early in the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey, which is not an elderly gentleman at the age Alvin must reasonably take. <br /> <br /> But this way, we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications that equip him to achieve his goal unlikely. His goal is simple and clear. His brother is sick and likely to die, and he wants to visit it. He fell out with him many years ago, and they did not speak for a very long time. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Alvin meets a lot of people. The way he behaves towards them, and the benefits that they get from knowing it is the essence of this film. We came to find out who is Alvin Straight is, what makes Straight Alvin. And at the end of the film, we know who we are .. better.
