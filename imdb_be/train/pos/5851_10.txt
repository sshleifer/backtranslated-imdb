* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is only the second type of payment I made for a perfect 10, the first of which +1991 Royal Rumble. She was full of exciting matches, which were not memorable, just a one-time fun. And that's why I love it. <br /> <br /> The opening match between Razor and DiBiase, and Ludvig Borg against Jeannette Marty had only low point. They were in the order of matches, but DiBiase deserves better in his last pay-per-view match. These days, the game, as it would have run-ins and a great climax to the first major push BABYFACE razors. And Jeannette, fresh from the Intercontinental title run, could have a better fit with the Borg. But I do not think anyone really cared. They just needed a push Borg on pay-per-view television. <br /> <br /> IRS and the Kid were great, as Michaels and perfect. I want to perfect could have won, but Michaels goes for anyone. Notice how immediately after he left the WWF, so he will not have to work in the razor. Bret Hart are two big fights with Doink (notice how the best match each against Hit-man), and then Lawler. Their rivalry is a classic; That's why this year, the hostility there was no danger. How often do you see two legends to win the feud of the year is the end of his career? <br /> <br /> In a match Steiners-celestial bodies it was one of the best of the year. Who knew that the authorities can hold their own against one of the best teams ever? <br /> <br /> Many say that the match Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember that made the old WWF (in pre-wrestling) was a mixture of great athleticism and a freak show. Has a soul out there who do not like Akeem? <br /> <br /> The main event was not bad, although nowhere near the status of the match of the year. They put Lex Luger over well, but made a wise choice in that, Yokozuna to keep the belt. He was the first heel, as the superstar Graham to keep the belt for more than two months. Currently, the heels of champions constantly. But when you blinked, you missed the title reign of the heel from the beginning WWWF through WWF 90s. <br /> <br /> In the old school wrestling fan, this SummerSlam and 88 are my favorites.
