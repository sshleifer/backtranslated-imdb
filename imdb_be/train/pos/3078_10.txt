Loved this show ... clever acting, clever dialogue, a great story with real people .... please return it or make it available on the internet ... really bored .. Hope Davis really shines in this show. I like the idea of ​​Six Degrees ... It really makes sense in this crazy world. Rid yourself of this stupid reality TV show and give it a second chance to please return it to Nha grovel..but please! When he went off the air, I looked online and liked the way I could watch it with minimal interruptions, in fact, ABC Online makes it easy to enjoy the show if you missed it in prime time ... gone are the days of endless belt, anytime you want to get it back, I'm ready.
