When I saw this film, I was amazed at what a great movie it was. This is the only film that I think I ever give a rating of 10 stars. I am confident that this film will always be in my top 5. <br /> <br /> To act well. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet at its best. I do not think that someone might be better than Kate. <br /> <br /> If it's a rainy day, and you can not decide what to rent, well, that's one. You'll love all the action, special effects and many others. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this film go to rent or buy it now !!! You will not regret it. <br /> <br />
