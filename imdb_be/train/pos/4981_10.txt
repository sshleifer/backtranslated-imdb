I myself feel that this film is a rare treasure. Moreover, it is the beginning of the career of Shirley Temple, but a rare look at how our society has changed. You need to understand some things that we are today regarded as sexy, then it will be presumed innocent. For example, parents of children in the film, as well as many parents who have children to see this movie, I saw it as soon as children imitate adults. Most people do not think about those children viewing sexually attractive but teenagers eager on teenage girls. For them, it's not sexy. Keep in mind this was before we had Internet access, TV, etc. ... The majority of sexual crimes were openly raised. Sometimes there will whisper about the kid with the "funny uncle." But this is often all that came out of it. It's very boring. But it's kind of sad today, because even I can also see this movie, like everyone else, except that it was intended, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirley dance like that and the boys are balling her eyes, and I felt uneasy. I have to remind myself time it took place! These children did not know what sex was. Parents know that children like those in films and those who watch it. Thought can not even entered their minds. In the eyes of an average adult if it was not sexier, when Shirley plays at home. Even today, children will enter a beauty contest, many dressed very mature for three years old. However, the child just pretending. I do not blame the child for wanting to act like an adult. Or old films, which show it. Frankly, our media has done a lot of things, it seems, then, it seems, is sick and wrong. Sometimes it can be for the better. But I really believe that this movie is not one of them. This gives a rare view of an innocent mentality that we have long since lost.
