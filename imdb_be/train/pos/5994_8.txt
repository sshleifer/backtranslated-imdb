I had the pleasure to watch the short film «The Cure», the first-time director Ryan Zhafri. What really impresses me is work and chamber music. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of young filmmakers (and I'm one of them) will feel a hard time with the cinema, when I started to do with indie. We see that the output is not exactly what we are, or appear below our ambitions. But this film, the directorial debut of a young director, handled very well on the screen. Camera movement, color, lighting, compositing contribute to the history and emotion of the film. <br /> <br /> And the music, as a key element of film language, it helps a lot too. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to portray the heart of a woman, her desires, her fear, especially in the short. Yet, I must admit that I am not a fan w / v (story), especially if the film is released the story, and the boom and cuts. My personal feeling to some of the descriptive part, my assumption was the narrator tried a little too hard. Thus, the energy of the audience pushes back from the emotion of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, this short film is beautifully done, I could see the entrance from the director. Way, Ryan! Greetings from China, looking forward to your next. <br /> <br /> Tim
