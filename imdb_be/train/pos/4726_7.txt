The origin of this film is a mystery to me, since I only know as much as IMDB, before I shoot him. I believe that before the «Starship Troopers», «Killshot» was one of the countless unaired pilots who never made it to the network, cable or otherwise. The new name "Slaughter shot" comically thrown in the opening sequence, the first of many quick tips, it is not always intended for the cinema. Quick cuts cheese «Melrose Place» Music and short 2-second close-up shot open the main actors you know what you are for. <br /> <br /> And I'm not against anything. I made this film, seeing the repackaging, that puts Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net, thinking it would be funny to see them in the movie besides the SciFi parody Starship Troopers (great book, in my opinion ,, not so hot film - but it's another review). After watching it on IMDB, my roommate, and I assumed that the pilot was pulled after the apparent success of Troopers and Richards own career (see Bond-Girl, Wild Things and references therein). They threw in a sex scene involving a minor character, to achieve the desired R-rated status - a welcome video in the dark sections, ie. In any case, they should have left it without a rating if you are trying to sell it in the / partition softcore porn obscurity. <br /> <br /> In general, it's interesting. I hate to spoil the pleasure to tell you that this is a pilot TV, though. It was the big gulp, watching it - if you expect to get a cinematic film and TV shows, the differences between them make themselves more clearly than usual <br /> <br /> I would rent it again.? No. I would watch this TV show? Well, why not - it's better than Malibu. And their poor attempt to hit all demographics would do well back in the mid 90s. Token black guy (who was gay, to avoid TV taboo of interracial dating), the token Asian (Japanese, I believe, on behalf of Koji) more skilled in science and computers that talk to women, beautiful, intelligent Latina pre honey student who has everything what's going on behind it, except for the bank account of his family - the show would probably have made a good <br /> <br /> But, as the film is just cracks me <br /> <br /> I gave him 7 a .. 10, taking into account the fact that it was and that he was forced to become. It made for a very enjoyable evening, and that's all I'm asking for rent.
