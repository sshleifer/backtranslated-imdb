Although I am not the biggest fan of installing on the basis of martial arts films when the film goes straight to the imagination, and not to fight, I get much more pleasure from it, and this film is one of the best in terms of drawing fantastic and crazy flight fraud. Cheno Xiaodong built here a magical fun with excellent performance and a large ethereal beauty. Big tragic Lel Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays overnight in the temple of ghosts and is linked to the stunning fox spirit and wacky Taoist. Cheungs performance full of naive, but worthy of charm and nice to Mo from the wall, as a Taoist monk who shows some fencing and even gets a musical number. Perhaps best of all Joey Wang, like a fox spirit, really pleasure to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive. The film takes the elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all mixed together in an ever entertainment package. Chen Xiaodong, directing and choreography processing provides some neat wire thrills and fills the film with fog, shadow and savagely ignorant spectacular wild flowers, giving each forest scene wonderfully magical atmosphere. Also worth noting is a complicated hair and gorgeous style of clothing that takes the female characters, with, if I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang sporting hair done up like a fox ears, then, an amazing touch. Although the film shows a relatively small steps, and some, perhaps, ill advised cheesy pop song at times, it's a beautiful part of the entertainment, with ripples symbols and drawing, even the odd neat arc of character, an almost constant supply of visual treats and rich dreamy atmosphere, essential treasure it is strongly recommended.
