It filmed presentation of the "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is the most beautiful and interesting performance pursues Coleridge poem. It's amazing cinematography, combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the poem of 1798 the world-famous artists, and beautiful story of Michael Redgrave, very well worth the time to see this beautiful visual work. <br /> <br /> in the era of television, this work is an invaluable tool to encourage young students and adults to explore and learn the value of great poetry. To my knowledge, this work is really rare; which is unfortunate. As a student of world literature and as a former college professor and academic advisor, I feel that more great epic poems like Coleridge "Another Ancient Mariner" should be so "translated." Although it is not a film critic, but as an avid reader of classic literature, I am happy to recommend this wonderful product without any reservations at all.
