In my opinion, this is a good example of a film that could be much better if it was a short 10 years ago. I doubt that it will benefit from modern technologies, but it would look much better if it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70. <br /> <br /> artists and animation did a great job. In my opinion, this film boasts the best background art and one of the best character design. The animation is very smooth and realistic. Throughout the film you believe in the world you see, so that everyone did a great job. It also boasts one of the sexiest women of animated characters, if not the sex that beet typical anime girl with ease. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are a few bad thins about this film, which will make it not so attractive at the moment. Firstly, the plot and execution comparable with the modern adventure films, and it's really old-fashioned by modern standards. Secondly, it would benefit from an additional 20 minutes of dialogue in connection with the duration of time. Finally, the installation is not so popular now <br /> <br /> Conclusion :. A great alternative to another short story about Conan the Barbarian, but not to the novel.
