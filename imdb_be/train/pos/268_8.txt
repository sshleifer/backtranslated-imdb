I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (is that spelled right?) The Sybil. I have not seen her for a while, and forgot how much I missed her. I thought she did a great job of that. supporting cast was pretty good. In some angles, the daughter even looked young Nicole Kidman. The kidnapper was pretty awful and the story as a whole had a good twist. The young guy was a beauty. I thought that my husband is definitely something to do with it for sure. <br /> <br /> Just got the Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas, and I love these movies. It saved my interest, and I'll watch it again if they handled it. Can anyone recommend any movies like this? You can place on the board or send me a private message if you want. Thank you in advance.
