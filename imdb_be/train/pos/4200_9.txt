Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: A "Red ScareÂ» film devoid of hysteria, in which the communist threat is not over McGuffin, that ignites the plot. Pickpocket Widmark takes the free woman Jean Peters from his wallet, which comprises a strip of microfilm; Unknown to any of them, it is fraught with secrets that are vital to the Cold War. Peters, as it happens, was under the supervision of the FBI agents who are confused theft, as the man who ran it, cowardly comsymp Richard Kiley. When you try to gain valuable film, both sides win the support of Thelma Ritter in StreetWise old Jane, who is always on and ready to sell earie what she hears. <br /> <br /> Fuller draws from a rich palette of tempo and key, telling a story that becomes a race at the time of escalation of violence. From the underground to the waterfront, its midsummer Manhattan takes on sweaty low tide, it's almost sarcastic. Love scenes between Peters and Widmark becomes unstable mixture of rough and tender, and they scored on the "Again," a song introduced Ida Lupine in a road house, also starring WIDMARK. The pace of slack for the beautifully written and played scenes of death Ritter - among the most poignant vignettes throughout noir, and a kind of mirage of an oasis in the film smoked sentimentality. This writer / director only work within the strict framework Fuller film noir cycle; his later search of American Pathologists (Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, USA Underworld) never led to the synthesis of suits like Pickup on South Street.
