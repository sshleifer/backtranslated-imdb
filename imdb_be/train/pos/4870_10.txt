The film celebrates life. <br /> <br /> In the world of the setting for the innocent and pure souls, and all my «Happy End», as well as in the final scene of the film. <br /> <br /> the film has a great soundtrack, a mixture of Serbian neofolk, gypsy music and jazz. <br /> <br /> This film is very refreshing piece of visual poetics. <br /> <br /> watching experience, as you 've sucked into another beautiful, romantic and sometimes harsh world. <br /> <br /> As Mr. Kusturitsa film should be.
