I must say that it was not very interesting, but talk about fashion and amazing ways to solve the puzzle. A little too easy, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses the IMDb ... it's fantastic! I really enjoyed that part of the movie ... <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Flitter), but very fun ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) seemed really hopeless ... he had to be more evil her for the way she treated him ... <br /> <br /> Well, it's a movie tour and fashion in disguise. Anyway, I recommend this film only for summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. More teen spy movie Emma Roberts .. Spymate ... remember? It becomes good at this difficult detective work.
