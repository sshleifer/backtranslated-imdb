It was a great 2-part episode, although I have never seen older, I never thought that the doctor would go against everything paranormal, extra Terrestial, of course, but the paranormal. <br /> <br /> This episode brings things we fear the most, and how we, the people, in an action-packed time, will fight and defeat the evil real live when most likely to say that it would be impossible. <br /> <br /> Given that this is a family film, that I am surprised that they brought some things in fear, as faith, especially if it will also entertain American audiences. But who cares about what the Yankees say, we rock! Doctor Who has shown the potential is still one of the episodes of the new series in 2005, the first to be so harmless for scary delight to serious, from light to dark. I hope that many of the old fans will one day say, "the old doctor, who returned" in the near future. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10
