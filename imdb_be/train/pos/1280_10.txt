I was lucky to have seen this on a whim during a film festival, and kissed with such force that I saw that I went back the next night, his second of three films. Funny, wild and toothy attack on every aspect of the main entertainment passively swallowed without tasting on naimaleyshemu common denominator of the target audience, which is conducted in a single Avengers writer who slowly takes in members of guerrilla warfare for him to predictability is what the film is all about, and performed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that you were after the credit roll to restore hope and excited that the original films can still be made. Any disappointment with unfulfilled expectations for something to spark their imagination would do well to hunt (and I mean hunting) is almost not see the point down. For fans of Fight Club and any movie Charlie Kaufman, and is required viewing for anyone who avoids multiplex, like a mad dog.
