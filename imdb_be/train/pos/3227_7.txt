Kurt Russell is a powerful and (mostly) silent in this action-packed thriller by Paul WS Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.) Set the garbage dump of the world, the soldier plays like a cross between Rambo and Shane, with Russell barely speaking, as the title hero, " outdated "genetic soldier left to die. The supporting cast of the colonists, including Connie Nielsen, Pertwee and surprisingly hairy Chiklis, he can. They spend most of the movie scared of Russell and the rest running for their lives. Russell's performance is one of the best he has ever given. From almost no words to say that it transmits emotion, sense and meaning to the appearance and looks. It's almost a mime performance. If the sequence of the impact of action in the transfer, he tears - and does it in a strong, silent, nor indeed the way. There are drawbacks. Jason Scott Lee is meaningless, as "supreme" genetic soldiers. Jason Isaacs makes memorable Frank Burns of M * A * S * H ​​weaselly as a commander, and Gary Busey busts intestine (and almost busts its band) as Todd teacher. It is undervalued and a great sci-fi film, and is recommended for those who want to visit the second edge of the universe - David Webb Peoples as a written screenplays.
