Zucker is the only film that nothing of the first of its kind entirely faked. Funny movie with 98 Night in Roxbury right behind, but I do not think that there is something about Mary Theres was funny, so that the graph buckskin for open and bean thing he it apart. Dont listen to the critics, notably Roger Ebert, he does not know a solid entertainment just look at him reviews.Anyway see it you will not dissapionted
