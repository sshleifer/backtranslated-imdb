This show has a few cliches and several top-like moments Creek Dawson (16-year-old talking about way back when life has meaning?), But overall it looks like a decent show. Most of the characters seem very real, and the story seemed to move along well-pilot - finishing a good lesson in the end. I just hope that each episode will not be changing lives, like the first, it would be just too much drama for this car. Sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball, I believe that many of us can relate to his devotion and sometimes tunnel vision for the team, he always wanted to part.
