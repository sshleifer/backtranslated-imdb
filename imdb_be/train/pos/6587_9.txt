master blackmailer is based on a short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Adventures of Charles August Milverton," is the first full-length history of Sherlock Holmes Jeremy Brett, what I saw. The history is interesting and dark. The film has a few wistful, sad feel to it, but it's quite interesting (especially with some funny scenes). <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson attempt to reveal the identity of the blackmailer is illusory, which was ruining some of England's most famous families by publishing private letters, which, one way or another, destroying their lives. In the end, they know that it is Charles Augustus Milverton, "art dealer" after several tragic consequences for victims, who could not pay. Our heroes have to help the next Lady Eva Blackwell, who has to pay the amount which is outside it means or even her upcoming wedding will most definitely be revoked. The scene in which Holmes and Watson Milverton house burglary is intense. Although the film is essentially a happy ending, tons bored and sad. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hard uk (as usual), and Robert Hardy as the notorious villain (most viewers will probably recognize it today as Cornelius Fudge in the Harry Potter films), Serena Gordon as the Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thompson as Agatha ( scenes involving her and Holmes rebellion). I give him a *** 1/2 out of *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough inspector Lestrade. (I want them to be added to the stage at the end of the story, where it gives a description of the two robbers, one of which corresponds to Watson.)
