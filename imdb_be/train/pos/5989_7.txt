The film begins with a bunch of kids in school reform and focuses on the child, named "Gabe", which seems to work to earn parole. Gabe and his sister move to a new area to start a new life, and soon meets a dead end Gabe children. Children in this film a little punk, but they are much less antisocial than they were in other previous films, and deep, well-intentioned they are punk. However, there are some criminals in the area who commit insurance fraud by arson and see Gabe as a convenient scapegoat - after all, he was a reform school, and no one would believe that he was guilty as soon as he was framed. So when Gabe about the readiness for shipment back to «The Big House», this is the rest of the gang to rescue him and expose the real crooks. <br /> <br /> «Dead End Kids» has appeared in several films Warner Brothers in the late 1930s and the films are generally very good (especially the Angels with Dirty Faces). However, after the contract ended the boys, they went to Monogram Studios and movies, to put it mildly, were very weak and formulaic - with Hunts Hall and Horsey be pretty much the whole show and the group was renamed «Bowery Boys». Since ANGELS FACES wash were excellent writing and production values, and Hall and Gorcey not constantly steal the camera, this is a very good movie - and almost earns 7 points (it is very close). In fact, while it is not a great film aesthetically pleasing, it is sure a lot of fun to watch, so I'll give it a 7! Of course, it was a bit fake, especially towards the end when the kids are taking the law into their own hands and Reagan ignored the Bill of Rights - but it was also very interesting. Deadlock Children make their best performances and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan, provided excellent support. Of course, this part of the film was illogical and impossible, but somehow it was still funny and quite enjoyable - so if you can suspend disbelief, it works well.
