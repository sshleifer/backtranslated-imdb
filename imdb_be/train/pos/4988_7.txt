The proposal of this film is that a person's home is still his castle, even if it's just a cabin in Hooverville. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy has a hut and tell the truth this guy, even in the good times will not work all that much. But in terms of a very typical Tracy, before he was thrown into a priest in San Francisco, at the beginning of the classic kill those roles, he plays tough natured circle that takes in Loretta Young. <br /> <br /> One of the things about the man in the castle is that it shows the influence of depression on women and men. Women were some additional strains placed on them if people have trouble finding a job, women have it two times stronger. And they have been sexually harassed, and some only turn to prostitution for a square meal. Spence takes Loretta Young, which is facing the kinds of problems and does not raise any claim to it in his castle. Quite quickly, though they are in love, but Tracy is not something to calm down. <br /> <br /> The love scenes were some additional Zina them because Tracy and Young had a whirlwind romance during the filming of Man castle. And both were Catholics, and in marriage, and in those days it was an insurmountable obstacle for marriage. And Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith seriously. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast are Walter Connolly as a kind of father for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau, who went through all the pitfalls Young could face and tries to steer clear of her and Arthur Hall, actually disgusting creep, who has his eyes on the young as well. Khol brings human castle site to its climax through intrigues. <br /> <br /> human castle grim look at the Great Depression, and not an ordinary film escapist fare for those who try to avoid this kind of reality in their entertainment.
