When browsing the Internet for the previous sales prices, I came across these comments. Why are they all so seriously? It's just a movie, and it's not pornographic. I got this short film from my parents 30 years ago and has always been in admiration of him. I showed it to many of my friends and they all loved it too. I feel privileged to have the original one thousand nine hundred thirty-two 8mm black and white silent film Shirley before she became popular and well known. After reading the other comments, I agree that the film is "colorful." Big deal! I just wish there was more. It seems that I must be the only person who has one of these originals for sale, at least, so I wonder how much it costs?
