Plato would have run an entertaining movie with Gary Busey.it relatively unknown film as the one I had seen him in the trunk of the car, I thought it looks interesting, I was right to.Gary Busey plays Plato blacksmith tough mercenary who is framed for the murder of a powerful crime lord Cuban is currently on the run, Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends play Steven Bauer (Scarface) and the action star Jeff Speaksman (specialist). what I liked about Plato's perspective was the way the film is never boring story, may have been done before, but it was still a good action was fun to watch, and the action was pretty fun, especially the climax Busey makes a good hero is ironic since he usually playing the bad guy, and Steve Bauer good as pal Plato even Speaksman Jeff does a good job, and he can not even act to end his term in Plato is a nice effort from the nude images of movies and I give it a 7 out of 10
