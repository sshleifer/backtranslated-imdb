At first glance, this movie is not like a certain big. After all, Bette Davis movies with only 166 votes at IMDb rating of 6.5 and must be pretty bad. But the film turned out to be a wonderful and original surprise. <br /> <br /> You would first expect it to normal average typical '30s movie with a formulaic love story, but the film is surprisingly well built and has an unusual and original story, which also helps to make this film very enjoyable look. <br /> <br /> history made two protagonists played Bette Davis and George Brent. They helped to throw mostly funny characters, but the film is mostly includes only about two of them. Their character is involved in the most unusual and intelligent writing love stories, working with a sense of humor as well. This makes the film a wonderful little comedy to watch that very interesting. <br /> <br /> The film is quite short (just over an hour long), which means that the story does not waste time on unnecessary plot lines, characters and development. This makes the film is also quite fast paced, which helps to make this film very watchable one by today's standards, as well. This may make the film a bit simple at times, but it never comes at the expense of its entertainment or fun. <br /> <br /> Great nice simple romantic comedy that deserves to see more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
