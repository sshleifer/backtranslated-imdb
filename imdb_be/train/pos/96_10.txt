I was looking through some old VHS tapes and I have bumped into John Denver & The Muppets Christmas Together.This TV show made me go to my computer and watch it to see if I can find a version of the DVD of the show to buy. I was disappointed to not be able to find it even on DVD. The show aired in 1979 and was a great show. I have a record and a CD, but I would like to buy a DVD version of the show. Old tape and the image quality is pretty good, but it disappears, the sound is not as good as a CD. There are also several other songs not included on the CD. As a supporter of John Denver and from the Muppets, DVD-this show is really good seller. If you do not have a CD is a wonderful collection of Chritmas songs taken from this show. The album is also good if you can find it and still have a gramophone to play it.
