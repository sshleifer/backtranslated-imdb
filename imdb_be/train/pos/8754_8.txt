I watched this movie 11 years ago in the company of my best friend. I got my judgments teeth pulled out, so I do not feel very good. <br /> <br /> I ended up liking it a great time. It's hard to look at, if we take into account that it has to do with friendship, betrayal unwanted, power, money, drug trafficking, and a very difficult situation, which deals with life in a foreign prison. <br /> <br /> Acting on this prime level. Two women I desire most of all star, and it's a good thing. Claire Danes as a cute and beautiful, as always, while Kate Beckinsale very hot and delivers excellent performance. Bill Pullman is also excellent and demonstrates the quality of his acting. <br /> <br /> There are many plot twists, to dig out and make it interesting visual experience. In addition, it shows the hard times to Thailand. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated film. Not a lot of movies like this come up in recent history. This should make you jerk a lot ...
