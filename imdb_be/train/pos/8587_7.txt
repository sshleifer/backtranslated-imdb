My opinion: it uses the familiar story with great performances and some real moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> The story is familiar. Innocent decorated to a conspiracy to murder the president of the United States, the first traitor to the United States Secret Service. Like his fellow Secret Service agents pursuing him, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course, we know that he was innocent, but the real culprit is not far off, but I still entertained the hour. At this time, when thrillers reduced to too inappropriate and too much in the action sequences, a watchdog good lick-back all those good old-fashioned political crime thriller. Familiar story elated neat exciting sequences and stunning performances. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas, the ideal person for the job, is a long-running Secret Service agent Pete Garrison, who is framed for conspiracy to kill the president. Former colleagues of the secret service (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) pursue Harrison while he tries to find out who was behind the murder and possible traitor in the Secret Service. This leads to a lot of chase scenes that, surprisingly (and thankfully) never unbelievable. The script also offers a story featuring Harrison affair with the first lady (played by Kim Basinger). This, fortunately, was not necessary, as most of the storylines are this kind of films. <br /> <br /> Directed by Clark Johnson Movies (S.W.A.T.), who managed to make the movie look good. Although many have criticized it as "TV movie was" I do not agree. I agree, this is not a perfect movie, and a lot of it is inspired from other thrillers, action and political intrigue, as in the line of fire, or an episode of the TV series 24 (this film is very similar when it comes to style and Sutherland stars), but even in this case, the film picks up his story in a serious heights and does not leave it, even the small details. Views are stunning (with a first-class gypsum, its boundary to be, even with a script by-numbers. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, I will reward his *** 1/2., Not perfect, but not far away <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
