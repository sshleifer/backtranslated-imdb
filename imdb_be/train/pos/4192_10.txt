In what is likely to find himself on my list of the best films Fuller (that is, when I see more of them, which is exactly what Shock Corridor), Pickup on South Street is a film noir, where the rock, as well as men hero, are not stereotyped by those in the genre. Like most of his other works, Fuller introduces his own experience and sense of style New York, which is usually absent in Hollywood film noir. On a small budget-, at least for such Zanuck- Daryl F. Fuller and its actors create person who cute even in a dark environment. Good guys, mostly those who do not get violent with you, even if they are looking for an extra buck. <br /> <br /> Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter all terrific in the lead parts. Widmark is one only a few actors I can think of who could really took off this character. He looks a bit like Bugs Bunny, as it can be clever, which is a bit of a coward. On the other hand, the nature Skip McCoy has many meanings in his life. He does not go into other people's business, and is not trying to take care of most of the working world outside their small hut on the river, after being sent for three years. He slides up, without his knowledge, he pickpockets woman (Peters) on the train, and raise a subject that is under the eye of the government. It may have some secrets that could make it a lot of money. But at what price is the central part of the movie, since it includes a snitch Moe (Ritter is one of the best and most believable character actors of the period), women ex (volatile Kiely), and the police department. <, Br /> <br /> In addition to the thematic elements that speak to a sharp dramatic, journalistic style (as the previous position Fuller, along with boxer) is a new dialogue and participation. There's a spontaneity in many movements Fuller camera. And the third act. It is a thin, dense film noir that should be checked, even if you are not familiar with Fuller (a relatively less strange than some of his later works).
