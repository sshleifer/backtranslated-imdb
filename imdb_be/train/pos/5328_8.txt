I still remember first seeing it on TV. I could not believe TVNZY let it! I had to have it! A lot of humor is not lost-NZ'ers, but give it a go! <br /> <br /> Since finishing the back of the Y series, Matt and Chris went on to bigger and better (?) things. The greatest daredevil stuntman NZ, in Randy Campbell has frequently appeared on British television series of steel balls. Yes, it is still F ^ @ kc all of his own stunts, because he was too drunk. <br /> <br /> In addition, the "house bandÂ» Deja Voodoo has since released 2 albums, Brown Sabbath and back Brown. The group consists of members of the flip commands Y and singles, such as "I would like to give you one of my Beers (But I only have 6)" and "You were not even born in the 80's" will continue to humor. <br /> <br /> Festival South-By-Southwest film also showed their feature film 'The Devil Made Me Do It ", which will be released in early 2008 in New Zealand. <br /> <br /> All yes, if you can not find these guys are funny, then you can just F% ^ K OFF !!
