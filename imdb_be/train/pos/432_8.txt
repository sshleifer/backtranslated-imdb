I watched it only because it starred Josie Lawrence, who I knew <br /> <br /> from whose line, in the end?, Stupid British improvisational <br /> <br /> comedy show. I was very pleasantly surprised by this touching and fascinating stone. It elevates mood, touch, and <br /> <br /> romantic without being sentimental or school. Symbols <br /> <br /> all real people, with real weaknesses, fears and needs. Look.!
