Hmm, I think that the line of the old posters. <br /> <br /> This is a silent film, which seems to have been translated from any language that was not familiar with the translator. Here's a hint: Any movie that starts with a black screen and the reading of the text "In the future ..." will be fun. This means that the room is so implausible that they should explain to you. <br /> <br /> In this case, "In the future ..." it means that instead of waging wars, countries have guys climb into giant robots duke it out to determine a good thing is never very clear, but it probably something really important. There are good guys (apparently the capitalists, that is "we") and the bad guys (the Communists!) And there are more robots stop motion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the effects of the budget was quite thin, so we don "t get to see a lot of big robots. There are many cheap long-term domestic scene, and then a large space battle at the end. The space combat is especially nice, since it does not serve it purpose other than to strike the remainder of the effects of the budget. <br /> <br /> With the said money now spent climactic fight degenerates into (and I'm not making this up) two guys hitting each other with sticks. I can always get a laugh in the bar, again reproducing the final scene, complete with the last line is guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is nonsense. That's why I bought the tape.
