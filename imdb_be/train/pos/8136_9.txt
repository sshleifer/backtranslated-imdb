This film is a great mocumentary. It follows a group of rap, NWH, consisting of Ice Cold, delicious flavor and tone of protection through a single path to gangster rap highs, lows, and return to the highs. Because of problems with women, ego, police and White, the group gets to the top of the gangster rap world as the movie goes on top of the mocumentaries. I know everybodies favorite mocumentary This is Spinal Tap, for a very simple reason, but I think that if in the right mood, this film is just better. The laughter never ends, even for someone not in the rap culture. <br /> <br /> I'm a white guy who has no interest in rap music, culture or anything else associated with it, but I love this movie, Rusty Cundeif, who wrote songs and played a major role in it have shown great potential, and it's a shame that I have not seen him since Fear of a black hat. However, I saw him one more time than you have, and is what I recommend to you the fear of Black Hat for a quick laugh. <br /> <br /> Remember, "Do not shoot, so you can see the white! .... their eyes? no, do not shoot, you see that white. "<br /> <br /> FYM and enjoy the movie.
