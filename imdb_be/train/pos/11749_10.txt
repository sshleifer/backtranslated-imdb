In the end, we get a series of TV, where we get to see the actor's talent! Episode one was excellent! The script gave us a little more than usual, but there was still "I'm not your father, your father -I and my God you did!" Rubbish, but the scenario has allowed the actors to really feel and live those moments of real, rather than show us he will feel as if-as so much TV do wash. <br /> <br /> The work chamber also gave us a little more than usual, there were no unfortunate angles shots repeated within a few hours had not yet had any unnecessary "shots fired inside or handheld camera shit" do not add "artistic" edge he gave us what we needed to see, as well as some beautiful scenery pictures as well! <br /> <br /> There was nothing melodramatic or overly dramatize they were real people in a real place to deal with real situations, the show is not enough nothing in drama and was entirely appropriate. It was tacos ie relief, exposed to the real action, and so good to our country see how talented our actors can be, if given a real scenario, a real opportunity! Thanks Tony Tilz, Sam Miller, ten channels and all the cast and crew -wonderful job !! please continue what you are doing, your efforts are greatly appreciated and do not go unnoticed!
