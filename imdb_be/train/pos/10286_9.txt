This movie is awesome! While it is funny and interesting, it is also deeply and profoundly instructive. I'll watch it again and again. Bruce is a man who is dissatisfied with his life. He has a job and a life, but it's not what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness. Bruce bitter, unsatisfied and resentful that his life is not so, he suggests that it should be. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing their jobs and blame God for what he thinks is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him divine powers. Bruce uses these powers to get what he always wanted. His life, finally, that he assumed that it would take to make him happy ..... with one exception. In the process of obtaining all, he loses one person who really loves him. As the movie, Bruce learns that the real changes that are needed to occur in his life circumstances did not, but his perception of what was really there. This film was inspired and deeply. If you really pay attention, it makes you look at life with a deeply offensive to the fact that a lot of the time we are so much happier than we recognize. As my wife says, "Yes, if anyone knows what it takes to make them happy?" And my humble addition, "Let us not lose ourselves and those who while we try to find out."
