I just finished watching «Kalifornia» on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw him in July 2001, would you have thought that with the recent wave of mass-produced films killers that «Kalifornia» will be among some of the early worthy of mention films, but It does not. Perhaps if the film was released sometime between 1996-1999, as perhaps it might be more successful. In my opinion, «Kalifornia» is very different from most serial killers films released in the late 1990s. It has almost a completely different atmosphere from most modern serial killer films like "Seven" or «The Bone Collector». Many serial killers films showed the killer, but the man behind the mask is always, or we never see enough of them to really learn something about them. «Kalifornia» is a film that is actually trying to break through this barrier and really understand the criminal mind. He tries to answer questions such as "why they do what they do? Is this because of what happened in their past? There they feel superior and powerful? Or they do it because they love the thrill of the murder? "Here are some of the things that« Kalifornia »tries to answer, but also leaves room for us to try to figure things out for themselves. Brad Pitt makes an everlasting impression as Early Grayce. When we first met Early in the beginning of the film, we see that it is obviously a disturbed individual. When we first see him, it's late at night. In the beginning, probably drunk. Then we see him pick up a stone to throw him off the bridge, and he would later land on the windshield of the car, a passing . Pete is hard in this film. it's always good to see it, yo Mr. playing psychos or really bad people. It's funny that it would later lead him to play a real loon as in "12 Monkeys," and that he would be at the other end of the spectrum, David Fincher's "Seven."
