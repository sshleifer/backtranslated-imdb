Team Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack documentary 50000 Bakhtiaris and their animals on the summer migration to winter pastures. The main value of this film today as time capsule "forgotten people" and how they lived in what we in the West known as the "Roaring Twenties." Sharper contrast could not have imagined. Mad River and bare mountain passes rigidly realistic and animals that disappear under the water do really die. To make sure that the time the audience believed that the story took place, signed by a certificate of authenticity is offered at the end. The version I saw was exciting Iranian music that can stand alone and be judged without the film. Having said all this, the film is probably more valuable to anthropologists than the casual viewer in search of good entertainment in the evening. The crew was there an adequate supply to take footage that they recorded and no fancy camera work as a result of multiple re-takes. Western inter-name detract from the experience, but in fact is part of the recording, as they show how Hollywood has tried to put a spin on the life of the indigenous population lives in such a way that they will be appreciated by the audience of the day. Entertainment off-duty police desert becomes a "ball of the police." Manufacturers have gone on to make a docu-drama Chang (1927) and fully commercial King Kong (1933). The theme of migration is used again in the People of the Wind (1976) and in the Himalayas (1999). It recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into - and then it is strongly recommended for them.
