Oddly enough, all of the previous comments describe just the beginning and left no detail above. I feel the need to confirm that it is a family operation, as well as Marina Vlady was the wife of Robert Hossein, in and - excellent - jazz music was written by the father tÃ« director, Andre. In these circumstances it is not surprising that it was a really good thriller, seen when issued and immediately identified with the music. Suspense was impeccable, and not retained for up to the end. Robert Hossein, while one of the best European players, has managed to impose itself as well as in the main screen and the director. He still put up a big stage shows, preferring religious subjects.harry Carasso, Paris, France
