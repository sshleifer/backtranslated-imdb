This film resonates with me on two levels. As a child I was evacuated from London and put on unwitting hosts in a country village. While I escaped the bombing and had an experience that made the cherished memories (for example, heard a nightingale sing one dark night for the first time) and enjoy life, I could never be in London, I missed my family and cares about them. Meanwhile the old man whose wife and child both died, and who lives alone in a small country village.As old man, who is now without a wife, whose children are married and live far away in another province, I again sometime lonely boy's mother a religious fanatic with a very odd idea of ​​raising a child. Since the deep affection grew between the old Tom Oakley, and this young man, Tom goes in search of him and, finally, saves him from a very odd and unsafe conditions. At the end of the story there is a lot of stress because of some bureaucratic ruling, it seems that the child is going to lose someone who has developed a loving relationship with him.
