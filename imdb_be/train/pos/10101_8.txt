Dominion Tank Police is an exercise in the controversial film. Scene through 4 parts of a mixture of meaningless action slap-stick humor touching mankind and thoughtful philosophical problems. Hard to believe that there is only one director, as the style changes from episode to episode. A must watch film for those who love anime.
