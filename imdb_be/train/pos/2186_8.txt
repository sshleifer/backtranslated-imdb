and that combo. Two great singers of the century star together in this musical is undervalued. He writes music, she writes poetry, and they both work, Basil Rathbone, who can not write or because his wife died (actually she just put on weight!). Best scene pawnshop number where Bing sings an impromptu number while the swing group gets their instruments of collateral. Just perfect. And it is a rare major role in the Broadway legend, Mary Martin, and it is pretty good. Charlie Greypvin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (again manic pianist), Charles Lane, and Helen Bertram roles. And who knew that Rathbone could be funny?
