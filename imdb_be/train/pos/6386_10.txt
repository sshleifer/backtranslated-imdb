Disney, the film's title, which once stood in all innocence and suitable for all ages, finally began to realize that in order to survive, he must become more diverse. Such diversity was very noticeable in the last couple of years. Films such as "Tarzan" and "The Adventures of the Emperor" made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine the last Disney and the new, uncharted territory. "Atlantis" is a bold step, but we must remember: This is STILL Disney. The first major film to come out of the animation studio Disney is a major achievement for them - in fact it is so serious that it makes on the PG territory. Maybe that's why many families have been scared off from seeing it last summer. <br /> <br /> But, in spite of the more mature subject, this is a film that Disney wanted to bring in families, not just the older audience, so the site should be simple enough for children to understand, but interestingly enough, to take it away from the realm of "The Little Mermaid" and others. <br /> <br /> so we get really detail the potential plot, unfortunately, suffering the blow it is condensed into 96-minute film. Ultimately, this action film about Atlantis, instead of the previous exposure, so we slip through the first half hour with so many sequences that act on the screen as possible without losing coherence. Suspend your disbelief, as the characters get from point A to point B, so fast that you can hardly find an animated film, which goes in detail from Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the story, we turn to James Cameron's "Titanic." Both films have the boat in any way. <br /> <br /> But let's talk about love, we have to? So, with a lot of movies, the leading men (one Milo Thatch, clumsy archaeologist) and senior women (Kid cliché princess of Atlantis) is set to fall in love with each other. But what I found was not formulaic, as I expected. By the end of the film, this time, the characters are touching / feeling / kissing sequences were much more muted. There are at different points in the film where the attraction is growing, but it's just not in the stadiums, say, "The Little Mermaid" (a good thing). <br /> <br /> You may have realized that it's pretty formulaic film. That's right. Do you have a leading hero and heroine, backed by more than half a dozen crew members who go on an expedition, all the time gave their moments during the film. are many other characters, take a few minutes of screen time, and then disappear. No need to be a genius to do the math ?? 96-minute film with an emphasis on action and visual effects, as well as with a significant cast has very little time to expand the characters in any large extent. So what hope? Clichés, and many of them. Each character emulates what has been done a thousand times. Do you have a clumsy scientists attractive princess, square jaw, Colonel, a rich eccentric, manic disgusting, Russian femme fatale ?? Do I need to keep me? <br /> <br /> I do not know why it is necessary to someone ?? I found insincere nature of this film is quite funny. Well, it's meant to be a serious Flick, but do you really wait for Disney to give every feature of its history? At least, the authors have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes even a little inspiration. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on the cake. CGI animation is really strange in places, and the dwarf character, which was a flaw that let the recent "Titan" AU Down Talking about the characters, Disney has hired outside the industry to design a comic artist, bringing the anime style for the film. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole needs a lot of anima, far more than any of the previous Disney picnic. This led to a conflict with the fans of Japanese anime, "Hope", for the overall similarity of the film with this animated series. After not seen this anime, I can not comment. <br /> <br /> On the photo, there is sound. Raydstr heads sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the opening shots soundstage alive and fun. James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score that compliments the film in all respects, without ever sounding off and always helps build tension or to suppress it. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed the point that the creators intended. In my opinion, the film conveys that this adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney film in front of him. If you do not like the attitude of mocking clichéd, it is possible that the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. Heck, at least in mythology is much more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts (* cough * * cough * the Hercules). <br /> <br /> This is a positive, 10 out of 10 the number of those from someone who is blown away by this film. I always suspend my disbelief with any animated film ?? In the end, the laws of the real world more than often violated in a cartoon environment. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this movie.
