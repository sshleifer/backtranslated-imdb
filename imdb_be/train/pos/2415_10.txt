I am completely addicted to this show. I can not wait until a week goes to see the next show. this is a great story line, and it has the best actor and actress on the show. I'll tune in every week to watch it, even if I'm not home, I always set my VCR to tape Monarch Bay. Simon Rex is the best actor on the show. it is disturbing and exciting. I think this show should remain in the air, and I believe that everyone should tune in to watch it. I saw the very first episode and in fact I was not going to watch it, but I watched all my life one day, and I decided to see, because it was, and I really love it and now it's my favorite show. I really mean it.
