This film has a lot of raw potential. acute scenario, dialogue (usually) excellent (although it can be to lose cheezy voice-overs), direction and cinematography strangely pretty good, although some experiments simply does not work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. After a freak-boy, always freak-boy; and sad, the simple fact that he is unable to play anything, but Fox Mulder. He poses, he is trying to be smooth, it creates, he is trying to be macho. In the end, he was just trying too hard. He replays his character, he overspeaks his line, and he just outplayed in all respects, Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, which everyone in the class above him in terms of acting skill. Timothy Hutton (as always) very well. It was spotted moment or two when he over-dramatize their role, but you could tell that he was happy with it. He looked the part, and he became the character, both physically and atmospherically. Angelina Jolie was also very good. She did not have much of a role; in fact, I though it could use a much stronger one ... her character was not developed nearly enough, although she did amazingly well with what she had. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was obvious (gee, maybe that's why Uma had left him ...;) In general, it was rough around the edges, but a good solid effort and a large cast of supporting roles. If David Duchovny is not tore it to pieces role it would be * that * much better. 7/10.
