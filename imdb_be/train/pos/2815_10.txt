I can not believe my eyes when I read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews. As if this mediocre film of a mediocre man. <br /> <br /> The film is excellent, funny, crazy, over-the-top violent even with minimal baked blood, and all the ways to the energetic core. I loved every bit of it. I can not think of something crazy, like it's made for laughter, and the art of war glory. And now the most important thing (at least for me): This computer-generated effects for free. When I look at some of the Hollywood actors duking it out on the screen in a modern high-resolution and high-budget action cursed "bullshit" (Russian word for "bull * beep *"), I understand that any * bleep * a child can do it - you you can adjust the wires to the body, add some nice effects PC, and his stuff in the film. Here is another. I do not think there will be a dozen more physically developed action stars in the world, which may be repeated in a fight, which takes place at the end of the movie, or "Chinese football" game. And this is just a little Hong Kong cinema is made for pleasure and not to pretend that "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> With a DVD with an English soundtrack is not a problem with this film. It does not spoil the atmosphere for me. <br /> <br /> It should be noted very carefully the theatrical play. Some of you, let's do not like it. As for me - it's weird. Look at the other dragons, who speaks in the manner of criminals with courage and suddenly gets punched in the left side of the head. His expression changed to something naughty, and he comes to the Dragon with the expression of the child. And look at the size of his mouth threatening - almost from one ear to the other for a long time, if he makes a face <br /> <br /> This film deserves a higher ranking and thousands of comments from people all over the world. Very grateful to our Russian industry for the release of the classic Jackie Chan films. Its modern ones are much weaker, in my humble opinion, and do not deserve a lot of hype <br /> <br /> A total of 10 out of 10 -. The legendary film in its genre. Thank you for your attention.
