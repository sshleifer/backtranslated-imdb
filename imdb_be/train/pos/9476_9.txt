For the sake of Romance, as a married man. We recommend the following two films. <br /> <br /> 1. Brief Encounter David Lean (1945), United Kingdom <br /> <br /> Well, if a woman goes to the train station, it can happen. And it happened! How she wanted to be there, in a small tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married ... the man was a stranger fantasy woman <br /> <br /> 2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun Fei Mu (1948), China <br /> <br /> Well, if a woman goes to the market to buy fish, groceries and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there's a lot to think about that, about the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and no future ... Only when a joyful young doctor arrived, something happened. .. the doctor was a high school honey out of the dream woman <br /> <br /> in both films, from big directors of great Britain and China, passion against Stryi Anas was so intense, but in the end, intimate feelings are not grown into any physical contact. This leaves you with a great taste, sniffing it much does not bite him.
