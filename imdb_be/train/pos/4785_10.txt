[NO SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> As a film by David Lynch, one could have an idea that draws, that the mysterious mind of it, like most of his feature films are doing. But this is a very straight story, the name might hint. No exception to be caught in the conventional vacuum Lynchian inconceivability that usually occurs after viewing i.e. Lost Highway. This is a simple film, but it's a really great movie. It's like with an innovative and fascinating aspect. It is an innovative, because it is not so Lynch. But, perhaps, IS Lynch. He likes to twist our minds and, therefore, puts together a film that may seem very basic and far from the Lynch. Being a very avant-garde filmmaker, he could just make a film like this just to tease him a regular audience, because he knows that they are waiting for, but it does not give it to them. It would be tricky. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is slow. I would even say, the speed of the mower ... Do not wait for an orgy of action, but the film is really interesting for those who go with the flow of the movie. Look closely at the fine details that Lynch storyline throughout the film for our entertainment. Look at the big cinema that makes this film comes to life. And listen Badalamenti cost and the main theme that really enlivens the landscapes of Iowa and Wisconsin, these often. <br /> <br /> The professor puts in one of his finest performances in this film, which makes it one of the nicest men vzbredut ever depicted on film. He did not have to say anything, to express their feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness just shines right through him and his actions earned him an Oscar nomination. Needless to say, that his poor health in this film did not act? He was diagnosed with cancer and committed suicide shortly after the film was completed. This knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film, because it becomes more respect for Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> All the above forms a very good motion picture, which is suitable for all types of people who love the movie the way they should be done. You can ask for a sermon, are not so obvious and a bit naive, but it does not spoil the overall picture, that is a memorable movie. 9/10.
