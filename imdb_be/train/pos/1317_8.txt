This anime has been underestimated until now. Hardly film dumb children, as already mentioned, I will come back to it 10 years after I first saw it. One of the best films released. <br /> <br /> animation, while not perfect well, the focus of cameras to give it a 3D feel and the story is still as good today, even after I grew up and saw the ground-breakers as Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. This is far from the depth, obviously, but try to see it with the carefree view. This is a story to entertain, not a question. <br /> <br /> Another one of my favorites I will be back, too, when I feel like giggling for a carefree anime. Not to say its children's films, there is surprisingly sad moments in it and you have a sense of humor, to see it all.
