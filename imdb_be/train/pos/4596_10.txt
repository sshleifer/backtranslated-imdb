This is the best film of Jackie Chan, and my personal favorite. After U.S disappointment made «The Protector» directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and put it slap bang in Hong Kong. It is also likely, Jackies most violent movie, the audience flattering on bone broken tricks. <br /> <br /> The action fast and furious, Jackie and his team have really put their best efforts into the design of combat. Bones were broken and blood spilled in the making of this film, as you'll see in the credits. <br /> <br /> scenario is simple bobbin case and robbers, nothing special, as it was written around the action. I must say that the English version has some bizarre dubbing, but this should not put you off too much. <br /> <br /> So, get the guys round, open beer and enjoy. By the way, the film earned him the nickname «Glass Story» from the stunt crew. Why? I'll let you find for yourself !!
