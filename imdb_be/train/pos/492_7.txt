First of all, let me say that while I consider each episode StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself a Trekkie or Trekker. Those people who live in their parents basement and visit the convention to wear suits with pointed rubber ears. I gave this film seven historical fiction throwing error. The action was better than average, but the story has not held any surprises. They tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology, but also the special effects were just great temptation. Now for the historical mistakes, if you call them that, first Capitan Enterprise pilot was Commander in April, followed by Captain Pike, Jim Kirk, etc .. According to the statement made by both Ricker and Kirk we dicovered the Klingons and educated them and I gave them the technology, but as I said (this is the reason the Prime directive was created), that these are not an excuse to discredit this wonderful series. I hope that the regions will be deeper, and then the special effects can take over.
