I watched a show on the basis of the saying that it reminds of David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a show that I love. The show starts promptly introducing us to the main hero and the pilot episode is quite unusual for me the best of the lot, it very dramatic and really gets the whole evil side show are ready to progress to the rest of the season. My one big criticism, I felt a little summing up the show - probably not the fault of their own, since it was canceled after only one season, appeared to show the show great potential and he deserves much better treatment than this there. Works perfectly, and this show has some of the best characters (good and evil), in it I've ever seen that well-developed in a short period of time. There is the odd cheesy effect during the first five or ten shows, which are a little too dramatic, but it is corrected during the season. Well worth a look, it is definitely something out of the ordinary!
