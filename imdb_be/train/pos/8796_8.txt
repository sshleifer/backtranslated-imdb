<br /> <br /> Everything is relative, appears to be the main topic at the outset this set of eleven pieces of eleven directors. That is to say, that what may be the number one priority for people like Bush, Blair and the company may not be so for many other people, ordinary people. From the first scene, in which the Iranian teacher trying to impress his young students, the most important thing that happened as a result of children not impressed, as the death of a neighbor, and the like, obviously, affect them much more closely than anything that could happen New York, United states, wherever it is, this series is almost a documentary style works establishes that not all things are equal for all people, as some world leaders will try prophess. <br /> <br /> While it is clear that the attack on the World Trade Center was a vile event by any measure, one does get the impression that both politicians and cameramen have a tendency to blow things from all proportions - perfectly manifested in one of these parts. Will the same reaction at the international level have occurred when the attack took place at Lagos or, say, Jakarta, for example, or even in Rio de Janeiro, they say? I rather think not. News seems to suffer distortion, depending on where things: a much more TV time, given the earthquake in Italy, say, once every ten more devastating in Outer Mongolia, they say. Long distance, it seems to reduce the scale of the disaster. <br /> <br /> This series of eleven parts helps to put things in better perspective - or perhaps I should say, some of the parts do, because each director with full freedom to do their own history, their own point of view, translated, so that it is not possible to judge the merits of the whole, but individually for each eleven-minute segment. <br /> <br /> In no case, one conclusion that is an anti-American film that would be too simple reading various posts appear within the segments. However, this is not something a pro-American. Eleven segments take different approaches and common bond - if there is one - is that the WTC attacks disasters should be considered in the future from a different perspective. Only then will people like George Bush even begin to understand the planet they live on. <br /> <br /> Obviously, he said one segment is the belief of my concealment I for two years: America has not learned the lesson. And the lesson is that the United States had to share the planet with the rest of humanity - not to dominate her ruthless economic persuasion or simply by force. Instead of learning that the US can not continue to simply stamped all over everything, everywhere, its political leaders, aided and abetted by Blair (and even Aznar) have become more arrogant and more intolerable, that does not do any good to anyone in Afghanistan or Irak now, not to mention many others. The mentality of the White House is completely rejectable: US and Britain invaded Iraq and have caused all the chaos, and therefore should be mopped they caused - do not insist on the UN and other countries to delve into with a helping hand and, therefore, to find an easy way out of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Radical Stances, adopted in the United States (or Israel) is only going to be met by the radical position of the Islamic people, who for many years were ready fanatical fundamentalism, just to cover up their own macho futility, ie pelting stones women to death or simply wrapping them on the tops of their heads on the dusty ground. <br /> <br /> The world is in a terrible mess, fueled by the greed of a few rich countries, who seem bent on not seeing and not knowing anything more multilateral perspective. This film in eleven separate parts accurately reflects the dark and silent posture.
