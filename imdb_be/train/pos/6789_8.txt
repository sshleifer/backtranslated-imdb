The Legend of Dragoon is one of those little-known games that people either love or hate. Some people argue that it is too similar to other games, namely the Final Fantasy series - which is understandable, as it was originally intended to be the equivalent of Sony Final Fantasy. Honestly, I can not comment on the similarity in excess of that, since I'm not very familiar with the FF games. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of the game is the combat system. Not only do you have the opportunity to change to a more powerful form of dragoons, but every time you attack, you should pay attention to end the attack button is pressed at the right time. Moreover, sometimes the enemies will attack you back right in the middle of the sequence, which means that you have to press different buttons in order to avoid losses. Even the use of certain elements of attacks requires a bit-button mashing. If you do not want to attack, you can always protect that not only reduces any damage in half, but raises your hits without using healing potions. <br /> <br /> In FMVs pretty well done, about the same quality as the Final Fantasy 8's. However, the schedule of the game is not quite to that standard. They are good, but they could be - and frankly, should have been - better. Translation, as well as poor. This will not only raise interesting questions about the nature of relationships, but there are some grammatical mistakes that just should not be allowed to pass. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found interesting was the fact that you lose the main party characters-- one dies, the other basically becomes useless for the party and leaves. While the death of one character is often said, it makes no sense, it makes you realize early on that the characters, while the characters are still just as mortal as the next person. People who replace lost characters simply get all their stats, so the game-wise transition quite smoothly. Maybe my one complaint about the characters the love interest of the protagonist, Shana. She is the epitome of helpless women who need to be rescued, helpless before the player's driving point of screaming in despair. While you can use it in your party, it is incredibly weak - I do not even know that her dragoon force, as I did not like it so much, I never used it. The character of Rose, on the other hand, probably my favorite female character in any game ever. It is not a wimp, and some of its Dragoon magic is extremely useful. Measure is strong enough, and, while sometimes being annoying talkative child. <br /> <br /> character designers were, as most of them are prone to do the female characters are quite there something, and do not think to the actual usefulness of clothes. Seriously, Sun armor and have most of your exposed skin is not useful in the fight against monsters. But I'll give them props because they have women serving as knights in various countries around the world. <br /> <br /> I can not comment on a lot of the story, but to be honest, I did not pay attention to it for where I need to go to the next. I'm not sure if it says something about the story, or my play style. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very enjoyable game. It has its flaws, but for me it struck just the right balance, to think, and by simply clicking on a button and kill monsters.
