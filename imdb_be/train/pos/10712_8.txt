This film is best described or compare «Big Fish» (The movie by Tim Burton). But it is less glamorous and more you come across an offer. And, of course, there is no father, and his grandfather, who tells the story. <br /> <br /> The story of the film is also moved backward and forward (so the story outline here IMDb, could tell you more than you want to read before watching the movie). It's funny and attractive enough, even if you get from one story to another, and to have some dramatic moments, too. It is also a surprise for you here and there, with the things you did not expect. Good little film that deserves attention, especially if you like movies like this! : O)
