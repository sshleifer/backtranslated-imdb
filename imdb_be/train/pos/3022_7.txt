I never understood that Charles Boyer (Luis denarius) appeared with Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen) in a film together and enjoyed their great acting together. Even Peter Lorre (Contreras) has a role in this film, and it was bad misfortune in her bathroom, which caused him to lose consciousness. This story deals with the Courier republican, Luis denarius that visits England during the Spanish Civil War and is trying to disrupt the contract coal mining, leading to a large expense of other nations. Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) comes to the aid of Louis denarius, lifting it up and at the same time falling in love with him, and then move to help him get away from the angry mob British miners, who threatened his life. The real bad guy in this film Victor France (Licata) "The Beast with Five Fingers," which gives high performance. Large classic film 1945 without Humphrey Bogart.
