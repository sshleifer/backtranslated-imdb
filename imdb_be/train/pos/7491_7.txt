A few years ago, I found a "bargain bin" copy of the movie for a dollar or two. In many ways, it is quite appropriate, since, when it was made in 1933, it was a really cheaply made film based on "raw poverty 'studio, Majestic. However, while the film is rather a derivative, it is still worth a look, and gives few surprises. <br /> <br /> The story is very, very familiar, as in some German city, people are upset because of some recent deaths that seem to be the work of a vampire! Adding to this acquaintance Dwight Fry. He played Renfield in Dracula, and then it is very, very similar - although it plays a much more harmless eccentric. In this case, it is absorbed by your pet bats and people start to blame him for the death. The film does a good job of providing some "red herrings" (ie, false conclusions), and yet he did not take a genius to understand Fry can not be held responsible, WHO and WHY are intriguing and to make it very different from the average horror film. In addition, while the production was not enough money to speak of, it still had a few good actors of the day - Etuill and Melvyn Douglas - and it is also used Universal Studios sets at night (if pictures during the day were made) as a result, the film looks pretty good on the whole, even though I thought that, as usual, Fay Wray was terrible - he did not think much detract from the film. I've seen her in more movies than most people on IMDb and I have come to notice that her characters have no depth - it always seems to be cast as the "crying lady" and provides little new in every film. <br /> <br /> In general, fans of old horror films, this is an excellent and well worth a look. For people who are not supporters of the genre, it's probably a pretty pass to the state.
