Beautiful, free-flowing, often lyrical film that comes along you never smile, even if there is really shocking incidents along the way. One gasps at how women are treated, and ultimately, all they seem to come through very well, and it's a lot of credit to all interested parties, so many potentially catastrophic scenes all work so very well. This is probably the best performance Depardieu, certainly its most natural. Jeanne Moreau performs admirably in what must have been very difficult to play a role, including energetic sex scenes with a couple of guys, at least half his age. Miou-Miou is beautiful all over again and very complex scenes to play. At first it seems down and dirty misogynist recitation / fuss, but as a fairy tale and characters unfold much more gentle and honest picture. In the end, this is a bold and uncompromising film demands respect.
