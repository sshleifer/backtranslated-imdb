I read some horrible things about this film, so I was prepared for the worst. "Mixing. Chaotically. Horribly structured." While there may be some merit in these allegations, this film was not nearly as bad as your average DVD programmer. In fact, it was actually desire. He tried something outside the typical monster / slasher nonsense. And God, there are some interesting things happen. <br /> <br /> Ms. Barbie is a marvel to behold. It carries the film on her shoulders. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that it is a masterpiece. UNHOLY eventually collapses under the weight of its own ambitions. There are just too many (unexplained) podagovorov trying to coexist. A gap plot by time travel has never really solved: for example, if Hope knows that her mother is evil and that it would eventually kill his brother, then why did not she just kill Ma in the very first sequence of the film? It seems that it would beat the hell out of travel into the future to do so. <br /> <br /> However, I give UNHOLY points for trying. A bit of ambition is not a bad thing.
