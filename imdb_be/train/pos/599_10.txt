I thoroughly enjoyed this film, because it was a real sincerity in action. Drafting was second to none. James Arness is a great actor, and he showed it here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and who can really play Davy, but Fess Parker? <br /> <br /> Another great actor in this movement, Raul Julia, who gave depth Santa Anna, vain and complicated man who led Mexico through turbulent times. <br /> <br /> while some may think, the film was slow, he was captured in battle, she turned around, a lot of sadness and then a couple of hours a monstrous terror. <br /> <br /> what struck me most about this film is that it made you think about why and how some people are willing to die for what they believe. in this day and age, when no one is not for that, I found it refreshing think that there was a time when people were dying for freedom, no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time.
