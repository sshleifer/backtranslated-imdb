This, in my view, a very good film, especially for Michael Jackson fans. It contains a message about drugs, superb special effects and wonderful music videos. <br /> <br /> The main movie is centered around the song and music video «Smooth Criminal». In contrast to the four-minute music video, it's a normal speed and, in my opinion, it is much easier to watch. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite strange, however. Michael Jackson plays a magical "bandit" that when he sees a falling star, it becomes a part of the machine. Throughout the film, it turns into a racing car, a giant robot and spaceship. <br /> <br /> Robot scene, in particular, a bit elongated and strange. I found it a bit out of whack compared to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> A child abducted, Michael tries to save her, tortured and beaten, and all of a sudden turns into a giant robot that blows up all the bad guy. A little strange? Yes. <br /> <br /> But, apart from the bizarre scene of the robot, it is a very good film, and any fan of Michael Jackson will be enjoyed as Smooth Criminal music videos and movies.
