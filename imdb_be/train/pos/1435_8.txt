I appreciate such films as: smart and well thought out, entertaining, absorbing, well-acted and well directed. No one - not even Pacino - chews scenery *, trying to stand out; One of the best moments of the film (Aielo pulling on his beloved from the ramp) will be cooling because of its restraint. <br /> <br /> Not as good as, say, a quiz, like the Town Hall tissue: involvement of the mind, as well as the eyes, ears and heart. Why such a well-hewn entertainment flops at the box anyone's guess. <br /> <br /> * Do you know if his chewing Pacino in one particular place, and precisely because it is necessary. Great scene, too.
