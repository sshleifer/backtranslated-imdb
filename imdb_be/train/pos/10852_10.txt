Hello, I was alanrickmaniac. I still Crazy-Holic. It was just another movie that I watched on TV in part. Then I had to get a videotape, to finally find out how it ends. Then I wanted to DVD, since the tape showed the first signs of decay in a few weeks. After the DVD I had to lay his hands on the soundtrack. Then, a few posters of the film and the script of the film. Now he has become so much the worse, I'm trying to push the other person in the relationship with my site and still crazy parties. <br /> <br /> How could this happen? What made me dependent? <br /> <br /> Well, it's one of those funny, but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies as only the British can make. <br /> <br /> Well, the film is worlds apart from such things as «» This Is Spinal Tap "», because of the character that is not a child or an ultra cool, but not really. This is a story about people who are getting older, too. The story of the men to get along with each other. Or not. It contains some of the best actors possible. Timothy Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy, which relies on one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the soundtrack is incredible. Foreigner Mick Jones wrote songs for an imaginary group Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail, who plays bass man Les Wickes and Bill Nighy drawing egocentric but uncomfortable singer Ray Sims really sings. We know that about Jimmy Nail, but if you have only heard singing Bill Nighy in "Love Actually", you do not have the slightest idea of ​​how great and powerful his voice. <br /> <br /> Well, you Fever on each scene, to come to the x-th time, especially those that live scene. You have to die to be able to actually stand in the dancing crowd, when Strange Fruit makes «All Over The World», singing at the top of their lungs. You long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people a real rebirth Strange Fruit on the stage of the festival in Wisbech. <br /> <br /> It's hard, but ... I'm addicted to this film. I'm addicted to Strange Fruit. If there is peace, where this group really exists, I would like to move there. <br /> <br /> Got still crazy ... who?
