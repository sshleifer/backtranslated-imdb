This movie is awesome - it's just like a nightmare. A strange story, dark decors, the swarming of insects in the world, the idea of ​​jumping and surreal dreams ... Really cool! People who love cult films or very dark thrillers will find it fantastic. It seems a little David Lynch film: an amazing story, strange dreams, red curtains. Nuit Noire contains almost no plot. It is rather a series of surreal events, nightmares and meetings. This is a disadvantage. If the movie was really exciting plot, complete with an exciting voltage isolation, I would give it 10 out of 10. But this is not enough, which is why I gave the film 8. Nuit Noire film worth watching. Search this DVD, and you will be rewarded!
