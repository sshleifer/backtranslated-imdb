In November last year I had the opportunity to see this film at the film festival Reno Film. I must say that it was a lot of fun. Several errors technology aside, it was a great experience. I loved to write and act, especially from a guy who played a major role. There is a lot of heart in this film, a lot of wit to. I got a chance to talk with several directors after it was done, and they seemed fine. In general, the whole film was a positive experience, and one I would definitely recommend. The story was entertaining and cool, like a woman, I went through a lot of one and the same problems as a leading man, and I could really understand his problems because of this. The film does a great job of giving us a people, we can sympathize. Friends in the movie really well written, they are realistic. I know these people as they are, I just want to IMY friends and I could sound as cool as these people, if we are talking about. The whole movie is just a real cool, I wish there were more movies out there, as it <br /> <br /> -. Jayden
