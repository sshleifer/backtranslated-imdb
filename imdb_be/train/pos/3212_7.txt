I watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it was not as successful (commercially or artistically), as it should be, and found significant artistic merit -. That may ultimately become her business ruined <br / > <br /> First of all, this film tries to "serious" science fiction, social commentary, more adventurous. There is an action in it, but this is not really what it's about. If you focus on what you end up with (as others have noted) bad "Strangers" clone. But, again, this is not what this is about. <br /> <br /> The film is really about (Kurt Russell) Todd conversion from one person to the nearest car and back to the person (mostly * back *). But since he is not trying to give you the usual answer GLIB Hollywood style, Kurt Russell has to make this transformation, not to mention, and mostly without broad expressions. And he really does an excellent job - it can take two views to appreciate it <br /> <br /> Environment "social logic" is incorrect and it is never adequately explain whether Todd's ability to hold their own against the army. supposedly superior forces based on their experience on the battlefield or its newfound people Ness or that, but the film still does an amazing showcase (easy to underestimate) the talent of Russell.
