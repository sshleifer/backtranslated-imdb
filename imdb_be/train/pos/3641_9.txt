This movie has a few things going for it. This is a "feel good" story. Characters and actors cute, real and present excellent performances. Most importantly, I believe that Dennis Quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looked good as throwing and swinging a bat in «The Natural, and so did Kevin Costner in" For Love of the Game "and" Bull Durham ". In the "Majors" Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen looked like they knew what they were doing, but many others did not, and that the painting was pure folly. - and not a very funny <br /> <br /> So many baseball movies before, even where these stories may be interesting, provided such a disadvantage baseball ability on the part of the findings, they were ridiculous in these respects. in «Stratton Story» and «Strategic Air Command," Jimmy Stewart looked about as believable as a professional baseball player, since your excess weight without sports, middle-aged guy in a softball game on family reunification and other courageous physically strong stars (such as Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig's disease; Robald Reagan like Grover Cleveland Alexander and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean). also exhibited the degree of ability to baseball, which would put them at the end of the round as "picking up" for a game of Picnic Sunday (even if colds, and even if your uncle was involved). <br /> <br /> high school team he coached Quaid scenes, the ones where he visits his attempt with the Devil Rays, and that it played in the lower leagues and two in the American League, all ring true. Participants are believable and capable. In addition, it is an attractive actor who always gives talented and relevant characteristics (except, to some extent, some of his "over-stamp" the scene, and his forced accent in his portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he's definitely on purpose here, and this film is a "9" as good or better as any other of the genre, with the exception of «The Natural».
