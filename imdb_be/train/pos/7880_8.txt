The plot of this pleasant MGM musical contrived and only occasionally funny, dealing with espionage and romance, but the focus of the film is hovering over the melodic interlude which exhibit an extremely talented and athletic tap dance Eleanor Powell, inciting Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra, featuring Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton stock top-Billing with Powell, he and sidekick Bert Lahr given most comic minutes, although Skelton is more effective when it is, if it can be believed, serves as the love interest of Powell, with Virginia O'Brien actually giving the most humor of the film, as a companion dancer. Technical brilliance Powell testifies for one incredible scene in which Buddy Rich contributes his drumming skills, and to be viewed several times in order to allow my breath to catch up with its authenticity. Director Edward Buzzell uses its large cast of well-action move well together, despite the rather convoluted scenario, with whom he has to deal, and allows cotangent Powell inability to manage business as necessary.
