Some people love the "aristocrats" and others hated it, often walking in the middle. Reaction to Eddie Izzard, probably not that extreme - if you can cope with a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and has a vocabulary that makes, say, use the «F» word is enough that its program It will be one long beep if presented on television. Many of IZZARD supporters are so committed that they would see no flaws whatsoever in his performances. On the other hand, I thought that the show was sometimes flatter than Izzard chest, but more often than not funny, and in places, is absolutely hilarious. He has a way of connecting links of the routines at the beginning of the show to a later procedure. He's not a storyteller. He's not a joke producer. He is not a dreamer obsessed with Robin Williams. He plays with ideas, some of which work and some of them - a routine with the cable car in San Francisco and Alcatraz, for example - it is unfunny. He is the way, however, to move gracefully past flopped procedures and expand the ones that connect. I gave this performance 7 and can be persuaded to lift it up to 8. But 10? No way.
