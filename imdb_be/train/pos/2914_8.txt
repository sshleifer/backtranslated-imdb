Not many movies have been made about the lighter-than-air (LTA) aspect of aviation, but this is one of them, and it's damn good. Just a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place in the Navy airship operations at NAS Lakehurst (from NAS Tustin plays a role). Wallace Beery plays nice, but Munchausen-like Senior Chief Ned Trumpet ordinary pilot, whose fables have become so common, no one believes him. Half the fun is closer to the end of the film, when events begin proving that the majority of his more bizarre tales is actually true. <br /> <br /> Set in the Second World War, the main plot centers around a bachelor pipe courtship local widow only eventually, the father and son relationship with crippled widow's son, Jesse. Told he would never walk again without crutches doctors, the main pipe carries the strings and Navy flight surgeon helps in restoring the crippled boy legs. Jess is in the Navy to become a flight officer, flying airships back to Lakehurst and facing a whole new set of problems. <br /> <br /> It is very well done movie, though not without some boilerplate dialogue Hollywood slip past the technical advisers and the apparent inability of the beer to keep up. Otherwise, this film gets good grades for technical accuracy and gives a rare look at the Navy LTA operation. Cash Scene, exchange between the pipe and Jess future love interest Cathy, is an absolute tone.
