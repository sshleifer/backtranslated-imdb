I am determined not in the target audience for this film. I am a man of nearly 50, which has only recently come across in the world of independent film. It happened quite by accident, with the opening of the movie titled Clerks late at night on TV. The first two things that I noticed about this movie was that it was 1) is technically an amateur and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with the director of the local newspaper, and he said that one of his influences was a clerk, I began to wonder. When he said that his main influence was the station agent, a film I saw on DVD a week before that, I decided that I had to go and check it out. The result may be described in the same way as the clerk, although the two films is nothing so content wise. Both films suffer from technical flaws, which overcome through strange letters. While the clerks is the day in a person's life, which has nothing in his life in general, and afraid to ask tough questions about yourself and your situation, Less Like Me about a man who seemingly makes himself constantly busy, he always works anyway, filling your life with little things, so he will never have to deal with a lot. Themes and ideas of the film strong and bitter. I can tell by watching him that not much has changed since I was growing up, young people still have the same problem, they are always there. The writer puts these issues and themes in contemporary jargon, making perfectly honest characters, and they're doing quite a plausible thing. As for the indie film goes, it can not be perfect from a technical point of view, but from an artistic one hand, it is very close.
