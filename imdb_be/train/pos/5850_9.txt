16 years have passed since the original run, I would hope for some right now "masters marketing" would put his live version of this classic actor at the moment, or at least tried to re-release the original 65 episodes. I can not understand why the science fiction or cartoon network is not snapped it. Galaxy Rangers was actually a well thought-out areas, and even better scripts.The animation was above average quality for its time, and excellent compared to said slide shows Japanese animation today. He was preceded by heavy tie Cartoons toys on the market, it can be stated, it is doomed, too. I would be willing to spend the cash on a DVD GH, if any.
