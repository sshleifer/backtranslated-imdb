I just recently bought a collection of one with this amazing series, and even after only watching three episodes, I still am fascinated by the smooth animation style and the slow but deliberate action of the story. I'm still a fan ..... with some minor pain. <br /> <br /> Although this contribution in Gundam saga really cool is the fact that the previous series was satirical, stylish way to tell about the evil of war and hold need to have control or power over all things (sound familiar?), I I must say that this one is getting a little too ripe and Drama to continuing to explain the life of the main characters and their ongoing need for belly ache about every thing that is happening and what they need to do to stop OZ group of success in their plans (especially a character Wufei them ... I mean, he skugoli s a character on the American soap opera. Get adviser, will ya?) <br /> <br /> In addition, for a more exaggerated drama (I think that is mainly derived from the English dub voice actors), this series is still very interesting and will continue to fascinate me again, I mean, it can always be worse. This can be as a recent contribution, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about the school and drama .... I talk about that one later.
