Take 4 couples whose relationship has been on the rocks and put them on an island paradise, where they will tempt 26 singles. This was a prerequisite for the show, a simple but outrageous and ridiculous. Leave it on Fox, to throw morality out the window and let the flow of debauchery. It was like a real life version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it was not about the people, connivance and manipulate each other for the prize. It was about lust and temptation, pure and simple, and the ultimate test of relations. <br /> <br /> People either love the show or hate it. It was kind of like slowing down to look at the terrible accident. You know that you should not look, but you can not help but look. Drama aside, there was plenty of eye candy.
