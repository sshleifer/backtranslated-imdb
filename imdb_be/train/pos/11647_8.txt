I can give you four reasons to see this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Four of the best directors of contemporary Mexican cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories related to the big circuit. <br /> <br /> 3. Surprisingly good throw. <br /> <br /> 4. The bitter reflection on the biggest problems in this country (and many others). <br /> <br /> (Possible SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens the movie with a good story in the mood comedy about the power of practicing extortion against ordinary people, and is still waiting to be assessed effort. <br /> <br /> Then, Antonio Serrano is becoming more dramatic in the second part of the Italian neorealism heir story "Peter and the Wolf» -like anecdote. <br /> <br /> In the third story, the one that seems to be more independent of the series, even in the context of Carlos Carrera tells the story of a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time. But after the recent lynchings in Tlahuac and traditions in this horrible case in the State of Mexico, this story can not be more updated. <br /> <br /> And in the end, Fernando Sarinana returns to the dark humor in the "grand finale" in which he collects most of the characters from the previous sequences in one of the best parts of a comedy ever filmed. Repeating the central scene of one of his previous films «Todo el Poder», Sariñana give the last lesson topic. And by the way, gives us a scene that steals the film with Anna Ciochetti makes a short strip. <br /> <br /> After the movie ended, you will get a bitter feeling of watching a good movie (and maybe like) with a very sensitive topic. They say that in Mexico, people laugh at their own shame, and this is the best example. This film is a testament to how Mexicans to learn to live in the middle of the state of crime (and perhaps took it), between two fires: the criminals and so-called full-corruption authorities. Even this film is wishful thinking, because almost all of the good people become a victim of crime, and they are not getting the whole. If you attack with no zero, then you're in luck. At the same time, do not lose the chance to see this movie, highly recommended. <br /> <br /> And it's a beautiful life in Mexico ...
