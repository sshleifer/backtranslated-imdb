I found this film to think, and the ambiguity of refreshing in the world of quick fixes movies where we have manipulated into loving "good guy" and hated the "bad guy." Scott Cohen, very handsome television actor, does a great job drawing the family black sheep / lost child who tends to get his father's love and respect, as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law, with whom he apparently has a history. Judd Hirsch plays against his usual good guy image as a father who triangulated his son and now remain with the one he has always denied. <br /> <br /> When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was fascinated by the great way sawdust are used to depict the family tradition, as the director explained. <br /> <br /> This is a fitting successor to the classic "Ordinary People." I just realized, Judd Hirsch was in it too!
