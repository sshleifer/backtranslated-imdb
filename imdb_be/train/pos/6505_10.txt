Theo Robertson noted that WAW is not sufficiently secure conditions after the First World War, which give rise to Hitler and the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Perhaps he missed the first ONE, and a quarter hours of 8? Covers this period, and together with the earlier volumes in the series, clearly shows the existing conditions, I feel. My friend grew up in Germany at that time, joined the Hitler Youth, even, and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in WAW. <br /> <br /> This film is still above the documentaries I and History Channel. yourself that there is no comparison <br /> <br /> The only drawback, and it is a little that I WAW is: does not include the many times. For example, if you're talking about the Lend-Lease Act, how much war material lent / rented? How many in Russia as Britian? How many merchant ships were the submarines sink, and when? How many ships were German or Japanese fleet has, in total, in 1941? What are they? How many troops? How many troops were allies, in total and by country? Many numbers could have done a lot of the audience nod off, but I would have preferred more! And, of course, I always want to see more military analysis. How Why not Patton & Clark trap the German army, which was on Cassini, after they surrounded him, not racing Monty in Rome, and let him go? I do not think you can begin to understand the war as long as you have seen some of these movies on the "total war", as the fire bombing of Dresden. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc., before you see the clips of the death camps: you just can not wrap my head around it - it's too unbelievable <br /> <br /> Unknown at the time, and. Of course, unfilmed, it was the most egregious atrocities and inhumanity of the Japanese, including cannibalism, (read "Flyboys"), and some live vivisection medical "experimentation" of prisoners, without any anesthesia! <br /> <br /> Dave
