I went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was pretty packed, and we all laughed because it was difficult to easily skip the line. I knew that it looked like it would be good, but it was much funnier than I thought it would be. I liked how Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed really strange, just like normal people, if that makes sense. I'm sick movies that show how the teenager as a template the people as a "jock" or "geek" or "fan" ... etc .. Both characters were unique, but still a very fine man, and enough to touch. I would recommend this film to all your friend and forward very eagerly to be on DVD, I'll go watch this movie with your friends, who can laugh funny side of life! I plan to see it again in the theater, and I do not go to look at things more than once too often.
