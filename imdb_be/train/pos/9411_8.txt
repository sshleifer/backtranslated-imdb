Sidney Stratton has trouble keeping jobs in various textile factories mainly because of his experiments in the textile laboratories. Stratton is tested according to the formula for a new fabric that will create the final fabric, the one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles or wear out. If Stratton ultimately creates the fabric it creates enemies in all textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money because one mill has exclusive rights), as Stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in England . The film is ideal and only Ealing could do so. Guinness performance (and a great supporting cast, such as Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and direction MacKendrick make the film enjoyment, but the real hero story itself, good satire of business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance and suspense. Rating 8.
