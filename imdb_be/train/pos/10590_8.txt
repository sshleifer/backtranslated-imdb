The series was a cut above the rest of the TV detective series of the day, but did not find an audience. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a blind detective may not be entirely new, but added so much to the story. And who could forget Pax, beautiful dog-guide in the series! <br /> <br /> While the stories in themselves could not be better than in the middle row, setting, in New Orleans, acting and music (I note the comment at the score in the other comments .. . I remember clearly) all work to make a good TV series even better! <br /> <br /> Well, you never know ... one day Paramount can simply dig in their archives and to release it on DVD!
