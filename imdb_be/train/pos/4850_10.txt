So your Bairns leave to sleep over? Wife visited her mother-in-law? Do you have any at home. It's a dark and stormy night, and there is no football on TV and dishwasher requires installation? So, what are you going to do? <br /> <br /> I'll tell you! <br /> <br /> Go make old-fashioned cocoa (Frys better!) to get nuts ginger and sit in front of a DVD. Now go to select and play Arthur Askeys WWII thriller / horror The Ghost Train, return to this comfortable sofa and enjoy the night! <br /> <br /> The Ghost Train is a real British military time classics! Arthur Askey with his side kick, bitch Murdoch, entertain you, and I suspect that the cast, to the high-octane thrills and spills, espionage thriller.It tuned in an old rural England during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> it centers around a motley group of people who have to stay for the night, through circumstances beyond the control of any one, in the old railway waiting room, they discover an old haunted train. <br /> <br /> plot unfolds gently and precisely this is the merit of the whole cast is a humorous side, and sometimes really scary! <br /> <br /> (The story was written by this boy Godfrey glory Dads Army and reasonable) <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey exciting and very much at home briquetting its procedures for you and throw it also shows that he can act a little! The cast never put out, though, even a railway porter and a parrot helps to give the film the necessary ambiguity. <br /> <br /> Oh, and when it ends, please remember to stack the dishwasher!
