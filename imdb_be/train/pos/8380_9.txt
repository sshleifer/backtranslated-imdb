Now I have always been a supporter of puppet work full moons. But I must say that Robot Jox is one of the best projects out there. Yes, you heard me. History is working fine, the atmosphere really works, and the actors are doing the work of the first course. Harry Graham who really makes its mark on television in shows like ALIEN NATION Series and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE shows that he can be a star of action which tears and takes the name. Stop motion effects can be a little bit better. The color was not right, they look to me plastic instead of metal they are suppose to be. But this is a minor complaint compared to the whole, it's a robot Jox, if you like Harry Graham or other Full Moon movies, you'll love this movie. 9 stars out of 10.
