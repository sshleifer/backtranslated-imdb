How many pilots series opener Dark Angel features a mixture of a large capacity and a small problem finding its own feet. Not that this is unusual in any way, but there is a feeling that it would work better if the story has been tightened and focused a little more. In today's world, where you need something to hold on instantly or revocation of a person has made a series of little disservice by staying at least halfway focused, with all guns. <br /> <br /> Ninety minutes the pilot actually feels like two episodes, glued together, and both have an episode with a focus problem. In the first half, we meet Max and filled with something that makes it. We also get some interesting procedures with Max, using their ability to win the bet, interacting with PI or sorting internal problems with the staff. The problem here is that there is nothing unusual for any person with a normal set of genes, on television or otherwise. <br /> <br /> This is when we were in the second half, we get the story of the purpose and focus. Within two halves, Max finds himself in the spotlight with a pirate journalist who feels that the mission in life is to save the world, exposing a dirty dealer at the time. In the second half, the consequences catch up with him, and Max cleans reluctantly formed a mess. This creates prerequisites for the rest of the series, and it works, but it does not quite click, when you get my meaning. It is, like most of the parts there, but a couple that make the entire image has been omitted. Perhaps, they are filled with the use of the later episodes, but it is irrelevant. The fact that the contents of this episode could be easily said at least twenty-eight minutes. <br /> <br /> The last of the negatives is that many of the actors fully support unendearing. Original Cindy, in particular, irritation, and I doubt that has changed over the next two episodes. While the action is not as bad as in the daytime soap, not of this quality, I recommend it. Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world, but it comes with a short point of view to be convincing when the story needs it more. <br /> <br /> The good news is that the premise and the value of production of all the best. In fact, this series is considered to be quite expensive to produce, and it is very sad that it was canceled to be replaced by another show that lasts all season. Especially when there is enough time for both shows - they could just cancel one of the pieces of debris disingenious they whipped the flag of a reality show. The fact is that we need more shows like Dark Angel, where the representation, not overhype, which are used to attract attention. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave Dark Angel seven out of ten pilot. It never rises above the idle level of television, and he never got a chance to live up to the potential he had shown at the time of running. But the potential is there, and it is often all that matters, when the pilots concerned.
