I have always loved Pok√©mon movies. Yes, I know, they are all very banal, mediocre in some specific areas and are confident, even if they are aimed at young children, they are too old in some areas to be able to protect them with the statement, "Hey, lighten, it is a film children" but all that aside, not all of them are still good pieces of entertainment? I think they are so and I love them very much. this one is just as enjoyable as the previous three, and, of course, appealing. it has some really sweet and touching moments, as is the introduction of an attractive, fresh Pokemon Celebi. this is not a we are the best Pokemon movie, but I enjoy it more than a third party, even though the third is not bad, and the whole series just fun, harmless, popcorn, a family vacation and should not be considered nothing more, nothing less. This the film has some high scores and intensity of interest, especially around menopause / termination, as well as all payments, as well as signs, while a little more dull than the previous three, I thought, still handsome and with a sense of humor. This film is the lowest rating and the most criticized of the four full-length regulation, and he does not deserve it.
