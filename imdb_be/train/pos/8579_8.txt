Plot: A crime insole combines 3 different mafia entreprise buy an island, which will serve as a means of laundering money for organized crime. To thwart the FBI is trying to destroy one of the mafia lords. It is not the case, and some improbable plot twists and turns, we presented another "KS friends who do not like each other," the movie ... one being the female FBI agent, and the other man's ex-DEA agent. <br /> <br /> still so stupid. But the strength of this film lies not in its history - a bad anecdote, at best. This is ridiculous. (At least, the synchronized German version). The action is good, too, with a memorable scene with a gun shot and a rocket launcher. But the focus is directly on the humor. Nha intelligent satire, it is not a farce, but somewhere in between, you get a lot of funny jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is the opposite of political correctness. Legal drug abuse features prominently, without criticism, and even showing him how cool. It's a little film that seriously annoys me and makes it unsuitable for children, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> In general, for a nice evening watching reach an acceptable action with some funny jokes, this movie is perfect. Just remember: in this genre, it is common to leave your brain at the door when you walk into a cinema / TV room. Then you'll have a good time. 8/10
