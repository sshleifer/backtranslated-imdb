The good thing about this film: The concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. It also makes you think about the little things in life that could significantly affect the life of someone else, you do not ever know. It's a small world, and this little film shows us <br /> <br /> The bad thing :. There are too many characters, and it is difficult to say who is the main character, but it is still a great movie <br /> <. br /> it a great film and many people compare him to Magnolia, I have not seen. <br /> <br /> 8-10 <br /> <br /> not rated --- I would rate it PG -13 for short-violence, some language and sexual situations.
