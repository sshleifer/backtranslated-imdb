What a wonderful film, entitled to many labels it will never be: science fiction, film noir, with the original dialogue and high intelligence, which provides an educated, cultured audience ..... kind of cinema language in English only made until 1960 England ( and shown in the US art house cinema when he first arrived), and never, ever done in the United States. <br /> <br /> The main characters in The Man In The White Suit (1951), starring Sir Alec Guinness, Joan Greenwood and typically use highly complex, reference word science as "polymer" and to discuss and explain the concept of chemistry as " long chain molecules ", and then communicate the importance of the man in the street and science are the advantages of it. <, Br /> <br /> Man in the White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the explosion of video games movies, which are now (2009) dominated the film world, and, of course, dominated by major US movie ....... it acted cautiously, intelligently told the story of a gifted and believable educated British actor (who pushed educated, sophisticated people), and it's all done with comedy, charm, pathos and irony, that the ancient Greek playwrights would have approved. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this film, and someday, somehow, some worthy director and his supporters have to make another one like him. <br /> <br /> This is great.
