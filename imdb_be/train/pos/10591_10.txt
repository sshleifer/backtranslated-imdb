There is no doubt that the Ealing comedies are good, but for me, this film stands out as one of the best. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the film is that a small portion of Pimlico in London found that a part of Burgundy, but not in the UK. Then follow the lives of residents in their fight to keep the treasure found after bomb explodes, and stay in the black market traders who soon realize that freed from the law of the UK, there is no standardization. When they become prisoners in their own street, because the government has decided to close the border, we see them fight against the system. <br /> <br /> They are forced to ration food and water in their stand for what is right. In fact, getting worse than they were before all this started, there comes morality. This is when they lose all the food that they think they are beaten and calling for surrender, but to the whole of London to respond to their plight by sending food, lots of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle. <br /> <br /> right note This film hit all acting beautiful, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren, standing out. This camp just right, not too sentimental and moral of the story is not shot down his throat. Well worth viewing
