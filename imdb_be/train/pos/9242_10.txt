It is difficult to evaluate such films like this, so how do you assess its production or just having fun? <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie back to about 1988-89 or so when I was a boy, and I'm sorry to say that the beginning of a lifelong fascination with ninjas. The plot is quite pathetic and action, of course, terrible, but there is a certain mystique surrounding the ninja in this film, which makes for a pretty good atmosphere. Important scenes struggle, while the "little» sparce, really good. <br /> <br /> I have to say that it was better when I was a boy, but now I can see glaring moments of incredible stupidity in the film, but as a "sit down with a few beers," a martial arts film, I can not accuse him, and it provides a lot better than the mountains "American ninja" Style debris that is produced in 80 years with hundreds of guys in black suits, but really not very good fight scenes. <br /> <br /> in an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, writer and director Sakura Killers took another ninja movie under the flag of Bonaire film called «White Phantom» I have no idea where it was to be a continuation of Sakura Killers », Sakura clan but again the main feature, including the same logo and a similar story except this time including the White Ninja. it is also, at the same time generally lamentable, there was a slight sense of atmosphere, but the action scenes more sparce and being open, pretty creepy. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a fan of martial arts, then give it a blast to kill a few hours!
