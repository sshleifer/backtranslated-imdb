Robot Jox does not suffer from history or bad consequences. I mean, it was in 1990, when you know what I'm saying. RoboCop 2 is still used stop animation, most movies have been doing for 80 years. If you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period, most of them was that they could with the help of special effects shots, which were available to them at the time. It was not until the Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released the following year, a breakthrough in technology has been implemented, and the history of snowboarder started using this motif. But you will have fond memories of the Transformers, Gundam Wing, even the Power Rangers, if you watch this movie. The enemy robot is very ominous. It makes you not want to run into a man without a really good backup plan. And there are some great moments in this film. Traitor / spy working within their midsts. Who do you think is on your side, supporting you all the way, can be the person you do not expect him / her to be. And it is very troublesome to think so, do not you agree?
