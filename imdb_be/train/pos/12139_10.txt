This film, despite the fact that more than 70 years, is still very moving, powerful film. Bette Davis as a fornicator, a vicious Cockney waitress Mildred is absolutely plausible. Watching her performance still fascinates. It makes the viewer absolutely despise her and her shame at the same time. Leslie Howard's performance as weak, obsessed Phillip Kerry is not that strong, but I do not see how any actor could hold their own against the statements made by Ms. Davies. She chews the scenery in every scene she is totally eclipsing. This is a film that sealed her stardom, and she deserves to win an Oscar, but lost. It was a shock for him a day, that the unmarried pregnancy, multiple sexual partners, and so the vicious language Mildred somewhat outdated, but still a wonderful film. Just to see the scene where Mildred said to Philip that she really thought of him ( "You Cad, dirty pig ....") are still some of the greatest acts I have ever seen on film.
