A unique film ... one of the best of all time. Acting, script, Quincy Jones score, cinematography, editing, etc. - fantastic. Because most viewers know this film is based on a book by Truman Capote about a famous murder Kansas farm family (clutter) for a couple of young men during a robbery misinform. I have never seen a film that so brilliantly transformed profit into an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> actors are solid in all areas, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry and law enforcement teams chasing them. Scott Wilson, Dick Hickock strange. Saucy, irritable, and devoid of sympathy, he comes across as sweet, thick and believable. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well - alone, and immediately sensitive and discreet. Who could make these characteristics in one person and make us buy? He does, and it's great! The key point of the book, she took the intersection of these two very different sociopathic people to create a critical mass to make such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors to make it work perfectly. Both were moments in their subsequent careers, but these high performance water assessment, and what is behind the period. <br /> <br /> cops are excellent too. Which is investigating the John Forsyth, but the other three detectives are great as well. Unlike modern movies where producers consider that it is necessary to endow the police superhuman assets or weaknesses, this is only true flatfeet, working deals with the determination and competence. They seem so real. I've never seen cops on the screen is so powerful as to their authenticity; and I have seen most of the classic offenses that go way back. Truly one of a kind in this regard. <br /> <br /> partial SPOILER COMING (this film is unique in the fact that you already know what happened, but I warn you to record). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes of the best crime shows and movies are questioning - intellectual fencing match between the police and criminals, Mano Mano. This film is hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on film. See Dick and Perry are trying to cheat your way to the end and slowly unravel, not knowing that the police have the goods on them. But the police have suspected them deftly preparatory to the destruction of their alibi, and we hope to find confessions. This is some of the best action you'll ever see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross, without self-promotion. <br /> <br /> To help translate awful boring and corners of this true story, the ICB was filmed in the actual Clutter house, and I heard that the movie played clutter the students to give them a real sense. It works. They seem like a decent, ordinary people. This makes the crime is so palpable, and sad. <br /> <br /> I'm going to stop there. This is not a feel-good movie, but it's one of the best films ever made, and is so unique, it is necessary to view each movie naked.
