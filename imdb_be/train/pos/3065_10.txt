<br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. One of those rare films that Hollywood does not do more. William H. Macy is just fine as a killer with a soul, and Neve Campbell just flat-out fantastic, like a woman who puts his life on the road of redemption. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see this film. He gets this praise
