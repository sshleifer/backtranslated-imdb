I had to pin the red-eye. This is not a masterpiece, but it is well focused and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams is perfect in the role. Yes, it's the same old story with a different situation, but Wes Craven gave him a good pace. At least, not another cry from the usual college killer. This is good if you can see a clear, coherent thriller, even if the original does not stand out as the main character. In particular, a film-maker like Craven, who brought so many innovative ideas for the thriller and horror genre in the past, and now only lends itself bringing home that might be, if he was not released theatrically good TV movie. Good job!
