Well, I'll be honest, when I first saw the trailer for the program, I thought it was an advertisement for some sun screen product. With all the people walking around on the beach. In spite of this, I decided to look it up, thinking it'll be a new show that I could laugh. But I was seriously surprised. <br /> <br /> Since the first 10 seconds of the program I was hooked, why he was lying on the trees, why the plane crash, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> It's not every day that a show comes along that combines intelligence, humor, action and suspense. But «Lost» manages it all. With a great cast and crew, beautiful places, and pretty decent special effects, «Lost» will catch everyone who sets up and it's a must see for anyone who is sick and cheesy comedies Crappy reality. <br /> <br /> Loss on Tuesdays 10 on channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = a
