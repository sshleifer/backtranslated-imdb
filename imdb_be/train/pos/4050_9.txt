Anyone who thinks this movie boring hopeless dullard, who must follow the car chase movies and romantic comedies. This film is a riveting and not a boring moment. Why? Because it consists mainly of intellectual dialogue between real people in a time of crisis and in detail their efforts to survive the crisis. I repeat - the intellectual dialogue! This is what characterizes almost all movies Romer, and that is why many people do not like them. They prefer action. Well, let them spend the rest of my life, watching fighters, while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to look for films like this. <br /> <br /> Romer has always been accused of «Talky.» Well, it is, but for me it's a compliment, not a criticism. Shakespeare was Talky, too. There talkier game than "Hamlet?" Each time, when the subject or theme of a work of art is made up of ideas and conflicts over values, there must be a discussion of these ideas and values, up, basically what this film is all. Aristocracy and noble origin against egalitarianism; loyalty to an old friend, who put to the ultimate test if this one takes what we believe to be the wrong way; the value of human life and the responsibility to help keep this life, even if the person holding that life is not as good, or even mean. (Has anyone ever heard of Dostoevsky, or "Crime and Punishment?") This is what this film is all. <br /> <br /> The two leads in this film is impeccable, as if they were born to to play these roles, Lucy Russell, which is in English and French as her second language, especially brilliant. Do yourself a favor and see this exciting film. This may be the last film of the Master screen.
