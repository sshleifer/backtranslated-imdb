Things Going early is Sci-Fi film, which shows the imaginary world, or «Everytown» 100 years. You can break it down for about 4 different scenes or parts. The film covers the period from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how the ruler or the «Boss» would like to be able to fly in an airplane again, after Everytown bombed and war. <br /> <br /> This is the only film has about 3 mistakes: this is the sound muddy and video have been some strange, shallow characters in general, but the overall story is not quite solid. The site lacks something, that I can not put a finger on ... it just seems a bit "fuzzy." But if you love science fiction and are interested in the fact that, although perhaps there was HG Wells, in the next hundred years, it must be seen . It is worth seeing just to find out that everything was afraid :. long, protracted war, because they were just about to go to war with Germany, and there is a threat of biological weapons and all <br /> <br /> future things are pretty good movie that most people need to see once.
