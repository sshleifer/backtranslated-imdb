This film, I never even thought to see, while my 3-year-old did not notice it in the video store and grabbed him after loving the little animals on the island Nabooboo image. We got it and watched it several times since then; in fact, we rented it several times since then. There are very few non-animated films that my son will watch and pay attention; What a nice change from the Dam and the Little Mermaid. Action is outstanding, compelling lyrics, they penetrate deeply into your head and you can not help but sing along. The storyline, namely 2 infinite in its own way, and there is something new to see every time you look. I heard that compared to Mary Poppins, but I think they are two very different movies, and great, but for some reason my son has no interest at all in Mary Poppins. This is one of those movies that the kids want to again and again, and one that parents will not mind watching conservation. There are days we are watching it before nap time and bed time, and I do not feel like a groan comes, that comes when he wants to repeat any other film.
