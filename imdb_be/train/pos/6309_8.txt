I saw this rock film in Cannes, where it was part of two weeks of Directors. <br /> <br /> Welcome to nothing but how great to Collinwood. A lot of fun in everything with all the members of a strong cast acting their socks. This sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman), who comes trying to steal a car and sent to prison. While in prison, he meets' Lifer "who tells him about the` final Bellini "?? that you and I ?? this is a sure-fire get rich quick scheme. It turns out that there is a way through a deserted building in the city jewelers shop ?? which could net millions. Sounds simple? ?? good throw at all kinds of eccentric characters and incidents along the way, and you have the ingredients for a wild ride !! ?? word passes from one low life loser to another, and soon the team are going to try to capitalize on Cosimos `lead Bellini" failed boxer Pero (Superbly played by Sam Rockwell ?? definitely star in the making) and reluctantly fraudster Riley (William H. Macy ), who is forced to bring their child along with him, as his wife was shut down for fraud !!. <br /> <br /> on the basis of Italian film I Soliti ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna Street), which is also inspired by a similar film on `Collinwood" ?? `PalookavilleÂ». It knocks spots last effort, and although his Written and directed by brothers Rousseau it certainly has shades of the Coen brothers about it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small but fun part of the cripple both safety switch.
