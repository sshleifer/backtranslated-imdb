The brightness of this film is that even a competent dentist's pretty scary. This is one of the initial fears of man. This film is a nightmarish image every child should go to the waiting room. Bernsno gives strange, is not a bad performance as the crazy dentist, which I guess is trying to kill the man, but it only works on your teeth, so it really does not work. In a particularly bloody scene, we find the so-so actor Earl Boen, having teeth completely destroyed drills and whatnot, I think it's the worst thing you can do if you are a killer dentist. This is a typical situation of the Union, is not very well written, but there is blood. The plot is bad and at times seems to be done on the spot, but hey, it's a killer dentist movie, we all thought about it, but they did it first.
