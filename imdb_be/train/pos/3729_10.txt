Although I believe that this film can get a rap as an anti-Vietnam, watching it, I did not feel that this is the case, how much film was just an honest look at the prospects for young people are trained in the war that the public did not support the .... it showed their fear, their despair, their disc ... all of this in an open, naked. As a soldier I have many themes rang true to me in my experience in the military - particularly the camp load. Overall, this movie, even though it was shot on a very small budget, looks great, very well together, and has a great acting and directing. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for another perfect Colin Farrell film. 10/10
