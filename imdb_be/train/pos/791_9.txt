Having no knowledge of the film to see it on Channel Rialto I found it to be enjoyable, poignant and enriching film. <br /> <br /> The casting was great. I loved all the characters, they were a little exaggerated in places (but it's the film). As it looked nice and was spinning drive head protagonist took far failed badly as a real life can and does. Yes, I thought, Andie MacDowell was great. I was particularly interested to see this movie as soon as it began, because people so often joke about his acting abilities (I find it quite strange, because it is always a solid actress in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I loved the end of the bat, in which he said the character of Andy, "sometimes I feel that he has never been here", etc., that was as far as it is actually in such a situation (which I can personally identify with), that is to say that a great classical work "Nocturne" I think Chopin, who was a great way to end (the bar of light comedy in the end, that's probably not necessary) <br /> < br /> I say "well done" to the filmmakers. - I have seen the 1000 s of the worst films!
