Life begins - and ends - in a typical 1930s, maternity / recovery ward, where we look at 48 hours in the lives of several high-risk pregnant women, playing Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandick (Auntie Em ??? ), Vivienne Osborne Dorothy Wood and Gloria Shea as they wait to give birth. While the film shows a plot device, which seem far-fetched today, when the maternity wards are much more controlled and limited, he invites us to look back in time, to see what gives rise to the typical municipal hospital in 1932 was for our grandparents and grandmothers. I found the film fascinating and very moving. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the most outstanding performance in this film comes from the male cast, the young Eric Linden, Jed Sutton (Loretta Young), husband of Grace. Which actor! For the first time father, Jed confused and concern with the hospital staff, who seem to shake their concerns about his wife as they could clean the crumbs from the table cafeteria. I felt his every anxiety acute. I would like to see more work of this actor. It was a very emotional voice, which has been used for a memorable effect in Gone With the Wind. In this film, Eric played a young soldier, whose leg was amputated without anesthesia, who shouted, "Do not cut! Nha cut!" Scarlett fled from the hospital in horror. Cool! Another great performance by Aline MacMahon, who plays Miss Bowers, a nurse. Her character is the salt of the earth type, the kind of nurses we all hope to get to our hospital who violate the rules of the hospital constantly, in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young made another excellent acting work here, as well, very authentic and a deep sense of performance as Grace. Oh, it is great in these precodes, I really grew to appreciate her more as an actress in the past few months. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell played a role piercing unmarried mother bit over the top for my taste (I do not know who else is in 1932 that sipping cognac from a bottle with hot water can be dangerous for the health of unborn babies?), but her character redeems himself in the end. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast was titers Gilbert Roland, silent movie stars like mourns Italian husband. His screen time was short, but noticeable. <br /> <br /> Life Begins is a must to see the pre-encode, try to catch it someday on that, but do not forget to take a few scarves to cry. 9 of 10.
