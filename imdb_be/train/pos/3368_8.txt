Hitler's visit to Rome is the background of this tender story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays a housewife and mother of six children, who stay at home, and her family go on a military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She should stay at home, because the family can not afford a maid. She loved to go, though, as she, along with all the residential complex where she lives is an avid fan of the Duce. <br /> <br /> There is one exception, though. Across the yard sits Marcello Mastroianni in his chair, contemplating suicide. The reason? He was homosexual, and due to the fact that recently lost his job as a radio announcer. The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni desperate and in dire need of a friend. Loren, disappointed by her own husband cheating incorrectly explains Mastroianni and masterfully shot, directed and acted in a scene on the roof of the complex offers her body to him only to be rejected. Starting packed replaced shortly after her hunger for this person, this anti-fascist, this homosexual, another world, which is so ready to give her all that she misses. <br /> <br /> This is a beautifully crafted film with two of the most talented actors ever. Loren proves here that she is an actress of caliber, if well directed. This is a simple, yet powerful film about fascism, love, simple people, and most importantly, the human condition. Despite the sad ending there is a glimmer of hope at the roundabout, then it changes someone realized.
