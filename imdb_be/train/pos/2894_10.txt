As a child, I always hated the kind of "Cinderella," since I was in the minority has two sisters, when my parents were considering that the Disney film to buy. I wanted to "dam", but won my sister, and we got a "Cinderella". They thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and I sulked in the back room, playing with my Star Wars figures. <br /> <br /> A lot has changed since then. My love of the Disney theme parks I landed an internship at Walt Disney World, and now I have two young nieces. I would like to show them to Disney as much as I can, and we have recently seen "Cinderella" together. With my new-found appreciation for everything Disney, I was watching "Cinderella" with a new perspective, and was amazed at what I saw. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of the movie, though, I do not quite understand why Cinderella was caught in a terrible situation. Why is it such a slave her half-family, and why she could not just run away? I was not too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I discovered that becoming immersed in history. Can be released animations or funny characters attracted me, or maybe it was the eternal song. Listening to songs like «Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo» and «Dream is the desire of your heart makes" a kind of whipped me into the theme parks. I can imagine myself in this light-hearted and fun atmosphere, looking at the impressive Cinderella Castle. <br /> <br /> Something about this film is just the magic of Disney. This can make a lot of people make fun, but to go to the Magic Kingdom and see all of the little girl dressed like Cinderella, who are happy to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm saying. Images of Cinderella and the glass slipper - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Tinkerbell - embody why Disney is one of the most popular companies in the world <br /> <br /> While the "Cinderella" can. not the strongest plot is kind of a landmark in the history of cinema and Disney. He is having fun, idealistic, and imagination as a surprise we spent when we were kids. I believe that this film has a lot of meaning for many, many people out there. This may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it is everything that I love and admire about the company <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating :. 10/10. My Yahoo! Rank: A (Excellent)
