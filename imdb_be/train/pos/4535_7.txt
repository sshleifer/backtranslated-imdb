The first 50 minutes of this film was pretty boring. It is focused on personal issues Doyle, including his sick wife, death threats supporters pushy publisher and guilt about his mentally ill father. Even if these items had a great influence on the life of Doyle, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were delicious. We finally got a look inside Doyle's head as he created the Holmes and why he had to "kill" Holmes. Actors perfectly. Including intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, the compelling role Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as a "role model" for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The location is good, especially for a television movie and the camera work is good. If the first 50 minutes were good last 40 minutes it would be a small masterpiece.
