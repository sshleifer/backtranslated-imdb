....... Games Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. the man was a fairly wide range of issues and cry. I love to watch how he interacts w / Amanda Blake, or Don Knotts or someone - he was clearly with the ball and I think he made it easier for your guests as well - as long as they knew ahead of time was not disciplined, 19 take the form of products. Relax and be free, it was clear the name of the game there. <br /> <br /> He reminds me of guys like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe Jerry Lewis some too. Great timing, ancient jokes that kept the audience in the paths for decades, the very pleasure that he does. His sad clown he played too well. - but in a touching manner <br /> <br /> Personally, I think he's great, just bought two DVD-set of his show from '61 or so, it brings back his things in a loving way for me. I remember seeing him on TV at the end of its run, when he finished the series in 1971 or so. <br /> <br /> Check it out if you are a fan or curious. It was a riot.
