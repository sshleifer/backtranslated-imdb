This is a real character, and the plot of the drama at a level that shames most of what we see on TV in a month. <br /> <br /> I was impressed from the start. Do not worry if your not Sci Fi nut (like me ...) This can happen on the ground that it in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting. NO spaceships and laser guns (None yet anyway) So far, I've seen S01 E04, and I grabbed and wondering what will happen next, because there are so many possibilities. <br /> <br /> cast to play there role with Pasion. Eric Stoltz particularly strong. <br /> <br /> This show really stands out well, it does not matter if you watched BSG or not, they are actually quite different. I have read some negative reviews of the science fiction geeks who expect less drama and more aliens and ray guns, etc., but I would say ignore them. <br /> <br /> This is a really positive start to show. Let's hope they do not CANN it through the 1 or 2 season as they usually do good shows these days.
