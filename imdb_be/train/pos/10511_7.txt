"Emma Woodhouse," Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, duets) has nothing to do with herself, but the pictures, walking with his friends on his car up and down, say hello to the people in the city and trying to match to do all that she knows. I think there was no cinema, no television in those days, and she had nothing to do but gossip. I want her to read a little more. Like Gwyneth, and I think it is a lovely young woman. She is talented, and one "Emma" has the privilege to hear Gwyneth sing. I look forward to meeting with "Duets", where it is suppose to sing. She boldly speak British English with all the carriers of the Britons, including sister, Emma Thompson, "Miss Bates' Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and a Funeral, dancing at Lughnasa). "Mrs. Elton» Juliet Stevenson (Indeed, Madly Deeply) is considered one of the most promising actors of 1991 Gwyneth is part of the American movie royalty without being none other than the daughter of film director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elsewhere) and Tony Award winner Blythe Danner (Myth Fingerprints). It will hopefully be around for a real long time. Lucky us! I like Emma, ​​as well as recommend it. This is one of those old stories that still true these days. Favorite scene: Emma sing and play the piano. I especially love it when she sings a duet. Any quotes: Mr. Knightley, "Emma, ​​you did not ask me to contribute to the puzzle." Emma: "All your identity a mystery, Mr. Knightley, I thought you were overqualified." Miss Bates, "He left us speechless , completely speechless, I tell you, and we did not stop, because to talk about it. "
