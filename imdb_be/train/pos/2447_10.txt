George Lopez never caught my interest for him to stand up comedy, and he still has not. But this show is a work of art. It will never show where the jokes to keep you laughing every time you remember (and jokes that again in this memorable). This show has raised just look at him and the characters between the old, short to dyslexia drunk teenagers. I do not know who wrote this show, but this man is doing a great job. If they only continued to show I am sure that he will get a positive response from critics of this great country. If you are looking for good, traditional comedy, then the George Lopez show for you! One bad thing is the name. George Lopez? Really? Imagine Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is the "Will Smith." Come on man! But otherwise, this show is a genius! 10/10
