This is one of the best Bollywood films I have not seen so far. Family and friends feel the same way about him. This film is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more movies or films like this to keep alive the culture of South Asia. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao acted very well in this, as well as the pair attracted many people to the movies. This is a must see film, it is a family and a romantic movie. This film from the creators also do us part and Hum Hain Apke Kono. This film is their best right now ... Installation of the film was beautiful, which is also a huge attraction. This movie must see ... it is recommended for all !!
