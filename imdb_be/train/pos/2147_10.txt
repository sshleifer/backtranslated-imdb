I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the reality of a long train commute, bike rides from the train station, soups stands and other typical scenes are depicted so well, of course, add my thanks for this movie, which I really, really loved. There are aspects of Japanese life in this film is painted with bright colors, but you do not speak Japanese, to enjoy this film. Director tricks third were thin for the most part; I found it illuminated a character named Tamako Tamura with a soft filter that makes it sublime, a little far-fetched, but most of the tricks of directors were so gentle that I was fully extended and just danced with their characters. cried Or. Or laughed out loud. Excellent. A +.
