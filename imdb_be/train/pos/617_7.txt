Greetings again from the darkness. This one will be compared with «The Princess Bride», and although she does not measure up to this classic, this is a very interesting and well done in its own right. The storyline is a bit strange and the whole wall that never explained, but the execution in order to build even stronger uncertainty. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls to the girl (Sienna Miller), and agrees to bring her a fallen star ... which happens to be playing a stunning Claire Danes. Not much suspense of what happens with these two, but part comes in suspense in paragraph wicked witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and Prince, son of King Peter O'Toole is looking to regain our ruby ​​necklace "Star" will wear. Many bad things in the pursuit of good. <br /> <br /> Along the way, a meeting with the most bizarre pirate, you will see (including any of the Carribbean). Robert De Niro plays Captain Shakespeare - tough on the inside, and we'll talk in connection with his feminine side. Another meeting assumes brilliant Ricky Gervais, as the fast-talking trader, which is good for a couple of laughs. <br /> <br /> Or is not your typical chase, majority, or fantasy film, but ( "Layer director Matthew Vaughn's Cake") effort deserves an audience. Unfortunately, poor marketing company, is likely to prevent it from any money. I may think it will find great success in the video.
