I do not believe that this was a valid challenge for Richard Harris. It was a simple story, but it is interesting. This is a good movie to watch if you do not want to do a lot of thinking, I just want to tell a simple story. Canadian landscape was spectacular. Beautiful Fall Boom alone made a picture is worth a look.
