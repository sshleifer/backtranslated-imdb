Oh, I loved that movie. I think that was it. It made me laugh more than a dozen times. Yes, I'm a girl, so I'm writing this from the perspective of women. I think it's a shame that only scored in the ranking of 5.2. Too many guys voting? This was much higher than the other romantic comedies. Just because I'm a woman, I do not use all chic flicks, on the contrary, I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies are usually small and not as funny as they should be. But, as I said, that this film had it all, almost, in my opinion. A great script, a good one-liners, perfectly valid. Although the nature of Eva Longoria Parker reminded very Gabrielle Desperate Housewives, but what? It was awesome. I'll keep this film rainy days, the days when I feel overwhelmed and need a few laughs.
