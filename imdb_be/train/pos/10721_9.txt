This is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever! <br /> <br /> I'm embarrassed to say that my favorite character TISH, but still enjoy watching as she makes her space outfit "as the super cool" with "as a fully Bitchin 'belt and stick on rhinestones her face. <br /> <br /> But in any case, the film is actually one of the few "family" films that hold your interest. I know that involves initial, Particuarly, if you know it will happen, but the second half is probably one of the most nerve Wracking segments in the family film. <br /> <br /> I would not get out of the front of millions of people and proclaim love this film, in fact, rent is quite uncomfortable in itself, but I admit it here with the Internet, to hide. <br /> <br />
