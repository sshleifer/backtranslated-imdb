I could not take my eyes off of the film, when he appeared on the cables. Dialogue and costumes are as the most easily associated with soft-core porn. In this case it is advisable portion serves as a vehicle, not sex, and for serial thrashings with Nunchuks. (Maybe for sex, as well as, but not on Indian television, anyway.) <br /> <br /> Not being a supporter of the genre, I could not put Jeff Wincott, and there were no clues to find. Not only once Brigitte Nielsen traded in his futuristic nurse Hood (so for mayor!) For high-top fade we remember from Beverly Hills II, I made a positive ID on her. <br /> <br /> This film will not doubt, will please any fan of the early 90's couture or a nod-and-blink schlock Paul Verhoeven. You can add genre tag "that bad-is-good"?
