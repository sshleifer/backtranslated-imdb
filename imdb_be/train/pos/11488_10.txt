I rented a zero day from the local video store last week. I had never heard of the movie, and I had my doubts about this. Just looking at the box, I knew that the film was the indie film, and therefore, the quality had to be less than the core of the film. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after I finished watching the Zero Day I immediately started him again from the beginning. The film was clearly following the basic outline of what happened at Columbine High School in April 1999, but what struck me was how believable the two leading actors were. My first time through watching this film, I was not quite sure if what I have observed, was the actual tape remaining Columbine shooter. In my heart I knew that I was watching may not be real, but at the same time, the action is so strong, you had to keep giving your head shake. <br /> <br /> Is the film an alarm? Absolutely! You will see things that will make you question the merits of the film? Maybe. I think most people would find disturbing is the fact that they actually have a sense of the two main characters, Calvin and Andre (played Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is it difficult for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning to massacre at the high school. I know that for me, I felt a great sadness for Andre and Calvin. I had compassion for them, because their life has come to a terrible point. They are so deeply fell through the crack, they began to travel on the road, which could be terminated, unless the people around them paid attention to their plight. <br /> <br /> Zero Day phenomenal film. It gives you up close and personal look at the events that most of us will only ever see the output on the news. It leaves you thinking about life involved. And that leaves you at a loss as people get to this point. A week after watching this film, I still think about it <br /> <br /> For those of you who have not seen zero day, please keep the following in mind :. The film is an independent, almost no budget and the film was shot on video cameras. The material in the film alarming. This is not a mainstream Hollywood and there is no happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put all of that aside, Zero Day is a film that will follow you and just maybe, will help you to open your eyes a little bit.
