LOL !!! delirium was so funny .. I was in tears. Eddie Murphys seems absolutely in place. The best impression of James Brown and Mr. T> SO FUNNY !! Its amazing how Eddie Murphy was then and as of now he raves must see, but if they do not like to swear not look BUT AMAZING AND SO FUNNY .. I saw it 6/7 times and still piss myself every time .. It's Eddie Murphy's in the prime of life, and you can see where he got the humor and the idea of ​​films such as nutty professor. He gives the impression of his family, and that really funny. <br /> <br /> If only I was there ...
