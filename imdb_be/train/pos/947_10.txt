and perhaps closer to the storyline Dickens. While I believe the young Ebenezer hard look (who is the idea that the period of the hair, of course, they could do better than that!), Scott does an incredible job as Scrooge. His delivery of some lines from Dickens finally brought him back to life for me. Edward Woodward everything we expected and more Ghost Christmas present. I believe, G.C. Scott Scrooge is much more plausible than the miser more current version is made by Patrick Stewart. Nativity Scene morning when Scrooge realizes that he has not "missed", it is enough to convince a friend that Scott knows how to act against the overact. He is phenomenal here. Almost all the actors is incredible. Tiny Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol a little hard to see, almost too sweet. Nevertheless, the music and the scenery make it a must watch every holiday. Enjoy!
