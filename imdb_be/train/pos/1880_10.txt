Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic. This film is very witty film that belongs to the very talented actors. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli, and several others, this film could be a disaster. It's not always a good shot, and sometimes has some very corny music that tries to get the mood (the "psycho" -like music to fight the wedding), but the actor overcomes it. The character of Arthur oars, with his drunken comments. But it is well developed in the more mature, well-rounded character as he learns to live by their own free will. The end of quite banal, though. I will not give it away, but it can be improved. Worth seeing over and over again.
