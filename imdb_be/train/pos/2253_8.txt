I made this film because my interest in American history, and especially the somewhat strange story of the Mormons. This film tries to make some sense of how Joseph Smith could turn his "vision" of a major world religion. This is the first focuses on the problems in their Mormon settlements in Navuoo, Illinois. He draws the court of Joseph Smith. During this process, Brigham Young gets up to talk about his conversion to Mormonism, and his faith in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith was killed, and Young have to deal with their own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite serious doubts, he persists, and finally have a vision (that Utah is the place for the colony), which gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. Later, when the crops are destroyed crickets, he again doubt that he was actually elected -. However, a miracle happens, cementing his place in history <br /> <br /> I found a ledge to move, and a story to be compelling and interesting. I would like to know Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. Polygamy is a part of history, but the reason why it occupies a central place in the LDS are not raised. The question is not emphasized. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that people stay away from this film because of its religious theme, but it has a great cast, and will hold your interest throughout.
