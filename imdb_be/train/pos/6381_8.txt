"Atlantis" is a new and correct step for Disney features. This is a good choice to make the film a mysterious legend as "Atlantis". I had no expectations for this film, but after watching, I do not quite understand why this film was so bad reviews. Even in my country they are the reviewers were not positive. <br /> <br /> Â«Atlantis" is not a perfect film, but still one of Disney's greatest, I even doubt that this film will never get "the Disney classic" reputation. Well, that's another matter. It's funny to think, it is a science fiction film was directed by the same director as "Beauty and the Beast" and "the Hunchback" (as Kirk Wise and Truzdeyl trying to get away from his monster movie reputation, he he, I m just kidding). <br /> < br /> Well, enough of this nonsense. "Atlantis" is a watchable, output and very enjoyable film. Even this movie is PG-rated action wasp livasts, it is also suitable for children, in my opinion (parents, which means the opposite, do not kill me for writing this, he he). <br /> <br /> story is a little predictable, but it does not spoil the movie. Comic book inspired animation it is suitable for the movie and to set a departure from the usual Disney style. this colorful, dark and detailed. Deep Canvas sequences are quite large. The film is also funny sometimes, even I still giggling, you laugh through the movie. (Spoilers) characters of the film is also very nice, but unfortunately not enough screen time to learn all so that some characters were left behind (Spoilers). <br /> <br /> The number of James Newton Howard is absolutely adorable. This bold and exotic. (Spoiler) Most impressive in this film, as they make the language sound Atlantis very natural, ethnic and certain. It is really huge (spoilers OVER) <br /> <br /> The script is tight and well written, but there are still some questions that remain unanswered in this story. But, fortunately, there are not many of them. <br /> <br /> So what do you yourself a favor, do not listen to the reviewers and watch the "Atlantis" because it is waiting for you ...
