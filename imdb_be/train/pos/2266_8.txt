It will take some time to get used to the Nebraskan speeches Nick Nolte, before we can easily take it as a well-known playwright intercontinental. Once you get past the bar, it turns into a fascinating story about a man who loses everything, trying to do good. <br /> <br /> Nolte, American, moved to Germany to marry a famous actress, and is satisfied with success in all respects to pour out of the war. He visited gay American, John Goodman, who convinces him to accept the post of anti-Semitic radio broadcaster for the Nazis. Nolte is not a politician, but he believes that it is a challenge to write a role that is almost impossible, and then play it by himself. Another American secret agent will modify the radio Nolte scenario - cough paste here, sneezing there - that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence allies. There's a catch, though. No one will know about the real role of Nolte as an American agent, but Goodman, Donovan, and Roosevelt himself. If he ever found out that he would be denied recognition on the part of Americans. <br /> <br /> Nolte puts forward and his vicious broadcasts wildly popular in Germany. He was loved by his wife, Sheryl Lee, knows nothing about what is going on, and she did not care. Nolte and Lee live in that he repeatedly referred to as a "two nation". The war ends, and starts trouble. He was captured by the Americans, bitter because of his betrayal. They beat him up and leave him in the dirt. He saved Goodman, his "fairy", which sends it to an anonymous existence in Greenwich Village and send him a little money now and then. <br /> <br /> In 1960, he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor, artist Alan Arkin, who also lost his family and says that the two currently belong to the fraternity. But his whereabouts and his personality as a leak, and it is more or less accepted by a group of ancient Aryan racists - led by a dentist and a priest. His home front and the mailbox painted with swastikas and charges. He struck senseless by an ex-GI. But - miraculously - his beloved wife returned to him the ancient Aryans. Another catch: it turns out later that it was not his wife, and her younger sister, who loved him with adolescent <br /> <br /> end is, he publishes his memoirs in an Israeli prison in 1967 before the court for. crimes against humanity. It's not a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Nolte can talk to, but do not see, inmate cells over him in prison. This Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann seems pleasant. He advises Nolte, it's a bad habit to gain fifteen hours. "It is important to relax. . You have to learn to relax, "Nolte loud laughs and shouts." That's how I'm here, "The film is filled with such irony. At some point in their relaxed conversation, Arkin tells him that "in spite of everything I still believe that people are good at heart." I do not know when the film was a commercial success, but if it is not, that is the one thing that could be torpedoed it to a younger audience of theater-goers who might never have heard of Anne Frank is not to mention the fact that the supposedly final statement in his diary. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a movie for adults, and adults in this. History is moving slowly, there is very little violence, no chase, no shootings, and people do not seem inclined to manic speech pressure. Much of this is likely to slip by viewers who do not reveal themselves his conscious approach. Nolte refers to the war-time relationship between him and his wife as "a nation of two." It's quite compact expression. No doubt, those who could not come up with a brisk determination, but it takes a bit of concentration to understand his emotional import <br /> <br /> This is a story about a man who loses everything -. His ability to write, his personality, his wife (twice), his only friend, his country, his self-esteem. At one point he stops walking down a crowded street in New York and just not worth it there until after dark, when it is moved by a curious cop. Therefore, it stopped that he simply has no place to go. What Vonnegut describes much more than a depression. I do not mean to sound condescending, but it's a kind of feeling that is difficult to understand, in his youth. Teenagers might think that they know what keeps Nolte in this place, but it does require a sense of maturity and accelerated limb that only maturity can bring. <br /> <br /> Remember Robert Frost line of the house is a place if you go there, they have to take you in? Well, it does not take place in Nolte.
