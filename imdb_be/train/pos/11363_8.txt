Imagine that this prevents the bureaucracy that one person spends 8 years of his life story, and has a mental disorder, trying to solve the case of mass murder almost by itself! the killing technique are clear, but the government does not want to admit the truth let the monster to destroy dozens of lives. When I think that my job is stressful, I just remember the true story behind this amazing film. Devotion to duty of the protagonist was artfully depicted Rea. The comic (and almost tragic at times) the relationship between Rea and the nature of Sutherland made it one of my favorite films of the past 5 years. Catching one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat. Although not as well advertised and talked about how to "Silence of the Lamb", the story was the same as in suspense. Rent or buy the movie today!
