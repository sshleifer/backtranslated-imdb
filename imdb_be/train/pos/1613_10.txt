This film is still constantly favorite. Only ambitious, humorous moron will not enjoy this great movie. This film feels like a piece of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream! I think it's the best job ever Cher and her most believable performance. Cher has always been blessed with charisma, good looks, and enviably slender figure. who still sounds like Cher - do you like it or not singing it? Cher definitely made their mark on the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after the others have come and gone. It is one of the most unique artists there. It's funny, because who would have thought Cher, as such nugget actress? She heads up the so-called film "stars" of today. Cher real actor at the same level, Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett, and a few others, that she never gives up, "action", it really becomes a character convincingly. She has more than earned the respect of his colleagues and cinema-going public <br /> <br /> All of Moonstruck fine. - the characters, the scenery, dialogue, food. I never get tired of watching this film. <br /> <br /> Every time again, when I look at the scene where they all sit at the dining table in the house of Rose, suspend the remote to see exactly what good food rose portion. I saw the spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can not figure out whether they are eating dumplings, Ziti? What is the main course? He looks great, and it's driving me crazy! <br /> <br /> All in the family was hard-working persons, and they respect and care about each other. Grandpa was not pushed to the side and to endure, he was an important part of the family, and he listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He seemed to be quite healthy, independent old codger, too. <br /> <br /> Mom Loretti was not "just a housewife," she was the glue that held the family together and was an exemplary example of what a wife, mother and home manager should strive to be. She was proud of the life she had chosen but she would not let it define who she is high-powered businessmen are not so comfortable in his skin as Rose was Casterini note defiant as she said.. "I do not have children, as long as I 37 is not completed "Sesame finished." Do you have the feeling that she was the type of young woman he did exactly as she pleased, and as kept his way without another person who realizes what happened. She was charming, smart and very clever. What a great mom! <br /> <br /> I do not really like Loretta immediately because it seemed a bit know - it's who was not really as adventurous and how to control herself as she wants others to think she could tell others about themselves and where they went wrong, but it does not really eat healthy the meaning of his own life. She was going to marry Mum's middle-aged, simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose in her life. She was more traditional than her own mother. She dressed and wore her hair as a matron in a house of detention and seemed humorless and dull, but underneath you felt that she was vulnerable and lonely, and there was a lot of love to give the right person. It is likely to end up making an amazing mother, too. <br /> <br /> I could see in the future, a full house of Loretta and Ronnie loud screaming happy child and Rose Cosmo and enjoy every minute.
