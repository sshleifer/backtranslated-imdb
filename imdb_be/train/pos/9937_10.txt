This episode was one of those I loved when I was a kid. Even when I see it now through rose-colored glasses of nostalgia shadows, I can still say that it is the quality of the show is very informative, but still funny. I have not seen the original French version, only Swedish. I have no idea how good dubbing was, it was too long ago to remember. <br /> <br /> The premise of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear, the school still has not taught me half of what I know from the show. It is also linked with other things, like what happens when you eat junk food and do not exercise, with good examples in the body. Who wants to have another bar of chocolate if you know, miniature tanks virus can invade you? : D cartoon looked nice, very friendly child of course, but with great caution. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, the antibody and the rest presents smiling cartoon figure, it looks pretty much like you'd expect that they should look at the animated body. <br /> <br /> This is a series of stories (especially environmentally terrible finale) was a key part of my childhood. I'm so happy to have found them here.
