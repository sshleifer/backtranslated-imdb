After Aquino's first work «Im Juli», which was good enough, he has created a truly wonderful Italian family epic. His German film, which is, unfortunately, a bad premise, because we produce more moderate rareley movies;). But this film makes a very good time shots then. "Salina" about an Italian immigrant who arrives in the "Ruhr" region of Germany during the 60s. Immigrant and his family then run the first restaurant Pizza in the region. Characters perfectly portrayed. Especially Giga, the main actor. Live every moment, every feeling that he is doing. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is that good. Well, you just do not believe him the role. But the nature of wellbalanced and fits perfectly into this scenario. I feel the urgent need to compare the style of the film with the style of "The Godfather." Many people will probably hate this movie, let's say, it's sad. Not a lot of stress? - Yes, but a glaring film. 9 of 10.
