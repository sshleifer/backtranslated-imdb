Foch provides a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little gothic nail biting. It takes the post of secretary in the society Widowhood London (played powerfully Dame May Witty) and her terrible son (effeminate and annoying George Macready). Before she knows it, she wakes up to find himself in a seaside mansion, she'd never seen before, where Witty and Macready cause its Marian and trying to convince the servants-and-coming citizen, that she was mad at his wife Macready. Of course, the couple can plan only dastardly deeds and even if we know, Julia must ultimately escape her trap, directed by Joseph Lewis builds real intrigue in the answer to the question of how it will operate. <br /> <br /> "my name is Julia Ross" has nothing to stylistic, to set it apart from any number of films released in the same period of time, but I was surprised at how well it keeps, in spite of the shoe string budget and a B-movie pedigree, there are a lot of things that can only be you on the edge of his seat, and I found that really cheering for Julia, when she caught in the scheme under his feet and began to outwit her captors. In any other gothic thriller heroine would have fainted, I cried and trembled, waiting for her hero to come and save her. So I can not tell you how refreshing it was to the heroine in this film to use her brain and figure out how to save yourself <br /> <br /> Well done <br /> <br /> Grade ..: B +
