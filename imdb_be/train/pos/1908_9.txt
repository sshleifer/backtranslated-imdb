This show is beautifully done. When it first came out I was, even though it is no more than a light-hearted family comedy with quite a few good jokes. It seemed to express many families are really too good, with different concepts of both parents and the child, but, as I said before, I never thought more about it, then a good watch for the evening. However, in my view it has been removed from another window when the tragic death of John Ritter fantastically funny charged. The program was an occasion and really appreciated the life of the characters in a very sensitive way, which also touched the hearts of all admire Res John Ritter, a fantastic actor with the talent to do something. When the show aired after the Ritters passing, I really just wanted to give my dad a hug and let him know how much he meant to me. I thought it was shining threw acting talents of three children, in particular, that the character of Brigitte, who was worried about the last words she said to him. It reminded me that no matter what terrible things I say to my father, I do not mean them, and it is very important that he knows about it. Great Show
