This is probably the best of the Star Wars movies. <br /> <br /> The starting point of the film was almost like Episode IV - A spacious cabaret music and cabaret thought a place where serious gangster Jabba the Hutt was getting even more serious. He ordered Luke to die in the basement of his bone crushing teeth bows that looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. Jedi force Luke finally finish the monster off. Adding to the vile rescue Han Solo, who was frozen alive at the end of Star Wars Episode V Jabba was very angry about this, Luke was sentenced to death in the Sarlacc pit outside. <br /> <br /> But all of Star Wars "good guys", especially R2-D2, had other ideas ... and those other ideas fended off execution Luke; after all, most of the soldiers died Jabba and Princess Leia was able to use force to strangle to death Jabba to death. <br /> <br /> As episode IV, Death Star in Episode VI makes its appearance. As I reviewed the Rebel fleet attacking Imperial fighters around the Death Star Destroyer Star staff, I guess, he has accelerated the arms of the main laser, using the Imperial fighters, as a distraction. Star Destroyers 20-25, who were lined up ready to attack, but were withdrawn, and instead of laser weapons on the Death Star was dismissed with surprise. After he was shot, the Rebel fleet only hope that the deflector shield Death Stars had to be knocked out, and it affected Lando so much because he wanted to destroy the Death Star, but he could not, until the shield was removed. And it was made with great looking Lando. <br /> <br /> As with the V Episode, Imperial Walkers make their menacing appearance of these twin guns, killing at least one of the Ewoks Ewoks ... but found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them. For example, Chewbacca, and another an Ewok, was able to steal one of the walkers (and actually used it to destroy because of the pedestrians), as well as other magazines used Ewoks beat two other walkers. <, Br /> <br /> surprising that Luke could do with their powers Jedi lightsaber to him, as, for example, the scene on the Endor, where Luke rejects incoming laser shots from the speeder bike attack aircraft, and using Saber knock out of the bike. Or, at the culmination of using Saber sever the hand of his own father during the final duel with the Sith, Vader Saber. <br /> <br /> You probably know, the celebration EWOKS after the Death Star was blown up, complete with a short fireworks, drumming on the trophies of victory (for example, mask attack), and Luke finally meet with Levi after own nemesis Luke --- Darth Vader, is now dead, burned at the stake. The celebration includes singing Ewoks, but I think that Lucas did not buy that -. Even with a strong relation to the composer John Williams film <br /> <br /> According to the home movie, I think he wanted a different ending Lucas. The annex to the celebration on Endor, he wanted shots of holiday scenes on several surviving rebel planets, including festive laser shot that destroys the statue of the Sith. Ewoks song was replaced by alternative instrumental part. He probably wanted more material to prove that the destruction of the Death Star, the balance has been restored rebel galaxies.
