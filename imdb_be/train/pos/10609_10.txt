I saw this movie last night on the cable, and it's extraordinary. What I love most about it is that it is understated and discreet, but deep heart. Henry Thomas (he played a child in E.T.) masterful performance slurred (he must be a man of few words). David Straithern great crazy villain. And miraculously (given that we are talking about the product Hollywood is) the child acts as the main character, but one who does not work or there is a line, but simply (and lit it). It is interesting to note that the mysterious attitude w Thomas. the alien has been the backbone of this film; while its connection w. child serves as a basis <br /> <br /> Then there is the music of «A Good Baby.» - ah, what kind of music !! Gillian Welch melodies are excellent and the whole assessment of the magnificent hill country music. <br /> <br /> This film is wonderfully atmospheric. I highly recommend it.
