Rob Estes, Josie Bissett and shit loads of children who do not look like any of them. <br /> <br /> In general, Rob and Josie have a shotgun wedding to a drunken night during a Vegas vacation. Each of them has come home to find that their respective children already know about the marriage because of the tabloids as not feed. They, Rob and Josie, move both of their eight children to one or other of the house. <br /> <br /> Rob builds furniture, I think it is close enough to (Patrick Duffy) construction Frank Lambert on much the same step-by-step to ensure eternal mockage. <br /> <br /> Josie sort of cookie queen decisions, although it does not look like it does any of the cookies. Not close enough to Carol Foster (Suzanne Somers) barber's job to ensure similarity mockage, but funny enough absurd to justify the atrocities mockage. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the step-by-step, they couple to rest and really know what one another's surname, or so we assume, if they are serious enough about the relationship to take a trip together <br / > <br /> anyway, there are eight children. Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. Andrew B. and I, personally, think that they should just call the young Andrew "Andy". <br /> <br /> There's a lot of product location, especially for the soup in hand (that nasty) and Listerine pocket packs. There are also some silly, meaningless moments. It's also not a great film, to promote happy families. <br /> <br /> But, hey! Rob Estes! This concludes my review of the "Step By Step ... on some really bad drugs. Watch it, Rob Estes and his cute! Eyes. There are some great looking! Eye shots.
