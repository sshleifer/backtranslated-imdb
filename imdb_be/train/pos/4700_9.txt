I could not believe the low rating 5.6 on IMDb about Johnny Dangerously at the time I wrote this review, and I thought I had to do something to help make a memorable part of the comedy as much as I can. Seriously, to get ranked so low, that the people who vote must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention the very shallow open mind. If you do not like, click humorous, look at them! The combination of absurd humor, a very good story and an outstanding pace, given several running gags, this movie has made its way into my DVD collection. And that's not to mention the visual farces introduced here and there, and of course, the use of «Clin d'oeils» and "cliché" on the basis of our favorite movies to organized crime. <br /> <br /> I showed the film to a large number of people, and being introduced to it without any specific expectations (except, perhaps, watch comedies) - a state of mind itself, you should be able to see any movie, in my opinion - they are all very much. It is going well, it's not a long time to watch and there is absolutely no slowing downs in the development of history, which I think is very simple. Of course, it is not perfect, some gags fall a little less, but none of the film is not perfect, especially when you consider other considerations that for you. That's why I rated this movie 9 out of 10. This film, in my opinion predecessor as "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs» in absurd, but well thought-out comedy. What is now more and more absurd with a drop of thoughts and ingeniosity hand sometimes gags need more culture than many people imagine to be understood correctly, if at all, as the last word, I would say.. look at yourself, do not stick to the middle saying, Joe, and if you do not like it, then you will know, really it was not good etc. in your tastes, which is understandable, but it is unlikely, in my opinion.
