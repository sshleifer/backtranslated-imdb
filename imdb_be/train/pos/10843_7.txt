What happens to the discarded rock 'n' roll stars in the late 1990s? They begin to return / tour. At least, that is what the members of Strange Fruit, (fictional) 70-stadium rock band to do. <br /> <br /> Tony (Stephen Rea) has the concession for the automatic condom when he is faced with the son of the promoter famous music festival. It is at this festival in the 70s that broke Strange Fruit. 70s are "retro" and it's time for a wide this wave. He goes in search of the other group members. <br /> <br /> Part of what the group was broken up and the replacement of the death of Keith, a singer and a brilliant songwriter. The band was known for their excessive lifestyles, and now they are because the working class, from which they came. Bino, the drummer, plays Timothy Spall (who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies) is a slacker, bass is a roofer, and their lead singer is still a rocker. While he has a huge mansion, he was forced to sell it, because his condition did not last. Bryan, lead guitarist, died so young guitarist hired to replace him. <br /> <br /> Some are reluctant to agree to give a group of Reunion try. Throwing their daily work, they begin to rehearse, and their manager is close to their label about the re-release of their albums. But he wants them to start touring again first. And so they hit the club circuit around Europe. The club scene is not good for these overweight, dated, old rocker. <br /> <br /> It is a tour that the film really starts to develop. All the old conflicts rearise, with figures of Keith and Brian hovers everywhere. They all hang together, because they are all in search of a second chance for greatness that eluded them before. Again, some of the interpersonal chemistry that made the play at the same time enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Still Crazy begins Spinal Tap II, but gradually becomes more sharply focused film, after relations members. Although it is still very funny movie, it's evolving characters, struggling to cope with the death of Brian and Kate and their personal demons, who do the work in the cinema.
