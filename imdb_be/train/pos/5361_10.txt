If you were brought up on a diet gameshows you realize that you need more and better gradually corrected. Well, in the world of man, who fled, your needs will be filled. To do this in a game show, prisoners compete for freedom, and the grand prize -. All their life <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It was such a parody of the mind-numbing tripe that we are seeing on a daily basis. This is not one of the best performances of Schwarzenegger, but overall it's a very good film. The basic idea that TV Corporation will one day be "real" leaders of the planet is very plausible and very well portrayed in this film. Of course, there are the usual Arnie one-liners, my favorite, if he's going to be catapulted into GameZone, the Gameshow host asks, "Any last words?" Arnie said, "Yes, I will come back", but the owner of the island "in the re-Only" and presses the eject button. I give this film 10 for pure originality. I must have watched it 30 times or more. The only film except Die Hard series, which I watched it a lot !! <br /> <br /> In short, do not for a minute think that you have a tanker - It has you .....
