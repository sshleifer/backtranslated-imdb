If you like thin (yes, I said thin) actions and reactions of John Candy, you can not help but like this movie (pronounced «fillum» Salvatore DiPasquale). Inattentive (and ignorance of) the observer always seen kendo ~ d as a broad actor - a big clown. Sometimes it (see «Stripes» and «Splash"). However, if given the opportunity, he can be really razor thin and pretty. It's too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his wide face, because we will never get to see more of the other. Oh, yes, the movie. You can watch the "Warriors" again and again (I know I have) with a frequency of "Caddyshack." It's just that good. The plot is a little confusing, actually quite deep for this kind of farce. This allows the candy and so always underestimated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to bounce off the Candy ... and they bounce off hard. Definitely worth a look for those that enjoyed the SCTV or kendo other work.
