It was a simple, but nice. I think the whole point of sexual segregation in society, which can be bitter, was shown very delicately. It was a bitter kind of Hammer in it. The fact that most of the actors were not professionals, made the film more sensitive and more realistic. It was a "documentary" film side, too. Best scenes were the ones that all women, forbidden to look, listen to hot soldiers who are supposed to keep an eye on them, broadcasts the game. If you are Iranian, friends cheering and dancing in the streets after the game is won, you are filled with national pride !! If you are not Iranian, you'll still love it anyway!
