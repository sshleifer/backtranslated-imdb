I ran across this film at the local video store during their annual sidewalk sale. While scanning thousands of videos, hoping to find a few animated films for sale, I came across this film. I've read the back of the film and knew that it was God's hand at work for me to purchase this film. See, I have a sibling group of three receivers (and soon to be adopted) children living with my family. Immediately adopted children has made a connection with her three children in the main role in the film. The film has helped them to better understand their own circumstances. For the first time, also, the oldest of the group of siblings (7 years / female) decided to open up to me a little about his past and the trauma she experienced. She fights the whole issue of trust. It is also the first time I saw her cry. After watching the film, I asked her what it means for a child to be adopted. She replied. "It means to be happy" A must see for families, children and contribute to consider adoption. This, of course, opened up lines of communication with us.
