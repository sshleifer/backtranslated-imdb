Atlantis was much better than I expected. In some ways it was better than the story comes from other films aimed at older age. Despite the fact that this movie really requires strong concentration at times. It was a great movie for all ages. I noticed that some of the young spectators were waiting for comedy, but there is an adventure. I think people are tired of the endless parade of extreme parodies. Many of these children have not seen anything but parody. After a while, everything seemed very hard to watch Atlantis.
