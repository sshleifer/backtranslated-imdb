I thought that this movie was fantastic. It was fun. Interesting reminded me of Spinal Tap. This is a must see for any fan of 70s rock. (I hope that me and my friends do not like that in twenty years!) <br /> <br /> Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance as an excluded repair singer is trying to regain the old spirit, <br /> <br /> Steven ry fits perfectly into the film, the glue is trying to keep the group together, but can not be good. <br /> <br /> If you love music and have ever been in a group, this film is definitely for you, you will not regret seeing this film. I know that I have not. Even my family found it funny, and it says something.
