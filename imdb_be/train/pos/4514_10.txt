I recently watched this movie in a lazy Sunday afternoon, with some friend of mine, and we have a lot of fun! This film is a masterpiece of trash. Try watching it for this purpose! This was not expected, of course, but the performance is provided by the actors (Alberto Tomba and the absolute best), weak script and budget inexpensive created a wonderful combination of nonsense. Tomba just retired from alpine ski racing, where he was the dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s. Tombaugh had won three Olympic gold medals, two World Championships and nine World Championship titles of the season. Seriously about the director: no one knows why Damiano Damiani, he signed the film. All other directions Damian significant.
