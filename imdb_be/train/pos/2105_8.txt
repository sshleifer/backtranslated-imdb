Set in the world of depression Era Prague, is the story of an ambitious store clerk who falls in love with the mystery of the woman with whom he exchanged romantic letters, only to discover that the mystery woman is not other than a sales girl from his shop, which seems to constantly quarrel with a colleague. Add a little twist (the owner is confident that his favorite employee -Stewart- has to do with the owner's wife), resulting in a short Stewart "fired", while recognizing that the sales girl "favorite" Stewart together, a happy ending is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Although very dated (links to poverty and -I have a wife and two children to essential over-used, along with an indication that many small objects of pleasure, like a musical cigar box, are out of reach for the implementation of the common people), this film is much more effective (and more credible) than 1990 th years, again to make "you've Got Mail." In the remake, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the actual chances of winning in the chain of events is so unbelievable that the viewer intelligence grossly insulted. <br /> <br /> Â«shop around the corner" innocent stroll through memory lane in a less complex, less anxious, and more romantic time and place, known as utopian novelist. Fans of classic romantic comedies will enjoy this photo!
