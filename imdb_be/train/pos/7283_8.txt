I love to buy those cheap, lousy DVD from Alpha Video. One day I happened to buy this. This is the perfect silly sci-fi film of the 50s, all the sexy up. Crowded ALL unscientific, half-naked girls and a lot of melodrama, it's a nice movie for those who appreciate this kind of thing. And if you can "suspend disbelief" enough, you can get crawled out-- not only psychotic head or smashing things in the closet, but towards the end, the nature of the "perfect body", it is. ,,, What is another word for mindf *** s?
