I really enjoyed the reunion of many! I would rate it 10, if they were «Hassie» and «Little Luke." There was not even a mention as to where they are today, or why they did not participate in the reunion. They were very popular characters, and I think it was a mistake not to give explanations for their lack of appearance. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was glad that the TNN series starts again! I was looking for episodes for many years, and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series (I may have missed a few episodes). Jenny Hanahan
