Scott rights. Best 2 person sword duel ever put on film in the middle of the film. Sword fighting with a few soldiers, not the best, but pretty good. Nevertheless, the fight in the middle, even better than the Japanese samurai films. Chinese Swordplay scene in my opinion, never surpassed the Japanese in terms of entertainment. Especially in the scenes where one guy has to fight a group of enemies, Japanese films excel, example is the series Lone Wolf and Cub. Although the fights in the Japanese movie last only a few seconds or a minute at most, the very intensity of those moments to make them better. But this is one example, when the Chinese swordplay superior Japanese. The scene in the middle of the film was five minutes long struggle with the most amazing choreography ever. Other fights in this film are also good, but even if they were sucking the film received 7 for this one scene. If you have not seen it, you should. John Woo is a human.
