I am glad that it is now available on DVD. This film is an excellent example celebration content and style of the empty-headed & flashers constant loud sounds. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you have a short attention span or do not have enough mind & imagination to communicate with a literary story you do not like this movie. As a result, fairly basic, but, unfortunately, is rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs has done a fantastic job of transferring the story of Catherine Storr's novel in "Dreams Mariana" successfully screenplay. Unenviable task, as anyone who has seen the movie, the book will no doubt be aware, <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, allowing the director Bernard Rose's use of actors so rarely seen now. they dabble in the craft of acting! I know, I know, the actors do their work and acting, instead of resorting to robbery pointless in a kaleidoscope lens Vista chase camera, explosions and fights fire erupt around them is really a rare treat, but in fact happened in this . Movie <br /> <br /> This brings me to the final reason that this film is shaped to a thinker and not spoon-fed a tabloid reader - except hard scenario, direction and action, it relies on the atmosphere, suspense and horror means. To be classified as horror, the presentation of «Paper House» is more in the vein of Sophocles than Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, then, if you're like a lot of loud noises, explosions, the constant cuts and bright flashing colors you'd better watch "Transformers", but if you like history, disturbing unfolds through skilful and remembrance use narrative entirely insulting your intelligence by giving you the power cacophonous nonsense, then it might just be your thing.
