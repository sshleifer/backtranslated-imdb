What can I say that has not been said about the "Ghosts"? It has everything that would make a great picture. Excellent kit, whimsical music and sound effects to die were all in place. The film's script, although sometimes boggles the mind in such a strange, surreal way. The whole team must forget to read it to the end, perhaps because they were too busy creating Cg effects and the creation of the Gothic sets to see how the plot was weak. Every member of the cast gives a decent performance, although with little conviction to the material at hand. Lili Taylor do most while others mainly react to it. But that's about it. All I can say is that it was a bit of a pleasant two hours, but you'll definitely want more. Much more.
