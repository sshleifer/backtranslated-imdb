Sitting, Typing ?? Nothing is the latest 'what if? Â»FEST offer Vincenzo Natali, and starring David Hewlett and Andrew Miller, the two losers. One of these problems in a relationship, got canned from work (due to problems in the relationship) and the police to get him (because of his work and his relationship problems). The other guy is agoraphobia, which refuses to go outside his house, meets a bothersome girl guide who calls her mother, claiming that she was molested if he does not buy cookies from him. Oh, the police are after him too, since spy girls mother called them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> The man that day. <br /> <br /> What if you could make it all go away? That is the whole premise behind "Nothing." Two fools understand, cops, girl scout, machine, lawn, road, all ?? disappear. There's nothing but an empty space! It's an interesting concept, I thought. I also looked at the time of 30 minutes left in the movie, and I still had an hour left in the film. 2 actors can do the job and keep us entertained for 60 minutes? Although the actors try, 60 minutes long, and there is clearly a musty air in the areas of the film. But the two actors who are lifelong members with each other and the director has a great repertoire with each other, it was interesting to observe the dialogue and improve goofing around two do. There are a lot of supernatural elements, but it is more of a reaction to these elements that make this film ultimately worth seeing.
