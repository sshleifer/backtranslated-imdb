Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. These raw materials are sick, and realistically, but very interesting. Leading actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who would go on to become an Oscar-winning actor will deliver amazing performances. Sign in as Texas hustler Joe Buck, who migrates from a small town in Texas, New York, to become a pickpocket. He did not apologize for his chosen profession, but it is not so simple. In New York, women, rich ladies play Zhorzhenn Cass Johnson and Oscar nominated plays Sylvia Miles is different from Texas women. Unfortunately, Buck tries to escape from his past life in Texas. He was raised by his grandmother, Sally Buck played a wonderful actress Ruth White, who died in 1969 from cancer. Places in New York wonderful to watch how the relationship between Hoffman and Fatso playing the characters evolve in a moving Buck Male to male friendship. The men struggled to survive the life of New York, do not play by the rules, how to get a real job. As the film, a former Buck comes to the surface, and it is memorable, but not clear. The film is not for children, but compared with today's movies and television programs, Midnight Cowboy could be more manual. I can not forget the young brand Vaccaro and the party that you can not forget. It is also a sentimental film, so get your handkerchiefs, too.
