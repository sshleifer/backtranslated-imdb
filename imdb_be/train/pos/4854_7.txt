Take this in dark and stormy night and preparing alternately pleased, irritated and frightened. Creaky old story about a phantom train, which is said to run a lone English countryside can be fetched in the dead of night, but it's great fun. There are some good old cliches as "accident", which locals can remember, but will not speak. But first and foremost this means for movie comedian Arthur Askey in order to demonstrate their particular brand of musical comedy style of humor between the scary bits. corny humor Askey is not very fashionable these days, but if you just let it wash over you might be interested. This is perhaps the best of the films in the Asuka.
