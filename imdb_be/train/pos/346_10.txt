What a strange movie! It was very scary, a lot of action, well written, good plot twists, interesting characters, very good direction, and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on his face. This is one popcorn flick horror that can not be attractive to fans without horror, but still (yet) one of the best thrillers out there today! I highly recommend it only supporters :. <br /> <br /> 1) The horror genre <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> 2) The actor or actress is featured in it <br /> <br /> *** s * *** stars! <br /> <br /> PS- I'm tired of people comparing this and other modern horror movies, with SCREAM. I know that they do not want to be like SCREAM. All this, "Oh, they copied SCREAM!Â». Well, if I'm not mistaken, SCREAM also copied other movies too! In fact, almost every horror movie copied earlier one. Creek, however, was a good movie. But still ... stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is! <br /> <br /> FORWARD AND RENTAL it! <br /> <br />
