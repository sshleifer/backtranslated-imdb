Not only that, this film is interesting, with a wonderful comedic effect, but the politically interested. This was done at the end of the Soviet Union, but makes fun of the Soviet mentality through. The story is set in the early days of the Soviet Union, and it calls into question the justification for the revolution in cultural and practical terms. Of course, in the late '80s and early' 90s, bizarre strictures of Soviet society has relaxed, but the ideology and mentality is still alive and well and ready for some well deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, this is a deeply philosophical commentary wrapped in a funny and entertaining package! <br /> <br /> Jur
