Kudos Fawcett, to take on the role that, while considered to be controversial. To my recollection, rape is still taboo in the 1980s, as well as women's rights and the emotions were rarely so deeply studied during this time. <br /> <br /> Fawcett just a woman that followed, the persecuted actor James Russo. It is adequate as the obsessed psychopath, but sometimes a little bit transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwid has little role, as does Alfre Woodard as the home mat. Woodard is worried about the legal consequences when Fawcett, a rape victim, take revenge on the perpetrator. The scene where she throws a pan of hot oil on Rousseau is a classic, and as a tyrant he deserves. Then she holds him in bondage, and must face the consequences. <br /> <br /> It is a true story, reflecting the emotion and anger of rape victims who have been violated, physically and mentally. Highly recommended. 8/10.
