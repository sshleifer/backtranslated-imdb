This film is very much surprised me. I'm not very high hopes for him, but I was wrong. Mary and Rhoda was very funny and well written. They do not spend too much time, to paraphrase the past that they did not hope for the success of the old TV show, to carry a movie. Overall, it was very interesting. <br /> <br /> My friend remarked that it might be a weekly sit-com, and I think I would agree with her.
