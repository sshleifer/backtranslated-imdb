I've seen this movie before joining the British Army. I went through my basic training, at first hard and then I progressed a lot easier. My time was spent in the midst of the unrest in NI and the Cold War. There was a time when I asked myself that I got involved, did not last long, as the training will always take over and you will always react instinctively. Voice-over is used to indicate that the soldiers are thinking spot on, although I would add breathing and heart rate, as it seems to rub in your drum in a given situation. A few years later I was in Canada for a family get together. My aunt, who lives in the US and is a teacher in Columbus Ohio Uni gave a presentation on the impact of the British army in NI. She spent some time there studies. Although ex pat she was very anti-British. She made a bee-line for me and judge me for being a British soldier. My only answer was to see the film "Long Day's dying." It is near civil disappear understand why men do what he does. The answer at the end.
