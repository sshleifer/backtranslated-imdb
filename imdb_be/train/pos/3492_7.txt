Not so bad, the film, as I thought it would be. <br /> <br /> He has a good cast.Nice see Roger Moore back on the screen, as well as the use of other British actors. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more of in the future Olivia D`A projects.Maybe starring opposite her forge sexual Maryam D`A. <br /> <br /> Also good use of invisible places such as Luxembourg. <, Br /> <br /> I hope we'll see more of the UK European co-production like this.
