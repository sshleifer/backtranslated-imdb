I can not believe that they took it from the air. Especially if they only had a few more episodes left. My daughter, sister and some of my friends like to watch this show. We were so upset when they stopped to show it because of the so-called ratings. This is unfair to the people who watched the show from the beginning. We have the right to see the end. I wish they would have a common voice of all people, with 3 times a year the voting system. They can send the documents by mail, and we as viewers can give a general vote of all the programs that we have seen or heard. It can also help promote the new show. People will see it and wonder what it is. Not only that, you could see that the viewers are watching, you can also use it as a tool for free advertising for TV and cable channels. We want to see the other episodes. Bring him back !!
