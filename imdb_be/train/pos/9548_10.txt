This is a great thriller from Turkey, which can make the job of sense.Great Gokbakar brothers. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to show on the screen play.Generally game screen in most films from Turkey, is not enough, but GEN has the best staff to say "perfect" .And also the transition of some truly awesome. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, «Gen» has a great theme affecting everyone.Especially, a woman who wants to be psyciatrist in the hospital, there is a mother who is familiar insanity.Principal causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen.The the only thing you need to do is to combine all the tips. <br /> <br /> There is a big part of the aggression and Doga Ratkeya Şahan Gökbakar played.This performance may be more realistic than the "irreversibility (Monica Bellucci)." <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is "watch this movie, you get confused"
