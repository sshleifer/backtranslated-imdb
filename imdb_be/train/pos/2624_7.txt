In this film, we have a fabulous opportunity to see what happened with Timon and Pumbaa in the film, if they are not - that's a lot! This film goes back to even before the Simba and (presumbably) immediately after birth Kiara. <br /> <br /> It is true in the first film, "The Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 elsewhere)," funny, interesting, exciting and amazing film (or a sequel, if that's what you want to call it ). Bundle of surprises and fun are waiting for you! <br /> <br /> While Timon and Pumbaa watching a movie in a movie theater (with remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have an argument that «The Lion King" point they are going to start looking like Timon wants to go to the the part where he and Pumbaa Pumbaa come and wants to go back to the beginning. They have a very fair compromise to watch a film of their own history, which is what is waiting for ... it starts with the first home of Timon in ... <br /> <br /> For those with a good sense of humor, who liked the first movie just about any age, are «Lion King 1/2»! :-)
