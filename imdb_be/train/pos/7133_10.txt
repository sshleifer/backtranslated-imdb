An absolute masterpiece of a movie! Quiet night Mr.Tom soon became one of my favorite movies of all time. No one should miss to see this movie, it's just too good! Mr.Tom perfectly portrayed by John Thaw as harsh old man who becomes gentle father figure when William Beach (Nick Robinson) sent him to evacuate, almost like a "mouse click and cities across the country." Really dumb movie. The director knew exactly how to turn a book into a movie, and he did it very well. The film was so well shot, that the emotions of the characters and what happened made the audience feel the gamut of emotions from love to fear, and these emotions can turn into a sixpence. Set in a period of upheaval during the Second World War, the film also shows the difference between town and country, they are almost like different countries. It is absolutely necessary to see those who are missing out on truly amazing and brilliant film.
