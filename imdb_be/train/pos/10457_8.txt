Forget mannered "religious" films, which monopolized the market of television / movie ... this movie has a real sensation. Although this may be seen as a film that has a cheap emotional draw, it also has this message of forgiveness, and generally good manners . However, I did not like the lighting in this film ... for a film deal with such a subject, it was too bright. I felt that I took away from the overall appeal of the film, which is almost unforgivable sin, but a well-known cast, and their performances counteract this mistake. <br /> <br /> In caused considerable worth a look ... buy a DVD.
