Several typical little film from that era. Obviously, it was first conceived in this world for the stage, but nevertheless a very good movie from start to finish. Peter O'Toole Susannah York and get to make their action stage to the silver screen, and how to do it effectively. There is very little in the way of history and those who are not familiar with this type of character study of the beat can be a little scare him off. In general, though, a good movie, in which Peter O'Toole Susannah York and get a replay.
