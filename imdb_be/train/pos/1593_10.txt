Show about two sisters who live together. Holly is the younger have some teenage problems, on the other hand, her sister Val has a job, my friend, the groom a problem as most of the women on the planet. They try to support each other, they make mistakes, but sometimes they do not give up and continue. And the show is also about friendship. Priorities in life. I loved this show so much. It's funny and the actors are so good. I'm really sad that the show was over. I still watch time repetition time :) Amanda Bynes very talented. Jennie Garth may be a new comedy, but she plays very well. She is one of the actresses I like to watch. I like the attitude of Vince and Holly are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time he shows up. Tina Holly found a real friend, and I really love them hang out. Lauren character is so funny, and she is a natural talent. I would like to see her more. This show really takes you and makes you laugh. I want to show was not finished.
