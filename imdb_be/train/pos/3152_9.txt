This show was absolutely wonderful, and I always look forward to watching it.All characters were funny and strange in its own way, each episode on the condition of non-stop laughter, and it was very interesting and different from many other shows .Everybody was just absolutely insane and wonderfully funny that you could not help but love this show.There had several episodes of the dead weight, but that '70s Show has always been able to create some nice atmosphere, where it is just very unhelpful "t matter.This was one of best show ever to go on the air, and I'll see yadets this show at any time I can, because it never gets old, never gets unfunny, and never becomes uninteresting.
