It was another big Tom Berenger movie .. But some people are right it was like another SGT BARNES character, but he was still Awsome .. Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the jungle of Panama! Billy Zane was a wimp for the first time as Corporal Upham on Saving Private Ryan, but then he got a little more aggressive in the end! Sniper was Awsome and action buffs should look .. I would like to remind you that do not have as much effect as the action flick p .. I got this on DVD as well, and it's great!
