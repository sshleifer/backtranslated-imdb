A kind word to say about this film really is. I was not initially impressed with it, but it grew on me quickly. I like it a lot, and I think it's a shame that many people can not see past the fact that it was banned in some countries, mine is one of them. The film delivers in the department of shock, gore and atmosphere. The cost of delivering a beautiful piece of the unknown device. It only seems fair that Chris Young went on to be one of the best songwriters in the business. To act in this film has a number of high standard, if a little bit of wood in some places, and the consequences are very real and gritty. All this is high praise for a good slasher in my book. I noticed in some reviews that the film suffered serious publicity that have shot P.O.V known killer. And I ask: What is wrong with this ??? This is a classic shot that causes fear in any good supporter of the genre and is great to keep secret the identity of the killer. The only thing stopping this film received high marks in my book, which is strange twist (shows the killer) are not handled with great care, I mean it's just happening kind of fast, but great performances do just about worthy of trust. In addition to this prank is a great film (although I prefer the original name), and it is a shame that so many people knock it as a cheap piece of crap. He was more than that, but only a few know that, as it seems to have got lost in the fog of the early '80s slasher. What a shame .... Its really good people movies! Trust me!
