Part of the Grinch has been made for Jim Carrey, and I was very impressed with his work. Not being a big fan of his, I was afraid, but pleasantly surprised with the result. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who was the cutest little girl I saw on the screen for a long time, and it showed maturity beyond her years in her acting. I've even drawn to tears at one point! I've never read the book by Dr. Seuss tale so I do not know what to expect, it was quite dark humor. Overall, I enjoyed the movie (except for the songs!) And would recommend it to browse the family especially.
