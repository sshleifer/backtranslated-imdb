"The whole world is a stage and its people are the actors in it" - or something like that. Who the hell said that the theater stopped in the orchestra pit - or even on the door of the theater? Why not participants in the audience theatrical experience, including the story itself <br /> <br /> This film was a grand experiment that said :! "Hey, the story of you and that you need more than your attention, you need your active participation." "Sometimes we give the story to you, sometimes you have to go down in history." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, no one was listening, but that does not mean that there should not have been said.
