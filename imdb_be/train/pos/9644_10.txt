I'm gonna give it to ya right ... this film enough. foreign gay movies so quickly surpassing American gay movies in the highest quality products acting and stories. while many American indie films gay grainy, poor sound, a lover of action, corny storylines, and a strange absence of any nudity or erotic, high-quality foreign gay films were popping up like this in France. Film lovely, thoughtful, meaningful. story adult and sophisticated (but not difficult for anyone to follow), the current intense and professional. how to fi, as well as the entire cast. boys are more than just beautiful and there are lots of full frontal nudity. you follow the whole year of these boys, from their meeting to the end. all the little nuances of the relationship, the details fall in and out of love it beautifully performed. it left me wanting more. check it out!
