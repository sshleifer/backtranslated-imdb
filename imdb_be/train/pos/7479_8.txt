"The sweet is never sweet without the sour." This quote was in fact the theme for the film, in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who gave everything in his life. He takes for granted, and it is in full swing around in this big movie with a wonderful twist. This movie will keep you engaged in the story and not being able to pause to take a bathroom break. <br /> <br /> His film, which really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You can not really appreciate the best things in life (sweet), as well as love, as long as you have not experienced bad (sour). The theme will really make you "open your eyes". <br /> <br /> Only complaint is that the film gets very twisted into points, and really hard to understand. I think the end is beautiful, though. I recommend that you watch it and see for yourself.
