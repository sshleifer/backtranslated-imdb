When I saw Exterminators year 3000 for the first time, I had no hope for this film. Although it was not as bad as I thought it would. It's kind of the Italian version of RoadWarrior, alloy, which is almost known in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. For this story Elisa Briganti and Dardan Sacchetti, who are also responsible for the story of a zombie flesh eaters. You can also look for other links to the Italian horror movies: Luca Venantini plays the role of Tommy, and you can see that the child is in Paura NELLA Chita acts Mort viventi (City of the Living Dead AKA The Gates of Hell), John Robbins and Cannibal Apocalypse as the role of Mary Brother . Quite entertaining film, with some blunt parts.
