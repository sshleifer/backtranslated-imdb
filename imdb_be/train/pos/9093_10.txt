I am the father of the special needs of the child, and I enjoyed the movie very much! It was love, warmth and fun. I learned a long time to see the humor in things. In particular, I thought it was sweet as all the other characters are worried about Frankie and who will take care of him after his grandmother died. I attended a screening of the film focus with other parents and siblings of special needs children before the film was edited. Everyone liked the film, and it really inspired wonderful discussions. We talked about how our kids make us laugh, and we also talked about how we have to worry about them. Writer spoke about how it works with autistic children and other special needs children as a volunteer for several years. She based the character on a real person. Our family has been blessed with a sense of humor that got us through a very stressful time. I give the film two thumbs up !!!
