I know that it's rude, and I know that it is not at all PCs, but it's so funny. If you can put it in perspective, that it from the beginning of the 80s, and it carries with it all the time stereotypes - and the film still makes you almost faint from laughter - what a really good comedy. That goes with the tradition that the comedy had been for thousands of years, the subject of this film are exaggerated. If you can suspend political correctness for an hour and a half just to have a total of laughter than see it. <br /> <br /> P.S. Will someone please put this on DVD, it's so hard to find on VHS anymore.
