One of the best comedians ever. I saw this show about 10 times, and most of all, to watch it, at least 100 more. My friends and family quotes from this DVD so often, you'd think we did not do anything but watch. The initial part of the Alcatraz a little slow, but either wade through it or zip code into the account the part where Eddie is on the scene. Watch for the section "the Cake or Death" (a joke on the Church of England) and of the "Hitler / Pol PotÂ» (hard to explain, just watch). The best part of the show can be an expression of Eddie's face. He really has a lot to say through his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner, eye shadow, and probably will, yes?) Fair warning: Eddie does tend to throw a lot of four-letter words.
