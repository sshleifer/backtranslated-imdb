I hate reading reviews that say something like: "Do not waste your time, this film stinks on ice, he makes up for this reviewer even for me, it might have some naive charm If you like other films« Whistler »series, this one.. will be watchable. If you want 40S noirish movies, this one will be watchable. <br /> <br /> this film is not as good, in my opinion, as any of the previous records series that starred Richard Dix as the main character. this much slower, and the plot is trivial. you have seen this same unit told Later used in many other films, and usually better. <br /> <br /> But the acting is good, and so light, and dialogue. It's just not enough power, and you're likely to find out exactly what's going on and how it's all going to come out in the end, no more than a quarter of the way to the end. <br /> <br /> The series «Whistler» is a semi-noir, and the character, mood, lighting, camera movement and angles with It is more important than the story itself. But this film is not noir. It's too light weight and Hollywood guilty for this. Neither the nature of Richard Dix, nor those of any of his home in the previous films did not have to come to a good end. You just never know until the end. <br /> <br /> But still, I will recommend this to at least one view. I watched it at least two times himself, and got a reasonable amount of pleasure from it both times.
