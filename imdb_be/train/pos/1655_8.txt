Mendes and Marichal gave us a serious, painful and compelling analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis, which has 108 years of colonialism engendered in Puerto Rico. Beautiful island with the most hospitable people I have met, and also because our country refuses to face its imperial responsibilities, Puerto Ricans were allowed to wither and die. <br /> <br /> spiritual crisis that the colonial situation of Puerto Rico created when families and undermine the basic institutions that support any society. Corruption thrives to the extent that people do not pay taxes (which resulted in a financial crisis for the country) and a sense of cynicism and mistrust permeate the culture. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the island, the grant allowed this painful but powerful film to be made. <br /> <br /> A must see. ,,
