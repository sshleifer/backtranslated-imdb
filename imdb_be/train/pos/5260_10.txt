Yes, it may be blunt and may not seem so funny how many big-budget comedies out there, but this film is really fun if you really look. Tim Meadows I am always surprised how funny off Saturday Night Live show. Every time he would do this character on the show, I would crack up laughing. Therefore, after I saw it will play on Comedy Central one night I decided to check it out. In general, I was struck farily with this film, because it was not supposed to win any Oscars, or to become a comedy of the year, but it was to please fans in a live Saturday night, I love the character of a womanizer. This film is also packed with some very Quotable lines that can be read for years to come.
