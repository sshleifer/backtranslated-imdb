I wish "that 70s show" returns to the TV. It was the greatest show ever !!! They have to make the episodes between the other episodes, but of course that would be confusing. But I would like to come back and do more episodes . go back ... the show was absolutely hilarious. you could not laugh without seeing the episode. There is a very funny in each episode, plus the show was much better when Hyde and Jackie went out with each other. It was the best episodes. «That« 70s show is the best ".... This is and always will be the best show ever. This would lo really sad when the show was over. They have to make new episodes.
