not quite sure what to expect with this, outside the Uniform positive reviews that I read. It turns out that I could not imagine this film, because it is very close to the "Bride With White Hair" is an opera and that's fantastic. It is a fine line between being a farce, comedy, and just a good old fashion ghost story telling. There's nothing terrible about it, it's not a theme, it really is basically a love story deals with a clumsy guy who meets a beautiful ghost, which is in a lot of trouble with the other ghosts. Therefore, the main theme is the guy trying to save a beautiful ghost. This also happens in ancient China, a strange wild Kung Fu exhibitions, and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the ghosts stop action is pretty cool, and the visual effects on top speed all the way. I could see this genre of Chinese cinema all day, because they are very interesting, great visuals, and quite a lot of mocking. And I'm looking forward to watching the first sequel of the film too. Highly recommended.
