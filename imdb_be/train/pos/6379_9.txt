The film «Atlantis: The Lost Empire» is a bright pearl in the rubble of films produced in the Disney Studios recently. Parents who have had to sit through "The Jungle Book 2" or even Pokemon movie will surely appreciate this <br /> <br /> The film is one of the few to try in the original story. Previous movies art were simply re retellings of existing stories. Films such as "Toy Story," "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters, Inc." everyone is doing the same thing, but it is worth noting that all of them were made by Pixar and distributed only to Disney. Recent films by Disney Studios generally released directly to video, and the continuation of the existing successful films. The quality of these films gave way to profitability. A new era began with the "Atlantis" after it was "mule", "Lilo & Stitch" and «Open Range» lately. The authors have created all the original storylines instead of tales of the past. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is devoted to the quest to find Atlantis, a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years. Including the young Milo Thatch, voiced by Michael J. Fox. Miley hired Museum in Washington, D.C .. His grandfather was a famous archaeologist, who has devoted his whole life to find Atlantis. This was seen as a waste of their colleagues, and they want Miley did not follow in his footsteps. After failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor the expedition, Miley comes home to find a woman in his dark apartment. She takes him to her employer, Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore was a close friend of Miley's grandfather, and Miley wants to send a team to find Atlantis. Mr. Whitmore is very rich and has paid for the best. The crew, who must accompany him as well as his grandfather. Journey filled with many more obstacles to overcome, and it is great fun to watch. The viewer finds himself caught up when they reach Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected turn after the opening of Atlantis, and not only the opening of the people. Enough to keep the interest in the old auditorium. <br /> <br /> animators did an excellent job in that the depth of the animation. The film is very successful in combining traditional animation with computer images. A feat not easily achieved, most of the audience quickly notice the difference in the two. Characters believable people. There are some nice scenes such as car chases, with a lot of the action takes place. A few lulls filled with jokes that kids just can not get. <br /> <br /> writer's work really shines through. Culture Atlantis richly developed, including the entire language. The film used reference Atlantis from historical sources, such as Plato. The disappearance of the world of Atlantis is due. Plausible when a younger audience that magic really does exist. Powers of Atlantis people is not represented exactly like magic, but can best be described in this way. <br /> <br /> Although established in 1914, the level of technology used unrealistic. The journey in a submarine is very reminiscent of the Nautilus of Captain Nemo, complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes. Giant excavators driven by steam boilers so they try some era of technology. Female characters are endowed with in such a way that women in the age were not even keeping role in the manual. It's not bad. It provides a good role model for my daughter to see, not all male cast. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons this film is my favorite over the other films Disney is that there is not one single song ever. A tradition that began with the first feature film "Snow White", and carry on «The Lion King», almost every Disney movie songs full of optimistic. This is great and all, that would be the Seven Dwarfs without "Hi HO!»? After the millionth time after it would almost be better off without him, but this one is spared father. Not once does each person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one had never heard before, and light up in the song. I, for one, is grateful. <br /> <br /> The storyline and depth of the animation is sure to keep the attention of both parents and the child, yes. This is a movie that I'm ready to watch again and again with their children.
