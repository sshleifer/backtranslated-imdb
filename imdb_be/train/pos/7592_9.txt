Just I finished watching a movie and would like to give my opinion (and justice) in the film. <br /> <br /> First of all, to get things straight, this film is not pretending to be anything other than a hard action comedy film. It does not aim to make a revolution in the film industry and to gather critical offer and do not want to be viewed as a single entity. If you really want to enjoy this film in full, I suggest you give up the critical-mindedness and your desire for a good story, because you will not find here. It has been established, let us continue in the film. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations for this film simply because he did not have a strong plot (yes, moviegoers, I underestimated this film as well), but I never expected myself to enjoy this the movie that much. I even enjoyed it more than the movie by Stephen Chow (which I find Kung Fu Hustle, to be his best efforts and I will have this household 9a). Action sealed and epic comedy and chokes on the right places. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS alert, I think that the action may be unrealistic, but for some reason I want to see a serious basketball movie anyway? There are many other sports movies (drama), which has already done so well, why create another one? SPOILERS end <br /> <br /> I do not even know why you are reading this article. Go ahead and look. Just remember, do not think - just watch, enjoy, smile, laugh, and <br /> <br /> Every once in a while they (the film industry) creates such masterpieces as Pulp Fiction or a movie Godfather, and sometimes they create movies are better in the dump heap. I'm not saying Kung Fu Dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples are, again, if we are talking about Stephen Chow-ish comedy, this one in the top ten. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend if you love: -no elementary films with very good action -Kung Fu -Death Trance -Kung Fu and comedies -What staples, look at it. you will have a great time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for you throwing Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
