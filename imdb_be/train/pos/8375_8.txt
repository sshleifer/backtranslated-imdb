<br /> <br /> Robot JOX great little film well, some of the sets and the bad effect is not so great, but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age. You have to remember that this film is more than 10 years now and has been made very cheaply in the 1st place, so you can not moan a lot about the bad parts. So just sit back and watch a cool movie with a great big robots in it.
