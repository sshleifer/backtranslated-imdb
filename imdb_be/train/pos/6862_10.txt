When people ask me why I love movies so much, I usually respond, "Did you see a sequence of art gallery in De Palma's Dressed to kill?" Only one scene, to a large extent is all that I want to see in the film. If I was the director, that would be kind of what I wanted to do. "Pure Cinema" is one way to describe this sequence, and it's really amazing to see how the entire film directed by De Palma's work on the same frequency of high art of the scene. It is a dream, like a movie, smart as hell, and with more energy and intelligence than a dozen films together. I think that the film raises the important point that there will always be a subject of hot debate: whether the film can rely solely on technique and is still considered an artistic success? The film has no message, to talk about the actor's big, but it is at the service of style, and the script is a little logic. De Palma film does a really good deal, that style, if properly handled, can withstand a feature film. Of course, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Kate Gordon give excellent performances, but this movie as a director all the way to FADEOUT. This is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium. I will not tell you that Hitchcock film film pays homage (I do not want to spoil any surprises), but I think that De Palma beyond the arc of the story, and he manages to create a film that pretty much sums up my entire career , not for the faint of heart!
