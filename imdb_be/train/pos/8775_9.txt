Great job Warner Bros starring Errol Flynn in one of his best screen performances. This is often referred to as his best, and I can not judge fully until I saw him, "Dawn Patrol». Nevertheless, his work in "They Died with Their Boots On," takes some beating I'm a big fan of Flynn. (He is my favorite actor after James Mason - it also helps that he is Australian), and I think he's just gorgeous, a large presence of the screen, as well as a great actor. he is the central "Gentleman Jim," as legendary boxer with a wistful, but it is also backed up by a competent, warm and funny script and the direction of Raoul Walsh. Walsh Every movie I have not seen it never loses the rhythm this pace, it really was a born filmmaker. olsh directs ring scene beautifully as he does with lighter moments and the piercing, big final scene between Ward Bordeaux and Flynn. Add to this great production values ​​( "gay ninetieth" never looked better!) and a great supporting cast, and this is pretty much the perfect entertainment. Alan Hale is usually played sidekick Flynn, but his father, and he still works. Alexis Smith's love interest Flynn. The pair is head over heels in love with the struggle with each other.
