Melting of the MAN ... a tragic victim of the space race, he died melted ... never reach the dew bygone ...! <br /> <br /> A person (Berry Debenning) smoking his hand on the kitchen stove. But instead of yelling something a normal person would shout, he shouts something that sounds like «AAAAATCH-KAH !!» This film you jumped ... it's not a normal movie. You have just made the first step in an incredibly fused MAN, gore film known dead, 70 with the participation of outstanding Rick Baker's make-up effects. Baker was on the edge of becoming a superstar, and did so at the same time as his famous «Cantina aliens" in STAR WARS. For some strange reason, STAR WARS became a household name, and INCREDIBLE MAN trunks did not. <br /> <br /> This may have something to do with the fact that this film is just mind numbingly awful. With the opening credits ( "Starring Alex rebar as Incredible fused MAN» ... it really is what it says!), To the plump nurse passes through the glass door to the fisherman's head going over the waterfall and breaking graphically from each other certain rocks, this film gives many, many moments of apparent obscurity. "Why are they ... but how does he ... why are they ...?" After a while, you refuse to wonder why and see it as what it is - a very interesting piece of trash <br /> <br /> astronaut returns to Earth in the smelting radioactive state. it runs, and its decay mind and its body starts melting spree insane death. Authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped, but (perhaps not wanting to "cause panic") wants him to be captured as quietly as possible. So they send a guy with a Geiger counter after him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Storywise, surprisingly little is happening in the film. Melting guy wandering around killing people. The doctor looks for it with a Geiger counter. Various characters are entered, ask questions and leave. In the end, the doctor is catching the man melting, but a security guard shot dead for no reason, after he explains that he "Dr. Ted Nelson." The man is distracted melting, and finally dissolved in a large puddle of slime. End. <br /> <br /> It's so mindless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun, despite the rather gloomy ending. Presumably, Widescreen DVD release is planned. A very special movie.
