At this time, the film was written by a dispute over it (like most projects Verhoeven) <br /> <br /> It contains very graphic images of death-scene. Parachute that did not open * smack * Body guys on the field. Man absorption Lion * * gnawing teeth in the throat. And the guy hitting on a high-speed * Zoom * bloody corpse falls. <br /> <br /> But apart from gore, this film also contains some brilliant (and stunningly beautiful scenes), filmed in the city of gray fish that Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of buds fly across the screen in a few irrelevant part of the film, a beautiful (holidays) woman putting flowers in a milk-can surrounded with slabs of meat dripping blood and obscene love scene between the two male characters in cemetery. <br /> <br /> history lies in a rage, but following the 10 minutes that will not disappoint, and will leave you sighing breath of relief. <br /> <br /> Of course, come with pros cons, some special effects too over-the-top, and obviously done to see how far Verhoeven could push Gore-factor (for example, a few eyeballs hanging from their nests). In addition, while two leading actor (Jeroen Krabbé and Reni Sautendizhk) do an excellent job to breathe life into their characters, the character of Herman (drawn quite un-charming Thom Hoffman) just feels very developed, which makes it it is difficult to care for, even after his tragic death. <br /> <br /> I did my best to give you some idea of ​​what to expect from this strange film, and as you can see, it's not so easy summed up in words. So do yourself a favor, if you are lucky enough to find this movie anywhere, watch it! And enjoy the unique style and content of this masterpiece.
