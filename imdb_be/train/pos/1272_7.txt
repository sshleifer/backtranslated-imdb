Enjoyable film, though I think it had the potential to be even better if it was more depth to it. It's a mystery, halfway through the film to know why Elly a hermit. Then, when we were finally given an explanation, dating back to her childhood there still are not many details. Maybe if they show flashbacks or something. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is still a good movie, I like to watch again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
