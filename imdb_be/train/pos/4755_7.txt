A bus with passengers stranded during a snow storm. The police closed the bridge - they say that it is dangerous, and they are stuck in a small cafe, until the road was not cleared. However, after a while, their sadness turned concern as it seems that one of the passengers was not originally on the bus, and may simply be a foreigner !! This leads to the conclusion that it is paradoxical, but quite funny in low-standard way. <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest episodes of Dark Zone. Instead of the typical corners or social commentary, that there is no longer reported. However, it is also very watchable, so who cares? That's what happens, you just have to see for yourself <br /> <br /> By the way, these stars John Hoyt -. The person most of you know from countless old TV shows and movies. In almost every case, he played a real curmudgeon (Charles Lane in the same period), but boy did I love to see him - as he perfected the grumbling person and was pretty funny at the same time.
