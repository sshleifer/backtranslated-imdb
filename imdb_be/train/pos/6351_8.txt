If the Grinch came out I was excited, but I thought it would be a lighthearted movie, and it was. Although it really was a little Nightmare Before Christmas touch to it. You know, kind of dark and scary. I loved this movie, because it helped to fill people with the spirit of Christmas. Thus, mainly the Grinch saved Christmas. What happened next is well Whoville they say that the Grinch little heart grew three sizes that day. MERRY GRINCHMAS!
