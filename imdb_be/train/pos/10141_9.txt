I was ready to pan the scene saw that the "Master" does not really have any horror movies under his belt .. but this is easily the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> The action was good !! I do not know how he argued, but we do have some real talent in this episode! And while you might see things coming a mile plot wise, at least, it was interesting, and managed to keep me engaged for as long as 56 minutes, that was missing up to this point in this series. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the bit at the end, rather than turn to say, but just a little bit funny, where he becomes, as always, a chicken-pecked husband. <br /> <br /> Really good effort. As I have said in other reviews- this is not the real masters do a lot of these episodes .. but they may someday end up wizard in the future.
