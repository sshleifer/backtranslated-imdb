This movie is great! He touched my stone cold heart. I could not talk about racial discrimination, Antwone experienced, because I live in my own country. I believe that it is really difficult to discriminate. <br /> <br /> We watched this film in our class of sociology at New Era University, and I did not know that it was a true story, I thought it was just created by intellectuals who want to bring fresh air in the industry. This is very good. <br /> <br /> The part that shocked me when Nadine abused Antwone (who was only six) sexy. If I were in his shoes, I would jump in the ten-storey high-rise building. I welcome him, because he is so strong! <br /> <br /> The scene that touched me there, if Antwone finally saw his mother Eve face to face. He was not her bitch or anything, instead he told her about his achievements, he has received over the years, they have been separated. (I think I'm going to do if I get a chance to trace their roots.)
