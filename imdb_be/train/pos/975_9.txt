Also known as the Big Spook War. Most Yokai War is an attempt Miike family film, and cursed he does an excellent job as well. The problem is that I can not imagine a lot of parents who want to expose their children to this movie. The best children's movies are the ones that if frightening imagery scary Neverending Story and return to Oz spring to mind, but in the case of the Great Yokai War Miike is probably taking things a bit too far. In fact, when I was screening the person presenting the film reaffirmed in two families, that is probably not very suitable. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a young hero of the play, introducing yourself and explain about their current family problems. This brief moment of hectic sharply violated as a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a man who shouts something terrible comes to the fall of the dead as it is an abomination (it is quite possible that the very creation of ugliness is some amazing Quato tribute). <br /> <br /> After an incredible introduction to the main villain Kato and his henchwoman yeah (strangely attractive Chiaki Kuriyami), by way of apocalyptic army vehicles. History returns to normal for a while, but it did not take long before the whole logic goes down the drain and young boy with a group of teams Miyazaki denies remove an evil sorcerer. <br /> <br /> the film's plot is fairly simple and surprisingly formulaic at times, all the selected one just seems completely out of place in the film, which is so regularly breaks the cliche, but is based on the simple vision of awe of the magical world. It really is a film made of Miyazaki in the live-action film, although much seedier and meaner than usual Miyazaki film. <br /> <br /> The film is simply a joy to look at the designs Yokai colorful, and largely practical, while the evil robots deformity, does not reflect the best CGI in the world have the practicality and threaten them, that gives them much more sensitive threat than you imagine. <br /> <br /> cast uniformly excellent, they just make their characters seem perfectly natural, which is commendable, considering that most of them are in full body makeup or latex suits. Even Aha screen with a funny beehive comes across as hot and deadly due to the surprisingly different from the action Kuriyami <br /> <br /> While the film has a lot of elements that put it firmly on a family movie. cute creatures, little hero, thoroughly evil villain, a sense of arbitrariness and adventure, and the clear absence of violence. There are elements that make you question worth Miike directed a film. <br /> <br /> Robot Army is really a terrible threat to everyday objects deformed terrifying animals that look like T-101 SANS skin and with the addition of chain saws, rip These animals are the characters to pieces; sucking creature in their blood stained mouth and steal the baby from their homes, holding them right from under the noses of their parents, before indulging in a little murder of his father. <br /> <br /> The creation of beings is as difficult for young minds. Yokai, in fact, the characters that are fed into a giant oven full liquidised form of hatred that eats flesh Yokai and makes them angry souls have a pile of metal. When children think that glow Anakin was bad wait till they see the size of the human hedgehog burning to death in a vat of molten hatred for a minute, before turning into the abomination of the motorcycle. There is also a Separation Of course, in one case, a severed hand twitching in front of the camera is dripping with blood, a fair amount of sexual energy (yeah wears one dress, designed specifically for the fan service and it seems to just sleep with Kato as motivation, while Princess rivers is a song and gets groped her hip young hero in a few scenes), and a general feeling that will go right over the heads of those technicolor wonder was, seemingly, have been developed. <br /> <br /> Spoilers An example of this is that the Yokai only interested in the final battle, when they think it's a big party. The next battle more festival than anything, complete with beer, surfing crowd and slam. Also, the scene where the Aga beats the tar out of cute furry creatures, it seems designed to appeal to the masses JADED from pokemon excessive. <br /> <br /> End of spoiler at the end of the day Great Yokai War is easy on a strong recent films in Miike. While it lacks some of the charm of a perverse say Gozu or Ichi he just constantly pushes the audience down the general madness of the road. In fact it is the most easily deranged Miike film is that it includes a clear subject magic so wholeheartedly. <br /> <br /> Well worth watching only the occasional flash of Gogo ass.
