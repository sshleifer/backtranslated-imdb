The person who wrote the review "enough with sweating and spitting already" has no idea that the cultural, literary, psychological or critic. He rejects the interpretation of Zizek, because they do not give up "in line" with what the director originally . what? The importance of (or author) director's intention is not important in the critical theory. This is known as the author of "intentional fallacy" and should be avoided. <br /> <br /> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Intentional_fallacy text or film can be analyzed by a number of theories, many of which do not agree with each other, and completely ignore in the intention of the author. This is the basic idea of ​​critical theory. <br /> <br /> Because of this, the one who wrote that wall of text wasted a lot of time and effort to insult Žižek. In fact, anyone who studies the theory once thought to discredit the guy (I suggest that you also should), because it is entirely the point. <br /> <br /> that being said ... If you are at all interested in the Freudian, or Laconian Kristevian discourse, this film is mandatory. It combines these theories with popular film, which makes them much more sensitive and more enjoyable than just reading or thinking about them.
