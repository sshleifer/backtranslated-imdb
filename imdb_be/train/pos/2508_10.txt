This movie is awesome. The plot is just ... wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised Gackt and Hyde performance, after increasing in the American world of actors who can not sing and singers who can not act. <br /> <br /> In this film, a young Sho (Gackt) catches a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they form an unlikely friendship. Kei suffers because he is forced to live at the expense of others, the half-life of a vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie, but not juicy. The plot was very unique, and unlike your typical vampire flick. The storyline was thick with the twists and very charming <br /> <br /> The only downside, I would say that the film was, in spite of this lack of happy. - although peaceful ?? end, it would be more than one language. I was undefeated version (I was lucky that I understood all these to keep some Cantonese), so I would recommend getting something with subtitles. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was simply astounding.
