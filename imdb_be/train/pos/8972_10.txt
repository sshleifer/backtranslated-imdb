My discovery of the movie Å vankmajer It opened my eyes to the whole tradition of Czech animation, of which Trnka was a pioneer. His Ruka is one of the best, most technically impressive animated movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Potter wakes up and is watering his plant. He then goes on to pot. But a huge hand comes, which comes crashing pots and requires the potter to make the statue itself. He throws his hand, but she soon comes back and puts him in a bird cage, where he is forced to sculpt stone hand. He sets about it, fainting from fatigue, but finally completes the task. <br /> <br /> In the beautiful metacinema sequence, a potter uses a candle to burn it visible puppet strings that are holding him captive, and he runs back home. He closes in and accidentally killed his own beloved plant when it falls on his head. <br /> <br /> This film does not hide the fact that it is pure animation, in contrast to contemporary films, which tend to be realistic (why?). Hand, for example, is clearly a hand in a glove. Everything else is clay. The rows are visible and are part of the narrative, making it the precursor film strings. The atmosphere is terrible: that hand will be after a bit of a potter was able to instill more fear in me than a lot of horror movies combined <br /> <br /> The film is obvious, but it avoids being completely manipulative in its simplicity .. this tale of creative freedom and tyranny, which can not help win the hearts and minds of those who hold freedom as a natural right.
