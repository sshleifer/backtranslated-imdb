This is the funniest stand up I've ever seen, and I think that's the most fun I have ever seen. If you do not choke from laughing at absolutely hilarious, it's just not your cup of tea. But I honestly do not know anyone who saw it, did not like. Now 17 years later, and my friends, and I still quote all of Goonie Goo Goo to fart games, Aunt Bunny ice cream man, Ralph and Ed to get out !! There are only so many individual and collective scenes of joy in the fact that here, if you truly have not seen this movie, then you are missing out on one of the best rivalries ups ever. Take any Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, The Dice, George Carlin or even greats like Richard Pryor and Red Foxx and it will surpass it. I do not know how and where Murphy got some of his stuff, but it works. That's what it boils down to. It's funny as hell. <br /> <br /> You can imagine how this show has shocked people who were used to doing Buckwheat Eddie and Mr. Rogers and is on SNL? If you listen to the audience when he cracked his first joke when he says the F-word for the first time, they are in complete shock. <br /> <br /> It is the first time he said that the F-word when he makes a parody of the g-T being a homosexual. <br /> <br /> "Hey boy, hey boy. You look pretty strong in them jeans. Now come here, and F @ ** me in the ass! "<br /> <br /> The crowd erupts gales of laughter. Nobody expected that mouth foul language that he unleashed on them. But the results were simply amazing. I have never been bombarded with relentless comedy, as I was standing in this. in fact, the next time when my stomach hurts so much laughter was not until 1999, when I saw the South Park:. Large longer and Uncut This comedy was raw and relentless, and he went for the jugular, as in delirium. I do not think I can watch this piece of comic stories, but do not laugh. it's almost twenty years later, and he still th funniest line in the video. <br /> <br /> "I took your kids fishing last week. And I put a worm on a hook and bait to put children back in the boat and covered their heads in water for two minutes, Gus. normal children do not do shit like Gus. Then they began to move them around the head, as it m ***** **** e come up with fish. Then they looked at each other and said Goonie Goo Goo! I said, you can believe it f **** n shit! "<br /> <br /> Look again and be prepared to laugh your ass Freakin away! <br /> <br /> 10 of 10
