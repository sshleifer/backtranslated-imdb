Woman in black British made-for-TV movie that premiered on BBC in Christmave eve of '89 and again in '92. I believe that it made a tour of American television on A & E. It was released on VHS in the UK in the early 90s, but went out of print. US company released it on DVD later, but this version is also sold out. According to the website of the author of the book data, the film rights now belong to someone else, and that he will come again, and that there are unofficial bootlegs sold on Ebay. <br /> <br /> I first heard about this movie, most recently on the bulletin board and had to check it out. I found a copy on Ebay for about $ 28. It is sure to be a fake from a seller in the Far East, despite the fact, DVD says, "Made in Canada" haha. But it's good copy, and you can not blame the contraband label for the remission of things rare, out of print, and lost in legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love the movies. It's a period piece set in the 1920s, all very authentic and quaint British attitudes of the time. The Woman in Black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the film is very discreet but efficient and frightening. There's no self-indulgent gore, violence, or much at all special effects, but the woman in black was still able to create absolutely frightening moments. This is a terrible stylized classic ghost movie. The film looks like it could be done in 1930 except for the color. Without all the flash of modern horror films, I am afraid that this film will always be a lost gem. For me, it places itself as one of my favorites.
