It Wrestlemania just do not do it for me. While some things, such as a battle, and with the participation of celebrities have been a return to the good old days, so to speak, he seemed to be more of a high-brow "in your house" than anything else. Above average ... worth a few games such as tag team title match, although it should be noted that the change of name does not mean anything, as it was canceled the next night.
