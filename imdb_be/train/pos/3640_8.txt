This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of becoming a baseball pitcher when his arm gave him away. In high school coach, he challenges his players to win the division championship, telling them that he will try for the baseball team when they do. They win (in part because of all they take batting practice with a coach who can take more than 90 miles per hour), and it keeps its part of the bargain - and signed! <br /> <br /> If you ever decided to try something new and scary, as adults, the history of Jim Morris will resonate with you. He moves and inspires, and the relationship of the man rings true. <br /> <br /> Inspiration is not the only reason I rent this one, though. Dennis Quaid only very Pardo in the part, and the baseball movie with a nice man to change diapers is my idea of ​​heaven. Home when you feel like I do, check this one out.
