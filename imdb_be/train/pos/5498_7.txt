This documentary was shown as RTE and the BBC in the past few months. Seeing it twice now, I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in media and documentary films. <br /> <br /> Initially, the film was intended to detail the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Irish crew went with these intentions. What happens when they get in Venezuela is amazing how they witness firsthand undertaken the overthrow of the rebel groups (in particular oil problems in Venezuela) Chavez and his government. What we witness the audience just how the media manipulates the situation and actually supports the overthrow of Chavez, distorting the events that evaporates as a coup intensifies. <br /> <br /> This is a really great documentary and an excellent piece of work of a few first-time filmmakers. <br /> <br />
