At first glance, a film about women who want to see a football game will not appeal to many, is a small interest in football, like me, but this is not about football it comes to discrimination against women and enthusiasm for the sport they love. <br /> <br /> The film opens on the day of the decisive World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain, the girl is trying to get into Tehran's Azad Stadium dressed as a boy, it looks like it will get in the soldiers trying to find her. Once caught, she is taken in a small housing high on the outside of the stadium, where there are several women who are already caught, they are guarded by a small group of mobilized soldiers, leaders wanted to return home to try his animals. We'll never know the names of the characters, but we know them as people, as the girls beg the guard to let them watch, although close the gap in the wall, and when he refused to try to get them to at least give a comment. <br /> <br /> How to make an important point about the rigid gender segregation in most of today's Iran, the film contains a lot of fun, such as "hidden" one of the girls had to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who changed as a soldier and was caught only because she decided to watch the match with a seat reserved for a senior officer. Girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the audience is likely to be on the edge of their seats, hoping that Iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in Germany. Soldiers Unknown fundamentalists, they just recruits, who are there because they have to be in explaining to the girls why a woman can not watch men's sports do not seem convinced of their own arguments. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that this film can not be seen in Iran, but it is good that the world at large can see and, therefore, we see that ordinary Iranians are not a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war in the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns, as people all over the world. The cast did a great job in creating their characters seem like real people, not just a caricature.
