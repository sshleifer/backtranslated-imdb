Nine out of ten may seem high assessment to allow for a direct to video sci-fi film, which has been vilified in the US box office and roundly criticized as a poor film career. <br /> <br /> I Kurt Russell has his reasons. <br /> <br /> First of all, if you've read the negative reviews about this film, they usually start with a wooden nature interpretation Russell Todd, a soldier of the same name. I'm going to start here, with my strange statement that this is probably the best piece of acting I saw Russell pull. Todd is an emotional cripple and suffer from intense PTSD - the movie is recorded to the phenomenon as it is widely recognized that the current <br /> <br /> Drawing spot on .. Todd withdrawn, unsociable and solitary. He suffers from irrational anxiety - key climax of Education, which teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another person for signs of treachery and danger. His hyper-focus brings with it the inability to understand larger continuum that gives him a task to do sit inside - there's a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work quietly, without cleaning or cut blood. Many interpret this as a sign of his physical endurance and focus on the job at hand, but it is also a sign that he simply performs the task of company, - not understanding the relationship between the vegetables, he cooks and food that will be. eaten later <br /> <br /> dialogue Todd spartan, to say the least - two big scene say he gets a central role in the plot of the film, and both emphasize the austere nature of its existence. Fear and discipline we are talking about. Always. Fear to keep him pumped up in a hyper state of anxiety, where the smallest detail will not pass, keeping it ready to respond on a knife edge. Discipline to keep it in check through his fear, to overcome it and execute tactically. The conclusion is that it does not have time to think, and can not afford to feelings. Many viewers have different interpretations of its response to the hug from Sandra Nielsen - but I think you have to interpret it from the perspective of a man who only experience an embrace in the battle - shivering is its suppression of his fight / flight instinct react in fear of being grappled, his movement and vision is limited. - fear and discipline really <br /> <br /> Then there is the subtext of his refusal (twice actually) - as representative of the way our society tends to throw the Marines in the trash of society when they are serving sentences. 40% of the unemployed are former military men in our world, in HIS it can only be worse. Russell quickly picks up the mantle of responsibility Mace with his wife and child - in desperate need of mission, even one with a high probability of his death <br /> <br /> Then there is also a military subtext -. Busey conflict between the Church and in a lump from the headquarters, Mekum. new people Mekum are faster, stronger, more precise and aggressive. Any one of them could grind Todd into the ground - but it's not about the tools, which are how you use them. Todd gave incentives to exercise their freedom of initiative and act without analgesia perceived advantages of using ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut the band through a new unit - sent in without the support, cover or intelligence. This is a reminder that military force can not compensate for failure in leadership. <br /> <br /> There are many other fine threads. If the film is removed and the script is so minimal, that leaves a lot of empty space for your own interpretation of the root. See Soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches you.
