I saw it 25 years ago on PBS. It was very difficult to observe. So real. To view this small family fight heart was torn apart in the winter. There is no time for courtship: the fate not thrown us together, and we put our shoulders grindstone and make it work. This was based on the actual diary of the woman I had read many years later. She said that in her diary that her parents died when she was young, and all their bothers and sisters had to work on a farm, to feed themselves. She learned how to mow, which was not like a lady. She was afraid that any prince would like to see a woman with a sun-browned, calloused hands, but my husband was so happy that his new wife know how to mow, and she was happy to do it. Both were widows, and they worked together to build a new house. It was so, so sad, if the child died. Of course, if they had it today, I'm sure it would have been nice. It only makes the tragedy of unnecessary boring. I cried so much. But then they went out and successfully took a new calf. Spring is on its way, and life goes on. In her diary, she had more than two boys, and they lived.
