I do not know how or why this film has a poor rating of IMDb. The film, accompanied by the "I'm curious: Blue." Is a masterpiece <br /> <br /> The only thing that let you down in this film, if you do not like the process of the film, no longer as a psychology or, if you're expecting a hardcore pornographic ram <br /> <br /> This is not a movie you want to see, to relax. this is a movie you want to see, like any other masterpiece, with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** ABSTRACT may contain spoiler or two ******* <br /> <br /> The main thing in this movie is that it combines the entire film, the film thing, but doing it in a way that sometimes you forget that fiction are not real. <br /> <br /> film, like many movies in one: <br /> <br /> 1. The political documentary about the social system in Sweden at the time. In many respects, it is still relevant today. Interview done by a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. The story of the film director, Shoman, which makes the movie ... it has to do with the relationship with his star in the film and how it should never be linked with people, it should work. <br /> <br /> 3. The film, which makes Vilgot. It is about a young woman named Lena (IE. # 2), which is a young and very politically active, she is doing a documentary (IE. # 1.). It is also coming of age and in their sexuality, and freedom that <br /> <br /> Beauty and simply shine "I Curious: Yellow / Blue". Here's how these three elements are cut together. At one point you see the interview on politics, and the next your watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes, but does it so well that you sometimes forget that this story. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the dynamic between "yellow" and "the Blue", which, if you see one, you should see the other. "Blue" is not a sequel at all. I will try to explain that better, I can not, because as far as I know, no other movies have done so, although this is a great technique. <br /> <br /> Think of the «Yellow», as a living being, the actual events of 14 scenes. Full story. <br /> <br /> Think of "the Blue", like all things in between 14 scenes in "yellow" that you do not see that this is the complete story of his own. <br /> <br /> In fact, they are parallel to the movies ... The same story is told in two different ways. <br /> <br /> It was not until I saw the first 30 minutes «Blue», that I fully understood the "yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope this was helpful for people who are in currently it puzzled by various influences, because the film has changed the way I looked at the film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
