My favorite movie! I've seen a lot of movies, but this one beats them all! Excelent action, wonderful story. You, as a "normal" caring person begins to love George. Altough he's an actor, he is also very, very attractive man. Maby And most importantly, you learn to respect and look different for people with Down syndrome.
