This is the second Eytan Fox film that I've seen. Fantastic actor Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in the walk on the water, has a small role in this film as <br /> <br /> But the real stars of young Israelis who live together in a small apartment. - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lula (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); Palestinian and connecting them to the - Ashraf (Yousef «Joe» Sweid). There is a kind Friends / Sex and the City thing going (mostly gay), and they just want to end the war, so that they can continue their lives in the world. <br /> <br /> But this is a hitch. No matter how many posters you put up or how much to rave you have a world war will not end. Many have tried for years to bring both sides to the table, but they just want to keep it for some reason. There are many on the Israeli side, and there, and here in the US who just want to get it all, and will not consider the world. There are many on the Palestinian side, which seems to work with should the world ever. It is neither in the interests of his to put an end to this war, and children suffer. <br /> <br /> It's always on your mind as you watch this funny and fascinating film. He will not leave. You know that something tragic would happen, and, of course, it does. With feelings on both sides running strong, and vengeance as a motivator, always a tragedy, and this is what makes this adult Friends / Sex and the City. There's no superficiality. This is real life, and it was lovely to see.
