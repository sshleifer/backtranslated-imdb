I am far from a fan of Sylvester Stallone, and I believe that the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French film Taxi 3, which is almost non-existent small role. And yet I must admit that this film was actually not too bad, although I feared the worst. <br /> <br /> If Gabe (Stallone) does not save the girlfriend of one of his friends, and she plunges into her death from 4000 feet high mountain top, he can not bring himself to continue working as a mountain huntsman. For almost a year he does not set a meal in the reserve, but the more he returns. Shortly after his return, they receive an emergency call from a group of tourists who are stuck in a snow storm. At least, that is, they believe that the gamekeeper. In fact, a group of robbers who had a fight with their plane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal a case full of money from a flying airplane government failed. Cases are distributed throughout the reserve, and they need the help of professional climbers, to get them ... <br /> <br /> It is certainly not one of the smartest movies ever, but in its genre is a pleasant one . I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master of the mind, and the leader of the gang of robbers. I know that he is the best of the series Â«3rd Rock from the Sun", but I liked his performance in this film as well. In general, acting in order, it was a lot of action to offer and, of course, also some jokes, but he also offered a very nice decor. This movie was filmed in a beautiful natural environment. I loved the snow-capped mountains and valleys, mountain streams and the forest ... Perhaps that is why I give this film a score higher than what I usually give in the action / adventure of this kind. I give it a 6.5 / 10 If you do not expect too much, it's a nice film.
