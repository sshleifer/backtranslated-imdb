I never seem to write a review on IMDb, if I'm not really surprised by how good or how bad a movie is. This film belongs to the first category. Every year I try to see all the nominees for best foreign film at the Academy Awards, even the ones that I know I will not like it. "How in heaven," it seems to fit the bill. The plot sounds sweet and sentimental and slowly .... To my taste, working more than the original, dark and / or brave a foreign film (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, many modern Japanese / Korean cinema) "as in heaven" does not sound especially interesting .... it does not get released in the US, so I sat down to watch VCD I found in Singapore, he is preparing to "cross it from the list." After a sad beginning, "as in heaven" becomes that rare film where you actually become excited about what is happening on the screen. Weaknesses: The characters in the film are clean "campaignÂ» characters- wounded Dreamer, city Bully, knocked his wife, prostitute Yearning for love, minister repressed .... Fortunately, they are largely sympathetic bunch, as well as being well written and well acted . Ingela Olsson's wife Inger minister would be nominated for an Oscar was her performance was in English. Strong: beautiful music, and the main song by Gabriella sing, really dramatic and memorable. And watch out for the bold 87-year-old actress plays Olga, who have time to dance steps, and give the young! I will not discuss the ending, but I will say that it makes sense. They have a lot of emotional things going on in the last hour of the film, and you're not quite sure why they occur. Although nothing has been explained in words, it all makes sense, since the film comes to a crescendo fitting. **** to *****. Probably the most powerful Swedish movie I've ever seen.
