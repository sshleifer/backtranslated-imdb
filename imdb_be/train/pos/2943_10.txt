I think it is still the best routine. There are some others, like rocks "hurts", and Allen "Men are Pigs", which paddles; Â«Damon Waynes past" as a fun way to weeping - but this procedure has no errors. All jokes are funny, and the 70-minute time limit is perfect. Just long enough to last 20 years. I just love how it allows the audience to be fully themselves and unlimited. I am a supporter of the classics, and for a guy who watched a lot of Jim Carrey grew up watching more laid back comic is pretty cool. Not investing in the category with Helen and Newhart, but what you can see when you're bloated. Thanks Eddie, God bless.
