Critics stupid. This film is funny and smart. I liked this movie a lot. Why does everyone hate this movie so much. I wish people like this movie more than they do not. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and they are put through a lot of work to make this film. I do not see you people out there make films as they are. Thus, people should just watch and comment. I like this movie. This is normal, after all this. There are parts of it were to get silly, but they do at least that. Jerry Stiller would like it, because this movie is acting just like the show King Of Queens. But it's better than that. I can not believe that it was rated so low.
