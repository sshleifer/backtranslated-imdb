After reading some other comments here I have something really awful to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. Reality Check: The original series is not so good. I think that some people will remember him with more love than he deserves, but separately from the foot chases and Daisy Duke in the script was weak and poorly acted. Duke boys were too smart and chic for backwood provincials sat Boss Hog was too feeble-minded to be evil and Rosco was just hyper for every screen moment. This amazing series actually lasted as long as it did because he ran out of the storylines for the first series. <br /> <br /> Back to the film. When you watch the movie in its own right, rather than as a direct comparison with that said, you remember the series, then it is not bad. The real star, of course, the General Lee. The car chases and stunts very well and this is really what D.O.H. it's all about. Johnny Knoxville his usual eccentric self and with Seann William Scott as cousin For the time make this film really funny to hilarious Dumb-and-dumber kind of way the series never achieved. Beautiful Jessica Simpson, Miss clear Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes a much improved Boss Hog and MK Gainey makes a believable bad Rosco P. Coltrane, as it always should have been. <br /> <br /> If you do not like slapstick humor and crazy car stunts, then you would not see this movie anyway, because you need to know what to expect. Otherwise, if you want an entertaining action flick car with a few good laughs, it's not too loads the brain then see this pleasant romp with an open mind.
