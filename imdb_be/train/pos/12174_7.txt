I think that the deal with this film, he has about 2 minutes on a really, really funny moments, and it does a very good trailer and a lot of people come to the expectations of the trailer, and this time the movie does not live up to the trailer. This is slightly more sluggish and pull a little slow for this exciting space, and I think that I see from the comments of people who have a love / hate relationship with this movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you look in this film for what it is and not what it could be, given the talent of the actors, I think it's still pretty good. Julia Stiles is clearly the star, it is so frivolous and carefree, which is installed between the conformity of all the others, she just lights up, and the whole audience falls in love with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, testosterone-filled staff Lee, his elegant mother-in-law, his fratlike friend Jim and his bride will all do a great job in fitting the stereotypes of conformity and boringness, which make Stiles stand in the first place. <br /> <br /> Does not live up to its Kostars, I do not think so, but you could see that the more that they are difficult to justify. Maybe this is another source of frustration. <br /> <br /> of the film, in spite of a little slow and a few jokes that do not come off as funny as the writer intended, is still pretty funny, and I found quite a smart movie. Topics of conformity and "taking a safe route," seemed to cleverly align multiple layers. For example, was the whole motive, he will submit a script, but will never act on them until the last stage, or, as he was listening to a radio broadcast on the highway saying how everything fits, or just like all Selma Blair and the characters Julia Stiles He said, and does not repeat these themes one person who is a safe choice, and a risky choice. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about the film was that it was a sort of screwball comedy in which Jason Lee has to keep lying his way through the film and who, through dumb luck. (Example: pharmacy guy turning out a good cook), and some ingenuity, for its part runs away with it for the most part <br /> <br /> At the time it was not as funny as I expected, and was a little wasted talent, but in general, it's still a good film.
