I just finished watching this movie and found it very enjoyable. It is a quiet, little film that does not overwhelm you with special effects or "big" performances. It just gets you into the lives of people who live in a small village in the backwoods of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas gives a good idea of ​​how Raymond Toker, a young loner who finds an abandoned baby in the woods. Toker search for the child's parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Leicester, slimy crook with good reason. David plays the bad guy to perfection. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this film than meets the eye. Filmed on location in North Carolina and with an excellent soundtrack of traditional music, it is worth watching.
