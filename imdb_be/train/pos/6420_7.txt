This is a big one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding joined together to make a powerful and highly influential film. This is the true story of the first black US Navy diver and the obstacles he faced in achieving its certification in the hands of racist Master diver. Along the way, he has also come across good old fanaticism of all their classmates, none of whom wanted him in her class. They move from the barracks when he arrives. In the end, he becomes certified and continues to have a great career as a US Navy diver. Watch this! This is a great story of courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we get to watch racism slowly dissipated, and all begin to respect people one at a time.
