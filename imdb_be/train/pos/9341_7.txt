Sandler country again ... I've become a fan of Sandler. This film is a sad story Sandler. His expression is fantastic. I cried more watching Press, but there are some similar points. Consider the importance of family, before losing it and being able to say "I love you" are some of the most impressive truths in life ... It's hard, it's real ... but in fact there is the real owner of this success, Binder . I do not think another director might give these emotions in this way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burroughs too strange ... Cheadle is one of my favorites since the accident. Do not expect a lot of laughter positive atmosphere ... If you're ready for the realities of life, do not miss this film.
