«Scarface» has a large cult even now, 22 years after its release. <br /> <br /> It has also been widely criticized as a very sticky, non-refined, over-the-top and all hyped up! These are people who are compared to the Godfather movie Scarface. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, script, direction, etc.) Scarface far behind «The Godfather». <br /> <br /> But it is also true that that Scarface has some other gangster movies is not enough, it's damp, he crude approach gangsters. Latin gangsters in the film look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas". This is one of the main points of winning the scar, and I firmly believe that this fact has been written off as "stickiness" by most critics! I saw the original 1932 Scarface, and I have to say that both these films are very different from each other and should be treated as two separate films rather than the original praise on the "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this film. But what about, given that it is exactly as the filmmakers wanted the character of Tony Montana to be! He is the angry young man who takes a hasty decision and throws a tantrum attacks every minute! He did not calm Michael Corleone is here. He was Tony Montana is very tacky, uneducated person who does not really think a lot, and angry all the time! <br /> <br /> There is certainly a very 80s feel in this film. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including the "Gina and Elvira threads", "push it to the border" and the title track tool. <br /> <br /> There are a few memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, then Rebenga hit, the first meeting with visiting Sosa and Tony to his mother <br /> <br /> On the performances. Al Pacino is brilliant as malicious Cuban refugee. He is reported to have said that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana himself during his entire career. And it does seem that he enjoyed himself thoroughly in all their scenes! Interestingly, the «Scarface» to without Pacino. I just could not imagine someone else drawing Tony Montana, and in all probability, the film will not be as effective without it! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer light, as a member of Tony Manny. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia well as boss Tony Lopez. Since F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role. <br /> <br /> Then there's some eye candy in the form of Elvira, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. It looks nice and appropriate in her role. <br /> <br /> The director does not go a bit overboard during a certain part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would just say that it was only a small part that suffers due to improper handling. <br /> <br /> «Scarface», is certainly one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster films ever to come out. Enjoy it for what it is: the raw image and the drug lords of the underworld!
