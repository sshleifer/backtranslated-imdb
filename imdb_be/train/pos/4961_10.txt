Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are mismatched couples, who sit in the car and go on the execution of the assignment in accordance with the needs of this or that. Morgan Freeman great man belonging to another, and all while Paz Vega is sharp as a cashier for "10 Items or less" line to check out, intimidating customers and bored out of his mind. Together they explore, discover and learn from each other. To do this, of course, they should be vulnerable, interested in change, and a sense of humor, all of which they both have. I want this film to be realistic, I want this kind of history happened often, I wish we did not have to go to the movies, to see what we can really connect with each other, even if we are from completely different backgrounds. message of the film is based on the open heart, and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world, where we meet each other there - in a world where peace can be possible.
