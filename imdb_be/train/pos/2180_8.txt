Louise Brooks gives a great performance in this well-made French melodrama. It plays a typist named Lucien, who, despite being in love with a man named Andre, dreams to rise above their station in life. She sees an opportunity in a beauty contest for Miss Europe, but Andre is furious when he discovers that she entered, then he demands that she leave. She tries to get her back post only to discover that she was chosen as Miss France and will now go to the main pageant. <br /> <br /> This is a story about love, loss and the decision is enacted in its hot end. The film is very energetic director filmed in August Genin and cinema tographers Rudolph Mat√© and Louis Nee. shooting style is more like contemporary films than Hollywood movies 30s, and shows a different style used by Europeans. There are many quick cuts and road frames, mostly made with great skill and inspiration. The high energy of the first third of the film is depleted slightly in the middle, but picks up again in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> performance was very good for all the principles, but particularly memorable Louise Brooks Louise leans heavily on her silent screen skills, even if the radio station, but because of its style of silence was surprisingly modern, understated feeling it makes the transition to talkies very well. Long early stage at the fair was particularly acute as Louise used her wonderfully expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of suffering and alienation, of being trapped in a life she no longer wants. I doubt that it's ever been done better. <br /> <br /> The film builds a beautiful final, artfully shot, powerful and stylish. This is truly one of the best things in the early days of film. And the tragic story underlines the great tragedy that this is the final main role of Louise Brooks. She was not only a beautiful woman, who looked fantastic in a bathing suit, it really was a major acting talent, which basically threw it all. We are all poorer than this. <br /> <br /> This film is less well known than its German films with G.W. Pabst, but I think it's better. I think this team is just better speaking, than Pabst, and while the Prix de bot could not profound moral complexity Pabst film, it's much easier to stick and generally more streamlined, focused piece of work. And it does not hurt that the singing of the Louise made Edith Piaf, either. <br /> <br /> As a result, this is a classic Louise Brooks film should look.
