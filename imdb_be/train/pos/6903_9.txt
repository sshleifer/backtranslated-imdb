This little underrated movie is one of my favorites. I can watch it again and again. Dreyfus and Bardot are the workshops, but Raul Julia dwarfs! Tongue in cheek, humorous threatening Gomez Addams, with the right tone for this irreverent parody of the often told story. <br /> <br /> In general untrumpeted and undervalued, Moon Over Parador allows you to check with reality and join in the fun happening on the screen. Two thumbs up!
