It is a film that piles interesting to see Keanu and Alex make a great on-screen commands reprising their characters of "Bill and Ted's excellent adventure" with more "style", they were in the first film. it's not rocket science, but it's great for a laugh, the characters are very like the future-state and the storyline is so radical, you have to laugh. Do not wait for "deep and- meaningfulls Â»just waiting for a clean master enne!
