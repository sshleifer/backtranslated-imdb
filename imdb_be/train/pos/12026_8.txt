I must say that this was the work of a TV movie that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart. We are so accustomed now, seeing her in the sitcom, and I very much hope that the channel will show the TV movie again quickly, as it will show the fan of Sabrina, MJH that shines in a drama. Seen as we watched it on Sabrina is now 5 years so as to give the audience a taste of her a lot of untapped talent will be a plus. Melissa plays a role as well in the wishing her parents "finished" with so that she can be with the guy she loves. One thing that all the spectators Sabrina notice Melissa works with David Lasher this, long before he took on the role of Josh on Sabrina. So it would be kind of neat to see it now, when it gets aired again. Hopes, MJH gets some good roles in the movie, or even a larger number of television films, kind of like Kellie Martin, who always covered in the television movies. A lot of untapped talent waiting to break out when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, you always shine Melissa !!!
