Ooverall, the film was pretty good, good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes, but Chuck Norris did almost nothing for disarming bombs, and shoot with the exception of a few characters. The film was very similar to the events of 11 September, bin Laden as a terrorist video sent to the president (Urich) and threatened to blow it up. Jadson Mills some fine action role, taking the connection Rashid and different roles, kick example, but there was a lack of Chuck Norris. Jadson took over most of the action, leaving Joshua (chuck) with Que on your computer. But, overall, it's real and not enough action, but did so only on the part of Mr. Norris. I gave the film 7/10.
