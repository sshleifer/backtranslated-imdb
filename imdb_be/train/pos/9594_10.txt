While many, unfortunately, have passed on, ballroom scene is still very much alive and carrying on their legacy. Some of them are still very much alive and well, the Octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja is very accomplished and gives great support of the gay community as a whole, Pepper Labeyzha just passed in the last year of natural causes, can it rest in peace. After the transition AnJi Carmen Xtravaganza became a mother at home (it was on the beach scene), and it looks more and more beautiful as well. Some balls have a category dedicated to those who have passed, maybe they all rest in peace. There is currently one project started known as "How do I look?", You can check out the website at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
