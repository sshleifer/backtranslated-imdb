For movies that are ostensibly about sex and skin, he has no right to be, oddly sweet as she is. History of Bettie Page, a good Christian girl from the South who is the mother would not let her date until she married, who moved to New York and eventually became the most successful pin apom of her age, are driven by the excellent performance of the Gretchen Moll. Her page can not quite agree on the pictures that it takes (no one has the right to touch, it's all fun and respectful) with the test pornography and the alleged harmful effects that its images have on the world around her. <br /> <br /> The page has been an inspiration to each of burlesque, as, not only because she had a figure to die, but because she put all the paintings with an innocent sense of humor, which was clearly and simply sexy at the same time. Rather, as this film, actually. Filmde in black and white and glorious technicolor, it's a great way to spend a few hours.
