Imagine the plight of Richard, the artist, whose real passion is flying. When we first met him, he had seen on the top of a building in London to carry it home made wings. He tore his paintings and other works at the height of his despair, designs flying device for his jump. If it gets to the Security Police cunning, he does not suffer a scratch, but it lands him in front of a judge, who ordered him to do community service. Richard, whose relationship with Anne, apparently, ended badly, decides to move to the countryside, where it finds its place in the country with a large barn, he plans to use to build their own aircraft. <br /> <br /> Richard ends up trying to help Jane Harchard reluctantly. She is a young woman suffering from A.L.S., or Lou Gehrig's disease, and is limited to a motorized wheelchair. Jane is very clever, but it has a dark side and salty vocabulary. She uses hand tools to talk sometimes, as her speech is not clear. Jane likes to do it, to lose his virginity at all costs. Jane and Richard clash as they meet, but mutual tolerance will soon make them comfortable with each other. <br /> <br /> Jane, who watches porn on your computer, there is a concept for a stay someone like Richard Gere in "American Gigolo," which, for a fee, to have sex with her. When Richard takes her to London, they found the right man for the job. His fee beyond, but they agree. Since they have no money, Richard decides to rob a major bank. Unfortunately, things do not go according to plan, when Jane realizes that she can not go through what she wanted. In the end, Richard takes Jane to ride his roughly built aircraft for the thrill of her life, what brings them closer, they find similarities with each other. <br /> <br /> Peter Greengrass directed this brisk film, which is an unusual situation. Jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in conventional films, and yet she has such a sweet aura about her, it's hard not to feel for her and that she is trying to achieve. Mr. Greengrass shows affinity Richar Hawkins material he wrote for the film. The film does not try to be cute or give a rosy picture of a young woman suffering from an incurable disease. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter is the main reason for watching a movie. It makes an excellent Jane. On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh, it seems not too well suited for this type of comedy. Any way, it has its problems in how it interprets Richard. Gemma Jones has some good moments as Anne, the former love Richard. <br /> <br /> "Theory of Flight" shows a good director. Without a doubt, Peter Greengrass will go on to bigger and better things.
