This is not the same as the other films about dance. Several normal people were from dancing. The difference is not beautiful or young people from the hot dance films in Hollywood, the characters in this film. They have someone that you can see every day in your office. They are somewhat depressed about his life and finally find themselves and their dreams of dancing. I was very hurt.
