Of the Pokemon movie (which, in order better to at least for me): Pokemon first movie, Pokemon 4ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon and 200 Pokemon: Entei and the unknown, this is probably the most related to the environment, perhaps the most beautiful and the most soothing one. Whether it is a good point for you or not, «Pokemon 4Ever," still entertained a lot. <br /> <br /> As topped with three points, this Pokémon film includes a good mood and a good CGI ( as well as the anime). Travel time is the movie theme is presented in a good way, and Team Rocket (comic reliefs / Baddies trash) end up with a pretty good joke and end up with more protagonists than allies. <br /> <br /> disadvantages is, as always, and unnecessary violence and action, and the villain is quite uninteresting, even more than a few baddies Pokemon movie. <br /> <br /> A strange Pokemon Pokemon tracked down the hunters in the woods. A young boy tries to save the Pokémon and take him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> At the same time, Ash, Brock and Misty entering a large forest ... <br /> <br /> I wonder? See the rest ... <br /> <br /> It is good for all Pokémon fans and the "American" supporters of the anime movie, enjoy "the Pokemon 4ever" ! :-)
