This film is brilliant in every way. It affects the complexity of meaningful love relationship, but never lectured. The script never condescends to any nature, or even the unfortunate Johnny. In addition, and benefits from the spot trends, design production, liti and speaking. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the film, and more in contrast to the «Cher», than it ever is a miracle for me. I look mad, at least once a year, and I just saw it again on Christmas Eve with my 16-year-old twin daughters, and they loved it. This is something for everyone with heart and leaves you full of joy in the end.
