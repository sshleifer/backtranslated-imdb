Here is a film that really funny every time it covers. How can it not be, given that the film stars South Park creators and director David Zucker? When I first saw this movie, I did'nt knew immediately that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey, but their talent in action and the letter came as a very big. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were actually Matt and Trey, later. Humor sometimes rough, sometimes foul, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes loudly and sometimes silly, but overall, this is one hell of a film that, no doubt, under-rated. Well actually, it insane. Completely crazy.
