Well it has done a ghost story that will give you goose bumps and some pretty fair scares along the way. The story unfolds slowly, building the atmosphere all the way up until you are ready to see a woman in black. You will not forget it as soon as you saw it. A lot of gore, no knives, no hockey mask - a well constructed plot, which is best seen at night with the lights off.
