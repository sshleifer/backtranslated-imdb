I knew, but I never saw Gray Gardens before I saw the Broadway musical of the same name. Friends warned me that if I had not seen the film, the musical will not make sense. He did, but it also forced me to make a film. At first I thought it was a train wreck, full of amazing screaming character, and it was extremely difficult to watch. But being able to stop it, digest it, and come back to it made me realize why Gray Gardens documentary considered memorable. <br /> <br /> And Big Eddy and Little Edie unforgettable and a complete lack of self-awareness to be evidence. Both of them are beautiful, despite their inevitable crowd age. They have a relationship that will cool any woman (and, no doubt, some man) and make you reinstall examine your own relationship with your mother. In an age where reality television and film is commonplace, it is interesting to see the work that Mayleses' three decades ago, and to understand what impact the film had to have. <br /> <br /> I echo what other posters have said, they were to slip into such wretchedness and his family? But, in addition, as if two people live in the 1970's in a position to escape from reality in such a complete fashion? Or they just felt too crazy to help? I highly recommend watching it with a commentary track that gave me additional insight into the film.
