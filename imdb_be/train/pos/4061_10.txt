This is the best dubbing I've ever heard of Disney, as well as the best adaptation, as the biggest ever abuse on the soundtrack, the theme, the characters, the dialogues in Kiki's delivery service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This one has a different atmosphere, especially deviation from the general character. This one has both the hero and heroine (though I do not support the use of the hero and heroine here, as Miyazaki from stereotype and a common theme). As usual, once introduced exported surprised Mononoke, bothered Grave of the Fireflies, and very touched Mayo Sun Takkyuubin, this one start with a bit of doubt in my part. I wonder if this will be the first in a hopeless Ghibi. Well, in the end, the same as yesterday and Whisper Of The Heart, I ended up giving 10 rating. I would give 9.8 rating, but additional 0.2 means to divide a good feeling, encouraging people to see the film. <br /> <br /> SPOILER-I see it as a boring film, people are dying in this lonely robot, deserted place, and ends with the destruction. It is as if humanity really can not live with too much power. Crumbling scene gave me a patch Metropolis end. It's just boring somehow. The plot is found in most of the reviews and the soundtrack of the rules, and (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber.People who can bring a movie, a game, an event in his life, even to be saved moments of wonderful compositions. <br /> <br /> This feeling good movie that used to be part of American cinema in the classic days (It's a great life, etc., etc.). Well, things change ....
