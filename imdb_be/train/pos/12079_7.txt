For those who are thinking about Dame May Witty, affectionately, lightly touched by the old lady with Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes, this film requires adjustment. Here, it is anything but gently or touched. Instead, her son, George Macready this crazy one. Just do not give him a knife, otherwise, his eyes light up and no furniture cushions in the house is not safe. Now we know what he has in mind for the captured Nina Foch, if he can just get out of the domineering mother hand. <br /> <br /> Really tight film a woman-in-danger, which keeps the intrigue at the highest level within. The script never deviates from the Foch dilemma. She is a prisoner in a large old Gothic house on the edge of the sea malicious. They're going to kill her, but why. Her plight has no meaning. Tension mounts as she tries to escape one trick after another, but even strangers seem to be against it. We begin to feel her helplessness and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from her. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph H. Lewis made a big step towards a cult with this film and it is clear. Then, too, look Foch work subtly through the gamut of emotions, not just passing from the top. Witty too shines like a really scary matriarch, who knows what she wants and how to get it, if she could just keep her Wacko son in line. a culmination of my order, which seems to be too far-fetched, given the timing of the events. Nevertheless, it is good, hassle way to spend a little more than an hour, courtesy of Columbia studio.
