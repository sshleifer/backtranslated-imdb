Why on earth, you have to explore the fascinating nature of the documentary "Earth"? How much time you have on earth, so that I can tell you this? Well, I'm not extended my research review on "Earth" to infinity, but I have to stand your ground on why this "must see". The documentary takes on the character of the world tour on the migration routes of three animal families: a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life story of his parents are hesitating to hunt for food in their isolated way and the whale mother with her shorthead taking kituyu tour migration to production, and mother elephant with her small (maybe not so small that they are elephants) progeny migrating to Africa. Directed by Alastair Forthegill and Mark Linfield made "with the land" work also capturing the skills of survival of many other species of animals, in addition to the magnetic images of our three heroes animal family. Cinematic skilled team of Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer Animales was in the camera shooting the amazing natural sites and instinctive behavior of animals; not to mention that the SLO-mo shots prey animal was n g e l i e a p a b l e "Earth" also learns a lesson on global warming effects on animals.; daddy polar bear in the document is the poster boy of the animal in this investigation. So fellow humans, it is time to take a documentary journey to visit the "Earth" today! **** Good
