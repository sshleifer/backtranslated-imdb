If only all animation was it great. This film is a classic, as a strong two simple aspects of the history and character. The characters in this film perfectly embodied. I felt for all the characters, and the human-animal relationship in the film works fine. Beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation does not work better than any other film. This is a great film for children and for adults who want to tour the classic hero. 8 of 10.
