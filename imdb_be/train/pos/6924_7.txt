This complex west was a milestone in the career of James Stewart after his return from military service, wanting to change the image, making the western, which is largely seen as the cause of westerns inflows in the 50 years since it's very impressive. It is a pity that there was not filmed in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stewart won the first prize for "the gun that won the West", but then had to spend the rest of the movie trying to restore it if it is stolen. SHELLEY WINTERS shady Goals unsavory reputation and Stephen McNally is the local bad boy shoots at Dodge City. Will Geer is Wyatt Earp and DAN Duryea bad friend Shelley. And you do not know what is the future Universal-International film, Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson (both completely unknown at the time) have the role of bits. <br /> <br /> interesting sequence shows the first Indian attack, causing Charles Drake detects a coward who leaves, leaving one in Shelley horse harness. Later, he redeems himself, but it is only one of the twists and turns that has a gun, which passes from one side to the other ugly - but finally end up with the rightful owner <br /> <br /> Stephen McNally and James Stewart . absolutely final shootout that nearly as melodramatic (but not quite) as DUEL in brilliant sun guns finals. McNally makes a perfect villain and DAN Duryea equally treacherous in a criminal role it played during the 40s, as a low-life Gunslinger. <br /> <br /> A tightly constructed story is very well directed by Anthony Mann, and it is interesting to see Rock Hudson (credited as bull) wearing Indian war paint and Tony Curtis as a young soldier who throws excitement eyes feelings on the slim and attractive shelley Winters. <br /> <br /> Well worth viewing and defined above the middle of history.
