I remember that when I was seven or eight. I must have found all the characters, because they left no trace in my mind, which lasted for a long time after the movie ends. And the end, it is now boring, well ... for a 7-8 year old child. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to see this film again recently, and found that the story was too simple, character-dimensional ... I think that this kind of film that you can only with innocence small child ... it is a pity ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this for all of you, parents with small children ... (I saw it in its original French version, so I can not tell you good translation or not.)
