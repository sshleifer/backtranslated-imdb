Chalk this one in the win column, it was a great movie. Acting performances were great, and the script was just great. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was gorgeous, like a police officer Riverside Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. She was a rookie police officer with the Riverside Police Dept. it ended in an affair with a colleague, she knew, had a wife and children, all the time she took on the dangerous task undercover to catch a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Fahey (Ray Liotta alike) did knock off work in the intricate, often stuttering, the police officer who had an affair with Gina. He was stoic, as an officer, but he was quite the opposite when it came to the decision of his feelings and his extramarital affair. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber, primarily because of the comedy "Wings" did a good job as a quiet, gentle, losers sociopath. On the surface, it was an innocent lost, but beneath the surface lie the cold heart of a killer. Weber really took the person child young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill the young boy. <br /> <br /> The entire film was impressive. Every scene, every verbal exchange, let us know more about the characters. The film crew has done a phenomenal job with the condensing days, if not weeks following events in the 90 minutes of the film. This film was a good example of doing a lot with a little.
