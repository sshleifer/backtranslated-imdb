Jim McKay made one of the best movies that you will see all the year.The quiet simplicity of this film draws you in with the first shot and never lets go.There not one false note in the whole film.Not one.Everything works. manual camera never distracted and is always where it should be.The three young will, whose lives we go always real.There not one bit where the audience mentioned we look at role.These performances actress is just trying to find a real girl themselves.There entirely political agenda, hidden or otherwise.This this movie at its core, and although it is likely to be considered only a handful of moviegoers, it deserves much more release.A special helmet to Hugh Hefner to provide filmmakers from grant the funds needed to floor rymats this important film made.I can not wait to see what makes Mr. McKay nearby.
