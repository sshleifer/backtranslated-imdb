This movie was hysterical. I have not laughed this hard in a long time. I mean, it was not he, "Good Will Hunting", but was supposed to be? I actually went to an advanced screening, which is waiting for a lot less and was pleasantly surprised. Comedy swipes and fairly constant. Amanda Peet hot and amazing. The entire audience, I sifted it, seemed to enjoy the film as much as I did.
