This film is banned in just about every foreign country I can think of. The Japanese people (?), Which stars in this, apparently, was really desperate for a job, or we're just friends. Here's the scoop: <br /> <br /> Three thugs torment hell with helpless women, they use all sorts of things that eventually kill her, they burn it, push it back in his chair around here (more than 200 times! ), they use the sound of torture (forcing her to listen to the sound of static for more than 20 hours! it does not sound that bad, but it can make you go crazy). They throw intestine (probably from animal) on her while Shes embossed, and she freaks out when she wakes up. And who can forget the grand final of the largest eyeballs TORTURE I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> If you have not heard about these movies and watch one, not knowing that it is an imitation of Snuff, you will think it is! (Ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to freak people and make some patients! As I have already said, a purely underground. Check it out if you are a fan of underground horror or foreign gusset. If you do not, I strongly recommend you read up on the series before watching! With the gore, shock, and the creative aspect of it gets 10, and from the storyline and all that stuff is 1. Underground classic ... <br /> <br /> My final rating is 8/10 <br / > <br />
