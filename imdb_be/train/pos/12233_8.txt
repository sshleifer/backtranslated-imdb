Astronaut Steve West (Alex reinforcement) and his comrades hold space flight, which sees them fly through Saturn's ring. His comrades are killed instantly, but it would seem that in fact they are the lucky ones. Steve returns to Earth is constantly oozing mass of human-cellulose; as it is transformed into a wild killer melting each step on the way it is monitored by his friend, Dr. Ted Nelson (Berry Debenning) <br /> <br /> This is often so deafening funny. - with a rather ridiculous lines and situations, to go around - it's hard for me to believe that laughter all unintentional. It seems to me that some sucker on a low-budget genre effort from the 50s and 60s, and as such, it's surprisingly entertaining film. Such a sequence with a nurse's ridiculous. We are even treated to a split-screen sequence that does not really add anything, but still see gas <br /> <br /> The writer / director William Sachs credit came with this brilliant idea. its ultra-slimy character memorable one for sure. I think it's not a little marching; some scenes (for example, one of an elderly couple) go a little long, but ultimately it delivers tight, schlocky, B-film products with a degree of panache. The culmination is especially fun. <br /> <br /> Music ARLON Obers' is a nice shuddery (but also entertaining stupid at some point), and cinematography Willie Curtis makes some really great shots at times. This leads me to Rick bakers fantastic makeup and convincing effect, which form very respectable central to the film, until the final end of the melt. <br /> <br /> Rebar under heavy makeup almost the entire movie (Sachs also received my praise for the fact that the film hit the ground running) and does what it should do quite well. DeBenning makes quite awkward and silly character, and Anne Sweeney is not so hot, either, as his wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Lyle Wilson Alldrezh and good support. In addition, it is worth it to see people like Sheryl «Rainbeaux» Smith (makes a noticeable topless shot), Janus Blythe (with Tobe Hooper Eaten Alive "and Craven Hills Have Eyes"), and even the director Jonathan Demme in a bit part. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting film with enough north of dried blood, chills and laughs to evaluate it, how to catch for lovers of low-grade sci-fi / horror throughout the world. <br /> <br /> 8/10
