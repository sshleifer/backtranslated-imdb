I saw this movie with my friend and we could not stop laughing! I mean, there was nothing wrong with this movie! It was interesting, all the lines are said Freddy was fun! I think they even made shoudln't new nightmare and just went to Freddy Vs. Jason. Although some parts were rough (for example, the head of undermining). and any Elm Street movie with 1- 5 sucks. it was the best, except for number 1. I Wouldnt recommend this movie if you want a good horror. But if you do not have anything to make the rent it, and you'll laugh alot.I want to see The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I think it would be terrible. Dead The Final Nightmare Freddy Overall: B-
