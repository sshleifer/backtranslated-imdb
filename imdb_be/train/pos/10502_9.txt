Mario is one of the fascinating I have ever played. levels are creative, have a liquid controls and good graphics for its time. There are also a lot of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels get frustrated, and if you leave some of the hard levels, and still need to get more experience to fight with the boss, it can be annoying. Another complaint angle; although it works pretty well most of the time, it can be a pain in certain situations. if your a big fan of Mario time; this ones for you. even if you're not a big fan of it, I would still recommend this. it is a great game, and get what you need may take some time, but it's very nice. good for the game in short bursts of time. he almost certainly will keep your interest; it sure does keep my!
