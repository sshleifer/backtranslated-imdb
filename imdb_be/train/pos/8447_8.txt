In all truth, this is actually not a "film" as the final episode of the long-term; By this I mean that if you do not move the TV series (Homicide: Life on the Street), I suspect that you would have a hard time then made for television movie. Having said that, "Homicide: The MovieÂ» is still a great watch. I think it says a lot about television production that will return every member of the cast, and many, after several years of absence, again portray his character and bring closure incredible program. The film reveals that a sense of "family", and not only among the characters, but among the actors as well. It's all very bittersweet, knowing that this will be the last time we'll see them all together again under the name of homicide. History-wise, I found this film is somewhat lacking. Candidate for the post of mayor Giardello seems especially far-fetched, and I felt that it was shooting could be considered as part of its normal position parameters as Leiutenant. In addition, Det. extreme plot twist Bailey that hung at the end was finally resolved, but for example, I never felt that it should have been; I loved to stay a secret (we recall that the first time the very first episode also left unresolved for the entire series run!). As an ardent fan of the series, I love this movie, and the fact that it even got made after H: LOTS was canceled, but I would not recommend it for those who do not have the slightest impact series. Now if they would just release it on DVD ...
