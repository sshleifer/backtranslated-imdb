Very Minor Spoiler <br /> <br /> This film (even though only on TV) is absolutely wonderful. I really was not `pay attention to the differences of opinion or emphasis, so I can not really comment. Acting in it was so good that I had to pinch myself and say. "Remember, it`s just a movie, it's not bylo` reality is" As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn talk, I knew that this was that John and Paul would say, if they actually had this meeting. in impromptu comments and burns from John were right with his character (especially in the restaurant!), as well as his depression while Paul was very easy going and laid back. Both actors have done and excellent job, and I was thrilled that they had seen this film. It`s an immoral experience for any fan of the Beatles. And get ready for surprises!
