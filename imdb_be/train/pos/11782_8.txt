I do not know if it contains any spoilers or not, but I do not want to risk not blacklisted until the year 3462. <br /> <br /> I do not agree completely with the comments viewer described * Guns, Germs and Steel * as a "politically correct" and "neo-Marxist". They may not look the same series that * I * did. <br /> <br /> The series * I * looked drawn history of European colonization in America and South Africa, without any discrepancies. I have not seen in the series, which reflected a European, as poor people who happened to be happy, even though Europeans often * were lucky - and there is nothing bad luck. Nor have I seen the indigenous peoples are portrayed as poor little innocent things. In any case, the Inca was quite arrogant - as would be expected of any leader would when dealing with foreigners, if his country was not conquered in the living memory of any other world power. <br /> <br /> Of course, I did not see anything that could be construed as a Marxist or neo-Marxist, except for the incredibly elastic fantasies. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African peoples * in * a built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that the Europeans do not have. At that time they were at the peak of its success, the civilization of the Aztecs, Mayas and Incas * were * as advanced as any other in the world - and the rich; sometimes more. Aborigines and American populations Ha-san * * were killed by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans; just as European colonists were decimated by tropical diseases such as malaria. (Note:. Ha-San peoples are quite different from all the other peoples of Africa south of the Sahara) <br /> <br /> So I do not see some of the other commentators complain. The only thing that * I * can find to complain about is that the series does not tell me anything, I do not know, by the time I finished the sixth grade. There really is not anything new in the way of historical information in this film. It is, however, present some interesting dramatisations of events, such as the conquest of the Incas; production values ​​are very high; and it fills a few holes here and there, are not reimbursed in the sixth hour of the social studies class, Mrs. Gruber in Milan high school. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy, if you have a decent primary and / or secondary education, there will be nothing new to learn, but you will have an enjoyable and entertaining time considering what you have already learned (or should have learn) by the time you get into high school.
