There are so many things to fall on Aro Tolbukhin. En la Mente del Asesino (inner mind killer), it is very difficult to talk about it, without giving any warning. Let's just say that this film as an exercise in the movie, but really, really cool to do. Winked made with super 8, black and white photos, 35 mm, color, interviews, retrospective. Aro Tolbukhin winked like a film made documentaries, or vice versa, the most unobvious relay doubts that leaves you wondering if he had ever really existed? The film is worth a late life in the Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, worked in a religious mission, and killed several people. The action for which he was caught and punished with the death penalty. The film begins because some French documentary makers interested in this character, so they interview him before his death. At the present time, few people were involved and to make a more profound study of nature. One witness we -The film. <br /> <br /> For the main part in history, we are guided by the slow phase of the floor to go look inside Aro's species, mainly in order to decipher why he did what he did. Nevertheless, it is important that the filmmakers did not give us a one-sided point of view; they left the judging for all of us, and even how we understand his actions, we clearly do not justify them. Thus, the first half is based on the recalled information; later things turn into childhood Aro, giving the film a incredible new strength (not hard and not get weak or sad) <br /> <br /> I do not mean and does not want- to spoil anything. so the only thing left to say is that if you get a chance this film next to you, believe me, the trip to see it more than worthy.
