A matter of life and death, what can you really say that will properly pay tribute to the genius and beauty of this film. Powell and Pressberzher visual imagination no boundaries, each frame is filled with a bold fantastic composition. Switches between the bold colors of the "real world" in a severe black-and-white sky brilliant, visually showing us how much more colorful life. The final court also fantastic scene as a judge and jury down the stairs into the sky to hold the trial of Peter (David Niven) 's work. <br /> <br /> All performances on the spot (Roger Livesey is a standout), and the romantic energy of the film is excellent, it has never been more romantic than this film (if I haven 't seen). A matter of life and death are all about the power of love and the importance of life. And cinema Jack Cardiff is a reason enough to watch a movie alone as he covers the face of Kim Hunter makes it all the more beautiful than the genius, he can do simple things, such as playing table tennis look irresistible. And the sound design and impeccable; as the sound drowns in the vital points decision was far ahead of its time <br /> <br /> This is a true classic that can restore one's faith in the movie, under appreciated in its original form, and by today's audience, but one of my favorites, so I give this film 10/10, in one word - beautiful.
