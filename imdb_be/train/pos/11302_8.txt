Oh, these cowardly Italians. This is not the first time when they are based on the original film material without the permission or knowledge of, in this case, the author of the novel. Of course, this is not something that, as a rule, Italian, but was done quite a lot in the early days of cinema, mainly because they often thought they could get away with it. Publishers James M. Cain failed not to delay the film from American screens until 1976, but, nevertheless, the film itself was a bit up in the well-known classic. <br /> <br /> The film is not so great to watch as the 1946 American version, but it's a great film nonetheless. This, of course, not least due to the movie, it's great powerful story that is intriguing and provides the film with some great characters and realism. It follows the novel fairly closely, and so basically the same as the other versions of the film in its history, to know the difference that he was installed in the Italian media. <br /> <br /> Leave it to the Italians to make a film about the life and real people in it. These early dramas always have a very realistic feel of him and, therefore, also very involving to watch. Unfortunately, the film lost some of its strength to the end, when the film started to feel a bit long and dragging in parts. The film could easily have ended 15 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> However, I'm really not much else negative to say about this film. It's just really made one based on some as big and strong original material. Quite an impressive directorial debut with Luchino Visconti, who went on to direct many more are some great and memorable Italian dramatic films. <br /> <br /> 8/10
