The film is gripping, audacious and music is very good.The film Moonwalker had to coincide with the album Bad (1987) .I have Bad.It excellent (*****). The film begins with Michael Jackson performs "People in the Mirror" on stage.then, he tells the story of Michael, from his early days in the Jackson 5 until Bad era. Oh, and also good Badder (Badder is a parody music video clip for the single Bad) .It shows that this song Speed ​​Demon video.The and the video is very, very good indeed.Same to leave me alone, that is after. Then he shows the film Moonwalker.after a few minutes, he plays a smooth criminal in a club called club 30s.like him when he makes lean.anyway, nice to see you.bye goodbye.
