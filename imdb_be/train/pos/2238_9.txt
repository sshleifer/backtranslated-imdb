As the film entirely in Swiss dialect, it's probably hard for most of the German language in order to accurately follow the film. I'm not from Switzerland, but I've worked there for several years, so I was able to understand this is the greatest deception of Lord of the Rings. I saw a lot of this kind of films (eg, Scary Movie, loads SCIFI parody, etc.), but this is the best one of its kind I've seen so far. I give 9 10. The only reason I can not give you 10 there, because there are some small details that could have been done better, and because they do not come without subtitles in any language, on DVD, so there's almost no chance nya-Swiss figure.
