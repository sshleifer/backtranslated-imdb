It is of the greatest comedy films of early summit. This is not a parody enter the dragon, the protagonist (summit) will get Bruce Lee and takes over its awfully good for a man his size. Nominal story about how his battle keeps calling his family problems - then fighting. About fighting. Good, fast-paced scenes with high levels of exposure (white guy who plays a boxer looks as if he really suffers from one of the bumps in the summit). <br /> <br /> comical bit of this film was purely unintentional. There seems guy Jim Kelly (one of the three experts hired to take out the summit), but he was a Chinese guy in a black man with an afro-wig. Well, not in them any real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I guess I've seen enough white fake like-hell "Chinese people" in old American movies, too. <br /> <br /> This one is for any fan of the summit or Bruce Lee.
