A few years ago, a friend received from one of his other friends videos from Michael Mann's film «Heat» on it. After we finished the film, and were going to get up, we saw that there is another film only after firmly on the envelope in the drawer owner did not write it. . Nevertheless, we were all glued back into place in accordance with its opening clear, which lacked loans <br /> <br /> About two hours later, I was just sitting there wondering how I had not heard of this masterpiece to ..? . <br /> <br /> This film was Europa. Lars von Trier noir woke from the dead, the deconstruction of reality with deliberately sets clear, but there is often a compulsive resemblance to the post-war German photographs that I have seen. And then the clever cuts! <br /> <br /> The story itself is hard to take a moral odyssey, which does not have a happy ending. A young American pacifist German origin comes to post-war Germany, intending to do good to pay his countrymen dropped out for bombs. But he is mainly responsible distrust and suicidal defiance. He hires of Zentropa, in the dining room and a double car companies (on the model of Metropolitan), the owner of which is the one of the Nazi collaborators whitewash occupiers. Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf, postwar Nazi terrorists. If he does not understand the world (or just Europeans) more, it explodes railway bridge under a train in his rage, he just saved <br /> <br /> As a final note, historical correctness :. In the real world, werewolf anywhere else was not so important, as the film, they were basically the end of the Nazi propaganda coup. After SS units murdered major ally occupied Aaha, two months before the surrender, the Nazis announced a whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who are willing to fight for the front line, a werewolf. But only a few hundred mostly Hitler received some training, and while two or three times, some of them have been deployed to kill communists suspected or forced-Workers foreigners in the Bavarian village imprint lasting fear in people, with Hitler's death and the end of the war it all fell apart. <br /> <br /> However, the propaganda Werewolf had a profound impact on the occupiers. They feared werewolf around the world suspected him of a serious accident - but without the exclusion of other causes was found later (overlooked by some of the recent pseudo-historians). For example, if a gas pipeline exploded in the police headquarters bombed Bremen, or when Soviet military commander was killed in a motorcycle accident in Berlin. The effect was strongest in the Soviets, who arrested tens of thousands (a large part of the children!) "Preventive" on suspicion of the werewolf, and locked them in the camps, where many died.
