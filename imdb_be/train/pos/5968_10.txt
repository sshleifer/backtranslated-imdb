If you come across a gem of a film like this, you understand why the 80 were the greatest decade of life to the end. Rock music ruled, and in the same movies ... especially horror movies. The filmmakers knew how to entertain us, and "Trick or Treat" is obvious for this. If the rocker Tech Summit, which will most likely written after W.A.S.P. Singer Blackie Lawless dies during a hotel fire, his # 1 fan Eddie confused. He goes to one and a local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives him a copy of the most recent recording, which has made the Summit; this is the only copy available. He was given a radio station to play live Halloween night. If Eddie plays, he somehow returns Sammy. It helps Eddie with bullies at school, but then goes out of control. This is definitely one great movie. The bad news is that this film is out of print. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get it on eBay. You should also ... $$ well spent!
