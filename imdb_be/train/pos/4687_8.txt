Criminal love Lizzie Borden is an important film dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (and including frontal female nudity, which sure beats the masculine). He flirts with sadomasochism and fall in love with a prisoner Captor theory. <br /> <br /> This treatment of female libido sometimes shallow and ragged, but Borden traveled far beyond the feminist dogma women are gaining momentum through their insatiable lust. <br /> <br /> One of the most illustrative scenes reveals female fetish for horses, where the antagonist, fake fashion photographer seduces an older woman wearing pants, asking her to show how she rides a horse. He puts the rod between her legs, pressing it to his crotch, and it significantly increases her excitement. <br /> <br /> And then he leaves her house, and she swears humbly on the door is closed. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bergin plays a crook, and although it falls a great distance from the beautiful, he takes on a simple Janes and has enough presence on the screen to make one believe that women can swallow his line. By all accounts, Sean Young demonstrates an amazing person, and it is hardly beautiful. However, in this film, as the District Attorney of her face intense and long slender body and limbs accentuated hips and occasionally unintelligible alchemize movement in erotic delight. Its performance is strong and complex. <br /> <br /> Borden has intriguing attitude, and the fact that he is so at odds with the modern Zeitgeist helpless I really appreciate.
