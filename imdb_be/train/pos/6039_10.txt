I was lucky enough to be an extra in this great movie and loved every minute of the picture. I went to the premiere in London and had a great chat with Phil, Peter, Martin and John, how did my wife.Fantastic after the game, too. Then a few weeks later was a trip to the cinema with the members of our bike club. Which is a brilliant film, it deserves to be there with all the big biker movies. We now have a DVD Sue, my wife can not get enough and can not have children. Get a bit of stick from the club, which seems to think that I'm a movie star now oh well, you can only dream of. I think they are just jealous. The only drawback of the first part of filming was the weather, rain, rain and more rain, but hey we were in Wales. I hope that will follow so keep me in the loop, John. Danny Beck
