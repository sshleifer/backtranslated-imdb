Maybe I liked this movie so much, partly because I was feeling down in the dumps, and it's such a wonderful little fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was the perfect move. Big, clever storyline, beautiful effects, good acting (especially De Niro, which is awesome). This film made me happier than I have been for some time. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny and intelligent film. Joke history of the kingdom of Prince savagery and after, like indulging in witch and dozens of magical effects reasonable little touches all kept me happy. It's a big part of what makes it so good; it is complex, special effects-laden film with a lot of history than most fabulous films, but there is incredible attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I feel like I just go ahead and watch it again and again.
