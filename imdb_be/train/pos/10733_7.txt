Watching this film really brought back some great childhood memories. I'm 34 now, still have not seen since I was 12-14. I almost forgot about this movie, but when I watched it again recently, some scenes literally brought tears to my eyes! This little robot "jinx" (Friends Forever!). It was just like reviewing my childhood. It was quite an amazing experience for me. I will always cherish this film for this reason. I hope that some of you readers can relate to my experience, not for the sake of this particular movie, but any film that you have not seen for a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading
