Eric Valette obviously talented director, and so the two guys who wrote the script. Therefore Mal√©fique is a great film, made with just a few dollars, but also tons of submission. Well, I'm exaggerating a bit, but I still sincerely. So, if you like dark, scary movies, go and see this. It's really worth it.
