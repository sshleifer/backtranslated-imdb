While listening to audio books, Cambpell Scott reader. I was so excited to hear his voice, and brought my disappointment that the "Six Degrees" were canceled. They never seem to keep a good show on the air long enough to capture an audience that can connect with the history of the show. What a shame, and shame on the second network for not giving it a chance to show a full season. It was a great show to watch with a large cast. The network gave the "Men in Trees" second chance witch is also a great show, but they took the "Invasion" and by that, too, was something quite different to see, not the same old same old themes. Why the network can not get it right.
