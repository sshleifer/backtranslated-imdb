This film was enjoyable, but for the wrong reasons. Coordination sequence funny and make a film there are some funny moments of buffoonery. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson has memorable scenes together near the end, where Williamson says Ginty, «Are you sure do get around friends boy!". I really enjoyed this film only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the storyline, which should have been written on a napkin in four lines, while the remaining ad-libbed most likely. The film is more than 30 parts is only a list of credit for 10 or so. It seems strange that no one has a credit in the film, maybe they had some idea of ​​how the final product will look like. One thing this movie really has going for it is that it's pretty strong, so three times with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty do for a film worth seeing.
