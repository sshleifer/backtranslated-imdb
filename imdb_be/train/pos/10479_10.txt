This is a movie that was actually recommended to me by my dentist and I am glad that he did! A mixture of British humor (I must say, the humor?) And the reality of a lost middle-aged widow, tries to preserve their way of life was a dial tone. Add to this mix the reality of what it takes to actually increase the pot (those plants, under shrubs Sun was going to do that they have received no TLC), and it's really fun, but touching film. I laugh every time I conjure a vision of all visitors to the bar sitting in their deck chairs with sunglasses on to pay a light! Maybe it's just my Mendocino blood, but the Brits definitely got this one right !! 10/10
