If you are uninitiated in the world of Gundam, is a good place to start. If you are burned on Star Wars or Star Trek, there is a compelling, realistic sci-fi series, you can dive into. Simplified or not the boy-save game-world-in-giant robot stories one might expect, but rather a complex, emotionally compelling space war drama, where the line between "good" and "bad" guys obviously less than different. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 focuses on the history of Al Izuruha, young, naive boy lives in a neutral space colony. He spends his days dreaming of a mobile suit and play war with my friends. During this series of friendly Al "enemy" soldiers, Bernie Wiseman. In the end, little Al learns some hard lessons about the realities of war and the necessary suffering and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I loved this OAV series, with its cool designs ma, including history and nice character. I recommend this series for those who like realistic SF anime, or for those who think that the anime is just nonsense or sexual entertainment.
