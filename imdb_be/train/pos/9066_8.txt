~~ I could see this movie yesterday morning in an early preview pass ~~ <br /> <br /> I am the mother of 2 children, who range from 11 to 6. So I'm sure that many parents can relate to seeing many many 'children' films. It is refreshing to me. I have not read this particular book, so I do not know where he remained true to the book or not. But it sure took a roughness factor in the high level. This is a story about the "new" child in the city, and it just so happens that a group of boys who formed the club varieties and choose love child .... mark? Do not we all suffered from this one or more times. He has a younger brother, he can not stand, and the parents, that he was embarrassed. What I liked most was to see how each character was completely different from the other they stood. Hooligan (why do they always bully red head? My daughter has red hair! And she's not a bully! .. lol) well big bully who considers himself while shouting at his own elder brother. It took turns well and you fall in love with all of them and really find yourself routing for all characters! Even parents, most bond between father and son. All around a nice, sweet, funny, gross, etc ...... Take your kids !!! You will enjoy it as much as they do!
