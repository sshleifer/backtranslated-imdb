The comedy in this film great, there were a few moments to laugh. <br /> <br /> Their first date is the beginning of a rocky when he appeared in her apartment with flowers, and she was sick to her stomach from eating new place earlier in the day. Rather than leave it helps to take care of her, helping her to change into pajamas cleaning the then vomiting on its toilet and bathroom later I told her that she was "very lady like ... NO chunks. Everything is going great between Ben and Lindsay all winter, but then begins baseball season. Lindsay begins to understand how obsessed bin with the Red Sox, and why it seems to be a great guy another. she tries to dismiss it and think of it as a good thing, because it has a busy schedule, and she will not feel guilty for work zvyshuroch on while he is in the games. She even bought all the books on the Red Sox, it can be found, including one on the "Curse of the Bambino». <br /> <br /> Everything is going pretty well until Lindsay has no false signal that missed her period. this makes them both realize how serious they are, and she begins to question if this is the man she wants to be. it is very touching part in the movie after she tells him that she got her period she shows him, unfortunately, removing baby Red Sox jersey he had bought only if it was a woman in labor . <br /> <br /> In the end, Ben is trying to show her how important she decides to go to his friends at birthday party after she said: "I had to check my calender, and when I saw that there It was a game of Red Sox / Yankee I knew he would go deer. after the party, Ben tells her that it was "the best night of his life."
