Contains SPOILER With the possible exception of John Wayne, no other actor was sitting up in the saddle in Westerns than James Stewart, and this film proves it. This is a beautiful story about the places around Winchester rifle has only one weak spot, I can think of: casting Will Geer as much unEarp, like Wyatt Earp. The casting was good villains: Stephen McNally as sullen Dutch Henry, Dan the Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean and John McIntyre (Universal in the game as the good guys and the bad guys), like a spot gun runner. Clashes between Stewart and McNally on the rocks large! I would make up this western westerns crops against all done today. They will not stand a chance!
