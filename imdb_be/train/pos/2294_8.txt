... Hawk Heaven for lovers of French cinema and expansion of the French film actors / actresses. In the worst case, it is an indulgence, the actors get to whine about other actors who doubt the legality of that act as a profession in general, etc. while at best, a great celebration / mocking some of the best actors currently working. From a simple premise - Marelya request for water was ignored in the restaurant - Blier expands in all directions and allows the cream of French cinema to strut their stuff in front of the camera even throw in a bow to those no longer around (Jean Gabin, Ventura), including the father of the director, Bernard, one of the great giants of French cinema, from which he fields a heavenly phone call at the end of the film. Discourse and wordy, so guilty, but also something to gloat.
