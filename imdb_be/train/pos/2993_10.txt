Apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties, Eugene Pallette as the gruff detective cop, Jack La Rue as a "nigger" Italian and, of course, James Lee as "Chinese Cook", this film is great murder mystery in a locked room. For early 1930s film, this step-by-step "peeling veneer secrets" is similar to the Columbo series, except that in this film, you do not have the advantage of knowing in advance who the killer is.
