James Cagney is best known for his tough characters- and gangster roles, but he also plays a lot of "soft" character of his career. This musical is one of them, and this was the first but not the last musical film will be shot in Cagney. <br /> <br /> Cagney even doing a bit of singing in it, and also quite a number of dance. And I must say that it was not bad at it. He plays the role with great confidence. He apparently had some workers dancing at the beginning of his life, before his acting career began to take off big time, so that in fact it is not surprising that he also took some musical acting roles in his career. He obviously also feels comfortable in this completely different genre than most people are used to seeing it. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, who, perhaps, one of the best and most successful director in the genre, his early 30s musicals largely defined musical genre, and he was also responsible for genre films, such as "42nd street." His musicals have always been light and fun to watch, and more comedies like than anything else really. '30s musicals were never really about his singing, it was something more than that featured in the' 40s, and then made musicals, mostly from MGM studios. <br /> <br /> As usual, it is easy and simple story, set in the world of music, which, of course, too predictable and progresses in a formulaic way. This, however is a fun and simple story that just makes it entertaining to watch movies. So that the characters and the actors who draw them. Sort strange though is that the general storyline of the film becomes a sort of abandoned by the end of the film, when the film starts only consists of a number of musical procedures. <br /> <br /> musical moments towards the end of the film as funny and well done, despite the fact that I'm not too big a fan of the genre. Once again, music rooms also feature a young Billy Barty. he often played little boys / baby / mice, and all that at the beginning of his career, including the movie musical "gold-diggers in 1933," one year earlier. <br /> <br /> recommended early film genre. <br /> <br /> 8/10
