The film is an outstanding brilliance and poignant and unusual love story, graphic protection puddle intense attraction between the eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character. <br /> <br /> This gives John Turturro, which is probably his best role to date (thank God they did not give him Ralph Fiennes, who would have killed him.) In addition, Emily Watson displays a wealth of experience (with its outstanding background in the scene). To achieve the exhausted wizard chess (Turturro), its character must reflect the intelligence and love of a woman. Watson entirely reflects the beauty-pageant sexuality, but it leads to a part of self-awareness, which is attractive. <br /> <br /> In a chance encounter Natalia (Watson) and the Puddle, she accidentally stops it from losing a chess piece that fell through a hole in his clothes - a specially created piece that we realize later in the film, became a symbol of hope and hope. Later, with the development of their love, she likens the delicately dancing chess (Puddle learned to dance, but never with a partner); She urges him to lead her to the "bold, brilliant strokes," and at the same time allows him to relax enough to later play at its best (and realize himself as her lover). <br /> <br /> This is the story of a woman who inspires man to his greatest achievement, and this is my own deepest fulfillment, emotionally and intellectually (Or so we are led to believe - of course, within the timeframe, Natalia something liberated woman , and no one takes care of himself to be a stereotypical wife and mother). <br /> <br /> Italian sets are stunning. The complexity of the characters and the skill with which dialogue takes place are a delight intellectual cinema-goer, but the film is affordable enough to make it a popular hit the main and most deservedly. Chess just photogenic background to the development of emotional and emotional film, although the game is considered sufficient in relation to almost convince chess, existing characters. While the tragedy of outstanding heights with the help of a classical author, the final denouement, yet strangely uplifting.
