Although I can understand the bad things, someone has to say about this movie, I still found it to be absolutely amazing. It will deal with you, and if your not a critic to look deeply into the shortcomings and failures of each film, or you just have not touched anything, it's worth a look. Do not come to the cinema, waiting for something, just a box of tissues and an open mind. It is beautiful and is a brilliant action. I think Will Smith, despite the fact that he once played another lonely depressed individual is amazing. I believe that a good actor who can really show the feelings and emotions we all have in our worst / best experience so that it reaches out to you and makes you feel something. And that's exactly what makes this film. Give him a chance.
