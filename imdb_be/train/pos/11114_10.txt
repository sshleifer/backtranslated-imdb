Probably, it is not fair that I have to see the most interesting of all the reviews on The Sopranos and then get to add that people forget, but oh well ....... <br /> <br /> from the point of view of action how could any actor to fail with these characters? Each of these fascinating and intense in their busy lives. Tony Soprano and mob «Capo» and suffers from mental illness, still sees his life in front of him, and knows what needs to be done to survive. Each of its people, you can see his life almost from the inside, as in the present form voyerism. This, of course, produces a kind of "interesting" side of each and every viewer, and I include myself in this! <br /> <br /> While some of the above, do not care about Bracco, I must say that this is a fresh role it has in the years since the good guys. It is a party, Tony, making him listen to reason, which makes it decent that offers him a respite, when dealing with his human emotions that he could not feel so long, if ever. It quite simply, his savior. (Not to mention religious tones) <br /> <br /> But the knockout performance here, without a doubt, Edie Falco. To see her in the role of a prison guard other acclaimed HBO series "Oz" and then to see her, as Libya is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress. She married boundries a famous actress, the actress just like Merlot Strip can get away with. A sort of chameleon qualities that transcend the role. But, as I mentioned earlier, with strong characters like these, how can any actor does not work out? <br /> <br /> The strength of Libya in its daily statement of faith in ourselves. She survived, so she hopes that her husband and the family will live. She is preparing for the worst, because she knows that the danger of the business of her husband, but knows that life has more than most women from Jersey. It makes sense, if not wiser and street savvy then himself Tony. <br /> <br /> In general, the greatest crime of the family Soprano is that we the viewer will have to wait to January 2000, to be seen in the next season. This in my opinion, the worst thing about the show. It was something that brought Larry Sanders Show, Sex and the City, Dream, and other back on the ground in popularity, and eventually killed them. Too much space between the seasons and very sporadically. By the time I'm not going to watch replays with the hope that this gap is filled in programming.
