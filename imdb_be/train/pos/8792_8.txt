Entertaining kung fu film, with acting, plot and fight scenes cut above the average chop socky. All the cast are likeable characters and a skilled martial artists. proto-Jackie Chan comedy antics Schengen Fu are fun to watch, and its companion plans showing particularly impressive skills. For me, the only glaring flaw of the film is the cast size - from time to time, things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between different scene modes, and some of the characters are not fully fleshed out as we would like. <br /> <br /> But kung fu film should be judged primarily on the quality of the action, and the Shaolin defined delivers on this score. The film ends with a high Bodycount battle that allows each character to show off their skills against a worthy opponent. <br /> <br /> In general, the Shaolin Temple is a pleasant low-budget film Kung Fu. Not to good quality Jet Li film, but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre. My rating :. 8-10 <br /> <br /> The various recommendations in 1987 Warner Home Video release, which I saw was (predictably) badly dubbed, was not complete cast and crew credits.
