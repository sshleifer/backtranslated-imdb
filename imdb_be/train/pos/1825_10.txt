I saw this film when I was young, and I remembered how one of the first films I really liked that there was not a militant or a comedy. So, in my later years, I decided to watch it again and see if it's just nostalgia, or there really is something in this film. To my surprise, the film is held every of my expectations. This is a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, good songs (not great, though, and that in fact explains why I do not remember that it was a musical), and all in all a great use of my time. I was surprised because the latest movies from my childhood that I Revisited not even pass my minimum requirements for a decent movie and even this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cry today, just like he made me cry, then maybe it's because my dog ​​died recently, and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that is why the filmmakers to shoot movies (which is money, of course). Yes, there are glitches continuity. Thus, the script has a hole, but it does not matter. The film itself is a fun and clever. So do not be fooled by cynical people who are always looking for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this film gets 10 not because it is made. He gets 10 simply because it made me feel.
