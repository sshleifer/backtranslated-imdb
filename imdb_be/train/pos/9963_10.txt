I saw this movie when I was a little girl. And I enjoyed it every time. Of course, the graphics a bit cheesy, compared to now, but back in the 70's it was great. I saw it in the original Spanish version only and thought it was great. It was, as I remember my Christmases have been with my family - charming. Santa Claus was strange, and I could not wait for him to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / children and speak Spanish, bring them up to watch the old-fashioned version of "Santa Claus" is a different version than we are accustomed to today, but who says that there is one way ? <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. It teaches children the good against the bad. I do not know how the English subtitled version or, if there is one of these English, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and Happy Holidays! Feliz Navidad!
