I do not think the film as it will be released today. He takes the time to introduce the depth of the characters and the plot is not full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat <br /> <br /> However, this film does not have :. An interesting study in how to deal with the grief of families. As if the language of healing and of promising a huge loss leaves us speechless, and we rely on raw emotions instead. Sadness without reason and patience, anger, even hatred. And, unfortunately, the protagonist (the boy who accidentally shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given more than its fair share of this. Eventually he leaves and goes with his grandfather (Brimley), which gives it clear that it was an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew what was in his heart, but you need to hear these words from their parents and get them forgiveness <br /> <br /> What I loved about this movie :. The lack of dialogue. There was a huge emphasis on physical reactions, facial expressions. And the slow pace of the film allows you to actually watch the reaction of the actors. Something we do not get to do a lot with today's films. <br /> <br />
