I must be honest. I've been watching and enjoying the show, because he was rude, offensive, funny and rude. Yes, there is a lot of humor for everyone. If you are in the kind of humor that has to do with making fun of people who served with skateboards, for example, you'll have a great time for this. <br /> <br /> Or if you like people to take extreme action stunts going bad, you'll also have a great time. And if you love scatological humor and extreme situations, oh, you will enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> I love all three types of humor that «Dirty Sanchez» offers. I would like to have a laugh with hard situations show. "Jackass", like a walk in the park compared to this. So if you are tired of the typical American stupidity Jackass, give it a try on the English extreme stupidity on this show. With all due respect. <br /> <br /> This is a show that has little taste or class. Not recommended for those who are easily offended or dirty. <br /> <br /> Now, these guys need to see a psychologist. Especially the character of Puck.
