Each plays its part very well in this "little good movie." Belushi is able to live most of his life in many ways, but eventually realized that what he was going to be as good or even better. The film shows us that we should take advantage of the opportunities that we have, not the ones that we do not or can not have. If U can get this movie on video about $ 10, it'd be an investment!
