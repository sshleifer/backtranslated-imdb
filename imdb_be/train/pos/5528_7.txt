It's very beautiful and almost meditative film is hardly any dialogue in it, apart from the story; and the scenery and music complement each other perfectly. I'm not the first to connect the red-haired girl and foxes, while it was not shown to me one (which also has red hair!) It's almost old-fashioned type of children's films, says that children now prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story, and g .d., but I feel that young people should be introduced over the beauty and wonder of nature, this film certainly does. Maybe not the best movie ever of its kind, but it is certainly a wonderful and relaxing view for all ages-not just children.
