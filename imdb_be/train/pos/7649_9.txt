Fascinating car Belushi, modern version of the silly It's a Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays a kind of angel, which allows Belush see what life would have been if he had "done more." Jim at it best with a good history and a supporting cast; It seems that a real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Oscar is not the enemy, but good fun responsive.
