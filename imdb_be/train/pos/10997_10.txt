WOW. One I've ever greatest films. - Ever seen <br /> <br /> Absolutely loved it! By the opening of the loans were made, I was glued to the screen <br /> <br /> It's a thriller Sci-Fi. - And the edge of your seat Whodunnit. Incredible. <br /> <br /> I wish'd it never ends. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is a throwaway role. Anyone could play it. The lead actor Jeremy Northram was the perfect guy cause. <br /> <br /> This film appeals to me, who love war games, running shoes and track down. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06.
