The first time I read the book when I was a teenager, I saw a movie late at night. About a year ago, I checked it out on the IMDb and found no copies available. Then I got online and found a site that offers the war, soooo glad I did, ordered a copy and leaned back in his chair and was able to confirm why I wanted to see him again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, to really enjoy the film, I suggest you get a copy to read the book and then watch the movie. The book is no longer in print, but I did track down a copy by E-Bay, Author Alan White was a commando / paratrooper during the second World War, taking part in covert disparate operations, and this was his first book. It is written by someone who knows this fact, I believe, gives the book and the film authenticity. I did not give ten films only because of the nature of the film end, not as good as the book. There are several storylines that are different from the book, and, surprisingly, as the book is not about the large-scale nature of the war, but also the identity of the war. The film illustrates this very well. I have a copy of the book to my son read it, and then the film, to allow him to see, in that order. <br /> <br /> If you can keep track of his book and the film, then it is definitely worth and I just want to make it more accessible to a read and see, one of my best war movies ever !
