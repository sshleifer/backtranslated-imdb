* Contains spoilers for me to describe some of the methods of the film, so read at your own risk! * <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. The use of tinting in some scenes makes it looks like an old photograph come to life. I also enjoyed the projection of people in the background screen. For example, in one scene, Leopold called his wife, and it is projected behind him, not in the usual split screen. Her face was huge in the back and Leo is in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best applications of this is when young boys killed Ravensteins by train, the scenes shot in an almost political style poster with the face to close the window. It reminded me of the battleship Potemkin that the strength of the DC style combined with splashes of red to convey a ton of horror without much gore. The same with the scene where Katherine finds his father dead in the bathroom ... you can only see red water on the side. It's one of the things that I love about Von Trier, understating his horror that ends up making it all the more horrible. <br /> <br /> The use of the text in the movie was unique as when a character is Leo pushed word "Werewolf." I've never seen anything like that in the movie. <br /> <br /> The use of black comedy was well done in this film. Ernst-Hugo Järegård big as Uncle Leo. It brings laughter I got from his role in the kingdom (Riget.) This makes the scene absurd humor anal retentiveness train leaders against the background of the terrible 2 and all the chaos, it is easier to take. It reminds me of Riget how hospital administrator trying to maintain a normal life at the end of the first part, when everything goes crazy. This shows that some people do not really paying attention to the terrible things happening around them. However, some people like Leo, configured, but not to do anything positive about it. <br /> <br /> voice over, did a masterful well-Max von Sydow, funny too. It draws you into the story and makes the jump to the head of Leo, which is sometimes a scary place. <br /> <br /> The film raises the point that a coward, if they do not choose the direction. I see the same idea, which is used in Dancer in the Dark, where the nature of Björk speaks for itself and ends up being its own destruction. In fact, at one time, von Trier seemed anti-woman to me, making Breaking the Waves and dancer, but now I know that his male characters are not a success either! I was in the same place during the end of Dancer, if you seriously want the protagonist to reconsider their actions, but of course they never do!
