This film was made in 1943, when I think Judy was at its peak (looks wise). In his previous film, for me and my Gal people often say that she looks haggard. Well, in this movie, it looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows that she has a penchant for comedy. <br /> <br /> I think that this movie is hilarious, especially at the beginning, when she tries to arrange audition with John Thornway. One of the funniest scenes in my opinion, the color rendition of Judy Lady Macbeth, and when John is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking (laughs). <br /> <br /> One criticism I have is that there is a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean, one minute he despises her, and then they go on a date then the next time they meet after that date, they are in love. <br /> <br /> Another thing I did not like was at the premiere, If I was I would have Lily furious with John, but it is not ... it just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> But overall I would give this film 10, because it is just great and almost perfect.
