This film is about a snotty guy who decided to become a spy for the glamorous high-tech company called Digicorp. This cowardly guy Morgan (North) are dissatisfied with their helpless suburban life and his demanding wife, he decides to become a spy. He believes that the move to the Conventions of other high-tech companies and figure out all the plans of the companies. Instead, Morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu), and to a large extent be double-crossed by the two companies, which make it become a double agent. Morgan to get myself out of this? Could he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, may Morgan make it out alive? Wow! What a great movie! I was completely absorbed after 15 minutes of watching this film. This is very disturbing and you can feel the fear and confusion, he makes every effort to stay alive Morgan. The scene in which they put this horrible contraption on Morgan's head to brainwash him brilliantly horrible and frightening. Morgan slowly goes through the transformation of the individual, which is not as obvious as you think about it after the movie is over. With snotty guy with bad hair and glasses, he turns into a human, is actively fighting for his life. <br /> <br /> end, wow, the ending is incredible! Twist so much fun! She left me gasping and cheering like crazy! Good performances from all, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie!
