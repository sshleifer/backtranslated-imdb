I gave it 10 points out of 10 points. I love it so much. I am a child of 80-ies and completely in heavy metal for years. Such reasons I love this movie so much. Its so cool to see these posters in the bedroom of the boy (Judas Priest, Lizzie Borden, raven, twisted sister ...) and his vinyl collection (Exciter's publication of the wicked, Rise of mutants with a master Impaler and metal shock Killing is my business by Megadeth) . In addition, FASTWAY soundtrack is absolutely incredible and fits very well into the story. If you are into metal, it's no joke meal is your friend. I do not buy this film do not look for OZZY or Gene Simmons, because they are in a movie in seconds, hours, because the soundtrack and a story that will take you back to the glory of the 80s. You're not the same person after.
