View "Impulse" is very satisfied with the experience. Unpredictable films so rare that one comes as "Impulse", is to cover. The scenario is logical, and very creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn, and Bill Paxton, give credible performances. This could played as a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is far superior to any dull «zombiefest» and originality shines through in almost every scene. You get the feeling that something like this could actually happen, despite the fact that fiction scenario. With the "grabber" to the opening credits roll, you will be charmed. Very interesting and definitely recommended. - MERK
