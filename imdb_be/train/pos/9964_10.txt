Just get it. DVD cheap and easy to find, the length is now standard, and you have gone long enough without it. (If the home video began, there have been at least three versions with parts missing ..) Everything you read is true. There's no protection, and no living without it. Color juicy and beautiful to watch, and production value is pretty good for the Sabbath day kiddie epic. But there is a whole question..the Santa Vs. Satan angle so jaw dropping strange it made the film a hit at the time and the cult FAVE once home video really started. How good / bad / weird / it? I've only seen the trailer as a child, and remembered that for nearly 30 years..including Murray over the top voice over..I told his older sister, and she called me a liar and I could not believe it was possible for ANYONE to do movie where Santa vs.Satan .. Add to this such things as Santa to ask for the blessing of the Virgin Mary before setting off on Christmas eve, the children, who want to capture it and make it their SLAVE..and international children's sweat shop..and its probably closer to a large number of children were nightmares in the 60s .. As another here I see things every holiday season at the moment. (My version of choice is a mystery Science Theater 3000 edition). But any old way you choose it, the film is crazy masterpiece and a total required (along with Brianiac, by the way ..). He will never be able to make me laugh. Better, I think, that Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. Parts of it can still make you cringe or just creep you. (How many parents do you know, go to cocktails on Christmas Eve? "If you get tired, just go down and play the piano.Â» DANG ..) whimsical, sad, disturbing, funny, childish, strange..hey, what else can you want?
