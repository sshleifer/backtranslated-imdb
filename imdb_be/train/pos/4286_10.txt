I saw this film (it is the English name of "Who is Singing Over There?") At the International Film Festival in Montreal in 1980. Then he won rave ... and disappeared. A terrible shame. It's brilliant. Sublime, funny, boring, and very funny. The script is a work of art. It was 19 years old, and I have seen only a few comedies (or any other genre, for that matter), which can comply with its originality.
