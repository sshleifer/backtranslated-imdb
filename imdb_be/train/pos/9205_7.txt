This one grew on me. I love music R.D. Berman and, despite the harsh elements of the story, which I found a lot to be touched, as I continued to re-watch the film. Brother-sister storyline is powerful, I thought; There are also more likely to be sure things like bar fights in the crazy stories of crime, etc., are just distracting. (Although not unfunny from a certain point of view.) In addition, a translation into English, of course, someone for whom he was a bit of a stretch, and as crazy as this I am grateful to him for that. <br /> <br /> Like many Bollywood movies that I've seen, this is one and the melodramatic opera-like, including here, in particular, the song is sung first, a little boy, to cheer him abused and unhappy sister, and then the same song sung 12 or so years, a man who traveled to Kathmandu seeks to reconnect with the girl, and grew restless (she was told her brother and mother were dead), stuns her pain with drugs. <br /> <br /> super thing about this one thousand nine hundred seventy-one film is that we are talking about the hippie movement that brought hordes of seekers in India, from the Indian point of view, that they are seen as people brought to the Indian spiritual famine caused failures of their own societies, but, nevertheless, in India, it lives only for the moment of satisfaction. Hippie singing-dancing scene intoxicated is really cool, and precise in their tone (I am old enough to remember), and I feel pretty confident that the masses of young white zone of the children are the real hippies additions as I remember hearing about the children in the caravan East obtaining this kind of work in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> (this is not the actual movement of Hari Krishna, though the hippie film sings choral Krishen / Rama, as well as to make the actual group of Indian devotees, not associated with hippies, in the first scene of the film.) <br /> < br /> ~ Virginia
