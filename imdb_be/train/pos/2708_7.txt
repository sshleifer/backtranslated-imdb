After being sent to prison for a term of not less than 10 and not more than 40 years for being busted with drugs and refusing to give her to perform, Jackie (Erica Gavin Russ Meyer «Vixen» and «Beyond Valley of the Dolls" in it last film role) to get used to life in the big "doll" at home, or at least try, in this early film by Jonathan Demme. Due to the nature of this tasteless and just watchability, I would have to rank this as one of his best films, just under the "Silence of the Lambs" and «Stop Making Sense», but still higher than any of his other films. This small simple classic mannerisms, sleazy and fun enough to be surprisingly good gloating and fortunately never goes overboard with all the parodies of the genre of women in prison. He was almost washed out rancid taste bad ridiculously instructive «Philidelphia» out of my mouth. Nevertheless, the film is not without its downfalls (hereinafter «un'talent show HUGE sick sit and goes on for too long, Barbera Steele, unfortunately in vain, among other small things) But do not let this stop you from colic view otherwise enjoyable film <br /> <br /> My rating: B- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras :. 5 minute interview with Roger Corman; Cast & crew Bios; The original trailer; and trailers for "Candy Stripe Nurses" (with nudity), "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" (nudity), and "Crazy Mama" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Juanita Brown, Cheryl " Rainbeaux »Smith, Erica Gavin, Robert Collins, Ella Reed, Linda gold, and a few others all show skin
