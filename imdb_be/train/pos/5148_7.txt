I do not know what it is with this movie. But films about history and religion has always criticized their accuracy. Of course, it is not 100% accurate. It's hard to make 100% accurate movies nowadays, when even the "experts" do not agree with each other. Therefore, I would rather like to judge a film based on the fact that he is trying to say, than the choice of all inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So I start with what I liked this mini series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood years passed too quickly. The series had three of the stories of his childhood is the first part. But if they did not have more money to shoot more of the story, who am I to criticize it ??? <br /> <br /> There's only one real problem I have with this film, and this is what he said in the history of the way the book. Especially the second part, which is simply the sum of the events that occurred. I would rather like to see Hitler more humane (more scenes where he doubts himself, and so on). Noah Taylor did it back in the movie "Max", which seems to work better, I think. Nevertheless, I am pleased that this has been done and have it on DVD. Just remember more vividly what happened and to see Carlyle giving him better. 7.5 / 10
