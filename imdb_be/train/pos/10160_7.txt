I went into this movie thinking it would be a crappy B-rated movie. I went out with surprise and was very pleased. Eve was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. It was an amazing time comedy. Jokes in this movie were surprisingly original and truly funny with one or two flat jokes in between. The site was enough to tie it all together, the woman (Eve) dies on her wedding day, and comes back to haunt the woman who is going with her was-to-be husband, it sounds far-fetched, but it actually works quite well . <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Overall it worth hours of film, if you do not get it on DVD, when it comes out.
