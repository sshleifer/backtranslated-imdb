I voted well, how good was acting, not the content. It still gives me goose bumps after reading the book and then watch the movie. Two ex-cons travel to your destination, to rob the family money from the safe of one of the prisoners learned while in prison. During the trip, the tension begins to mount as the soundtrack to the film adds to the total apprehension. After the killer did with their work on the farm, it is the next morning the family are at church one daughter. Blood-curdling scream, like a scene pans to the phone cord sliced, really made my blood run cold, and gave me the shivers. The fact that the killers met their fate only a small comfort for this doomed family. Robert Blake was very rich in its portrayal of Perry Smith. The book is also beautifully written by Truman Capote.
