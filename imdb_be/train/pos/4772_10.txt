This film is perhaps the most moving and raises a mood that I have ever seen. I'm not a religious person, but sometimes a large piece of art as this film can give me almost a religious experience. One realizes that there is actually the meaning of life. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that when I first heard about this movie, I was skeptical. I thought that the story sounds far-fetched, and I was afraid that the story would be trivial. But, being a supporter of David Lynch, I decided to give it a go. It took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the film, but I was completely lost in it. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this film! I left feeling a movie that I really learned something valuable about life. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical David Lynch movie, and in a sense, it was very strange that he should make a film after exploring the dark side of human nature over the years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he is able to convey deep emotions and deep human understanding, because I thought that he was able to be very good in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most talented filmmakers around, and I think the simple story it even better. 9.5 / 10
