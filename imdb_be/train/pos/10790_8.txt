It's incredibly formulaic film from the team «Walker, Texas Ranger» contains some of the most incredible scenes ever seen in the TV movie. Furthermore, it is possible to predict the outcome largely initially. Nevertheless, it is a fun movie that gets the job done: he entertains. That's all I had to do, and it does. Stunts and explosions fun and interesting, and the story is not half bad. There are also decent, which is not a big surprise, because everybody knows that Chuck Norris Sun Steven Seagal. If you are a fan of the genre (and «Walker, Texas Ranger»), you will certainly enjoy. If not, do not waste your time. 8/10
