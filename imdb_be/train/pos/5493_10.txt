It's really rare that you get an inside look at the media hype that has been so widely reported as the official "truth" and caught so many "news" agencies with their trousers. This film, in my opinion, deserves the price is, in journalism - that's the goal, courageous and a real "scoop" (sic). It can do without comments, fake scenes or leading questions - everything, including Chavez gets equally make a fool of themselves in their own words. The creators of the film "only" had to be up to date and keep them rolling camera. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan elite teaches "How to shift the president and sell it as a victory for democracy." It is strange that they have lost in the end - at this time. From what I know, the biggest television station involved only got its license revoked earth, they continue to broadcast via cable and satellite. I very much doubt that George Bush or Obama will be that we suffer after the coup attempt. But then, they do not need to worry. <br /> <br /> The fact that "Ch√°vez supporters to shoot innocent civilians" scam has been so eagerly repeated around the world shows how biased the so-called "free" (created) media really began, always, only in more. An important lesson for those who are interested in what "really" happens in the world. <br /> <br /> The famous "objectivity" call always comes into play when the journalists dared to resist the dominant opinion, or detect unwanted facts that accused "we" - it was exactly the effects of the atomic bomb, the United States Secret history of the spread "democracy" around the world, or the war in Iraq, which, according to Johns Hopkins, killed 1.3 million Iraqis now, not to mention the 60,000 Afghans (in 2003), which is never mentioned. To be objective, Saddam Hussein was less destructive of people for it than in the US. And the US is ready and willing to be more damaging to the Iranians that he was. <br /> <br /> I am very curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague, is there any mention of "our" participation in supporting and training the guerrillas Pol Pot in the 80s, when they were largely defeated by the Vietnamese. Probably not. <br /> <br /> All the more reason to turn to independent media for the balance unless the exposure of fraud.
