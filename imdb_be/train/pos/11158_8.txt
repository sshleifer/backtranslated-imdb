Shocking, well done chiller is undervalued story of the brutal murder and evil forces. <br /> <br /> The small town doctor trying to find out who or what is committing a series of brutal sexual homicide. <br /> <br /> Incubus intimate secret with some horrible murder sequences, which builds on the off-beat and terrible climatic twist. murder scenes are intense and the mountains, so it is not a film for the faint of heart! John Hough direction, along with bizarre score, combine to create a dark atmosphere of fear that runs through the movie. He also carries a kind of gothic atmosphere as well. Good location for filming and some stylish camera work is also highlighted. <br /> <br /> Cast not bad. Big John Cassavetes makes a solid performance as the new doctor in town. Also good performances Kerry Keane as a local reporter, Helen Hughes, the city historian, and Duncan McIntosh as a tortured psychic teenager. <br /> <br /> All around Incubus is forgotten horror film, which must be re--discovered and re-evaluation. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
