As the sky {Spoiler) <br /> <br /> It was a great human drama, which stimulated my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> This parable is reviewing the life and death of Christ. Daniel is a superb gifted musician who is physically and mentally exhausted their careers, and should give it up. If he joins the church choir as his regent, it leads to a transformation in the singing of life, just as Jesus did to society in the first century Palestine. They laugh, they begin to openly and truthfully say to each other, their shortcomings are exposed, they accept each other, love each other, are vital community.They include mentally disabled young man (? Tore), so their involvement. <br /> <br /> pastor Stig enjoyed authority by means of imposing a suffocating morality at the meeting, and gradually dropped singers. If Stig dismisses Daniel, is a rebellion, and Stig are crushed. Stig is the Jewish power in the time of Jesus, whose insistence on obedience to Jewish law, provided a stunning contrast to the new life with the help of the "golden rule" brought by Jesus. <br /> <br /> In one dramatic scene, someone says "the church invented sin." All through the film, this contrast between the moral and the Ishmael vital life (so far). <br /> <br /> The truth to the story of Christ, Daniel dead horse when he hits him, leaving him to drown in the river. Next scene, we can hardly believe it when Daniel (resurrected!) The body was dragged to her room (Graves) wrapped in a white linen sheet (shroud!), Three women (three women were on duty at the foot of the cross in the Gospel). <br /> <br /> Daniel refers closely to Lena, a warm beautiful young woman who was betrayed by the man she loved, and who is now heterogeneous (Jesus established a close relationship with Mary Magdalene- Lena-, which was probably high courtesan / prostitute). Through Lena, Daniel learns to love, something he longed for, and now finds fulfillment. <br /> <br /> solo performed by Gabriella, compiled by Daniel, all of life to the fullest, as opposed to the moral correctness that leads to concerns about sin and what is right and wrong. <br /> <br /> In the final scene shows the whole choir singing / humming in harmony, like a mantra, an image in a large auditorium, illustrating the harmony and interconnectedness that is our true human destiny.
