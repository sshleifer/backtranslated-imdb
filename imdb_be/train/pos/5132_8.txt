It's like watching a no-frills music videos today. <br /> <br /> Jazz man give us additional pleasure in the person of Mary Bryant, who sings the classic version on the sunny side of the street. I never heard her sing before, Bryant sounds great, like Billy Holliday. It is a compliment to the people. <br /> <br /> Their instrumental work top as well. With a black film of its time the reins of a lot of white stereotypes, this film is to observe and appreciate. No big production values, a lot of good music.
