Do we make a "video nasty" again? Under the guise of a digital wide screen big budget remake of 8MM, it's quite a ride. Unfortunately, there is a bit too much of the story, and sometimes it becomes like a travelogue, as our heroine is looking for a spot in the immorality of Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. However, I am coming to a rather unfriendly "depraved" scenes, including everything from, hot wax, a severe beating and rough sex with drowning, beheading some of them. These scenes are flawlessly, and it is a pity, Bruno and his budget can not stretch to all of the many typical creatures becoming more represented than just cartoons.
