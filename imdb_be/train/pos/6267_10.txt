I thought that the original of this film was quirky and charming, as well as with me, sitting on the edge of his seat, trying to understand it. <br /> <br /> Since I have seen the original, when I saw it on the Sci Fi Channel- I do not know if it's a remake of deliberately made for the Sci Fi - I knew that it was within the first few minutes. Since I like Richard Burgi as a character actor, I would like to see how he will pull it off. <br /> <br /> The writers / producers, etc., the film modernized a bit, trying to explain the plight of "foreigners" (They are no longer able to reproduce itself and needed assistance), using the same pseudo-science, which was filled with in our ears in the 90s. Perhaps, he added, a little polish on the film or not. <br /> <br /> This film. The film? This production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did- originality ended the confrontation between a young woman and an alien and understanding of the kind had taken place, but not solve the problem of foreigners. <br /> <br /> I kinda remember that in this remake, the woman became very hostile to BÃ¼rgi / Alien- I think it could have ended better. But the ending is just the end and thread string swells, being main 1958 Science Fiction Pulp Stock. Many of the great science fiction stories were written in the 50s, and some of them even made it in the movie. <br /> <br /> This swelling thing to look at, like a rainy day or something. I rate him high cos of all the remakes of old Sci Fi 50-one is left well. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. <br /> <br /> But if someone really wants this story well, I suggest that the original version of one thousand nine hundred fifty-eight Tyrone Tom and Gloria Talbott, director Gene Fowler Jr.
