Castle of Blood is a good example of the quality of work in the horror genre kicked in Italy in the 60s. The film has all the right elements - The Old Dark House, an atmosphere, a decent story and Barbara Steele. Styles make the most of any film worth seeing. <br /> <br /> As for the history of the castle ghosts. People visited, but none of them returned. Our hero makes a bet that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect your winnings. But he attends a special night by night. This is the night every year, when the dead return to relive their deaths. <br /> <br /> The only drawback I see in the film is in the works. It almost feels laid. There is a big part of the first act, where nothing happens literally. Our hero stumbles in the dark without finding anything interesting. But as soon as he can not find something, the film picks up and become very pleasing. <br /> <br /> Blood Castle is a definite must for the style of the fans and lovers of Italian gothic horror in general.
