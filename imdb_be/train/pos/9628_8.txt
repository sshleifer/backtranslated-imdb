Some of my favorite films of Laurel and Hardy's very, very little plot. Instead, they give them a fairly mundane situation and simply allow them to be fun! Films such as HELP MATES and BUSY TEL is one of the funniest, how do you see the boys who work or cleaning the house. Here, in rough work, much of the film seems that two other films - Stan and Ollie are the chimney sweep and spend most of the movie trying (rather unsuccessfully) to clean the chimney mad professor. Seeing Ollie falls through the chimney, the boys making the house a total mess and insane behavior Stanley works together to make a very enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> However, in an odd twist, there is also a really amazing story that begins and ends the film. It seems that the professor really mad scientist, and he is working on a formula to make things younger. At the end of the film, you see it in the duck to make duck and even duckling in an egg! Given that he then left the boys alone in the room, it's a surprise, what happens next? While this plot was unnecessary, it worked well enough. What worked exceptionally well it was the middle part. Give the boy to do anything interesting and you will be surprised to hilarious results. One of the best teams of films and earns almost 9.
