First of all, the date of issue in 2009, Sun 2007 for this feature-length nature documentary. It should more correctly referred to as:. "Earth 2009" Second, let me address the complaints of some observers who have seen "Planet Earth» TV Series 2006 <br /> <br /> I have not seen this show, but learned here that this the film is a full-length version of the 2006 TV series. Suggia any movie, it's own merits, not its source. Suggia results by themselves, and the results of "Earth 2009" really cool. I shift this trivial complaint some reviewers: it's just an extended version of the 2006 television series "Planet Earth". So what? It really does not matter. <br /> <br /> As a positive effect of the film, and one that looked at dozens of nature documentaries in my life, I was amazed and very impressed "Earth 2009". This debut film from the new "Disneynature» division of Disney, and is held in the footsteps of Walt Disney's pioneering and the Academy Award winning documentary nature of films in the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> cinematic, film editing, music score, sound and story are all excellent. There was several other natural documentaries that also pershynstvaval in these categories. What really sets "Earth 2009" apart is its scope. It literally covers the entire planet, spanning all seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing, it was obvious that the documentary required considerable effort and investment of time and talent to create. <br /> <br /> The three production companies had to make this wonderful documentary. <br /> <br /> «Earth, 2009" convincingly tells the stories of four kinds of them great migrations, as it covers one year later. The season starts in January and ends in December, from the North Pole to the South Pole <br /> < br /> Two new special high-tech cameras have been used for this film: one camera has 360 computer-controlled motorized rotating the lens and the other is a HD-camera is installed in an amazing one thousand frames per second shooting, this method really add drama and beauty of some. scenes of "Earth 2009" ace pour cheetah chase and great white shark leaping out of the water to catch sea lions and a bird's-eye occurs at the edge of the world's highest waterfall. There are plenty of stunningly beautiful shots in this documentary. <br /> <br /> Through the film, the score and the story is a drama, sadness, humor and great beauty in this documentary. With a large number of music performed by the world-famous Berlin Philharmonic, excellent creative and technical cinematography and James Earl Jones story, I believe, "Earth 2009" is the biggest feature of the nature of the feature-length documentary ever made. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication really paid off very well here.
