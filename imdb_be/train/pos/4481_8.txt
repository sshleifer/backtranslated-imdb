The only reason I give this movie 8/10 stars, not 10, because 1) of Sinatra terrible and 2) love interest Kelly character is poor, (IMHO). There is a love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, it's a little boy. Dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most interesting and amazing dance sequences I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry is still my favorite and my daughter. I am 28 and she is 4, so that while the character is less iconic than Mickey, he is still the favorite of many children and adults today. Kelly exciting as always, his eyes full of joy and excitement. In every movie I've seen him, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. This is not surprising, Paula Abdul «sampling» Kelly moves. I would also like to list the Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people in the 20th century. If you were to watch only one part, do not miss the dance with Jerry Kelly Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
