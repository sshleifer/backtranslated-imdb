I wonder how much more realistic performance Brosnan is that of the original James Bond novels, when compared to bond films. He's neurotic, paranoid, alcoholic and a womanizer to boot. It is an ideal break for him, even so, to ridicule icon. "I'm a mess, a parody of itself," he says. It does not get any better than this. I just finished reading Dr.No and it is a lot like Ian Fleming, James Bond has been portrayed. Personally, I never liked Brosnan as Bond, because he comes too close icon. There was nothing for him to personalize a character, compared with Roger Moore and Sean Connery. Its nice to see Brosnan plays and based on reality and the great wall. Small character tries to come to an understanding on a deep emotional and psychological problems, for which he has no business background. This is an impressive image, and Greg Kinnear his land, just poetic. This film reminds me a little of the dynamics established between the protagonists in the «My Blue Heaven», but more sincere in their coping mechanisms.
