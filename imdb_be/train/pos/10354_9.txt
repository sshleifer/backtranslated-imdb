A cry in the dark <br /> <br /> cry in the dark was a movie that I would expect to offer phenomenal performance by Meryl Streep and solid when unremarkable film. This suggestion came from the fact that aside from Streep Best Actress nomination, the film received little attention from the main group awards. <br /> <br /> Little did I expect that he cried out in the darkness will be a riveting drama -constructed well at every level. If you ask me, this is a classic appreciatted. <br /> <br /> The film begins quite slowly, allowing viewers to get used to the Chamberlain at a relaxed pace and notice that at the core, they are incredibly loving, simple family. Skepisi (director) is selected capture random moments of family on vacation, which give an impending sense of impending tragedy, at the same time shows the attentive pleasure which Linda (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain care for their children. <br /> <br /> While the famous line "Dingo Took My Baby!Â» has become somewhat of pointe shoes in those days, the film never even close to the ridiculous. The actual death of Azaria is a terrible captivity. This subtle and realistic, leaving the audience in horror and ask questions. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place in the courtroom and focuses on continuous battle Chamberlain, to prove his innocence to the press and the court, which is suspected of the murder of Lindy. <br /> <br /> What is clear to us from the outset that they are innocent do intense Trials all the more exciting. As an audience member, I was fully invested in a difficult situation ... and Chamberlain was genuinely outraged and hurt and upset when they were made to look so terrible media. But at the same, media / public opinion is clear. I loved how the media does not sympathetic, but they have always been good reasons to keep their point of view. <br /> <br /> In the last line of the film is very deep, and fully reflects the central element that makes this film so different from other legal dramas. <br /> <br /> in terms of features, but the ones that really matter in this film are those Streep and Neill ... and they provide in every respect. For me, this is one of (if not # 1) the best performances by Meryl Streep. For all her skill different accents (which, of course, is very impressive in its own right), Streep never loses a central heart and soul of his characters. I believe that this is one of the finer performances Strip, and she hits it out of the park. And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and engaging in Jurassic Park, is a great counterpoint to the performance of the Strip. From what I've seen, this is undoubtedly the best work of the Nile today. It's a shame that he was not recognized by the Academy with the leading actor category to match the Strip ... b / c the two of them play off each other brilliantly. <br /> <br /> For more emotionally immersive than most films, as well as incredible suspense ... a cry in the dark, far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend to people who only know about the movie as a movie where Meryl cries of "dingo took my baby!" Watch the film and see how much more there is to cry in the dark, that one line. <br /> <br /> ... A ...
