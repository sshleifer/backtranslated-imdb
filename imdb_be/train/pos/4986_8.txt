Lensman relatively little-known anime from stone Toja and MK studios.It-X based on the novel, but it reminds me more games «Metroid». <br /> <br /> If you want to see this, see it in Japanese with subtitles or just Japanese.The English dubbed version almost cropped and edited to death. <br /> <br /> There is not a lot, despite the fact that this is the first animated film to combine CG-graphics with a hand-drawn animation, but it's fun to watch nonetheless.
