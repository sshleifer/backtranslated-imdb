The film Titanic makes it much more than just "a night to remember." He writes again the tragic events of history that will always talk about and will never be forgotten. Why is it so criticized? I have no idea. Can / will they ever make a movie like Titanic, which is so moving and touching every time you look at it. Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director, no doubt, had a great influence on the film. Simple disaster film (sad look) is transformed into an incredible romance. I'm not the type of a Romance, but that should not bother you, because you will never see the novel as it is. Guaranteed! For amazing effects, music, the sublime action. <br /> <br /> The film creates an amazing eye and a wonderful feeling. It looks very real and alive. Legend himself "Titanic" is shown brilliantly in all classes, and looks too accommodations. Actions had a real effect. DiCaprio and Winslet is simply the best there is in the role play. No one could have done better. They are partly the reason why the film is so great. <br /> <br /> I think it's not too much to talk about. The plot is simple, the action is brilliant, based on a true story, probably more than half of consumers who watch the film will share tears through UN imaginable endings, which can never be forgotten. Well, if you have not seen this film, absent from the film and Hesterical idolize Hollywood. It could be better? No, not really. The most touching movie of all time, not to listen to people, to see for yourself, then you will understand. Landmark. (Do not be surprised if you cry too)
