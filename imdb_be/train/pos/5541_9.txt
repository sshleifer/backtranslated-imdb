Very atmospheric sleaze, showing great ingenuity in the use of props, scenery and effects (fog, lighting, focus), to create a sinister and moody texture. History contrived acting just functional, but it shows how creative effects can develop the whole visual storytelling. This film is recommended for his moods and textures, rather than its history.
