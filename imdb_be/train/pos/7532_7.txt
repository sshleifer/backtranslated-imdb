The New Batman Adventures (also called Gotham Knights) takes place 5 years after the final episodes of Batman: The animated series (B: TAS), and only aired 24 episodes. This is not a hit show, but it's just not as good as the original Batman Animated Series. I'll start with all the things that I found not so good <br /> <br /> The first thing first, the animation itself :. Long and sweet, the Gotham dark sun longer, the sky is always bright red and orange, B: TAS did it too, but it was drawn to the dark sky, the color of the sky to make a more sinister, in this show, the color of the sky is too bright. All this looks like any other children show, and does not seem unique, like Batman: TAS made of dark, cool style art on Gotham. The art style is OK, but reminds me of Batman more. Each character is made up of straight lines, squares and triangles make the character look less human type. In the original series (B: TAS), the characters look like painted versions of real people. The animation can be more consistent than in the B: TAS, but it is definitely not as good. <br /> <br /> Next: Some scenes seem too dumbed down and childish, but some of the subject even more than the B :. TAS (Two-Face tries to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2, and some villains get pretty rough treatment). This leads me to the next point. <br /> <br /> Since this is to take place in the future, as well as the final episode of Batman Animated Universe, many villains meet their death or leave forever. Poison Ivy, apparently tone when the cruise ship explodes; Two-faced nearly kills penguin, Killer Croc, and himself, so he moved to Arkham forever; Joker to get into the exhaust of industrial plant tower (though he'll be back later, League of Justice Animated Series); Catwoman goes to France, leaving Batman, etc ... Just because the series ends does not mean that they should get rid of some great characters! Motives villains pretty bad, too. There is not! In B: TAS, we learn that the villain thought tortured and their lives destroyed, so they act as they do on the show, only villains carrying out the crime, in order to achieve progress in history. It's like Batman just do not even care for the preservation of sanity no matter that remains in the people that he fights, he just beats them senseless. This Batman is colder and meaner version of the character, but as he was doing this job for many years, I can understand why he is so dramatically. <br /> <br /> Next, recycled character models: they are terrible. Gordon has lost about 100 pounds ... he's sick? Many thieves look stupid (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter and Killer Croc is one of the worst). Although, I think that some characters look better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl). Harley is about the same, and Ivy (which is even hotter now) has a pale green skin. <br /> <br /> From the series that have a lot of mistakes, some episodes of On Edge, Mad Love, Beware Creeper Girls Night Out, old wounds, Legends of the Dark Knight, and never be afraid of my favorite here, in my look. All crossovers with the image of Batman in Superman animated series were great, too. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part of the show, as the creators say that they love the animation in this series more than the original. On the DVD features the original Batman Animated Series, they talk about how proud they were with the style of art, and how hard some of the characters are animated, but they will eventually succeed with (complex animation to animate Clayface, for example), the peculiarities DVD in new Batman Adventures, creators basically saying Â«to Hell with the B: TAS, it is a fresh, new re-vamp, it looks better, and we love the way we ALMOST RUINED series!" (Well, that is an exaggeration). If the creators reject strange art style B: TAS, that really annoys me <br /> <br /> This is not a bad show, but I still do not like it as much as the original animated series. At least, the show did not speak to his audience, so for this reason, I still recommend it. Though some of the episodes in this new series are fantastic and worth watching. <br /> <br /> Superman: The Animated Series and Justice League: The animated series following large demonstrations in Batman: the animated series, and The New Batman Adventures, to give them a watch, as well.
