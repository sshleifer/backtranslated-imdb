I was usherette in the old theater in Northern California, when this movie came out. As nice as it is on DVD, this is even more terrible and awful on the big screen. Although it has been nearly 9 years since I saw him, he is still one of my favorites. At the risk of sounding trite, "They just do not make them like that any more!" The Sixth Sense speckled If you do, this film is definitely for you! Great storyline, incredible characters, sinister atmosphere; Even the soundtrack has a compulsive quality. I strongly recommend you do not watch it alone. Brownstone apartment is rented for only in 1977, it will have any shortness of breath (this would be at least 10 times higher than the price on the date).
