I really liked this movie. It managed to do what few films to do now; it provided the family values, entertaining me. Nancy Drew character for all generations and a role model for young girls to look up to. Little girls, I was a thoroughly enjoyed the movie and continued to talk about Nancy, as we left the theater. The film has relatively few problems for the family, and I do not think that the parents will be bored, sitting in a theater. No, he did not win the Oscar, and he has demonstrated superb special effects, or even imagine scary spooky mystery, but it entertained me, and he was true to the spirit of the book. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone with a young girl (she will love it!), Or any fan of the books. You will not be disappointed.
