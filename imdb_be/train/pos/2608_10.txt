Ryazanov final season was a roller coaster crazy. This latest episode does just what the previous comment says, it tells us that as much as we might think that we know the characters, we did not do. Ryazanov goes back to season one, and tells us that this show was her performance of her life. She says that in the last episode, she changed events and people, as it sees fit. Scott was not really with Leon, but it existed. Mark and David were married on opposite his wife in real life, and Dan died, when she made him live. How did the event in her life, she changed them in his writing. Do not we all wish we could do it. Not all of us have at one time that we wish we could just use a rubber band, and changes in our soul. This is what she did with the whole episode. And on another note, I would say that I do not feel cheated, the real family was in my head, it just changed the way that events occurred in their lives. A + A + at the end of the show !!!!
