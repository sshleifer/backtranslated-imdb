carefully written dialogues Simon really electrified Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the crackling of the script. There are several films that it can develop a relationship between the actors and the script. For example, the famous Reunion scene could have been much duller with less quality actors. Matthau, seems to have been born to play Willie Clark (of course, the Oscar to a greater extent in the Odd Couple), and all the little individual characteristics and mannerisms that Matthau overwhelms the character (the line where he argued that he had it with him lives in the city, while Lewis lives in a country that Lewis "divorced" is a typical example of this) make it one of the best performances I've ever seen any actor in any role, whether it's comedy or drama or something yet. Period. Matthau and Burns work well together; they draw the contrast emphasizes the excellent agility Simon comedy in creating the conflict. This film is just one of the ultimate "must see" and not required by law prestigious place in the pages of the history of cinema.
