I really enjoyed the performances of the main roles. Emma Lung bold and interesting. Director of the play developed, where the characters are not one-dimensional. Complicated history with the change between periods. It is also understood that underlies the history of unions are losing power and influence of a large employer of closing a small town. I do not agree with the comment that the old man should be attractive. There has to be a lot of relationships with older men and younger women - without a male being good looking. The depth of the character can be attractive for not so small. The film has good appearance and cinema is also good.
