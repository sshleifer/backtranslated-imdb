I actually found the film "interesting"; Finally, one worth my time to watch and shoot. It's true ... some scenes were on top of the emotional, cry, etc., but the fact that the film does not emphasize its agenda, genre, or "selfish"? Almost there! What surprised me was that I read a review elsewhere do S.Fran reviewers on other review sites, but found that his negative review, instead of a more precise description of his "own" movie review; not a film at all. Anyone who watches this film will realize that it's great to recommend to family and friends; chase, Yes !! Being "in" Italian family myself, I can fully applies to the environment depicted on the screen. The film has its portion of the tear-jerking, as well. This is what real life can be in such an environment. Good movie.
