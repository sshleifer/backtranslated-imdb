Released two years before I was born, is the Oscar-winning film has it all - gorgeous sets Technicolor and costumes, breathtaking cinematography, great music from wall to wall Gershwin, wonderful choreography, lighter than air, the script and great performances Kelly, the Levant, Foz , Guetary and Karon. Hollywood does not make them like that anymore. Definitely, this is my favorite movie of all time, the standard by which I judge all other films. ENJOY, enjoy, enjoy!
