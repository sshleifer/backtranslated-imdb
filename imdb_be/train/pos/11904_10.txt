I gave him 10 as everyone else seemed to like it and it would be impolite to Niya. The reason why I am not in a couple to add a personal observation on the castle. <br /> <br /> I saw the "mortal" and "tingler" (version with reasonable color sequence, where all but the blood in the black-and-white) several times and "House on the Hill" haunted many times. <br /> <br /> I do not even old enough to see them, when the castle was a showman tricks to it, so I can appreciate them for their own merits. And although most give it as a minor, schlocky, Hammy, etc., I believe that they are doing a disservice to him <br /> <br /> The final sequence of "death" genuinely shocking and works today. - and the premise of Â«The tingler" and stupid, was very original. <br /> <br /> But the "House on Haunted Hill" was a triumph. Using the Frank Lloyd Wright house, his appearance, great Vincent Price and monolithic, as well as good grades and the production of value - when I first saw him in the crowded late night, pointing in the late sixties, he made the audience reaction I have not seen and not seen. <br /> <br /> It was a little, where the heroine is one in the basement (if you have not seen this movie, do not read), and we expect to hear the hero on the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> which the wiring that comes, the camera zooms out slowly, forcing the viewer to switch their attention ... I mean, no. longer (my "spoiler" declaration above covers only the movie) <br /> <br /> The point is that I believe that this was a deliberate ploy - not by chance - and when it happened, a cry AUDIENCE (including most of the men!) It took the audience of about ten minutes to calm down. <br /> <br /> Now it's superior to the film industry. Bright showman, he could, but "House" and other two films I mentioned, there were good movies. The castle was not Hitchcock, but it was not Ed Wood, too. <br /> <br /> It is easy to focus on someone's quirks and forget to explore their talent. So I hope that this film admitted. I'm looking forward to see it.
