Haunted by a secret, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is looking for redemption, radically transforming the lives of seven people he does not know. Once his plan is set, nothing will stop him. At least, that's what he thinks. But Ben was not going to fall in love with one of these people, and it is the only one who will end up transforming him. Will Smith again with director Muccino, after a life inspired the movie "The Pursuit of Happyness." "Seven Pounds" is another change in the life experience of the film, which not only makes it recalls its previous co-operation, which is crying, but inspires you joy in the end. Will Smith, and again with some other producer. These films are very realistic, reflecting the life of an ordinary person in his life & breaks. Seven Pounds, may have taken a while to get that the actual impetus, but only half an hour of the film, the film is all set to rule your heart. In addition, the film has some twists revolving around that allows viewers to continue to guess. Director Muccino again a winner all the way, with his emotional yet inspiring message. He makes all the characters in the movie are very real that people actually find yourself in a film somewhere. Together with the director, Will Smith, another winner, with his superb acting. Once again, director and actor duo works like a charm. In addition, there are other talented actors in the film, which made its role very well. Dawson Rosary, beauty with brains, is that it can be called. It looks nice and does its part very well. Barry Pepper, gives a lot of support to the cinema and Woody Harrelson does the same thing, though, Woody was not a lot of time on the screen (it would be nice if he had more). You will not forget this film easily. Watch this movie, and change your life. Top class movie!
