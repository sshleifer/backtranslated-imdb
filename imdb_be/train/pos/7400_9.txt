This is a great story about family loyalty, which, fortunately, did not resort to the usual trick (or, at least, the ones I was used to seeing in American and European films) with supersentimentality or high drama. <br /> <br /> This is a very watchable and very attractive. It has some beautiful cinematography, but do not rely on it alone to entertain.
