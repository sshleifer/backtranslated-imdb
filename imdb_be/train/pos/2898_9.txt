What would happen if a depressive cop works with a psychiatrist on probation? Can be a lot of fun ... This film set the benchmark in action / comedy genre Argentine cinema. Dearable characters, probably, the history and the pace that between laughter have some thrills. I recommend it for a pleasant time entertaining. Peretti and Luke combine their efforts to combat the cold and daring enemy at a time when it is difficult to trust someone. This film will surprise you, the other side of the coin, "Analyze Me", but not so with nothing to envy. And if you want to know Bs.AS where several scenes of the city and the city center.
