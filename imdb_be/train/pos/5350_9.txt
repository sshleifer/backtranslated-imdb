I saw a man who ran a few times as I am a fan of Stephen King, and have all of his films, but now it is even better, because up until 2 days ago I did not know about this site, and I did not realize that Paul Michael Glaser, which has been associated with this film was the same Paul Michael Glaser, I grew up looking at the Starsky and Hutch TV show. For me it is a pleasant surprise, because I can not tell you how many times I cried when Starsky and Hutch was injured. Episode where almost died Starsky (murder Starsky) I cried so much my dad had to turn away from the show. What do you expect from a child under the age of 12 years now, I deliberately go for films and programs with the participation of Paul and David Soul, and all that Stephen King has his hands on me, so that !!!!!!!! Just have to say, the day of the birth of Paul !!!!!
