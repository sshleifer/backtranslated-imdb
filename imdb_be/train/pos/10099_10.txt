Anime that got me hooked on anime ... <br /> <br /> Set in 2010 (hey, it's not too far away now!) The land is now a wasteland toxic gas pollution and violence. Seeing how crimes occur ever 30 seconds and committed by thieves who have the firepower Third World terrorists, the government of the fictional Port City New forms Tank Police to solve the problem - ment with tanks! About madness! <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of this series include a rookie Leona Ozaki, Japanese red hair (yes, I know that they will never match their names with a clear Japanese Japanese appearance), who has just been called up to the tank police quickly cooperates with blond, blue-eyed good guy Al. Leona is new by using tanks and, unfortunately, it destroys favorite tank Tank Police Commander Charles of Great Britain (also known as «Brenten»), a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and sports a pair of elegant sunglasses large gun and a bad mood. Britain did not like to have Leona join the Tank police in the first place, and its wrecking his Tiger Special (a giant green monster tank) is not exactly call her to him, and he loves her taking the remnants of his giant tank and use it to create a mini-tank she had the nickname of Bonaparte, and he quickly pushing so she was transferred to the child's well-being "where the boys are more your size," he said. In the same function, the bifocal genius Bible quote / God fearing chaplain, purple MO-imposed Mohican, and the pot paunchy Chief, which is yhodits to the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the antics of the police Tank. Seeing as armored police often destroy half the city, chasing the bad guy and to use extreme violence to grab them, they are not very fond of the people. <br /> <br /> "villains" is a cyborg named Buaku, received a mysterious past, connected with the project, known as the "Green world", his gang and his two sexy cyborg cat conspirators Anna & Uni Puma. In the first game, these guys are paid to steal the urine samples from the hospital treatment of people who were not infected with the clouds of poisonous gases and in the second they are hired to steal a picture that naked Buaku. History, however, was incomplete in the anime and was completed in the cult comic book ( "Manga") The book, which is very difficult to find. <br /> <br /> All kinds of chaos and lawlessness in this venture comes a black comic that explores how far people want their police to go to catch criminals, and what happens when the thin line between good and bad guys It starts to get blurred. This is the kind of thing that if you are going to make a movie about him, you'd better go get Quentin Tarantino. . Unevenness in the ground, but still very fun <br /> <br /> This is followed by "New Dominion: Tank Police».
