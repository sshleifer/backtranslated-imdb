Fourth MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983). <br /> <br /> The film, based on the novel by Gerard Reve, it works best as a thriller. It's quite strange, considering about Reve need a hundred pages for the whole plot slight rotation and the tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work. <br /> <br /> «Fourth Man" top heavy on symbolism, Paul Verhoeven, tend to be very concerned about proving something basically hostile critics, and I'm never sure what it is exactly what he is trying to prove. He usually underestimate your audience and tells his story in a non-thin, he quickly moves away from the original idea or story, and almost seems to forget that you need to see on the screen and what should be omitted. In «The Fourth Man», he is not so obvious in the story detailing how he floor and nudity (of which there are many), but, as in most of his films, he seems to be afraid that the public will not get it and ground at home history with open symbols, mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There's almost no sex scene or full frontal nudity, most of them annoyingly gratuitous and in your face, it undermines the otherwise good story. <br /> <br /> However, if you can cope with rather obvious satirical approach Verhoeven, it's pretty entertaining thriller sometimes with some intriguing plot twists and a good performance from all sides, and Tom Hoffman Jeroen Crabbe in particular. <, Br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
