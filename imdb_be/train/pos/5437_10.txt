Pandro S Berman was "the responsibility of the production", but what made him so-called Line Producer. But who created this epic, filmed not in Arizona, but in the Mojave Desert in California, where scavengers have fled with all the remnants of the 'golden temple' huts strangulation, a British outpost in Muri village Tantrapur, etc. minor technical errors can and should be forgiven. What is unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for best music, although perhaps, the Academy did not offer such at the time. One theme was played in different tempos, including waltz, march and sweet, to create a mood. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of the production of a widow requires Kipling. The actor, who plays Kipling short a before and after the fight scenes. In the first edition of his scenes were cut to the demands of Mrs Kipling. Later they were incorporated and borrowed "connection" Kipling's immortal poem to the scenario in Ben Hecht. Interestingly, this is very typical and pro-British history was a great writer who hated Englishman himself.
