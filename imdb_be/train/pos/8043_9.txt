I've heard people who say that this film is boring boring boring. I do not think they are looking at the correct film. This is not a prototype fighter, thank God. <br /> <br /> it is a psychological drama about a rookie, and his teacher, who just happens to be about killing people. Thus, it works very well, with stunning performances from Beranger and Zane (which is not sleepwalking through the movie, as he is in other roles - it actually looks like, how it works) <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. with the action until the end - a lot of it does not make much sense and was not satisfactory, given the build-up of the rest of the film. But watch face Zane, he panics, alone, while Berenger does the dirty work.
