I first saw this film at the festival. There were a lot of good films, but few have kept me a long time to think about it after the nightmares and insomnia was definitely one of them. Tess, certainly a talented director. Shots were great. The casting was perfect. Dominic shined in his role, which she perfectly thought out. There has not been a lot to learn about his character, but she wrote the story in a way that we cared about him. And Ellen-- I can not wait to see where it ends! It shows a lot of talent, and I hope she makes a few films. With all the millions of dollars budget, trying to get a cheap thrill, Tess reveals that all is not lacking, as there is a good story and the actors. Kudos to all the participants of this film. And thanks to Tess & Co. to disseminate it on DVD!
