Fortunately for us, the real fans McCoy (probably all baby boomers who grew up in the late '50s and' 60s), three of the adult actors / actress appeared as they did for the reunion shows, in 2000, Tony Martinez and tilt both died shortly thereafter. As nice as it was Luke, sugar babies, and Pepino together again, it was as mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Uinklmane? It is my understanding that the little Luke died in 1999, but I do not know how. There's no information about Hassie on the internet that I can find. Very interesting, why are they not mentioned? It was so noticeable in their absence Reunion show, I suspect that Michael's family and myself (if still alive) Lydia something, 1) asked to leave with discussions and, therefore, their wish was granted, or 2 ) TNN could not find any trace of either Michael or Lydia (like the rest of us), it seemed that they were gone. Thus, it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, retrospection on Walter Brennan was beautifully done. They made no secret about it ... it was the grandfather who made the show such a success. I remember, as a child, imitating Grandpa frame to go and my parents laugh (as I'm sure millions of other kids did back then). A shame that so bothers me a bit, there was a trend towards the inclination to dominate the discussion ... sometimes interrupted by Tony and Kathleen, to make a point. In fact, although Tony Martinez seemed quite able to contribute to the conversation, he has no right to speak, and say too much during the reunion show. Unfortunate, because I would like to hear from all three equally. In general, the reunion show was a real treat for me. I watched it on DVD a few times and I use it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
