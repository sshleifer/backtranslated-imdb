Jammin 'the Blues is the Oscar-nominated short from 1944, which is basically 10 minutes of improvisational jazz played in one long jam. Marie Bryant sings "sunny side of the street" at one point to highlight the movie then jitterbugs with Archie Savage to bring the most entertaining "jam session" of its exciting end. Director Gojn Mili was a photographer, and experience shows in some of the double shot of the impact of some of the musicians, making it one of the most innovative angles 40s. According to some notes I read one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouette in the reflection of the social relations of the time. what a shame. However, this is the most unusual film time is available on YouTube, so for if you love jazz, then I suggest you look for it there.
