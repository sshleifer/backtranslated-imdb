I saw this movie for the first time on BBC July 27, 2005 For me it was a good interpretation of human Conan Doyle, and I really wonder what the supporters think about it Sherlock. I also think it is a film for those supporters they agree or not, that may be asking yourself mentioned.You was A.C. Doyle strong man, or he put himself in the matter. However, he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much it was a kind of semi-biography? At least much I put this forward fit, it's a film you have to see - even if you're not interested in movies or books Sherlock Holmes - watch it, enjoy yourself and have your own opinion about it.
