I'll come clean. The only reason I even learned about this DVD because Dominic Monaghan is my favorite actor. When I heard the name of the movie, I thought it would be ... different, maybe not such a good way. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading a few reviews that were there on this short, I was really excited to see. I sent for my copy, as I could and got it in a few weeks. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film Jack, insomnia, which often suffer from conditions that makes him doubt that it is a reality, and that all in his head. I did not betray what was going on, but I will tell you that the film can sometimes be intimidating is realism. <br /> <br /> are pointing is fantastic, focusing on what is important to the story, not allowing him to lose the fun and thought-provoking moments. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give this great movie 9 out of 10, to go far beyond what I thought I could achieve any short.
