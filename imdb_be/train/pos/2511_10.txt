I went to look for this film in a typical fan obsession. I just wanted to check it out. I did not expect much of anything. In the end, the musician, actor and screenwriter? AEs possibly as much talent to be in the same person. Right ?? <br /> <br /> Wrong !! Obsession aside, he quickly became one of my favorites! The storyline and characters are entirely lost in typical hyped up Hollywood special effects. Story break on your emotions and pulls you forward. Since credit roll by, you suddenly realize that you have not been glued to the end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the acting seems a bit from above. I do, however, believe that this is done with the intention of comedy and very fitting nature. Otherwise, I would not expect the level of acting seen. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing more than once. I find myself laughing hysterically or shortness of breath suddenly something I missed or forgot the first time or two around. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this film. Do not hesitate to go with his doubts, but I'm sure he will find a place on your shelf.
