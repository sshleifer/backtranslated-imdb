They had me from the first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to the Trinity County. Sleepy little Mayberry, as a place, with one small difference. Sheriff really Satan. There's a spoiler. Not like you would not understand it for 10 minutes in any case. <br /> <br /> Yes, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to keep it nice, but it's an uphill battle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows what Caleb and loves to spend time with him teaching him the way of darkness. Thin. Sneaky. He does not always come off as evil. Most of the time he is a hero. Everyone owes him a great favor because it often causes distress and saves them from it. Thus, every time you think someone finally take him down, one of his friends came out of nowhere to sabotage it. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were in the forest in the cabin and some guys with guns decided to rob them. Lucas used it as an excuse to teach a lesson about the evils of Caleb. <br /> <br /> robber (Ted) was hesitant to shoot them. Lucas Caleb said that Ted was half a conscience. If he did not have any conscience, he would have shot them now. If he had a real conscience, he would never have become a criminal. Thus, he began to call it Half-Ted. It was pretty funny. He teased criminals. And, of course, he stayed on the 10 steps ahead of Half-Ted at all times. And, of course, he was in complete control at all times. They are actually in your favor of Satan. <br /> <br /> It is a very beautiful show. it was one of my favorite horror show of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of Fear American Gothic Supernatural <br /> <br /> It is a good company.
