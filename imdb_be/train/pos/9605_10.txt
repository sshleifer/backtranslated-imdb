Well, I was not sure that the film was going to be like as I only saw a little clip, but I thought it would be good, and I was right, I watched it twice a day, I got it good and this is my favorite film. <br /> <br /> I think Allison Lohman Beth played the role very well she is an actress and writer grille should go in a lot of research to find out about bulimia, although the ending is when Beth is up in the hospital has 2 observation Horus after a meal, as IV has been said, one house in order, and that the hospital does not help Bulimics intravenous said that is probably why I'm still at home even tho my sister and my mother wanted me to be hospitalized, as I am, to have bulimia, but it is to rub the film I recommend it to any one, or with eating disorders or for people who know someone with an eating disorder, as it can allow them to life bulimic person and see the world as they do a little bit all over the grate of the film and I recommend it to any and all types of people
