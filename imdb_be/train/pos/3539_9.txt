Good: Bringing cinematic gunfights, great view, vehicles, really enjoy driving rather attractive multiplayer, fidelity cinema, and the list goes on <br /> <br /> Cons :. The main mission of a little short <br. /> <br /> This game determines what is "good" third-person shooter (not necessarily a spy-game) is. Large shootout to lead the story and make you want to complete every single mission to the end, and unlock all the real bonus games can offer. Hype this game has been lived up to, and I personally think that you should buy it, and connect with a few friends and play this. Loads of fun. <br /> <br /> The sound in this game is a rip-roaring distance from several previous Bond game and shooting weapons, actually feels like you shoot a weapon. It links in with the aspect that you are deadly and ruthless spy. <br /> <br /> In general, this game makes you excited and satisfied after you make it through, and some multiplayer, which can compete with the standards insidious game James Bond «Nightfire» for the GameCube.
