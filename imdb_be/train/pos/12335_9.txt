Warning: contains spoilers. Trite plot and in many cases the wrong action. Fontaine is great, but some others, such as Richard her husband Ivey, very wooden. She lay in bed dying of arsenic poisoning, with every hair in place. Nevertheless, the film is so rich and so intense expectation. Rather book than most films of its era. Casting Joan Fontaine as the poisoner (and the prostitutes, who was just as shocking then - I'm not kidding, children) was a clever move. She just her usual Joan Fontainey own. What should have been the killer, she dies from falling "just feet across the floor in the empty space."
