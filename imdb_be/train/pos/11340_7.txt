Every child feels older injuries and active representation of every child to get the best of them, but also (to be Clint Eastwood movie Changeling Anthony De Marco ?? - reminiscent of Henry Thomas about 1982) Jake combination can be deadly. <br /> <br /> The Lonely six years whose idea kicked into high gear when he was depressed to learn of his warring parents Peter (Sean bridges, later with "Deadwood") and Jules (Brooke Bloom, "the CBS: Miami ") suddenly decided to divorce, leaving him to fend for themselves, and the unleashing of a new tenant ?? . Zombies in the closet <br /> <br /> Jake actually gets the seed planted by playing with the neighborhood Dillon friend (Matthew Josten), who gives him a printout off the Internet in the FAQ Re: zombies. Jake is so convinced that the one to get it ?? and his family ?? he begins to hatch a plan of action to protect them, before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Indy rookie Shelli Ryan ?? who wrote and directed ?? combines domestic drama with minions of terror, but the former (the fight) outweighs the latter, with a decent story buoyed by fine acting (De Marco is a rare breed of child actor, where he is a child, and not a "valid" - all its nuances quite obvious, with the awkward, shy, introverted child, that many of them may be too (I certainly can). Brizhers makes it cheating husband is sensitive to the realization he really loves his son, while Bloom has a more complex work on building sympathy somehow careless mother quickly emotion over rationality ?? it does not help when the mother of Dylan Ruth (Monette Magrath, reminiscent of Laura Dern) constantly feeds motivated to drive a wedge between Jake and his father. Magrath also has a tough task to make her manipulative nature relatively nice, but it is open stage, I will not go into details, but it shows why it is as it is (and more importantly, it also affected her own child). <br /> <br /> The fillmmaker subjective camera is also good to use (many angles show the shapes POV Jake at waist level or slightly distorted, that is, on its head shot of Peter with his son in the same position , while having some fun in the yard), as well as editing a relatively flawless. <br /> <br /> Ryan screenplay based on the personal experience of growing up and witnessing first-hand accounts of other, passing through the same situation and the effect on adult relationships can be harmful if the application of their fears, anger and stress on them children. Here, the film is very successful in getting it across threads. <br /> <br /> However, the reinforcement of the horror a bit inconsistent, to say the least, but a tribute to the zombie films of George A. Romero shown lovingly Ryan (mother of Jake asleep in front of TV, as the night of the living dead unspools, causing his own faith undead to be in their home). The metaphor of the monster, which acts as a surrogate for domestic violence can be a bit heavy, but again, the child's fear of things under the bed versatile.
