Most horror films really terrible movies. They receive the same ol'-same old. Same old packet every minute with a cheap thrill (usually a "splash") and now they can time to pack every second with colorful special effects. One of the goals of really good horror movie to pause the feeling of mistrust audience. For example, I've seen of the last films The Mummy and a little dizzy from watching funny special effects every second. It's probably worth a million dollars in the second to make these movies, and my sense of disbelief has never been suspended, he settles. <br /> <br /> Stealth could be worse. Less is more. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw the "Woman in Black" on channel A & E. After flipping through the usual channels of 987 very poor TV stopped to watch it. This film almost looks like a production of «Masterpiece Theater». That was fine with me, I've always preferred the British TV & movies anyway. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will find this to be too slow paced. But slowly walk helps to give the history of the trust. Special effects that few lulls the viewer to think that this film is set in the real world, which makes us a little more difficult. Makeup and costume for the ghosts are simple and truthful. Hollywood would have made her look like she was a demon from hell with glowing eyes, fangs claws, etc. Hollywood would make a surplus and turned this idea into mediocrity. <br /> <br /> A woman makes only about five appearances in the film. Most of them, where it appears in the distance, and even what makes a good fright. When she appeared too often, it could reduce the cost of the mood that gets a lot. However, this film is so well done that for most of the film, we brought in sensing that she was there all the time, but it is not visible. The scene in which she "visits" Arthur Kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close to a masterpiece of horror. <br /> <br /> It's just unusual film, which I think should be considered as one of the choicest horror movies ever made. I have a copy of "Ghosts», «The Changling» and a million more. I have nothing Tops «The Woman in Black" even though I am still looking for could not see. This film did so well that it gives even the most hardened skeptic (like me) when I almost had second thoughts about the non-existence of ghosts. I joke with people that I sometimes get short fears that it may appear to stand in the middle of the road, and I can see that she was looking out the window, etc. Perhaps it could be in the crowd at the mall looking at me with her to look for hatred. It's like a really big horror movie should be. As LaFanu novel, The Woman in Black is very slowly pulls you and wrapped around the neck and, before you realize it, it is fueled by one of you, and then it's too late. <br /> <br /> The closest thing I have to criticism that it was made for the small screen ... and it's a terrible shame that it's out of print. I just paid over $ 40 for my second copy of this film. This is a big win in my collection. Now I'm on a quest to find an even better horror film, which not only gives you chills, but also qualifies the audio drama.
