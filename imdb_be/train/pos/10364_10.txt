Linda (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) just welcomed a baby girl, Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists live their beliefs every day and soon Azariah dedicated to God in their churches, with their two older boys looking at. Michael receives a family vacation and decides to go to Ayer Rock, one of the most spectacular tourist destinations throughout Australia. Not being rich, family camps, near the site. After a great first day, Linda baby Azaria put to sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly, she hears crying Azariah. As Lindy goes to the tent, Ding dog just out, shaking his head. The child was asleep, and in the near future, so the dingoes. Although the whole camp looks for a child, she did not find. In conclusion, it is dead and that Dingo disappeared with her beloved child, eunuchs struggle to accept God's decision and move on with their lives. But, unfortunately, the story gets a sensational coverage in the media, and soon rumors tale that Linda had killed the child. She subsequently arrested and put on trial. How could this happen? This is a great picture of real events, it shows how the "lynching" is not a figment of the imagination. The whole country turns against eunuchs, partly because they are seen as strange. Streep gives her best performance ever in Lindy complex, whose own volitional behavior works against it every step of the way. Neill, also does an excellent job as the vibrational and mixed by Michael. Throw one of the largest ever, with the image of people across the country, getting them to dig in when Lindy. Costumes, scenery, script, direction and production are all top of the line. If you've never seen or heard about this film, means that once. It is not far from reality, to say that it's "Scream" to be visible to anyone who cares about the film and about the abuse of power in the media.
