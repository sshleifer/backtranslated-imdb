I enjoyed this movie, and after watching it made me wonder how many "Caitlin Rose" world.How exist in many other girls have been subjected to this kind of sexual violence and suffering on the part of classmates and were too afraid to open your mouth about it? Just as threatening and violent teens can be to each other, because, as is shown by this film, who is right, not in the first place is important, who it is popular, and feared that manipulates the minds of young people and influence them to this kind of immorality happen .Tiffani Amber Tissno provides high performance as a rape victim, and Brian Austin Green persuasive guy torn between the woman he thought he loved, and his best friend.This is its native film, which does not receives its exposure deserves.Remar kable, and shiny, too good to be a film made for television.
