Hi I am from Taft California and I love this movie, because it shows how we are small town people love our sport football thing in Taft and this film shows how important I personally think that they should take another, but instead, actors to use our children to play games well show you our commitment, we beat Bakersfield each game during the last 6 years and since then I have a senior next year, it's my last chance, and then his college we have been working back to lead the state and I'm there if you want tse, to let me know that I am Kyle Taylor and I have an average of seven to eight yards of carry and is about five times the game is bad rip 75 or so yards to run so check us out at our website and go to our sports pages goodbye
