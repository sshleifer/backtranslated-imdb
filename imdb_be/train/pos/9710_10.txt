This is what makes me proud to be British. This is definitely the funniest on television. The League consists of Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Gatiss and excellent Reece Shearsmith. Completely underrated, this horror-comedy perfection. Symbols and iconic catchphrases strange, "Hi Dave". It's a comedy that everyone just has to look at. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the league of gentlemen in that it is always fresh, and always pushing the limits. It is not necessary to hope for little words (as opposed to a small UK), that it was funny. the fact that the league would kill perhaps their most famous and iconic character, shows us that they have balls of steel.
