MEN OF HONOR features Cuba Gooding Jr., that is probably his best result to date. He plays Brashear, one tower of courage and heroism. He was dirt poor farmer from the south, who wants to be a divergence of the Navy, but has a problem because of his race. Head diving school, played by Robert De Niro, a racist redneck who nonetheless growing Brashear respect. The film is about how Brashear must coincide with the almost insurmountable odds, not once, but twice. Performances that makes this film special. Gooding large and DeNiro, best actor in the history of cinema, giving rise to its characteristics of its best dramatic work in recent years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance as a young wife De Niro. The film rests on patriotism is too strong (though not anywhere near the level it was in the PATRIOT), and some of the characters is only one dimensional bad (Hal Holbrook Mr. Dad just evil), but the film is a rarity among the films today. This uplifting and uncynical. Great movie.
