This 1991 NBC-TV movie aired six months before the version with a larger screen by John Goodman in the life of Babe Ruth came. For my money, there is no comparison between them. Teleproduction is not perfect, but it represents a small history with greater depth and complexity than telling dimensional Goodman. I especially liked the image of the film about complicated love-hate relationship with Ruth Yankee manager Miller Huggins, who has always understood the brilliance of his star players, as well as continued to try to show why their own character flaws Ruth never would allow him to become a manager or supervisor players. Television film rightly observes Ruth never realized his dream Yankees management because of its deficiencies, while a terrible version of Goodman tries to push the lie that Ruth was denied, what should be his for the taking. <br /> <br /> This movie makes a great companion piece to "eight men Out», as the story begins with the arrival of Ruth in New York City in 1920, one year after the Black Sox Scandal and if his home run feats literally saved from ruin baseball. Indeed, the continuity between the two films even accented John Anderson reprising his "Eight Men Out» the role of Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
