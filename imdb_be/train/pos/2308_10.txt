I checked it out as an impulse when viewing through movie store and could not have been more pleasantly surprised! My mom and I watched this movie together and we really enjoyed it. This is not a typical "chick flick" with a juicy story of love and tears all the way to the end, but it certainly affects the nerves in the turn at the end. This is the end, where, despite the sudden and tragic, the overall effect of the film is not affected by it. I think Reese Witherspoon was even a great actress in this film, her debut, and it is definitely worth a look! I did not recognize many supporting actors, but they all play an important supporting role well. "Man on the Moon" is such a plausible story of a young teenager in love for the first time. Most women can definitely applies to everything: from the words Witherspoon, her thin looks and its not-so-subtle emotions (rage like a typical woman). Despite the fact that she plays the character confused about love, it does not come across as stupid and immature, which is highly appreciated by considering a lot of movies today.
