Star Rating: ***** The Works **** *** This just misses Little Bit In Between ** lag behind the pits * <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) peacefully making his way in the Wild West when he sees a group of people mistreating a lady. As a gentleman, it naturally moves in and puts an end to this, and thus kills son unpleasant enforcer. This is just the beginning of all the instruments before the end of the fierce battle, from which there is only one winner. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star who never really managed to take with me. Maybe I found it too late, and after another film that I saw him in her last Monday, The Human Shield, it was just another additional (haha) added to the list. But I have something for Westerns as movies that just sort of transported me to a different time and place and provide real escapist entertainment and these Dudikoff chose one of his best scripting, as his films are, in any case. <br /> <br /> the film hits a few low points in the form of a central villain mosey, sounds like an empty Marlon Brando and some even ropey performances from some of the actors, along with the obligatory cheap-looking sets. But if for some strange reason, your life never depended on movie Dudikoff, it will be one of your best options. ***
