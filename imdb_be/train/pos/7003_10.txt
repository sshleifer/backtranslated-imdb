The emotional impact of this film defies words. This elegant, slim, beautiful, and tragic all rolled into two hours. It Will Smith as he matures in his acting skills, a full range of it. Who knew? I have seen the pursuit of happiness and thought that it must be an accident for a blockbuster, over-the-top actor Smith. His performances in both films depict a very different dimension Smith, specification talent, the selectivity of the script, I'm not sure, but I see it differently. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy the essence you have to suspend belief. Even without seeing the story, look after the fragile state of the human heart, both literally and figuratively. This is the story of human guilt, redemption, love and sacrifice.
