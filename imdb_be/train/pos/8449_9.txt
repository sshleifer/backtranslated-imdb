I became a fan of the television series `Homicide: Life on the Street" show late in the term, but became a fan very quickly. It was a cop show unlike any other: a visually differs in its use of hand-held cameras, taking the audience all over the world, with its multi-ethnic and mutiracial actors and their varying and exciting people, and that it encompasses all the good and bad police department, including corruption and the collision face, bubble to the surface. <br /> <br /> Homicide: The Movie, the reunification of the follow-up series, as well as made-for-TV movie can be. After Lt. Giardello (Jafet Kotto), is now a candidate for the post of mayor of Baltimore, withdrawn, series actors have returned to help find the killer. In addition, the actors who left the forces, and those who have died, too, fails to take place in the film. Intensity and fire that marked the return of the series, and the script bristles with the same fire that noted a number. . All in all, a terrific TV movie <br /> <br /> The number of votes: 9
