I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier is a great fan fiction film series, and I can not wait to see more, I just started watching this film series last week, and I just can not get enough. I have already recommended it too other people to see, as it is well worth a look. I've watched every episode several times and wait to see all the episodes will be released. I appreciated it at ten, but I think he deserves a 12 to lie My compliments to the staff Star Trek Hidden Frontiers on an excellent job. If you like Star Trek, I highly recommend checking this Star Trek fan fiction film. Details related to this series of films is especially ships and planets that are used in it
