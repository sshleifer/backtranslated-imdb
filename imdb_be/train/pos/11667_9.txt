The Secret of Kells is a film that I have been waiting for years after saw some early footage at Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I am here to tell you now it's worth the wait. These highly stylized cartoons, but not irritating, since I was afraid. The entire film is a thing of beauty and a lot of imagination, I especially love animated illuminated book in which small figures come to life on the page. Feature beautiful, I love the voice of Brendan Gleeson as fodder Abbott and I particularly liked the voice sprite Aisling. Forest triumph of such a beautiful place. The story is well implemented, a combination of fact and fancy. and really draws the viewer in to cheer on Brendan in his search for the ideal material for a book. I am a lover of calligraphy and illumination in any case, so that the subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know who have seen it and are not supporters of the ship agree that this is a great little movie. I will definitely buy a DVD, when it comes out, and I would like to say well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people who are involved in this gigantic project. Let there be many more. :) Coming back here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD, as soon as he could, and gave them for Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the luck in the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see the candidate.
