If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we will all remember. But even I was only 4 when he left. If you have not seen for rent Doctor Dolittle, Showtime, I Spy, Pluto Nash and family comedy films of all Eddie - then look at it. Hands down, you will laugh 90% of the time. The remaining 10% you will wipe the tears from your eyes. <br /> <br /> This is really need to watch more than once to understand all the jokes. With crude humor jokes for kids (if you have seen it, you'll laugh here) - you will love his stuff. If you can not (or a big fan) trying to download clips from Eddie acts. Allot a different show, as you would imagine, and he has even more funny jokes. <br /> <br /> But this "best of" Eddie Murphy Â«X-rating", if you will. <, Br /> <br /> And all I can say is, please do not look Delirious, if you do not like comedy, has no sense of humor or fun to hang out with. You just put down this great classic Eddie Murphy and possibly make someone release it. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie was from Beverly Hills and was known from IT- Delirious it.
