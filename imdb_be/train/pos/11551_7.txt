The odd couple (3+ lost its 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I always feel that Klagmen and Tony Randall is final «Odd Couple». Their incredible work on the series from the early to mid-70s was HighWater sign for television at the time ... easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale. However, how can you go wrong with a pairing of Jack Lemmon / Matthau? Matthau is in particularly good shape, as the Oscar in the slush. Lemmon takes a little getting used to, like Felix, especially if you've seen the excellent performance by Tony Randall. a good script ... Neil Simon's definitely better. (I'll go on record here as that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, most overrated playwrights American theater.) The plot is simple: Felix, a neat freak, and again separated from his wife moves to Oscar, slush, who has needs help saving money on maintenance. Their living arrangements becomes the same as a marriage, and that resulted in some amusing quarrels and spats. Lots of fun and some great one-liners.
