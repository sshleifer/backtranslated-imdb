For real people movie, this film is a must, as it works as a perfect little allegory films themselves. Science Janos Movement / Boris Karloff is dealing with the capture and projection of light from the cosmic phenomena. This light can be harmful, or it can be used to do good. On the one hand, it blinds his mother, on the other hand, is used to treat blindness ( "I can see!" Shouts a young girl in front of which is projected that world). If Motion / Karloff is poisoned by the supernatural power of this light, we can see that it actually emit a ghostly glow on his face and hands as badly developed negative, paying attention to the fact that the person we see is the projection of the object viewed on the film (only visible as a movie theater, when the lights are off). <br /> <br /> There is a great passage closer to the top, where Karloff / Movement explains his research as to be informed of the fact that everything that happens is captured in the light of that rolls through space for millions of years, since the light from Andromeda emitted from this galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock. <br /> <br /> There are places in the film, when this new science is opposed to the old cultural cars: the writer, in the person of Bela Bondy / Arabella Stevens; and religion, emblemized in sculptural figures in local explosions Cathedral Karloff with his projector / beam gun. <br /> <br /> It is necessary here to be surprised if this film had to look at what was happening in Germany at the time, and especially when using Riefenstall about movie of the year before to promote a regime that surely will go on do a lot of harm: Triumph of the will. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in the end, the mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes, reminding Janos movement of the first rules of science. <br /> <br /> If only more films made you want to become in the theater and shout: "I see"
