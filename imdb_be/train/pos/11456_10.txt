Andy Goldsworthy is daosskim first-order master, by expressing his sublime through ephemeral art. Indeed, time and change what his job is mostly about. I bought my first book a few years ago, and my family marveled many times. So it was a pleasure to meet the artist in person through this film, he is just as patient and gentle, as you might expect, and has some amazing things to say about the natural world, the deepest of which is manifested in his occasional inability to say in words at all. He, like most of the children who play alone outdoors (if they make more), creating things out of sticks and sand, mud and snow, before they outgrow it. Mr. Goldsworthy was given a gift and a mission to extend this kind of game, to create a deep vision of nature and open our eyes to the often tired in this brilliant new ways. And always with great respect, gratitude and humor and fun wandering monk.
