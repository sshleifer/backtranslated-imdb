I was blown away by re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears on more than one occasion. Seasoned science fiction fan, I like to think that I can choose the good stuff from the BSA, and it was good stuff. <br /> <br /> So, when I first heard about the prospect of a prequel series a few months ago, I received a painful feeling in my gut. I was afraid that the formula that has made so successful Battlestar be reused in Caprica, which will not work at all. The history of the BSG, in a sad ragged group of survivors trapped aboard starships goes out and guided by the prophetic vision and sequence of pseudo-miracles, perfectly complement the unusual music and best actor actors. <br /> <br /> Caprica feels differently. Where BSG occurs after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica reflects that the civilization it is cold and decadent prosperity. In general vibe I got from Caprica was like Minority Report, minus the excessive and counterproductive histrionics. In this form of the BSG, Caprica has in its first few hours of programming has already dealt with issues of religious freedom, racism, morality plays God and the nature of the human soul. <br /> <br /> Casting for Caprica is also excellent. Each character is unique and deeply, the obsessive and distant scientist who became an entrepreneur to his restless and willful daughter, every actor and actress throws himself in his roles. <br /> <br /> The music that was used so powerfully in the BSG, also plays an important role in Caprica. powerful rolling drums in the Battlestar and sad duduks served this topic very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the show is their own feeling is very different from any of his predecessors. <br /> <br /> New Caprica, of course, is his own show, up from Battlestar franchise only as much as necessary. I look forward to a complete series.
