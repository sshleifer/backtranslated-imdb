If you are under 13 or above 13, and quite intoxicated, you will enjoy the D-War. If you are seriously devoted fan of all kinds of mindless militants, you will enjoy the D-War. Otherwise, do not worry! I saw a film today with my nephews and 3 of his friends. They really loved it and it made me feel good. After the film was finished, all the children (my nephews and their friends) could not stop thanking me for their theater. <br /> <br /> TT good. Acting and directing appalling. The plot is extremely simple. However, since half of the audience were children, they were shouting, screaming and cheering every time the dragons have appeared on the screen. This made the viewing experience much more exciting than it should have been. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to take your children, but also for the final battle sequence, except, D-War disappointing. I give this film 7 of 10 mainly because the kids love it so much.
