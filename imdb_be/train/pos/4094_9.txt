For those who only saw the beautiful Disney Productions animated version of «Beauty & The Beast», or even surreal vision of Jean Cocteau's tale will be very puzzled by this one thousand nine hundred seventy-five French (but with a director from Poland) version. The site belongs to the French family of fading aristocracy, who marries into a well to do English family. The main catch is that the groom is an ancient curse on the family. The film also includes a plurality of sequences retrospective (potentially) that explain a family curse. With the opening credits to the end, it's almost non-stop erotic fun house ride, with a very clear and graphic sexual content (consequently, X rated film in the US in this initial start-up, which is currently unrated). somewhat contemptuous sense of the film in the leadership class, probably to remind one of the flights Buñuel on similar territory. If you have a taste for the truly surprising, and not offended by the "taboo" stuff, then this film might just scratch that itch for you.
