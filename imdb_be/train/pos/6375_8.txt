While I have great respect for Disney's animated films, as in the last time they really did not have what I would call a "must see". Atlantis looked intriguing with the first poster of the film and trailer, and luckily my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is more "mature" Disney film in the sense that he did not have enough songs (very unusual feature for a Disney movie for sure), and focuses more on action and discoveries than any other recent Disney suggestions. World Atlantis, hidden under the Earth's core, is fantastic, presented as a desert cavern to the ruins, and then slowly turns into a real ecosystem, which, while generally contain a reminder of the violence, are becoming more and more intriguing, while he tropical paradise is not reached. Presentation of Atlantis just landscape and setting, without any long joyful songs, gave the kingdom is much more beautiful and intriguing appearance. Enabling Atlantean language and attempt to connect it to the real-life mythology of ancient civilizations add to it, and works quite well. <br /> <br /> In addition, except for some scenes related to the moles of jokes did not seem to be a lot of "child" item that I usually associated with Disney films. Instead, the main elements were a struggle to get to Atlantis, and the continual discovery, which happened in Atlantis, and Maile outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place, helping Atlanta to discover part of their own history, they did not know . Part of that includes Atlantis "weapon", which is used in a very action-packed climax, which, for lack of a better word, is quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, not all stories makes complete sense, and the film does not show any strange new computer-generated visual effects, but, apart from films Toy Story, is the most interesting Disney movie I've seen in recent years.
