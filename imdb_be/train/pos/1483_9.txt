Sophisticated modern fable about the stresses that are working to weaken and eventually decouple the promise of marriage. The main thrust of the story comes from "preaching", which is spoken in the country following a priest wedding vows cosmopolitan young couple from Milan. In it, as a course of marriage stipulates that bit by bit is ground from the stresses of modern life. "Moral" of the story in history is that for a marriage to work, both now and in the past, it was necessary for this relationship should be joined family and friends. This film was a relative of the domestic blockbuster Italian standards. This is a terrible shame that this movie is not available in either DVD or VHS.
