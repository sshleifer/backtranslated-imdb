Rock Star: INXS was the best music of the TV series I've ever watched! These were some of the greatest rock and roll songs ever written performed by 15 talented singers / performers. It was also (in my opinion) the most cordial, well-being, surprise endings in all reality shows. It actually made me shed tears of joy for the winner !!! For 13 weeks of the television competition, viewership had met and become familiar with all the contestants. After 30-some episodes of the other participants is more like one than just a few more unfamiliar competing against each other on a reality show. And the fact that INXS was, and still is one of the greatest rock and roll bands EVER just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series. If you do not have a recorded series, Rock Star: INXS DVD-excellent alternative.
