Una Giornata particolare film that made brilliant use of closed spaces.It these stupid, empty spaces that the public sees the emotional turmoil and noisy bursts of Scola's two leading characters.Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren played by two frustrated people decided to get together for a few brief moments of their sluggish lives.It is an element of sadness associated with a story that makes us think that people will take sides with characters close to them.All people really sorry character.A Sophia Loren women undoubtedly call their hearts on ekzi stentsyyalnyh plight.Disguised sexy Marcello Mastroianni are also one of the key issues of this grim, piercing film.Most characters grapple issues related to their own sexualities.Una Giornata particolare can not be called as a gay film, although it was well illustrated that homosexual leader mixes well with women.This film, for which the Italian director Scola built a pretty good mix of fact and fiction.His idea is to show how Hitler's rise has changed the fate of the ordinary Italian folks.A brave words about Personnage played pysh on the big Marcello Mastroianni.He acts as a real human being, not to beg pity.He happily accepts his destiny and prepares herself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life.A this masterpiece of a movie !!!
