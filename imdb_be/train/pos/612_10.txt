This remarkable film can be summed up very easily. First of all, while the comparison with "The Princess Bride" is inevitable, it is almost useless to do. While adult movies combine wit and humor fairy tale background, "Stardust" is so very different from any other fantasy / sci-fi movie that I've ever seen. This is a hybrid of genres, but his story and script are so unique that - along with performances, special effects, cinematography, and score - the finished product just is not all that is comparable with anything that ever appeared on the silver screen . Secondly, the assessment is very effective at the same time pulls us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushes the story forward, creating just the right amount of fear and anxiety, you need to make magic believable within the area where there are characters. Third, I did not find the film even remotely difficult or confusing to follow in any case. In fact, an interesting interaction between the three main plot actually made it even that much more attractive to look at. Strange cast and superbly acted across the board. This is a fantastic adventure (from the sci-fi elements) was one of the best I've seen since "The Return of the King" (not that I compare the two at all). Okay, so it's not so easy to summarize, but do not let the wet and / or cold-hearted and cynical review nor pathetic PR film to prevent you participate in the fastest time, you could be in a movie this summer (or even, perhaps, for a long time) !
