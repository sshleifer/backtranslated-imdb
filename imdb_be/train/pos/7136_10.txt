I saw the movie before I read the book Michelle Magorian and I enjoyed both of them. The film is more than a book, made me closer to tears several times. This film touches the deepest point of the human soul, and never let go. I encourage as many people to see this masterpiece, as much and as quickly as possible. I give it ten stars.
