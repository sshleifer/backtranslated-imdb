I first saw this movie when I was flipping through the movie channels on my parents DirecTV. It was on the Sundance Channel, and was just beginning. I love music, especially in the late '60s, and it's something that sounds like the BJM (The Dandys in order). All of the Brian Jonestown Massacre has intrigued me from the music, Anton and persons Joel, to illegal drug use. It was interesting, because, as I watched the first party scene, when everyone is doing the line, my parents walked by and decided to look (look on their faces were priceless). In any case, this is definitely one of my favorite films, because he introduced me to Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is now my favorite band of all time. <br /> <br /> just watch ... seriously
