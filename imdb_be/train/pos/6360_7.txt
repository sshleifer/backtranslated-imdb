I just read the lead commentary for this film, which is on the first page of the results of the vote cast and run down. <br /> <br /> Why is it that some people can not take the film for what it should be. <br /> <br /> This film must be light-hearted, Tonge on the cheek, family comedy, things to make children laugh and things for adults, and that is exactly what makes this film. <, Br /> <br /> I have laughed off the nuts in this movie, I thought that Kerry put in a great performance and the whole movie (if looking at Christmas) really give you a bit of holiday cheer <br /> <br /> So for all you movie reviewers do not try to look like a student film and knock each film, because it is not "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" and take the films for what they should be fun !!
