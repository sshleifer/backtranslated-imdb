This is a great film - especially in comparison with the time tedious seriousness of today's politically-minded filmmakers. The film, which is so easy to combine sex, gender relations, politics and art is a rarity these days. While bouyant optimism of the 1960s can not be restored, I think we can at least learn from the fresh film and glamor of energy. I do not know that those who called the film "boring" looked - there is so much packed into it that it never stays the same film for more that 15 minutes, at the time.
