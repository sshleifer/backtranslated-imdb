I joined the IMDb, to let people know that this is a great movie! It's not often you come across a film that moves and visually cinematic still modest. Did you read the story because all I want to say, do not look, because you want to see the clash of cultural religious chatter identity, because it is a typical misconception people read, and instead simply to appreciate and understand that this is about a father and son flight grows to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and give it to Film4 get round to it. It was one of the few films that are designed to be independent BAFTA and foreign. The beauty of this is that it manages to appeal to anyone, even if you never see anything subtitle or just used to the formula of Hollywood, just a great story that will keep you engaged. The only thing I want is to be more and see what happens
