If you want to see something for "his" and "her" so as to then say that it is a film to be selected. I am a lover of rum com, but my husband is not always so much (that guy !!!). Anyway, I managed to make him look, because I told him about the sport, and you know that he loved it !!! <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore very funny and her leading man (sorry, but it can "remember his name) is just as good. When I watched the movie, it was named «The Perfect Match», but I think the name was changed to the United Kingdom, since it is based on the book Fever Pitch, and there has already been a film made about football with the same name (the same film but the British version - phew), <br /> <br /> in any case all the reviews on here will tell you more details if you need them to buy the girl, take me to get hubby / boyfriend front of the TV on Saturday night, and you Both laugh and cry together. A real jewel.
