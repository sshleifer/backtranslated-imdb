This 1947 movie stars and was written and Orson Welles (with funky Irish accent), as well as a beautiful star Rita Hayworth with less attractive short blond hair. So I hung out with Orson first touch of evil and Citizen Kane and The Third Man, etc., but it was my first interaction Rita Hayworth. Our first meeting went well, it does a fine job playing scared / evasive Elsa is married to a millionaire lawyer mutilated. Mike (Wells) and Elsa fall in love with each other. He wants to run away with her, she does not know whether she will be able to live without the things money can buy. Elsa, her husband and his partner argue and bite, as well as Mike describes shark attacking a friend and his prediction proved too accurate. Followed by a few turns in this murder mystery, we came to a climax in a fun house. (Recall ending shooting in man with the golden gun which borrowed heavily from this stage). I was not sure who the killer was not until the end. <br /> <br /> This film, like shrimp garlic and lemon. Cup heart of the sea, the thin, sour and tart, all to great effect. It could not be better, fresh shrimp, but the good quality of frozen shrimp from Costco. Fragrant sauce adds a natural pink shrimp, as you fill up on healthy, but filling alternative to the more mundane, the overall rate. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
