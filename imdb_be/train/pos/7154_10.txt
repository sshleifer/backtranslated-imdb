I found a "hole" movie, to hear from people that were not characteristic of Disney, that both children and adults, both fall into the story. Guys, let me tell you that I was not disappointed. "Hole" is based on the novel Seyker and stands Stanley Yelnats adventure, a boy who goes to an amazing Juvenile camps in the desert. He befriends the boy, nicknamed Zero, and together they set off on an adventure that will change their lives. It was a very interesting, unique, different and funny story. I did not know what to expect when I watched it. it was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of the puzzle. The guys who played on juvenile offenders were all very funny and Jon Voight was just hilarious as g- n sir. Now, when I saw the film, I have read the book. Most recommended!
