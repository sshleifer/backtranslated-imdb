Off the blocks, let me say that I am a huge fan of zombies, so I do not make statements like the above slightly. Secondly, let me say that this is an Italian zombie movie and Fulci directed only 15 minutes before his transfer Bruno (Rat, Night Of Terror) Mattei. This is not the dawn of the dead people. <br /> <br /> It is said that this is easily one of the most exciting zombie movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> scenario strangely awful. Just check the two scientists are trying to find an antidote ( "Let's try to put these two molecules together"). <br /> <br /> Zombies come in different varieties. From groaned shufflers, to machete wielding maniac, birds! <br /> <br /> gore galore. Bitten off legs, hands amputated, stomachs open. <br /> <br /> The pace quickly, flying from one to the next zombie attack. <br /> <br /> Then there's the head in the refrigerator. About his head in the fridge! One of the greatest moments in horror as Ash got his hand get in Evil Dead 2. <br /> <br /> You need to know, so you're the kind of person who is going to like this kind of film. Get a few friends and a beer, and you'll be in for a fun night. <br /> <br /> I have a head in the fridge?!?!?
