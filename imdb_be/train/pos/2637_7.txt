This is a film directly to video, so it should go without saying that he is not going to compete with the first Lion King, but said it was just the same well. <br /> <br /> My kids love it, but it's a fact, they love anything that is a cartoon. Big shock was that * I * also liked, it was laugh out loud funny in some parts (even fart jokes *), there were many, and creative tie with the first film, and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand (but not as risky as in Shrek [ "do you think that it compensates for something?"]). <br /> <br /> Special note on fart jokes, I was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noise (in fact, were not hardly any noise / imagery in general, references are actually quite thin) they actually had setup / punchline / etc, and were almost in good taste. I would like my children to think that there is more humor than to go to the bathroom, and this film is good in this respect. <br /> <br /> Hmm, what else? The music was so-so, not as creative, as in the first or second film, but a lot of fun for children. No pain banal moments, which was a blessing for me. A bit of action, but nothing too terrible (The Secret of NIMH gave my children nightmares, not sure what rating G was suitable for that one ...) <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that this is a great film for children any age, one that is 100% safe to allow them to watch (I try not to be too sensitive, but I had to get up and turn off the TV for a couple of movies that were less clear appropriate than expected) - but you are safe to leave the room during this. I'd say stick around anyway, though, you may find that you like it too :)
