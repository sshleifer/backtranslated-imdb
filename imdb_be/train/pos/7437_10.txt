Recently, a friend and I were discussing the educational and ethical influence, when we were growing up in the 1950s compared to today. She said Coleridge, who in 1798 wrote The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner. Both of us were required to read part of the epic poem in high school and on courses of English literature in college. My friend said: "His message could even be called metaphysical in the context of today.Â» <br /> <br /> We have tried pronouncing it and remembered only bits and pieces. (I have a problem remembering Dr. Seuss.) I said I'd like to get two copies of the poem, so that everyone can read it. That was easy enough, but I was very surprised to find that it was made into a film. We looked forward to watching the movie to see how it was interpreted. In the end, Rime of the Ancient Mariner is not exactly light reading. After each read a poem, we watched a movie together. <br /> <br /> We have considered the film an outstanding achievement, especially given the fact that it was done in the 1970s, to computers, to the so-called "Ken Burns effect," and before special effects too often become a compensation for the lack of substance . Particular attention should be 19 and 20 century illustrations taken from 'less well-known artists, such as "Willy rotten, early Hollywood designer. <br /> <br /> The film is narrated by Sir Michael Redgrave, who teaches the poem when he was a teacher, adding tons credibility and confidence in remaining true poetry. <br /> <br /> His skill in thin layers of messages are conveyed without "instruction" or become oppressive and obvious morality tale. We have found that such a refreshing change from today's "in your face "and" clobber them over the head "mentality. B lshasts today's moral messages in the film are two-dimensional: extreme violence, murder and mayhem say bad bad really, really bad and good superhero It's as if the human character lacking any nuance Rime... ancient Mariner holiday personality, character, out of gratitude for the celebration of the richness of life has to offer, in the broader context of humanity, that is a person's ability to give to others. <br /> <br /> proud of myself for having found this "unknown" gem, we then found out that he won the highest award in its category from five to six times in the "name" of international film festivals. Another surprise recognized the film's director Raul DaSilva, is a recognized authority in the beginning of the animation, and the author of six books on film awards. <br /> <br /> message of this film as relevant today, if not more, than when Coleridge wrote an original poem, and if Raul DaSilva translated it into a film. If I was still teaching in secondary w ole, which I did for five years, I would grab it and show it to all my students. In the same level of wealth here, which naturally leads to a discussion about big and important issues, all of us face, whether it be in 1798 1978, or today -. In fact, as long as mankind has a spiritual component <br /> <br /> is highly recommended.
