Four teenage girls in the suburbs of Los Angeles come in a wide variety of problems: parties, drugs, cops caught by parents, older guys. Jodie Foster, a view of the hen flocks, trying to keep it all together as a "family" (as the family unit, she never had), and heartbreaking thing about the film is that it can not. Slowly, everything grows and leaves. That the exact point of the story, though emphasized everywhere, unfortunately, fake. Do we really need a long sequence of Scott Baio outracing car full of thugs on a skateboard? Or more sequence - also from Bayo - where Foster has an amazing monologue about "the illusion of pain." Some of the dialogue is in fact a completely insane, and I did not much care for editing at the end of the film, which flows awkwardly from death for the wedding. But it nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of tight coupling. And Jody's face in the final speaks volumes. When the audience really get suffocated in the end, the film earned it. He does not condone or request tears of sympathy. This shows us an example of friendship and hope we understand. *** from ****
