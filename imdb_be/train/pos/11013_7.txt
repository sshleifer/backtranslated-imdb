There were many movies made in Hollywood during the war, which were designed to build support for our troops by the public. Seen today, some may dismiss them or just see them as propaganda - they are technically, but the positive kind, and is intended to unite the nation. This film is quite effective and interesting example of the genre - with a fairly realistic scenario and good production values. Pat O'Brien plays pretty much the same character that he played in many other films (you know, cruel to say, difficult to manage, but the "swell guy"). Randolph Scott, as always, competent and entertaining, and other additional services well (note the young Robert Ryan as one of the scorers in the training). Although the story is reminiscent of several other films about our pilots and crew, the film processed well enough to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. That it, with the possible exception of the end - where the film is a little over-the-top, but also very nice. About the only serious drawback, and it is mainly for nitpickers, is that some of the footage a few sloppy integrated into the film and "nuts" as I, who are both teachers of history and aircraft enthusiasts may have noticed it - all others probably will not notice.
