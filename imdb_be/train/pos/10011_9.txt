I enjoyed The Night Listener very much. This is one of the best films of the summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, all the actors are very good. All played just the right note for their characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds great comic touch. Toni Collette is not big, my mother, and never comes from the top. All very plausible. <br /> <br /> This is a short film, a little less than one and a half hours. I noticed that the general release version of nine minutes shorter than the version of the Sundance. I wonder if some of the most disturbing images were cut from the film. <br /> <br /> The director told the story, and do it right way, which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think that their job is to impress the audience, rather than tell a story and to tell it well. <br /> <br /> not be sucker punched previews and ads. This is not a Hitchcockian thriller. See The Night Listener, because you want to see a good story well. If you go expecting Hitchcock you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the film was the ending. The director could have left a little more than a fantasy of viewers, but it's a minor quibble.
