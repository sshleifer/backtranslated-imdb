Call me a teenager, but I really think it's a great series. If you have not had a chance to experience several episodes of the last Star Trek series, you should definitely watch this. Perhaps more convincing than watchman Voyager, which was launched in a series of cop. Zheynuey, Archer adventure are quite different, but surprisingly familiar ... catchy music too. No true Sci-fan can go without seeing at least one episode of Star Trek - and these installments make the wait worth it.
