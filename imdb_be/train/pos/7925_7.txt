Stupid the film is really, really funny. Yes, it does have its moments of the dead, it can be a bit too obvious, it decreased slightly in the second half, and the story incoherent mess, but it's laugh out loud funny all the way. And it's worth a look just for Ed McMahon as the right wing of the cookies. This film is in the same class as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, another incredibly funny, underrated film.
