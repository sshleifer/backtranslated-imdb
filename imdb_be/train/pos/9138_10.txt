I have this movie and watched it several times over the years since it was released. Prince entirely overwhelm us with their phenomenal style of acting or anything, he's a musician, and I feel that this is what he showed here, it is simply the best to tell the story through the influence. Much of the film is simple and teenish, but it is the fault of the director / writers, yet this is a great film with an even better music. Principles and moral beliefs in Purple Rain is strong enough and if more films will be based on the principles we were taught as young children, we would be better all around the environment, seeing that art reflects life, which reflects the art.
