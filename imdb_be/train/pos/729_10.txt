I seriously love this movie so I never get tired of watching. The only line that I really can not digest this, if a riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy, but other than that, everything else is fine. I've never been a fan of PJ Soles and it did not help to hear that she did not even know who Ramones were as she was filming this movie, but I can ignore her snarly face for the most part. Most of the people who watch it again and again appear supporters Ramones and really .. it's the only reason why I love it so much. I never get tired of seeing Didi mess his pizza line or Joey entangled teacher's name over and over again, ha ha. One of the best parts of the film, seeing how they sing, you want to dance down the halls of the high school .. I love it. The special edition DVD has a good retrospective strange PJ Soles is not on it. Maybe she was working on another project * laughs * Anyway, great film, even better, if you're a fan of the Ramones.
