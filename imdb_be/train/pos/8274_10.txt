This film perfectly. I found it very interesting. I thought that the legend of the Wendigo was pretty cool. Action was also great, as well as costumes, production, photography, directing and script. <br /> <br /> A very happy family on vacation gets stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer. Huntsman then there is very angry and outraged by the fact that one of the deer antlers broken. Then he begins to pursue family and strange things begin to happen to them. <br /> <br /> See this movie. It's worth it. Kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. Two thumbs Way Up!
