Unfortunately for myself - I came to the show late in this lifetime. I only caught a few episodes (about three), before it was canceled by ABC. I loved the characters and the storyline - but most of all great actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two personages, I learned (Moynahan was and the nature of "Todd" was "Jared Smith") and Jay Hernandez (from Carlito Way: Rise to Power) and Erika Christensen (Swimfan). I enjoy watching the young actors are granted, and felt like this show will advance your career further. I hope that it at least gets put back on DVD, and possibly SAT pick it up for a second season ever? At the same time, I view it on the ABC website, from the very beginning.
