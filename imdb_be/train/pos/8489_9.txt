I'm teaching the Japanese language for the online high school, and I include cultural activities, so that students can learn about the country and language. And watch «Gung Ho» is one of the requirements. Students can either buy or rent a movie. Stereotypes or not, it helps students to see what other people look at the world and life differently than we do. Many of my students told me that they enjoyed the film so much that they're going to get a copy for yourself. It's really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture. I just wish I could get polished TV version. I'm actually not in the crude language of oscillation workers use all the time.
