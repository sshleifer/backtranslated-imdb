Sandra Bernhard without you I am nothing, the film was released in 1990, followed on the heels of its production in 1988 off-Broadway stage ... that she and the other referred to in the film as it "Hit one woman show. «<br /> <br /> have been some changes in the monologues and jokes, and the version of the film is visually re-vamp history, taking Sandra from fairy tale existence as a successful stage performers in New York, during what she calls her" a superstar in the summer " in an illusory, almost desperate existence still at his home in Los Angeles - her fictional manager in the film relate to it, how to get Sandra back "to their roots, to ... upscale supper clubs like Paris room" <br />. <br /> there's a point to be here. Sandra is trying to appeal her liberal outlook and it is sometimes sharp criticism of American pop culture to an audience that is not totally see it. In the memos, she plays mostly black audience, trying to link your ideas, if all these people seem to want to eat «Shashonna," Madonna look-alike stripper. And even then, with Shashonna dancing to drum beats, reminiscent of those with "Like a Virgin", there is not much to be said to satisfy the viewers of the show. The scene at the club throughout the drying of the film than the bones. Funny scene to catch my chubby man in the audience helps Shashonna her pants. <br /> <br /> But if it goes down, Sandra to do it with style and power, transferring everything from dishonest trust to pierce vulnerability ... right to the point where she's naked (literally) begging for adoption and yet somehow still floating in a pool of her own transparent star. Her depictions of the interaction with these Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren, and (the fact that we lead to believe) Warren Beatty are fictitious and hilarious. <br /> <br /> Sandra begins her show at the most awkward moment, doing a quiet but mysterious rendition of Nina Simone's "Four Women", dressed in civilian clothes and other African clothes, singing lines such as "my skin is black" "my hair is shaggy," and "they call me Sweet Thing" <br /> <br /> it resurrects the ghosts of hell and marks of art in a very amusing description of the mad auction property for Andy Warhol. "Leave it to Andy to have wisdom and sensitivity in hours and hours of hard work and the work that went into Indian product ... that they were fortunate enough to capitalize on this whole Santa Fe, what's going on. " <br /> <br /> She explains redundancy Hollywood, consoling distraught friend, persuaded him, saying: "Sir, if we are talking about Ishtar, I get up right now and go on with your life forever, because it is too self-indulgent, even for me! "<br /> <br /> Sandra shows women waiting at the age of feminism. Dressed as Cosmo Girl, Sandra retells her young-girl fantasy to become executive secretary and marry her boss. She finally concludes in relief, "I'll never be the statistics, but I do not I am younger than 35 years, and I'm getting married.!» <br /> <br /> Sandra sings the discovery of sexuality in society: "When he touches you at night, he feels all in order, or it feels real I say it feels real ... MIGHTY real?. »<br /> <br /> and finally, she was crying progressive change aha American society by means of a drive greats Patrick Cole and Sylvester and declaring, "In the end, everything will be funky!» <br /> <br /> All this happens in the form of shiny, sweet, but excellent cabaret songs written and there was Billy Paul Burt Bacharach, Hank Williams and Laura Niro, to name a few at the same time, idealized, fictional incarnation Sandra -. it squitter mirror image - floats around the city, a beautiful black model with a smooth dress and tight bust reading Kabbalah, studying chemistry and listen to NWA rap <. br /> <br /> Without you, I am in anything, Sandra Bernhard explores the emotions and the existence of which, up to that time, she had only played as a regular guest on Late Night with David Letterman. Its almost child like enthusiasm for the shock, exhibited during the 80s, are cast aside in the face of an elegant appeal, and its confidence in the face of American materialism and celebrity proves refreshing. This approach to comedy would change the direction of Sandra forever and mark a more mature, more representative of ceremonies in the future. <br /> <br /> If you like subtle humor in turn point to the inside jokes about the glamor, celebrities, sex, loneliness, despair, and small expressions of love and kinship, this movie will keep you in stitches. It may not have meant to be funny across the board. Maybe it's a little disturbing, or even sentimental for some. But consider the void paint Sandra world for you, and you will realize how funny and brilliant, she really is. <br /> <br /> but to see without you I did with a friend "in the loop" because it's definitely funnier that way. Before you know it, you'll both be traded barbs Sandra and confusing the hell out of everyone else.
