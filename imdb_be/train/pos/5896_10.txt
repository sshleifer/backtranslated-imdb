Really big movie and profit. Dan Jansen greatest skater ever. Touching and beautiful film the entire family can enjoy. History of Jane Jansens fight cancer and Dan Jansen love for his sister. On a more important promise made by Jansen to win the gold medal to prove to his sister Jane was right to believe in his talent in skating it was justified. This painting is well worth the time. I wish they would do more of this quality films. Thank you for a great movie with great actors and a great history. This is a very touching story about a beautiful family support and faith for their children and a special dream for their youngest son and his sister.
