This film completely ran circles around the original Dolemite. It was everything that makes great..except movie for real actors. (Ernie Hudson could not do it alone, and you know that! LOL) I admit that I killed my first video cassette of the film, and I plan to buy the DVD version again as soon as possible! This film has so many catchy lines is pathetic! I am embarrassed to say that I know the song back and forth! I love the character of Jimmy Lynch to death, and he had to win the Best Actor in the remuneration of black actors, but Oscar was never ready for it! This is a random film of Curves cops, chest, chases, Bad Editing, and of course martial arts. (Given that it's the 70's, and I can tell, everyone knew that some kind of martial arts). I think this film is to be restored, and showed one night in the middle of a marathon in the local cinemas!
