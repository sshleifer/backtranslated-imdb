I can not understand why Jeremy Irons felt it necessary to show the most disconcerting accent, say through clenched teeth, and from the back of his throat. In fact, it's pretty messed up movie for me, and distracted from what was probably his fine performance (very annoying). No other actor or actress did not seem to have such a pronounced accent and while I always ranking Jeremy Irons as a fine actor, I would not class this film as one of his best. The film, however, has sparked my appetite, as well as some of the other comments made by the film again, which I found very interesting, and we intend to read the book today.
