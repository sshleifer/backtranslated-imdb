I just saw this movie at the preview and all I can say ... "What did I just watch ????" And I mean that in a good and bad way. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. Stiller and Black play a friend / neighbor. Stiller focused, hardworker while black dreamer. Black comes up with the idea to create a spray that washes urinate. The idea is becoming very popular, and black becomes very rich. Extravagant lifestyle that black incomes and the fact that he's still trying to be best friends with Stiller Stiller is to be mad with envy. <br /> <br /> As I said, the story is simple. Everything else is clearly odd. The direction is odd, with an amazing rotating opening shot is never accelerated sequence. Dialouge and the action is very strange; odd in a disjointed way. And the soundtrack is the most interesting thing in the film, a strange «Envy» song that keeps on appearing on the stage, where you think you're going to hear a classic 80-song, but suddenly it's in Japanese. <br /> <br /> Thus, the real question is ... odd funny? It solely depends on the person. I crack shear unwavering strangeness of the film. After watching, I've heard people call it terribly unfunny and glad that he was free. Oddly enough, I understood his point. There are no jokes at all, so if you did not connect the uniqueness of it all, you will hate this movie. Absolutely I hate it. <br /> <br /> This film is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and DVD become a cult classic. If you can laugh at the movie without any real jokes, as the Cable Guy, or punch Drunk Love, then I suggest you look. If you do not, to escape from this film. It will only make you crazy.
