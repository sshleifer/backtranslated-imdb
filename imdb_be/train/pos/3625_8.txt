Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths light up the screen with a lot of history and a cast that seemed very real to drag you into their lives. <br /> <br /> Laced dreams - dripping in fact, the American Dream again ignited after 9:11 with the true story of mid-life rookie Devil Ray, Jimmy Morris. Born Australian actress Rachel Griffiths plays a native of West Texas is better than a lot of Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was the perfection ?? cast as a wannabe, gonnabe and humble winner with the same psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience. It's real. Chemistry on-screen work. If you love baseball heart-warmer, you'll love this movie. Ingredients for apple pie and Americana were all there. My popcorn became ?? a la mode. <br /> <br /> And hey: buy the CD! Music rock and carries the story perfectly! Synchronization words and music pushes the story forward exactly as it should be, an area that disappoints me more often than <br /> <br /> The criticism :. I would give baseball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach us all about ?? nature "and heart. St. Rita and nuns were nice decoration, but they never found his place in history, to open and close around them. A little long. It is worth every minute in the long run. 8 / 10. <br /> <br />
