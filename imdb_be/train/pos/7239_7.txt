Precious stone that movie, so good that they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> The film starts very well with bad monster who eats a few people and the party, where the two main characters of the first set eyes on each other. <br /> <br /> Bendan Hughes plays the Vlad eccentric little guessed it, who is this character who moved to the city and enjoys the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a home. <br /> <br /> Damn, we've all seen movies about vampires we know the format. <br /> <br /> film watchable, but the performances of actors is very wooden and they seem like they do not want to be in this movie, but maybe that's just part of the decadent atmosphere. <br /> <br /> did not like the ending, but there is a sequel, you need to track him down. <, Br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I thought, Brendan Hughes does not really fit the role. Later, I could not stop thinking about it, he seemed to exude a terrible sensuality, so maybe he was right on the part of the <br /> <br /> BRENDAN Hughes was last seen. "Hitler - the rise of evil" and the lieutenant Guffman <br /> <br /> Where is he now.?
