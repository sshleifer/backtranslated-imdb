Let me just get to the bottom line here: I have 3 children aged between 5 and 10. I think a trip to the theater a success if there is no talking animals. I have seen the majority of children's videos in our collection of at least 72 times. I can tell you when the movie gets back in the Wizard of Oz, over 18 sexual joke in El Dorado and the tragic flaw in the end Rudolph Red-Nosed Reindeer. I could probably storyboard Nemo from memory alone. <br /> <br /> What makes me support my child each (it varies), which provides the name for a family movie night? One word. Showerman <br /> <br /> A minute of silence ... <br /> <br /> * Sigh *
