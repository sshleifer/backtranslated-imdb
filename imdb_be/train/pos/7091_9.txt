The big problem is where to start as the film needs your attention the next two hours, and you better not miss a few minutes to produce coke, because there is a danger you can not follow. But well there and pause button. Bruce Willis has to go to TimeMachine find some antivirus for the virus, which made the animals rule the world in 1996, thanks to some mistakes he first comes to an end in 1990, and then in the First World War and how messed up everything it can look like Terry Gilliam comes with that, what should be one of the smartest scripts ever. This man is an ex-Monty Phyton knows exactly how genius SF-story should be told, as well as his choice of actors could not be better, there is a crazy Brad Pitt (his performance in the shelter memorably) and the beautiful Bruce Willis, which proves that he is more than a Schwarzenegger-like. This is a film that you can watch over and over again, the script is so strange and difficult (and yet you can follow), that each kind gives you more surprises. One of my favorites.
