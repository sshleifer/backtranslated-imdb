Jim Carrey is good as usual, and despite the fact that there are quite a few "Jim Carrey Moments", this is definitely not a "Jim Carrey movie." <br /> <br /> It is mainly aimed at children, and I was able to enjoy it as a film. He was promoted in Israel as another Jim Carrey movie, so that those who are waiting for an amazing over the top comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film has good moments, and works well as a film for children. I can not say that I loved this film, but then again I'm not his target audience!
