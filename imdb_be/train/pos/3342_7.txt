If you like romantic comedies, then you will find this story, two 30-year-old singles who fall in love during the race the American League pennant pleasure. On the other hand, if you're hanging around waiting for Kill Bill Vol 3 or Sin City 2, then you should probably stay away. The plot contains a mandatory guy meets girl friends, she meets a guy and a guy meets a girl's father scene. There is even a guy meets a girl dog scene. It's all par for the course in a film like this. However, what I liked about it that story delved into the decision-making process of people make when they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect, and it's actually a little quirky. The plot centers around the responses to questions; much quirkiness too much, and how much love takes to beat these oddities? It is interesting to see the characters work, because of the deep (assuming it is) we all have oddities. Barrymore is doing a very good job in their roles and Fallon sorta surprised me - he was good as well. I rate it 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add one point if you are a baseball fan or a romantic relationship with a friend. Add another point if you are a fan of the Red Sox and take two points, if you're a fan of the Yankees.
