Well, we have extreme violence Verhoeven (though not as extreme as other Verhoeven click), we have a lot of sex and nudity, but something was missing ... Oh yes, do not have enough intelligence that Paul Verhoeven It is known because of its sci-fi movies. I admire the way Verhoeven enter characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most movies Verhoeven, the film itself does not have enough humor to get into the comedy genre. Acting as a whole was above average compared to most films crusher. <br /> <br /> What makes a good movie Invisible is not a story, but do not throw or signs, but the amazing work of special effects, which could make a film like this is impossible. The crew really made invisible man, without the use of things such as swimming hat, hanging on a piano wire and other practical effects (effects made on the set). The most stunning scene effects are not seen at the time as the invisible Kevin Bacon, Kevin Bacon when they become invisible and visible. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this invisible history deserves to be more imaginitive. Here it is in the laboratory, for the most part. I would have enjoyed seeing the invisible Kevin Bacon to rob a bank and get away with it, or, say, to steal anything from the wallets of people, or something like that. But what appears decent enough to make an entertaining movie Hollow Man. Grade: B
