The freedom to have their own sea Going Power Boat, the excitement is going on underwater adventures lasting, An adventurer and a man of great (and so well endowed!) Assistant in thin bikini had certain points of sale for the «SEA Hunting" (1958-61). <br /> <br /> Just what triggered to create a kind of sea navigation "gun for hire" * series. Let's look closely at the moment. There must be some clues around. <br /> <br /> If we were to look back just a bit, we see the production of RKO Radio Pictures Underwater! (1955). He starred Jane Russel, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet very attractive Scuba Diving adventurers working for salvation in the Carribbean, including pre-Fidel Cuba. The film was quite successful and memorable not necessarily for its history as for the exterior of the principal in a swimsuit. Well, slender woman Folk in some really captured 2-Piece Swimsuit is always a plus for the guys (Woo, Woo, Woo, Woo!); as well as the presence of strong, athletic men folk displayed his best Beefcake «posture" equally pleasant for Gals. <br /> <br /> And there's one element that is the real legacy of the old RKO Feature. It is on the Soundtrack music contained between queues and topics. This is a record "is Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White», written Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and made Damas Perez Prado and his Orchestra. <br /> <br /> Anyone who hears this Insturmental or song (with lyrics) will not soon forget it. His Carribbean blow so very lively and rich use of Brass Orchestra section is a powerful and instantly has a momentary impression and memory. 45 RPM recording of this song made it to the Top 10 most popular songs of the week for many evenings on Saturday to "YOUR HIT PARADE» NBC TV. We can not remember how many weeks and not just how high it was. (Maybe someone can fill us in on this one item, please!) So, we went back to the «SEA HUNT" and his own odyssey in obtaining «Tube». The audience took underwater! all in order, but they will go to the TV series. <br /> <br /> ZIV TV Productions got the reputation of a product such as quenching, which, for the most part, did not get signed by the Network for a hook to the multi-station treatment. But they had some great success with the television Syndication. ** By this we mean offering for stations series hits one to the TV station in each market area. (Just as various newspaper syndicates "sell" Comics on various materials throughout the country and the world, even. <br /> <br /> So, we got "Mike Nelson", itself in the physical presence of Lloyd Bridges. Mr. Bridges have been around for about 15 years or so, and turned in some very memorable performances in the main supporting and very different roles in several films Boston black (with Chester Morris), that they are a puppet to the Congo (3 Stooges one thousand nine hundred forty-three) , SAHARA (as one thousand nine hundred forty-three), home of the brave (1949) and the whistle EATON FALL (1951). <br /> <br /> Lloyd brought very convincing hear and freewheel manner of his response, along with a wonderful, convincing athletic, has the kind of guy who makes his living with his physical abilities. He is very good as Diver diver, whether the duties on board or fathoms under. <br / > <br /> sea and Lloyd did quickly take the role, but unlike a lot of misinformation out there, he was not familiar with the diving. *** before landing this gig Mike Nelson. But Mr. Athletic Bridges turned quick learners, as well as many of the large underwater shooting plan showed that there was no doubt that it was Lloyd with a mask, a bubbler (air tank) and flippers fins. <br /> <br /> The story is almost always involved in helping out some client for payment, as well as a private detective would. So, if the client was a beautiful lady who looked good in a bathing suit, the better. <br /> <br /> Like many other Ziv / United Artists TV Productions, «Sea Hunt" is excellent, has the theme of opening and closing, as well as some of the original incidental music and queues. <br /> <br /> At the time, I believe that the "SEA HUNT" was the best syndicated television series, the success of that series ZIV previously known from the likes of "Science Fiction Theater" and «Highway Patrol». With regard to the venue of the show for this underwater saga, here in Chicago, it was shown late at night (after 10:30 PM) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (our NBC affiliate, now known as WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> And I remember just who was the original investor in this particular market. And there were even on roller skates of the scene, made a star! How well we can remember and imagine Lloyd as Mike Nelson, riding on his motor boat. And as we were invited to come back next week and watch "..... another adventure" Sea Hunt ", which is sponsored by G. Heileman Breweries LaCrosse, Wisconsin creators of the old-style Lager Beer!», In all the while Mike toasting us, lifting the old style bottles. (Shame on you, Mike! Drink beer on your boat traffic! We Tellin Coast Guard!) Then the boat leaves the dock accompanied by theme Sea Hunt and rolling credits. <br /> <br /> Note: * more figuratively than literally, Mike employment, and all ran very like Deterctive history <br /> <br /> Note: **. Ziv syndicated successes included "science fiction THEATER», «WEST POINT» (and its clone "the MEN Annapolis"), "Sea Hunt" and "highway PATROL». <br /> <br /> Note *** and, of course, SCUBA is an acronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus.
