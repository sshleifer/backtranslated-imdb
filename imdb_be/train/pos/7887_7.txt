If Freddy hard core fan then you might not like it. This seems to be a parody of a series of nightmare. Not much to see here. The only reason why he keeps it to himself is the background on Freddie. <br /> <br /> One thing that is always a great movie in the Nightmare is the death scene. But death scenes were really crappy at it. The visuals were great, and the action was in order, but the background was excellent. . Basically, the story of Freddie comes full circle in this <br /> <br /> I read bad reviews on this, but I really enjoyed it, despite the many shortcomings: <br /> <br /> 1. Nightmare on Elm street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Soldiers dreams. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend, if you like the series. It was Freddy fully explained, but that's all there is. Next on my list Craven New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
