Viggo Mortensen stars as a new pupil haunted prison where the warden (played well Lane Smith) has a terrible secret, which may be the reason why the various prison guards and prisoners cut supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is Lifer, who knows the secret and feared for his life. When I think that prison movies, I always think of action movies starring Stallone and Van Damme or high-caliber dramas such as The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. However, I did not expect that the ghost story is more along the lines Exorcist III. Prison but atmospheric effort and it certainly is the best film Renny Harlin career. The film is terrible, and has some good acting from the cast (at that time) unknown. Lane Smith comes off better because it is not the usual clich√©s superintendent of evil personified, and nervous and irritable, which adds to the credibility of the movie, which far exceeds expectations. <br /> <br /> *** with 4 (Good)
