I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. I firmly believe that Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the comic genius of our time. They have an uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity in pop culture and make it funny, but in a real way ... if that makes any sense. This is basically what makes South Park soooo funny. Once you get past the fact that this is probably the most vulgar and immodest cartoon ever, you see in every episode of the message is conveyed. This is reflected in BASEketball. Although director David Zucker and completely ridiculous, he has a sincere message about corporate America and shame, which is a major league sports. I'm also a fan of the sport, so I find this movie hilarious at times, because it is true that the bizarre way that people hate to love. Opening prologue brilliant ... the tears of laughter from the mold every time I see these players begin Riverdance! Some of them may not like this film, because it's just not everyone's cup of tea ... but, just as South Park, when you look past the absurd ... it actually is present, the message is transmitted through a literal comic genius . I gave this film 8 out of 10 stars.
