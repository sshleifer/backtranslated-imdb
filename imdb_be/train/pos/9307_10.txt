Not a film for everyone, but this film in my top 10. I am a lover of black comedy. With a cast including Richard Dreyfuss (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (MIC), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben brass balls "London) in leads, the line can not help but be dry. The supporting cast is almost dead. Counting minor flaws in the film: Ellen Barkin makeup gave her face a washed look; there were a few GIMME cameos Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor, that does not make sense, and while Michael J. Pollard screen was too short for everything the cast was just incredible, without ego. to disrupt the great script. If you've seen (writer, director) movie Larry Bishop, Und erworld (dark flowlines crime), you will enjoy it. His next outing (writer, director, actor) Hell ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
