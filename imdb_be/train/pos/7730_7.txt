If in 90 years you are adapting a book written in the 50s, set the bloody thing in the 50s rather than in the '90s. See, 40 years of morals and values ​​as a rule, do not play as well, or the ring, how exactly that far down the road. This simple rule that Hollywood usually continues to violate. And this is the problem with this film. He was supposed to be set in the era it was written. You would think that would be a no-brainer, but nooo. I would have said, but a comment bmacv to say it is pretty good. I will confine myself to the comment Rachel Ward. She looks as if she is completely dieted her ass existence for this role. As a result, it looks like a crack ho "to chemotherapy, and about as sexy as a gay leather sofa in the resistance. I found her, "I could die at any moment," it looks very confusing and distracting it from its alleged "hotness" and "sexual tension" of the film intended to create. In addition, the film was pretty good; 7+ to 10.
