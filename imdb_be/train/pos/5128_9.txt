First of all let me say that I'm not from the south, but I'm an American. I do not like country music, but I can digest. I would never wear a cowboy hat, but I wear a hat. I do not live in a trailer, but I eat a tuna salad and own house. What does this have to do with this comment? Many, if you are one of those people who say that the only "country" people like this movie. This film is based on "They have loved and lost" space. James Bridges directs American love story as real as it gets. In the age of Jerry Springer and "Lets put it out there" mentality, this film is a true ring than ever. <br /> <br /> kidney "majority" and goes on his own life with a little help from his aunt and uncle, so he moved to the big city with them. Bud finds himself drawn into a world of local Honky tank to avoid only the blue collar people can afford. He quickly meets Cisse, who from a similar background, and the two have a whirlwind romance, filled with painful ups and downs. <br /> <br /> (* This site takes so much it turns out that one should just sit for a few minutes before they hooked up. Marriage focus here is often produced. In the beginning of the film they are married, and we believe, the transition from being single to married. film highlights some of the modern struggle of women is when she marries an old-fashioned man. He also brings in the form of the male ego and competition with women.) <br /> <br /> Bud challenged and excited when ties Mickey electronic bull. Sissya get ideas, having fun at it too, but quickly recalled that she was married, and should begin to "act like this." The emotions between the two characters are raw and clear and the story goes on from there, especially if they are (ATTENTION This gives some story line AWAY) crushing and Sissya fall on the former con with a tendency to abuse and violence. She soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side. <br /> <br /> How can you compare Bud Winnie Barbirino shocks me. John Travolta has given exceptional performance that was worthy of recognition. He was believable and real. The scene in which he shaves his beard, and the first time you see it on bar..still gives me goose bumps. Keep in mind I am not a big fan of Travolta, but come on, I can see why Sissy pushed her boots so early in the film. Deb Winger was so real that you find yourself sympathetic to her, how she handles a note of emotion in the bud, after sneaking to clean your house during their break up. <br /> <br /> supporting cast was incredible. Wes played Scott Glenn gave the first presentation rate that made you hate him and curse him how he abused Sissi. Smith-Madolyn Osborne, and Mistress Buds / girlfriend was so authentic that large torso women throughout the United States prayed to wake up flat chest to wear the clothes that she wore in the film. My biggest Kudos went to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson, Aunt and Uncle Bud. They seemed like someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas, and whenever small their role, they made a movie and much more realistic. Two memorable scenes were competition Dolly Parton and unforgettable scene where Bud and his aunt standing in the street after the death of one of the characters. The dialogue between them touching. <br /> <br /> If you can watch it for what it is, a real American love story. Then I recommend that you take it for what it is ... a movie before it's time that gave us the voyeurism of the world, unlike our own, but it is quite feasible for our pleasure and entertainment. If this world sounds similar to yours, then you will enjoy it much more. And finally, the music, however, date back, be sure to send you back in time, if you are over 30 years old.
