Firstly, this is a very funny movie with some crazy characters running around, which are connected to laugh (check two Russian errors). <br /> <br /> A Bug's Life is a classic Disney story line, but it's one of the nice things about the film. Family values ​​are praised and the main characters of the film are a certain evolution, to stand up against the locusts in the end. And it also has several large voiceover Dave Foley, Julia Louise-Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course) ... But in fact, the most surprising thing in this film there is animation. It's just wonderful. All the items, different colors, each ant looks different, interesting backgrounds ... And the guys at Pixar made it all look so realistic. All in all, a very good piece of work. This is the best animation of Disney, as Aladdin.
