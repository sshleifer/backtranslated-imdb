The idea Ä±A very short movie with a lot of information. It is interesting, entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more. The manufacturer has released a short film of excellent quality, which can not be compared with any other short film that I've seen. I appreciated the film the highest rating. I also recommend this show to office managers and business people in any institution. What comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas never listen to their voice is never heard. This is a lesson to be learned any office that wants to go forward. I hope that was formed to make the second part of the "idea." I look forward to viewing the sequence. Once again, congratulations to the media Halaqah in manufacturing excellence and quality of the film with a lesson in the form.
