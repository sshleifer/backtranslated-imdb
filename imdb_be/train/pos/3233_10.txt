This top Finnish film this year, although the tango comes Kabaree close.The director Lampela did a couple of years ago, another nice little movie called Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista (I was in love with a desperate woman) .Joki really true in the life of a beautiful film One Saturday day in a small village / town.The actors may not be such a nice and beautiful, but they are beautifully.I, of course, I hope that many of them get Jussi statue (Fin OSCAR) near spring.I think this movie could to do so abroad.
