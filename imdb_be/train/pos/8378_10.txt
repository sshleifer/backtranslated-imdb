What a great film it. The concept of the nation sends people are fighting each other with giant robots sticky. The ending is not only a fitting one, it's more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But I'm intrigued by the characters. It is a pity that we never see the relationship of Achilles and Athena more developed just a couple of kisses and fear for the safety of Athens Achilles. Their romance is very nice. <br /> <br />
