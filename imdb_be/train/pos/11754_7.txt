Robin Williams is doing everything possible to combine comedy and pathos, but off a bit shrill. Donald Moffat is too one note, like his father-in-law. Jeff Bridges is great, though, as a defender, and Hall Palance and Pamela Reed strange, carrying the film through most of its roughness. It fills the time nicely, but little more than that.
