It's noisy British comedy film, and one that I could watch over and over again, entirely tired. Peter Ustinov never played the role of bad and this is no exception, in particular, with his dry wit, but very clever master plan. Karl Malden has always been a supporter of mine, since he starred in "The Streets of San Francisco". I believe that Maggie Smith real star of this film, though, as to be so incompetent in everything that she is trying to do, but actually so turned on, especially at the end when she tells everyone that she has invested so much money that she discovered during washing their clothes. One thing that really concerns me, though, can someone please tell me why I can not buy it on any VHS DVD format or in the UK, can someone please help?
