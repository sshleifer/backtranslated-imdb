This film is an excellent example of a film that divides people into two groups .. Those who get the joke, and those who do not. People tend to attack what they do not understand. This film has a comic style and charm, which was not comparable since. This is a great comedy .. and a great novel. It's the perfect date movie. Perfect movie for those who want a good light-hearted laughter. If your prospect is too tight, it may be, this film is not for you, and you may need counseling. It's unfair that Paramount has kept the film on the shelf since the beginning of the 80s, they have never seen the light on the DVD. Nevertheless, they believe, the Urban version «The Young" is a good idea. I find it strange that has two ALLTIME favorite romantic comedies were never released on DVD. The other being Gene Wilder «Greatest Lover in the World", which Fox was sitting on from the beginning of the 80s, as well ... However, "From Justin to Kelly," in almost every video store in the country. There's no justice in the world. Maybe those who took the time to stun it like "From Justin to Kelly," I'm sure one watered enough for them to "get." Sometimes with age people lose their sense of humor ... And sometimes it just goes stale, and they find satisfaction in a comic repetition «Full House».
