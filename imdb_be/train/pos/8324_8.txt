It is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein played well Matthau and his associates play a match-maker of his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interaction between these main roles is complemented by a terrific supporting cast of well-known character actor. This film is a cute and fun ... "feel benefactor!" Heart recommendations.
