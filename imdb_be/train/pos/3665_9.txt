They did it. And boy, they did fantastically or what! BBC finally brought the doctor back to our screens on Saturday evening, where he is! And they did it with style! <br /> <br /> EPISODE ONE: «Rose" - one of the strengths of the new series Russel T Davies, as a writer and executive producer. He is a supporter of the show and knows what they want more fans, but also an experienced writer in his own right, because he knows that other people want. Another strength is fully shown here, in this first episode is Billie Piper and her character Rose Tyler. Finally Doctor companion with precise background and a strong character. nice to also see the return of Autons - a nice nod to the Classic Series has <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWO :. "The End Of The World" - the beginning of this double counting to show the TARDIS 'strengths, we end up in the history where all the special effects! Now they have the technology to create a real, believable environments and monsters - not a rubber suit varieties! Also hints at the end of this episode about the past of the new doctor - a very intriguing to kill all the Lord of Time and make it one <br /> <br /> Third Episode. "The Unquiet Dead" - We 've had a future, now allows you to have a past. First nya-Davis wrote the episode a bit flat in some places, but this is offset by Simon Callow Charles Dickens and sudden twist in the plot when he showed pity Gelf not so pathetic after all ... <br /> <br />, episode four: "Aliens of London" - the doctor's actions implications fully explored in this series, not least with the consequences Rose runs away with him. In addition, we have our first climber; not the best of them are true. Slitheen are an interesting villain, although they may look too CGI for their own good <br /> <br /> Episode Five :. "World War III" - the second part of the story about the Slitheen suffers mostly from the same problems first. In addition, clips from the next episode coming to the end of the current episode annoying and spoil it for people <br /> <br /> EPISODE SIX :. "Away" - Yes! We had a future, past and present (ish), but now we get the good stuff - the return of arch-nemesis Doctor. Here, I think we can complement Eccleston - he was brilliant, as a doctor, and no more, in this episode, where we see the pain on his face when he recalls the war and alien nature of his, he almost transformed itself into the far <br /> <br /> Episode SEVEN: «the Long Game» - in fact, only the history, to act as a prologue for the series finale .. Saved Simon Pegg as a smarmy editor and Tamsin Grieg in entertainment image area. Media control us - it's never been done before, have not you ... <br /> <br /> Episode Eight: "Father's Day" - this is a great episode. Full of human emotions and heartache for the roses, and the real consequences of what happens when you really screw up history. Full marks to Billie Piper here <br /> <br /> Episode NINE :. "Let the child" - I do not think this child is very scared. Sorry, but I do not. This is a good episode, though, but the climax still could be better - those «Next Time» bits that spoil them. John Barrowman is introduced here as Captain Jack, a dashing crook - he's a good actor who has been around for some time, but only at first glance noticed now <br /> <br /> Episode TEN :. "Doctor Dances» - Part two of this WW2 history - very well done in terms of the historical context. Good upbeat ending, although a bit confusing, perhaps, for young audiences as "The Mummy" is revealed? <br /> <br /> Episode Eleven: «Boom Town» - perhaps the weakest of the series, but this does not mean that it is bad. Good return to Slitheen, as well as an interesting character study and Dr. Rose <br /> <br /> Episode twelve :. «Bad Wolf» - it starts pretty stupid, with some good-natured humor and brazen fun to do on a popular TV show on it in Blighty. Things turn serious quickly, though, and the opening in the end, it is the culmination of the best in the series! <br /> <br /> Episode THRITEEN: «Crossroads» - Goodbye Eccleston. Dr. fantastic in so many ways, David Tennant has to really work his socks, to be as good as he is. Regeneration of the scene at the end of the beautiful game. Oh, and the farthest back - to the extreme! God bless CGI, because they can never get it right! <br /> <br /> Overall - brilliant! 9/10
