I am a man, not given women's films, but it's really well done special story. I have no personal love for Jane Fonda, as a person, but it makes a hell of a good job, while DeNiro his usual wonderful self. Everything is so well done: acting, directing, visuals, settings, photos, casting. If you can enjoy the story of real people, and real love - it's a winner.
