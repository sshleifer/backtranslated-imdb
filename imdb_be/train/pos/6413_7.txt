Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook, and all the other actors and actresses in "Men of Honor" have combined to make this remarkable film. Mark Isham wrote filmscore, so you know that music really well, too <br /> <br /> But :. Noticing kill those inconsistencies, gaps and more dramatic line pluckings heart from the very beginning, I had to make a promise to ignore them and sit back to enjoy the film. If you can do it, it _really_is_ well. <br /> <br /> In the history of Brashear, true to the hero's life, inspiring enough for a lifetime. See it on the Internet ... The whole history of surprising than the film, as the director admitted in their comments. There were only three African-American US Navy divers during the Second World War. However, none of them reached the status of the US Navy Master Diver. Brashear was the first African-American Navy US Navy Master Diver. And he was the first amputee diver ever to be certified or re-certified as a diver of the US Navy. (Applause deafening) <br /> <br /> On the negative side of the ledger film :. I must tell you, just one of many "gaps"? Yes, I'll mark this comment as containing "spoilers" and to do so ... Early, a key scene where the helicopter lands on the radio mast and plunged into the sea, they would never have had the time to meet up to the full Mark V diver even if he was the legendary Master Chief Billy Sunday, in time to be the only "... a couple of minutes later" rescue pilot. <br /> <br /> So, gap, inconsistencies, and over-dramatization, I lower "men of honor" committed by 10 to 7. <br /> <br /> Will Hollywood EVER understand that the truth is so unalloyed better that their overly dramatic approach to speaking? I doubt it. Too bad!
