This movie has some of the biggest comic dialogues and memorable quotes ever assembled in one movie! The plot is somewhat lacking, but miraculous boom is enough to make a difference. This timeless film for all ages that are sure to please. In the cinematic art form is very interesting; and with major stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how could you go wrong? <br /> <br /> comedic dialogue and timeing, such as it has long been underestimated, and it is very difficult to forge. A good example of this is seen in 1986, forging the film: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and the physical comedy of these stars, the film is pulled and received bad reviews and viewer comments. Achieving genuine dialogue is the art of comedy.
