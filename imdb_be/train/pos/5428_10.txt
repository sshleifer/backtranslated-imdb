My favorite is "Imperialism" cinema and one of the best action-adventure movies of all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with daring-do and wise cracks to please everyone except the "PC" from the movie audience. Memorable scenes abound - 3 sergeants and 20 sepoys fighting hundreds of thugs; MacChesney & Cutter gives Bobby Corner kick spikes ( "save some for the elephant") cutter MacChesney - Â«I expedition"; Dean violation Cutter from prison with a fork ( "what do you think I'm trying to break out of the Bleedin pudding?!?) And the incredible temple of Cutter singing scene, and then annoucing, bold as brass -" well, you're under arrest! "<br /> <br /> I could go on, but suffice to say, I try to catch this film every time it is switched on. It's hard to imagine a better than 2 hours for armchair adventurers and generals.
