In this documentary we meet Roger, rich plant manager in China, making beads and other trinkets being sold and traded on the Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger says that the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities that it provides, but the interviews with four of them tell a very different story. sad girls life is shown in sharp contrast to the excesses of the most bizarre carnival. Filmmaker David Redmon should be praised for beautiful and rare shots of everyday life in the Chinese connection factory, as well as for planting reveal on camera interview with the head of the US company that imports and sells the bead. He said film compelling and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind those ubiquitous "Made in China" label.
