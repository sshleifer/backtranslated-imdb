There have been several films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, such as Alain Delon. This role is also played by great actors such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but for me the best of all time has always been a Reed Hadley. This sequence gives the opportunity to see an interesting western, where you'll find the only real villain, Don del Oro, in the end. The series also has a good performance of the different actors in the movie, Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, timeless villains like John Merton and Charles King, and a very good performance as the Hadley Zorro. He was fast, clever, well-used the whip and the sword, and his voice was the best for all of Zorro.
