Deathtrap gives a twist on every step, every turn, in fact, his biggest problem is that there are so many twists and turns that you will never be guided in the film, and it often does not make sense, though they usually catch you unexpectedly. The story is very good, except for the fact that it has so many twists except. The script is very good with great dialogue and characters, but you can not catch the whole development because of turbulence. Representation especially Caine strange. Direction very well, Sidney Lumet may direct. The visual effects are just, but the again most of them are actually in the game and are fake. Turns way to much, but it still works and is worth watching.
