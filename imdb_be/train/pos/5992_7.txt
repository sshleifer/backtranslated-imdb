I admit that I had no idea what to expect to see this stylized piece. It might be a cure for the zombie virus or runny nose for all I knew. It started with a more visual, small pieces that grab your attention and cause your imagination run wild. As I continued quickly I learned through the voice-over is happening. Nice little neo-noir story, which I felt was not waist a few minutes of my time. Small tips, these audiences through visual effects at the beginning to give them a sense of accomplishment as they plot pieces. Together with a good twist in a cool package MCP common end. The bill, though not bad, almost gave the film a music video feel. He just felt a little dated, nothing to further the storyline, not adding. Some of the performances feel too dramatic, but blends perfectly with a sense of common parts. I'm leaving this very satisfied. I got a lot of information in a short period of time, but in a large editing and voice-over work, he did not feel rushed or pushed. Great job!
