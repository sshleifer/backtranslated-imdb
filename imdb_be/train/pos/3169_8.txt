Video chat is beat steps (you know, where the lid of the box using the same font and color scheme successful films) .I do not know what to expect other than what was printed. The first thing I thought while watching it was "what is wrong with the sound of Ada?" - It is obvious that there has been no dialogue dubbing. Words echo, so I stopped chewing on something that I had to pay more attention, note there is no Shakespeare here !, Just a simple conversation. The history is quite simple, boy meets girl, etc .. What struck me as humorous and heart was, the people in the movie do not like cartoons, written in the story, but rather a non-actors plucked temporarily from them real jobs (uniforms included). All the while, you start to feel that the director after, you will see that there are no attempts at cheap humor (people damaging their ranks, using vulgarity it could damage the marketing. There is something honest about it. I thought, if they have a bigger budget , it would have been better, I'm sure they thought every day, but they went ahead and did it. this, I felt, was that of an independent film production in all about.The word "indie" is thrown around as if it Genre..Ha! .. it's funny!
