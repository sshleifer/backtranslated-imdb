I saw it at the screening last night, too. I was completely blown away by how much better the film was what I expected. Not many movies can combine dark comedy and the drama of current events and he collapsed in prison. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to paraphrase the story too much, because I think the less you know about this movie is going to make it much better. But I will say that the performance of Adam Sandler was really refreshing and real. He was funny, and much funnier than most of his latest comedy. Don Cheadle was plausible, as always. <br /> <br /> This film is not funny as Borat or Billy Madison, but he's got good pace about him. I would say that 90% of the audience were laughing most of the film. In the middle of the film slows down to address the drama of the end of things and does a very good job of tying it all together. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was really cool, like, instead of playing one all black / white one, they decided to just ignore it and focus on the relationship itself.
