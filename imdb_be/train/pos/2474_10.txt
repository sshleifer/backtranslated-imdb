There were a lot of things that go against this movie for me, before I watched it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I was a typical high school student, in the class of Shakespeare I do not really even like, much less clear half! Shakespeare is not more than the unintelligible without me fill ALL of my concentration in its almost ... play encrypted encrypted it extremely difficult to understand the language .... and then I still would not have got most of them. <br /> <br /> Second, it was a long time 4:00! I never thought that could be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Well let me tell you something. This movie was so artfully, so beautiful, I really understand the whole language as it can be done. Now, the script is followed to the letter in this film, the same scenario that was incomprehensible to me in class Shakespeare. And then I had my mind opened and I understanding it. I wondered myself while watching the movie almost! But lo and behold ... when carried out, and only then, Shakespeare comes alive. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare really master, to write more stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in the high-budget style of the main movie (with beautiful cinematography and photography), and acted marvelously with Brannagh and actor, somehow .... I realized what was happening. What was said. Language is an amazing and hot. This allows for a more raw emotion ... when words can not describe what may be Shakespeare's words could. <br /> <br /> I still keep to this day, Fist of the North Star (animation, the English dub) is the greatest film ever made. Neither the film does not provide a more obvious entertainment. But for the film to come close to discredit Fist from this position (that Hamlet did - it was close) really strange .... is awe. It was not a movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> Even more surprisingly, it made me appreciate Shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. Powerful word. One of the rare, really powerful film there. <br /> <br /> It gets 2 stars out of a hundred trillion infinity of stars. Yes, yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, all you kids out there in Shakespeare class ... forget. You spend you time. You should see the play performed. Only then will justice be done to them.
