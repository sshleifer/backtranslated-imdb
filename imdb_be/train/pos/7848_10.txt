This is one of the best animated films I have ever seen in my life. This is not just a fun movie, a well made film. This is a milestone in the art of animation, and even if it was not only the technical skills that went into creating it, give him a place in the history of animation. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz create an animation film about the secret life of beetles. He imagined the world of insects, with jobs, houses, night clubs, cinemas, even small props like posters and bicycles and painting. <br /> <br /> In this film he tells a simple story of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Zhuk has to do with dancing dragonfly, unfortunately the horse; but he and the cameraman decides to shoot affair. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds Mrs. Beetle with its own business. Mr. Beetle lover chases away, but He forgives his wife. Two make-up and go out to the movies. And the movie they are watching Mr. Beetle and Dragonfly. Thus described, it sounds corny, but once seen, it will be an exciting work of cinema. Along with Emile Cohl and tRNA, Wladyslaw Starewicz largely invented all that future animators will use in their work. For this reason, it should not be forgotten.
