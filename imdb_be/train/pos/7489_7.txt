This film has many strengths. This is one of the best horror throws outside the circle Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney: Etuill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, as well as leading man Melvyn Douglas. He has all the necessary ingredients: bats, castle with lots of stone stairs, a mad scientist, the townspeople waved the torch and hunting vampire, "Igor" -type character, a beautiful girl, even stupid hair Burgomeister. The camera work is whimsical soft-focus and imagination. There's even some good comic well spaced throughout the scenario. <br /> <br /> But it's actually not a monster movie, because there is nothing supernatural is happening in «Kleinschloss» ( «small castle"). The plot revolves around a common mad scientist (played well Atwill), who appreciates their work more highly than human life. <br /> <br /> This is not a top-level material, due to the resolution of the plot ho-hum and some dramatically bad dialogue for Dwight Fry. But it's worth a look if you like an early b / w picture of horror.
