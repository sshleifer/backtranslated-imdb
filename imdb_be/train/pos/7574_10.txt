This is one of the best series, ranking up there with the Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or Biohazard: Last Escape) The game has a very good storyline, in which you play as Claire Redfield in search of his brother, Chris Redfield (who you probably know from the original Resident Evil) is as bad as the other Resident Evil, and contains a lot more than movies <br /> <br /> My rating :. **** to ***** stars (the rating is based on a comparison with other video games)
