Bravo! Actor Morgan Freeman, who explores the symbol, he elected to play before he commits. Freeman is a "good fit" for this film (as it was for "Driving Miss Daisy"), and he is not only plausible, but it gets the chance to change their image to play a character with a reserved dignity and decency. Although there are no guarantees in life, for someone, it gives the actor a great opportunity to play different and unique characters that stand out in order to avoid falling into stereotypes. And I must say that stereotypes are difficult or completely destroyed, a significant number of existing career. <br /> <br /> This is a low-budget film, which, surprisingly, was done in the period of time for only two weeks, It is a film that is well written and Brad Silberling. Manager Location Select Carson, CA for movie settings, and helps set the tone for the location and time for the film. Edit fairly well, but a little rough. <br /> <br /> Silberling was "subcontractors" in getting Freeman to make this film, while the actor was in between film projects. <br /> <br /> There is a good chemistry between Freeman and groove Vega, Spanish actress, and this opens up an effective dialogue between each of the actors who are diverse and come from different cultures. The film also promotes understanding between people who not only speak in two languages ​​(English and Spanish), but come from two different worlds, ethnicity, race, gender, norms, customs, beliefs, morals, principles and values. The film strives for some honesty, and arrive at some truth to preserve the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> Part of the comedy is that Freeman played an unemployed actor who has been out of work for four years. In fact, Freeman so popular as an actor, he is constantly working. <br /> <br /> The film offers adventure bonding, caring, sharing, modifying, and sharing. And, outtakes of the film gives the viewer view certain things an actor must undergo in the process of preparing for the role. <br /> <br /> If necessary, tell your boss that you take a "mental health day" and go see this movie. If you are able, take your significant other or your family with you. I rank the film 10 out of 10. It is a pleasant, interesting, informative, sharp, and worth it.
