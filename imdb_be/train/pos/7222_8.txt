Definitely one of the most ingenious and whirled who-dunnit I've ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were brilliant and kept me going through the entire novel. <br /> <br /> A very stylish set pieces and props really give a sense of atmosphere to work. Minimalist sense of working for the whole picture. <br /> <br /> My only complain is not with the film itself, but the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the film on DVD. I have a full-screen option (which proves that I like this movie enough to support full-screen presentation mode), but the country Deluxe or "special" edition, more likely, of course, to get my money.
