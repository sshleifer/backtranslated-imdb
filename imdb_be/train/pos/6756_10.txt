Preminger, completing the cycle in noir Twentieth Century Fox, it rejoined "Laura" leads to the prodigious, rough detective drama. Dana Andrews again draws the police, but this time it has hardened, cynical and accused of police brutality on his boss - "You do not hate hoods, you liked to beat them!". Mark Dixon (Andrews) criminal contempt, because his father was a fraud. He wants to be a "child of Sandy Dixon," that he became a police officer, but his methods are harsh and hated. <br /> <br /> One night, a murder investigation, he unknowingly puncher suspect Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) so hard that he kills him. Vibrational Dixon is doing everything possible to hide it, intending frames hated bandit Scalise (Gary Merrill) for crimes. However, the blame falls on the father in law of Payne, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), whose daughter, a department store model Morgan Taylor (blackthorn) is moving away from her husband, but keeps getting drawn into his gambling scheme. Payne did not hit his wife, angering her father, who did show on his son-in-law apartments, but not to Dickson moved body. With no better suspects, Jiggs arrested and charged. <br /> <br /> Riddled with guilt, he falls in love with Mark Morgan and offers money for a lawyer. He decides to take on Scalise anyway, but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death, confessing all. In the end, he could not live with the knowledge that he did, and it allows the sheet to be read by his superior, and Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan professes her love for Mark and will wait for him. <br /> <br /> It was great to find this movie on DVD, after so many years of uncertainty TV programs. Eddie Muller, a film-noir historian, provides commentary and does a good job, but I believe his assertion that the audience did not catch the casting value of the two wires, as "Laura" were made six years ago. In this respect, he is wrong, because they have appeared in the "Iron Curtain" for two years before WTSE and the film was a box office success. <br /> <br /> Andrews and Tierney were incredible together, and Ruth Donnelly huge comic as a restaurant owner Martha, bloating between the detective and Dame. <br /> <br /> the Night Cityscapes provide air film threat. Gary Merrill as big as a low-life Scalise, who had a criminal history with Dixon Pope ( "Your father loved me," he scoffs Mark). Carl Moldna and young Neville Brand are also excellent. And Tom Tully simply touching and funny as unfair accused pop Morgan. <br /> <br /> a watchable film noir with a fantastic cast.
