CAT SOUP has two «Hello Kitty» -type kittens embarking on a bizarre journey through the afterlife, where anything can happen and does. This mind-tripping Asian short does not use dialogue, replacing the word balloons instead. There's no way to describe this crazy cartoon, except to tell you to see it for yourself. And make sure that no one under 10 is not in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and brutality and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that an elephant is water that cats and swim through, as well as ride. But, like almost everything else in this film, it's silly, picaresque intermission horrible end comes quickly.
