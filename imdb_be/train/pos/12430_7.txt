I usually do not watch action movies because they are usually all very similar. This film made a lot of stereotypical scenes of the film, but the characters of the original film and the room made it much easier to watch. David Duchovny bent his normal cast approach, which was great to see. Angelina Jolie is certainly beautiful, and made a lot of action. Large throw everything together. A must see for people with the same sad old fighter.
