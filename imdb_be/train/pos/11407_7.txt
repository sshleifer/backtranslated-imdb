Updated January 1, 2006 <br /> <br /> Parsifal is one of my two favorite operas of Wagner's music dramas, or to be more precise, (Meistersinger is the other.), although it is difficult to imagine him as a "top who it comes out. " Libretto by the composer, as usual, there is a confusion of religion, paganism, eroticism, and perhaps even homo-eroticism, and its length can make it seem to the audience how the rumor paint dry. <br /> <br /> Wagner, being a well-known anti-Semite (Klingsor could be one of his surrogate Jewish villains.), of course, instructed the prime minister on the unreacted (not due to a lack of trying RW!) Hermann Levi, who was his favorite conductor! (Go figure!) Kundry, the most confusing-Gal and other probable surrogate Jewish, it's like a criminal or benevolent, depending on the scene. <br /> <br /> Given that many video versions of Parsifal seems to be on the heavy side, the film of the opera, in comparison, a breath of fresh air. Syberberg, director, brought a significant representation to it, but it's hard to understand why he did some of his choices. For example: the notorious double Parsifals (Each floor!), Dolls, death-mask-Wagner set and doll and different symbols, such as the Nazi swastika in one of the mobile scene. (If I remember, the "real" Engelbert Humperdinck wrote real music swell of scene changes.) Although the Wagner died too soon to be an actual Nazi, many of his descendants (as well as his second wife Cosima.) There were at least passengers including their grandson Wolfgang Wagner, who still runs the festival in Bayreuth in old age. In fact, the son of Wolfgang Gottfried Wagner, in complete opposition to his father, tried to negotiate honestly with his great-grandfather. <br /> <br /> Syberberg, too, it seems to be politically controversial from what I read. In 1977 he made a famous film about Hitler, "Hitler: Ein Film Aus Deutschland» (sometimes called "Our Hitler" in English.). Since it only lasts for 8 hours and was not widespread, most people have not seen it (including me.). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, conductor of the audio CD, on which this film is based plays Amfortas (by Wolfgang Schøne) Edith Clever (Yvonne Minton) play Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick play dual Parsifals (two sung by Reiner Goldberg .!) and Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland both play and sing Gurnemanz and Klingsor. <br /> <br /> Although the opera takes place over a long period of time, and all (except Kundry?) have been shown that they significantly between the ages of Acts 2 and 3, no one is looking over a day at the end of the opera. (Magic Grail? In this opera Grail chalice from which Jesus drank at the Last Supper, and not Mary Magdalene, as well as in more recent times, the idea I find inappropriate!). <br /> <br /> conducting and singing all fully functional and DVD, seems to have improved the sound, if not now, to a large extent. (Yes, I agree that «KNA» approach is higher, even for a second, stereo version, but it is probably superior to all of the recorded versions in general). <br /> <br /> I do not Parsifal for all Wagnerites but I think it works very well as a filmed opera.
