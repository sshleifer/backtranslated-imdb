I watched the reunion McCoys and was glad to see the slope and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! To see them now was great, because I have always watched the show grows so when the TV says it is going to be reunited, I was so excited !!!! The only thing I could not understand why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (small Luke) was not there.I know that Walter Brennan died. So I got on my computer and tried to learn about them and found this site, so if there is someone out there that can tell me what happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke, I would be grateful !!! I've been looking everywere and not lucky .the only thing that I could learn about Michael Winkelman as it should have been born in 1946, the show was the value and morality of each show gave a lesson to be learned.The shows today do not have that to offer with all incredable acting was the only thing better than finding out obout them would meet with them, so as it is impossible, if there is anyone that can help, please !!! Thanks Glenda
