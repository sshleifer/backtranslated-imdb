Seeing as "Fear black hat" and "This is Spinal TapÂ», I can honestly say that while similar, both films should really see. There will be many times in "Fear", which will have you in hysterics. It is no wonder why both films have such a huge cult following. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. Rent, if necessary, but the only way to fully enjoy this film to have it for yourself.
