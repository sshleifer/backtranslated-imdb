I first saw this film at the Sundance Film Festival this year, and as a teenager, I've found the film very attractive. these children are out of the ordinary and very unlikely to be in a film of this growth, but with the right dialogue and junk they made the film a complete success. I enjoyed this film more than others, but I strongly recommend to produce and watch this movie. it is a mixture of ingenious comments and fun reality. capturing the essence of the high school, high school record topped your list of favorites and hopefully have a chance to be released in theaters. I really thank all the children who put the hard work in making this film, it helped me crying eyes of our laughter.
