I had the privilege of watching "Holly" at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a '12 old Vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution, his family and life in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (American) comes to life and Holly decides that he wants to help her. If Holly is sold again, Patrick desperately searching for her. We go through the difficult path they Cambodia and hope for their reunion. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of the millions of children who are sold and trade every day. The film reflects this complex issue, without crossing the line. I walked away wanting to know more about the problem of child trafficking and asks, how can I help? This film should be seen by all, because it's a beautiful story, and it reveals a problem, we should no longer ignore.
