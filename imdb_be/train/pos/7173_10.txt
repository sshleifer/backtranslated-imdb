I just watched a documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on cable TV network Starz. This is, without doubt, one of my most enjoyable viewing experience ever! He chronicles the artists area of ​​the San Francisco Bay and the creative talent responsible for some of the best films ever made. In addition to well-known artists in the list, that also includes segments Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and segment of Pixar Animation Studios. I hope that it will be released on a DVD-it is a must for any collection on the history of cinema and brilliant film. If you are even remotely interested in the movies and the people who create them, you will not be disappointed.
