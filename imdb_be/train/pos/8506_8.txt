,, But it was on the VHF channel and the reception was very blurry. I would really like to have a movie, that's why I watched it in the first place because I'm a bus driver and at the time I saw this film, I was behind the wheel of that bus model. It was only (at the time of his murder trial about 15 years later), I remember vaguely that OJ was one of the stars in it. I only recall that he was the driver of the bus, and shot and run wild. I've been looking all over for this film were not successful, as the view in the mid 80s. I liked the movie, I usually do not watch thrillers, but after reading a resume in TV Guide and view its beginning (though vague) I stayed for the whole thing.
