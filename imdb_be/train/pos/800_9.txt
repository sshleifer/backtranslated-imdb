I could not be more excited; Just eight years ago, in 1983, I was going to see the movie Star Wars in the theater! The best day was going to happen in my life. Until then, my only experience of Star Wars was several HBO shows Star Wars. I did not even see the Empire Strikes Back again. <br /> <br /> And boy, did the same day to deliver my less critical view. Jabba. Rebel big space ships. Emporer. Green-bladed light !! Wow! After all, this magical day, I have watched this movie a hundred times. I can not even form an accurate assessment at this point. With those few views, of course, I said that this film - the real Episode III. - has its drawbacks <br /> <br /> Of course, in the context of the movie Star Wars, these "flaws" are more like "strangeness". <br /> <br /> Millions had a magical day in 1977 and 1980 in May 1983, I had a. And it was my movie Star Wars.
