About 1986 I saw this movie on TV by chance one night. I was 6 years old. It was like my casual browsing terrible ending of Do not Look Now in 1987 I went to Venice for a holiday next year in mute horror, in the hope that the god of my parents did not know I was watching him! <br /> <br /> I'd objected when my parents knew that I was watching Les Valseuses, when I was a kid? I would probably avoid this topic with my dad, even in our time, and my mom probably dissatisfaction in the afterlife. I do not know if they wanted to see it anyway. From persecution and capture a woman in an apartment building in the first scene on the slide down the mountain roads with glazed eyes fed I will never sure that this film is insensitive piece of garbage that does not take into account the sexual revolution or if it's sexy releasing a movie to watch, as it envelops you, that you could never be so insulting yourself. <br /> <br /> It is definitely violent. It has a violent kind of sex, almost a declaration of love. Even suckers mutates young child in a sexual act greedy exploitation. But the scenario is very erotic and (god I'm so British) exciting! There they suck her breasts for her own good? That is exploitation. So why do I get the wood? <br /> <br /> The guys are looking for an experienced older woman, to find the ex-crook, a mother-figure? I do not know. It ends in a really hideous suicide. I described it to my friend JB Nelson, who has Cannibal Holocaust-guts, and he went eeuurrgghh! A lot of maternal love for this film, quite the contrary. Distortion, where the boys began. Why did they remove the girl in the leg? Why did she come back to him? women should be punished so that they know what is right from men? <br /> <br /> I think of the two films, one of which I would, I know, have never seen the other would do me this WASN Â«t such a harsh world. Gone / Madonna, that the heap does not calculate the madness has never been so sad that a woman is punished for the fact that a woman becomes a slave of the man and his maybe Madonna speaking, everyone respects Guy Ritchie them so furious I can not use punctuation! Once in America / Leone god why noodles do it? Destroys the path to happiness, we have been following him for a lifetime. So close to finally find love with Deborah. Now they are both destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> <br /> There's no rape in Les Valseuses, but a lot of sex and nudity in abundance, in both sexes. Very honest, not tickling. A lot of fantasy cormorants, Sun Hollywood perfect smooth motion. Joke, yes. But there is too much darkness and envy and deceit here to call it a sex comedy. Remember to keep shooting nude barber up Cos she will return and you will Vengeant Hook it to your Son, Ex-Con Lover and Cum She taught him. <br /> <br /> Two things I can not stand the rape movies and prison movies. Les Valseuses Sun rape movie! God no one wants to see it now! This brilliant film!
