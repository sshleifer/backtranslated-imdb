More psychological analysis, but Psycho sounds better as a title. The man in charge of the film (the narrator, if you) do not paint films here in their own way. Most of them are classics, but they are listed here in IMDb, and I encourage you to see them (especially the films of Hitchcock, Solaris, and conversational & Lynch films) because Zizka would refer to them! <br /> <br /> Or, in other words, it can spoil them for you. I do not remember when he spoiled more than I have listed (I think Chaplin movies, too), but as I have already said that it would be better if you advance to see them all! IMDb In the list there is no film that I made a report to him, so that he can get there pretty quickly. This film Meg Ryan, but it is only a short piece of code is not a big deal anyway. <br /> <br /> The views and opinions Zizek crazy and interesting to listen to, if you are open to see things a different point of view (even if it does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you ... it does not mean that it will do it is, but it can)!
