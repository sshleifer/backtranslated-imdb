This film is a true reflection of Australian ingenuity that was needed to make this country what it is so for the past 200 years. Nha pompous, like the British, Sun fanatical as Americans. If any of these countries have tried that the crew did, he would have become bankrupt. Either due to ignorance of the British, or too much faith in the superior firepower on the American side. "Real" Australians (ie, non-import) are the only one who can succeed in today's armed conflicts, because they had to improvise much of his adult life. Just look at the examples as Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
