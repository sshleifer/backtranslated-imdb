One of director Takashi Miike very best. It's so good it's hard to put into words. For nearly fifteen years older than the target audience it excited me from the beginning to the end <br /> <br /> He reminds these children's films from the 1980s, in the sense that (unlike today), these films are not afraid scare. - there is a lot of unpleasant detail here that I first found a concussion, but soon realized that it was nothing different from what I grew up. The film is a collection of 80 th years small conventions movies. You name it, it's there: the boy hero thrust from his own unhappy / dysfunctional world to another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; quest to save both worlds from the forces of evil; beautiful heroine, he is in love; sadist henchwoman (Go-Go Yubari from Kill Bill Vol 1.); leading villain who draws evil force from something everyone in the world can touch. But all these genre conventions give a fresh twist and added depth. <br /> <br /> One of the reviews IMDb begins "Where was this film when I was a kid?" and this sense I agree with the heart. Even during his viewing, I complained that I had not grown up on it; it was not part of my childhood, like a maze, Masters Of The Universe, and, to a much lesser extent, The Neverending Story. These movies and others like The Goonies withdrawn, but never copied. - Miike inexorably offers us a new perspective on things, <br /> <br /> Bad CGI is a staple of many of his films, and sometimes because of budget constraints, but only as part of the artistic choices - the desire to introduce things in an unusual way. CGI here mainly on the average, only because of the budget constraints, but nevertheless he does a fantastic job of putting on a spectacle. CG effects in combination with traditional dolls, animatronics and really extraordinary make-up, to create a world filled with rich characters (and response), which are often border on the visionary. <br /> <br /> It is considered one of the greatest children's films ever made. Not for younger or more sensitive children, though. <br /> <br /> just jaw droppingly good. Look at you, and if you think that your kids can handle / evaluate this is to show them. Let them grow on the Great Yokai War in some small compensation for what you could not.
