The dentist was made at the time when almost every profession has it's crazy. We were crazy police, ambulance man, secretery and that was just the beginning. The dentist came surprisingly late, because going to the dentist usually layman nightmare. <br /> <br /> The plot is twisted. Super clean dentist Dr. Feinstone lives an ideal life in his big "white house", he has an excellent blonde wife and a great place to work as a dentist. Dark clouds are your horizon in the form of reverse IRS Man (Terminator Earl Boen), dirty pool cleaner "cleaning" his wife and suddenly his teeth each seems to have gone through a dark filter. it goes nutso and starts taking care of teeth people in a nasty way. and you do not want to come in his way. <br /> <br /> crew were professional. Producer / director of the Union made a stylish horror movies like Re-Animator and due. He has sent the continuation of Re-Animator and his first film society was good parallel from John Carpenter's They live. Producer Pierre David known from movies like scanners. Actors were great. Bernsno really surprised me. I knew it from LA law and Major League, but I would later dream of his psycho dentist. he was really great in his role, and he was kind of sad man. Linda Hoffman and pretty stupid like Feinstones wife. Micahel Stadvec was not a lot of lines, but after I saw him with houses surrounding area I knew my future profession. Ken Fori (Dawn of the Dead, From Beyond) had a good view of a police officer in the case. Virginia Keane was an innocent teenager who is going to be close to the customer Feinstone <br /> <br /> The last warning :. If you're like me, and there are problems with the dentist, then maybe you should skip it. But if you want to try what you have to prepare yourself with dark humor and a lot of nasty drilling.
