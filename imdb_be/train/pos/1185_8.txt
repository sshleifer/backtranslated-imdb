Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger switched roles Goody-villain, they held in "All the brothers were heroic." Taylor seems to be a little uncomfortable in his role of bad guy, but Granger plays its role perfectly. However, the real hero of the story bison and north-west. The film is well done, with the atmosphere of that time surprising data. The direction is tight and although the film is not carefree fun, in my way of thinking a major film, unfairly ignored expert.
