My father was the caretaker of the prison (he is now retired) is presented in this documentary, and I grew up around the prison life, so perhaps my eyes will be completely different from everyone else who watches this film. I say this, the filmmakers who brought us to this 93-minute miracle fantastic artists and even better people. They were brave enough to A) Show and tell this story, Bed and) get inside these students minds and hearts, and C) Do all of this responsibility. Responsible their art and, more importantly, the responsibility of the prisoners and staff Luther Luckett Correctional Complex. They should be appreciated no end to this work. To 170 hours, so WATCH, staff and be able to cut and to reduce it to 93 riveting minutes of nothing but how extraordinary, and they are my great respect. <br /> <br /> I saw this film in the circumstances, only very, very few were able to see him. I was at a screening of prisoners. I was in the same room with these people as they watched their hearts poured out on the screen. I've seen men cry on TV crying in the chair in front of me, and let me tell you that it was a very profound experience. These people have committed terrible crimes, in some cases, but found ways to try to make amends, even if they think they are not subject to redemption. How many of us have the courage to do it? How many people can do what they did in such a harsh environment? In order to see their reaction to the film was an experience I am infinitely grateful for, and I will never forget. I thank the people who allowed me to is to look at my life, I thank my father for making it all possible, and I thank Philomath Films for taking the time to pour their blood, sweat, soul, and tears into this project. <, Br /> <br /> This film will change everything you think you know about life in prison, and the prisoners therein. "Oz" is not real, not real television. "Shakespeare in jail" is.
