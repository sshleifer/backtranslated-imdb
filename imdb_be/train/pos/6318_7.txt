I tried to remove it several times, but has always been with a friend who, as a rule, tend to reject Heist click and comedy ensemble with the comment "Um ... looks good, but I'm not in the mood for this film." Thus, I entered the "omnipotent Solo Movie NightÂ»! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found Welcome to Collinwood pretty enjoyable film. Though ultimately quite forgettable, there are moments of fun and laugh a little loud moments. I was not familiar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a rule, watch movies, try to ignore it and watch them on their merits anyway. George Clooney put in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker who, for the most part left me wondering two things ... 1. not every comedy be better if Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minutes cameo? and 2. How do they make the fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easy they are to wash? Throw all great actors in their own right, put a lot of work, and you get the impression that they had a good time working together, which is quite important in a movie like this. Needless to say, things are not going as planned, in this film, as the plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the features and see the original look, so I think that the success! Rent one for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and pizza. you'll have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> On a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear far under appreciated Paolo Conte is used, and it left me humming fragments of the score for a long time after the credits.
