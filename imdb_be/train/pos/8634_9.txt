Love on top - in a totally wrong the American name for a superb French film «Le Mouton Enrage» (which means, I think, rabid sheep) - is such an original film, the fact that it goes back to 1974, it seems all the more incredible . This film was far ahead of its time; even by today's high standards, he does things that seem the rich and fresh. Shot extremely undervalued director Michel Deville, it is rather impossible to describe how it combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire in a totally original mix - leaving at the end of the main, but the subtle surprise, to make all that stepped suddenly bored and understandable. Acting is superb, at the same time writing and topic. But it's delicious tonnes Deville, keeping you constantly off-balance but enrapt, that pushes this "lost" film at a very high level indeed. (Written interview with the director of the section "Special Functions" on DVD, is definitely worth a read if you have time.)
