I stumbled on this film when I was eBay'ing Caesars Palace material, and I'm in love with its rich history of Vegas as the last of the original luxury resorts still stands in good condition (not counting the points, the original MGM Grand). In this respect, this film provides the full power. You've given a grand tour of the Caesars property, which, despite all the renovations and additions they have done for 40 years, it was open, it looks eerily similar. The film as a whole, the plot is quite difficult to follow, largely due to the terrible editing. And when I say terrifying, I do not use that word easily. There's a lot of fusion in the second-long fragments Vegas traffic, the casino crowd, and even a scene where the character Robert Drivas has a conversation with his father about how much he has grown, and without any explanation, he (Drivas) is (in these shameful fragments) from themselves, a child, a little boy, and then back to him during a conversation back and forth with his father. (This does not give any details of the plot, in any case, you can be ready for it, and perhaps they will not be as surprised as I was editing.) The film is aging differently, and has a good message of the inherent differences between father and sons that most guys can relate to some form or fashion.
