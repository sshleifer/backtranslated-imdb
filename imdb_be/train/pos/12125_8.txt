I saw this movie again and noticed how close it is to the novel, when we ignore the part about [Leslie Howard] childhood Kerry. Given that <br /> <br /> At the time, can not so much be shown on the screen, [not that there is a lot in the novel] obsession with the character Mildred [Bette Davis] is very well conveyed the audience, I recommend this film for anyone who has ever fallen on another person, on the other hand, I tried to take advantage of him or her. I read that novel Moey asked to make an entry for the sale, but when he started in the studio, he began to cry and could not complete more than a few lines, and the whole project was thrown. You could say the novel is written from the heart, and the movie is good <br /> <br /> adaptation of part of it, at least.
