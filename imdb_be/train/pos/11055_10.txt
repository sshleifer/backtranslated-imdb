Well, what can I say, except these people super in all respects. I quite like the Sharon Mcreedy, I like the pure nostalgic series A, I have a boxed set of 30 CDs 9 episodes, I did not understand what they have done so much, I think it's a great shame that they did not do more. I wish that I was given these powers, Imagine me, being knocked off my cycle, somewhere and knocking out the cold, and then wake up in a special hospital. Later, I found that my body has been improved. Just as Richard Barr. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way, you can not deal with these 3 people, as they will lead you in all forms of weapons. Music is well written, but for me, puts a beautiful picture 3 super beings in my mind, a kind of power, the champions are the same as our family dog ​​or cat, Improved vision, better hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the power of 3 women Sharon. Who I thought was nice and smart. When I was little, I had a huge crush on her !!!! Now I can understand why, in my DVD set. The box is very good, and it comes with a free brochure of all the series. I also thought it was a good host Trymane hard, but he got everything ready!
