I watched the first series avidly, but asked whether I want to come back again after a long break from it. Nevertheless, I am determined to episode one of series 2 and hooked again. It's really a great TV; innovative things like mission impossible back in the 1960s. The characters are well-rounded, and expanded as the series goes on, they change, how they adapt - some more easily than others - to their new environment, but they are cleverly remain strictly in character, and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for someone who you would not think you could ever regret if something really happens to crushing them. I hope there will be many years «Lost», to look forward - and I really do not mind all that much if I never get answers to all the secrets!
