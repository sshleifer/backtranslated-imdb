This film is incredible. If you have a chance to watch. Although the warning, you'll cry your eyes. I do, every time I see it, and I am his master and watched it many times. The performances are outstanding. It deals with the darkness and pain and loss, but there is hope. This film made me look at the world differently: vicarious experience, according to my English teacher. Also, if you saw it, pay attention to the interesting use of shadows and light. The main room is a phenomenal movie, and I appreciate it 10/10 - for real - because of the miraculous action, awesome story, and heart-wrenching dialogue. Very busy, very moving. Do not give all the answers, but it does a lot of good points about humanity
