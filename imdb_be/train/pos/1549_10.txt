There are movies and there are movies. Movies more often than not only cinematic "sweetie" while movies a real work of art. Fraulein Doktor certainly well placed in the latter. Like most viewers, I was very impressed with the battle scenes, but the sharpness of the image of the central character is that I think the most sterling qualities of the film. Do everything you can to serve his country as a real daughter Deutschland, all the time in the throes of morphine addiction, die Fraulein treated very poorly by the German High Command, in spite of all its efforts. The scene in which Doktor transported in the back seat of cars Mercedes-Benz team, alone, desolate and weeping, perhaps one of the most boring yet accurate description of a lot of "espionage" in life. Only emotional pain, represented by Richard Burton in The Spy Who Came in from the cold approaches. Fraulein Doktor is much deeper than the film can be implemented on a singular view. I just wish that its producers have seen fit to release it on DVD, so that those who have never experienced it can, and those who saw it can be again (perhaps again) enjoy this exceptional film.
