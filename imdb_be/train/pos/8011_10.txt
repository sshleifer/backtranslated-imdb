It was the best Muppet movie I have ever seen! I know that Miss Piggy fancy appointments as a child was the cause of Muppet Babies. Songs will remain in my mind forever. Just I say so, because the stupid Nickelodeon show Hey Dude song is still in my head. Unfortunately, little of the threads there. But in any case, what I like is the animal after the credits saying "Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Hasta Luego!" It made me laugh so much. My absolute favorite game at the end. I was surprised that the characters of Sesame Street jumped at the wedding. I'm just glad that this film was very interesting. I took it out of the library, and now I bought it because I can not keep a copy of the library forever. In conclusion, I declare this is the best film I have ever seen! In my case, it's even better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!
