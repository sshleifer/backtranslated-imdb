<br /> <br /> There is a Star Trek canon - a lot. With Canon we know the history of the future. Advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new people, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> COMPANY largely ignores most of ST canon. The sad fact for a long time, serious fans. As one, I suggested that the producers, at least, take a look at the first few episodes of TOS and retro therefrom. - but do not <br /> <br /> Phase pistols, a large part of the technology, look much more modern than found in TOS. Old style Star laser cannon, slower conveyor gold speckle effect - this is what I expected to see. In addition, I did not expect to hear a dial tone on the basis of pure sound effects similar to the TNG, but far away from each TOS sound effects. <br /> <br /> In the first of TOS (original pilot: Cage), we see Starfleet with more formal military point of view - a little old Navy land. With the Company, we see a shocking disregard for rank. There is a military code in cartoon STAR blazer than in business. <br /> <br /> It's great that Captain Archer is not sure about the universe needs (quite unlike Kirk, who has never lacked confidence in his use of human justice), but inside ENTERPRISE everything seems to be as an equal. Unprofessional, not knowing more distant from the formal sense of military service than found in any series ST - and that says a lot <br /> <br /> Casual country opening song says about family travel, but not! Adventures important large warship. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE looks to show us mostly fun, warm-fuzzy study of human relations, and not to take us to the historic, bold, rough, high stack space exploration. <br /> <br /> I would choose the Adrian Paul playing captain and a senior person to be a doctor. However, I liked the actors for the most part. Linda Park, an outstanding ballroom dancer from Boston College, no doubt well-developed. Symbols that make up the crew seems to be thoughtfully created. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE begins his run more than did the last three Star Trek series. Let's hope for a good future!
