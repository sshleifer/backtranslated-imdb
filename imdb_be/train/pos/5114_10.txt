While Urban Cowboy Sun proceed with the same testosterone, you can find a rodeo, it provides a clear picture of the day and time in the city Texas. I also believe that to really criticize this film, one would have lived at the time and the relative place that it was made. Had good music, interesting times, and yes, a little "rough and lame" on HONKY tank roadhouses. Relationship Bud and Sissy, as "two ships passing in the night", has been well thought out. When Pam tore note that Cisse wrote bud he repeated the tragedy of many real life romances. The whole story was well thought out. I thought that the cast and crew did an excellent job. I thought the screen the game was well written and directed. Scott Glenn was to receive an Oscar for best Supporting actor.
