"I just wanted to see you laughing in the Purple RainÂ». It Excell film. He was re-designed for PG-thirteen But in any case, the first film and the greatest prince. Next sucks. But I have not seen for many years, so that's what I remember about it. Kid (Prince) has to juggle the victory over the love of his life, Apollonia (himself), keeping the group together (Revolution as themselves) and the tension in his family. But his rival group (The Time, as they themselves) is ruining my life. Morris (himself) try to steal Apollonius of The Kid. Just like Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent it, laugh and cry, and if you luv it, buy it.
