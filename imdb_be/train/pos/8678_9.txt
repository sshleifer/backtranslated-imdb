Butch peacekeepers? Obviously. After a violent start with Spike, Tom and Jerry all swinging away at each other, Butch camp calls and he wants to know why. This is a good question. <br /> <br /> Â«Cats can get along with dogs, can not they?" he asked Tom, who nods in agreement. "Mice can get along with cats, is not it?" Jerry nods "no", and then see that it is not the correct answer. <br /> <br /> They go inside and draws Butch "peace treaty" (complete with professional art!). Most of the rest, and the bulk of the cartoon, it's the three of them very well with each other, that a refreshing change of pace. I found it interesting to watch. I have a million of these cartoons in which every beat each other over the head. <br /> <br /> Anyway, did you know that the world will not continue. A large piece of steak spells the death of the "peace treaty", but on the way it was a nice change, and even some of the usual Tom and Jerry clever humor.
