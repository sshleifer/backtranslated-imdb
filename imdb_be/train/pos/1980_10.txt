One of the last great musicals of the 60s. I was 7 years old the first time I saw this film, and he has since been always a favorite. Musical numbers are all memorable. In 60 years, people who have been cast in musicals actually had musical talent (as opposed to certain Oscar nominated current musical based in a big city in the Midwest). All the major roles were cast ... handsomely Ron Moody shines as Fagin, as does Shani Wallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was menacing Bill Sykes (which, fortunately, has no musical numbers, lol) and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as Pluto were also great. Mark Lester comes across as an innocent tramp, who was intent Dickens when he wrote the book! Then, of course, there are dozens of dancers who perform in the "consider themselves to be", "I have something", "Who will buy" and "soon", many who were children! This is a great show for the whole family.
