This film is one of the most underrated films of its time. When watching this film, your full of action, and if something is not really are happing, humor un match. Brilliant writing for a movie that has been done to give us a bloody mixture, the game show where contestants are criminals, and the near future, when the general public all my thirst blood.Also Arnold Nha disappoint some of his best friend liners.I not want to spoil that anything for you, but I'll tell you when Arnold gives his "I will return the line" He gets the best answer to all of them in this film. I hope you enjoy this gem as much as I did.
