The true story of a bunch of junkies robbing is not as honest businessman drugs, jewelry, weapons and money. Someone might say that this is a tragic story of America's over-eighties, which crashed into drugs and AIDS and the world of high free love sixties. Honestly, it's just ordinary people who have no goals in life, sitting around a buzz and decided to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of his master plan? Once they have their own things ... they will sit and get high again. A great plan. Even if you do not know the story, there is no suspense in this film and without any surprises. The fact that Cox is trying to make some kind of folk hero of these characters, with party scenes and installation of production is weak and insulting. The story has been better with a more direct approach. As it is, it's just a sad story of a small-time drug dealers killed big time drug dealers. The more history, more than one, John Holmes. It is the center of the story anyway. This film was about him and his life. He was alone in Wonderland, with the wonders of the fade. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although it is not official, Boogie Nights best option Holmes lives. This is not entirely factual, but it is much more enjoyable.
