I started to ride horses recently and, as anyone who has ever traveled should know, I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented the Spirit on a whim, just trying to pack up my life complete as many horse-related material as I could, and I was amazed at the results. <br /> <br /> What I expected was a good feeling Disneyesque movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes. <br /> <br /> What I got was a strange film, filled with beautiful scenery and animation, as well as an amazing story that has great potential to warm your heart. <br /> <br /> The spirit of the wild mustang in the Old West, which has brought the whole world collapses around him when he discovers that people are slowly taking in his homeland. The story unfolds with a wide range of characters, some human, some animals, they are well-written, and most of them are nice to look at the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who loves a good story, and who has praised the history and animals. <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention, but I feel that it is very important that the animals do not speak in the film. It was a really nice break from Lady and the Tramp animated films, which are now used to.
