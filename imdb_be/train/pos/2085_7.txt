Sidney Franklin «The Good Earth» reached classic status thanks to the timeless stories and wonderful effect, especially by Louis Ranier, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of O-Lan. Rainers performance is so full that it is almost unrecognizable. With very little dialogue throughout the film (which is long), Rainer belongs instead to the face and body language. She looks and acts the Chinese to the fact that someone is not familiar with her work can be easy to confuse it as such. <br /> <br /> The film is still relevant today, as it explores the rags to riches stories and universal themes that come with it, if it is easy and wife O-Lan finally achieve financial success after years of hunger and poverty, they find a life of property, but not enough meaning. Only then, when they return to Earth after fighting off a swarm of locusts (special effects used to create them are still incredibly beautiful, and watching), they find fulfillment again. The usual formula is narrated with a unique point of view of the Chinese family (especially for 1937) makes the film classics. Money is worth nothing without friends and family, the point that the film really drives home in his last 10 minutes with a full emotional conclusion.
