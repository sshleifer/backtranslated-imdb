12 Disney animated classic intelligent film is told through a simple story. Although a bit dated, it deserves a place in the list of classic Disney. <br /> <br /> This is not one of the best works of Disney, but satisfying. One of the most "simple" works Disney, yes, but it retains a certain magic and charm (that old Disney is well known). This was an important film because it saved Disney from a sticky situation. If it was a failure, then there would be no more than the Disney animated classics. <br /> <br /> «Cinderella" once, how to get back to the 1st animated Disney classics ( "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"), because it brings the genre of fairy tales. It is not clear where the story takes place, but I believe that it is somewhere in France, because it is based in the fairy tale by Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of cute characters such as Cinderella, the Prince, Bruno (the dog), Jacques and Gus (the two main myshe), Fairy (for the fairies she was sure funny), the birds, the king and the Grand Duke. <br /> <br /> Jakes very smart and funny. I love his voice. In fact, there is that of the mouse, as the quality. Gus can not be that smart, but he is with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> The King of fun, but I think that's what makes it so funny that his short temper. The Grand Duke is very tough guy and funny too. They are two of my favorite characters in the film and responsible for many of the funniest moments. <br /> <br /> The Prince is definitely one of the most charming in Disney. There is no doubt that Prince Philip with "Sleeping Beauty" was inspired by this prince, because they are very similar in appearance. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (stepmother) does not have to be pretty because it is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughter (Anastacia and Drizella) is not much better than her. However, the stepmother is not as annoying as it is ugly and selfish daughter. Cinderella, the protagonist, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella gentle, kind, beautiful and cute. By the way, I think its a beautiful pink dress much better than the one that gives a good fairy. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (the cat) is a funny malware. The way he walks, sticking his nose in the air, and it is arrogant and snobbish facial expression makes it funny. Oddly enough, it is very similar to his stepmother, when it comes to personality. He is always the same as the ratio with respect to the stepmother of Cinderella. Lucifer is the right name for him, because he is the devil, and a cat. However, there is nothing annoying about it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is simple but nice, although not among Disney's best. The best song in the film «Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo». <br /> <br /> There are many famous talented speakers in it, such as James McDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Louis Van Ruthenia. <br /> <br /> Despite the simple form, the film has a good work of art, as well as its good parts, but never something "out of this world." However, the palace of the king spectacular masterpiece, being really grand and colossal.
