RKO studio decided to lend as the William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur of Britain, on one of its larger budget effort to cash in on the popularity of The Thin Man. They succeeded to some extent. <br /> <br /> A lot of people forget that in addition to and before Nick Charles, Bill Powell also played in several films Philo Vance in the title role. So until now, he was pretty well established in this role. Dr. Bradford does not make so many liquid lunches, Nick Charles, but the core oversaturated Nick still there. The difference is that while Nick Charles married the heiress, Dr. Bradford working life as a doctor. This helps in calling it a detective and he actually does in this film. <br /> <br /> He got two murders to solve. Jockey falls off the horse, who gets to the finish line a great race and dies for no apparent reason. The coach suspects that something was afoot, but he was faced with a more traditional method of bullets. This is after he comes Bill Powell assistance. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy had a stabilizing effect on the Bill Powell, than Jean Arthur. Arthur plays like a giddy lady, what did Loy. But it works here and she and Powell have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> Always reliable James Gleason is a police inspector in the role of Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. All they needed was here Asta and perhaps Eric Blore as butler Powell was essaying this part. <br /> <br /> If Powell and Arthur were signed at the studio we could see a whole bunch of Bradford films.
