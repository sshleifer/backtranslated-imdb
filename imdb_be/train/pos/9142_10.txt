Purple rain ... What more can I say, the name speaks for itself. But I think that all the actors were well chosen. The film was a great story. I loved it! Since then, as I watched this movie, I'm stuck in the eighties, and I'm only 13! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died, and he gathered all your music, and Apollonius was sitting on the staircase with his earing in his hand. Critics say his drama, but I think it's more romance. Murphy Brown also did a great job in the movie, in fact, he acted as he did. I'm so glad that I've seen this movie. The song Purple Rain, sang beautifully, was so soulful. I cried several times.
