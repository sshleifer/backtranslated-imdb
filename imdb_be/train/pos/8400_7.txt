I chose this film at my local library. Faced with the director on a film festival at the end of last year, I was interested to "check" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film takes a fresh look at familiar topics, love, betrayal, friendship, jealousy. It can be a little «Talky» at the time, but never enough to fully immerse the film. I enjoyed watching the love story with characters that clearly belong together, and watching how they make conscious decisions, not as horrible a "drop" of something as important as love. <br /> <br /> The contrast between this film and the average low-budget shoot-em 'up black film is very different. Check it out. If you're lucky, your copy will be delivered with a copy of the soundtrack, as did mine. Good stuff!
