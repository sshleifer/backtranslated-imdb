Spoilers After I picked up the book "Evil Angels" when it first came out, not knowing anything. Just to give the press and Austrialian people break here, I was pretty far into it before I began to doubt the guilt of the Chamberlain. The author is clearly intended the reader to understand why the company jumped to conclusions that they did. John Bryson said just as it was presented to the jury (and picked up by the press) arterial spray, then actelone (??) plates, Dr. James Cameron's confidence that the collar was cut with scissors, the child can not be taken completely out of her clothes with buttons more buttoned, bloody handprint, etc. it's pretty convincing. In the end, they were experts in their fields, who have testified to lie for no apparent reason, and the fact that evidence was totally wrong was not obvious at all for me. It was also very technical evidence, it is difficult for the layman to understand. From this point, for some rumors testimony in the trial, it is unlikely anyone ever heard of a man attacking Dingo; people did not believe that this is possible. The public is suspicious of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, whose origins are, it seems, the cult, and all sorts of wild notions of them contributed to the emergence of guilt. If it were not for the dedicated, dedicated lawyers who have worked tirelessly to investigate and confront the trial testimony, find clothes Azaria later there would not be enough to get Lindy from prison. The book shocked me for that reason, I reluctantly came to the conclusion that someone's guilt ever since (except OJ, of course). I was thrilled that the film had to be made in the case and did not think it could be done better. I always liked Sam, who I could identify with the brand, and Meryl was perfect, as always. Beautiful photography, pursuing music. I think it is not only very good, but very important film. It is a pity that he has not received a lot of publicity at the time it was released.
