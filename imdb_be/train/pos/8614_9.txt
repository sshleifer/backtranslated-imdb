The film held my interest, mainly because Diane Keaton is my favorite actress. I do not agree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot is not intricate. I have not had any problems since it (perhaps some people too much Eggnog night). The film was a very sad and moving, as well. What else do you want? Alexa Davalos is a great new talent (and beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott does an excellent job with his hand, as well. relationship between mother and daughter may have been a little unrealistic, but the behavior of young people were not in the movie. It was a tragically sad but instructive. It sure beat the other shows that were on TV New Year's Day evening
