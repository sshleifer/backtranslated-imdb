Oh, Kelly / Sinatra brands suit the music. So familiar, does not it? Yes, but it's not the one you usually hear about. At this-a-way town. But if you stick around, you can learn something. Well, probably not. Anyway, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors on leave for three to four days. Joe is the "Sea Wolf" and Clarence, book type, ask Joe to get his "lady." Now, after they picked up a penny, they receive little Donald home. That's where they meet Susie, that temptress Jezebel. Just kidding! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks he does. Is he right? Or is he a moron? Or is he just the wrong company? Find out all this and more when you see {} trumpet fanfare Anchors Aweigh! <br /> <br /> P.S. If you want to see Kathryn Grayson be anything but annoyingly sweet, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
