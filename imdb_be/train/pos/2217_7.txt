I'm usually skeptical about watching movies or mini-series based on the novels, because the script is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (I guess it helps that the author was the executive producer and a writer, huh?) <br /> <br /> cast is outstanding. I can not describe how much I loved to see such a wide range of participants (by Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, Robert, Richard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> location settings ... I was expecting to see the house and cottages, I alleged in my mind that what I saw on the screen was a bit different. . However, it was not enough to make me not like a mini-series <br /> <br /> I recommend it for those who have read the novel, you will not be disappointed if you have them. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
