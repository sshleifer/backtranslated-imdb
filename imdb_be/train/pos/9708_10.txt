I never watched the program before you even came highly recommended by my family members. Oddly enough, my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (this scene) and it showed several landmarks, when I first visited. <br /> <br /> This is my interest in going, so I bought a 1-series on video and sat down to watch. In addition to the recognition of some of the places I found that not at least a little bit surprised. Once again, the Air Force was responsible for the production of another example of the best comedies in the world. TLOG easily ranks up there with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python, as probably the best. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that I was hooked on the program at this time. Characters perfectly and show extraordinary depth while maintaining a frighteningly realistic edge. Appearance of the program is perfect, and displays the time the gloomy feeling of the North (no disrespect to Hadfield, which I found very welcoming and warm place). <br /> <br /> I just hope that it continues its originality during its run (which is based on the 2-series, which has completed its re-run in the UK last night, it certainly is). <br /> <br /> Well done BBC !!
