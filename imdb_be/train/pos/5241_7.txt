Great movie by Thaddeus O'Sullivan showing strong performances from a variety of British and Irish actors. Transactions of the film is also a thorny subject, and effectively captures the hopelessness and gloomy atmosphere of 1970s Belfast. Surprisingly realistic, it does nothing to celebrate either side in this conflict. On the one hand, it shows a young Catholic father trying to raise his family without being involved in the trouble. On the other hand it has to do with a gang of loyalists who intend to propagate violence. Very interesting and, fortunately, it is interesting. Nha expecting any laughs, though. 7 10.
