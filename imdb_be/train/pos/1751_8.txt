40 Year Old Virgin, Andy Stitzer about, forty-year-old man working in an electronic store and does not have much of public life and very uncomfortable around women. Some of his colleagues in the store to invite him for one night, and they discover that Andy is still a virgin, so they plan to help him lose his virginity. Once in the store, Andy meets a woman named Trish who gives him her phone number, and ultimately Andy works up the courage to go on a date with her, and they begin to truly love each other, but Andy, all still very uncomfortable when it comes to sex, and he will have to say that it is Trichet, to his embarrassment, when he can actually get up enough courage to tell her, before things get uncomfortable. 40 Year Old Virgin, is a good direction, a good script, good comedic performances of all the actors, a good movie and a good film editing. Movie stars and is a co-author Steve Carell, who does a very good comedy breakthrough performance and his letters to the film very well. I was very pleasantly surprised with this film. It's sweet, funny, interesting, fun, nice, smart, good-natured and have a good time. This movie is as good as this year's Wedding Crashers, and both films are two of the best comedies I've seen in awhile. 40 Year Old Virgin, actually shows a lot of talent and it is put to good use, and it works as a comedy and romance, and it is sweet and very fun. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
