It was a movie that I've heard about the whole life growing up, but I never saw him until a few years ago. This reputation proceeded him really. I knew that Michael Myers, saw mask, saw an advertisement for all the poor sequels that followed. But I grew up in a decade, where Jason and Freddy had a fatal seizure horror games, and I never thought that most of the Halloween franchise. Boy, I was cheated with cheap knock offs. <br /> <br /> Halloween is really the most film. Now, according to today's standards, it's not as a graphic and intuitive, but this film delivers on all other levels of most horror movies are not able to achieve today. Atmosphere that makes John Carpenter's so terrible, and the fact that it is set in the middle of the quaint western town is a testament to his ability. Lighting effects down right terrible, with the "Shape", it would seem, it appears and disappears into the shadows if desired. Simple but effective rigidly score only adds to the uncertainty. <br /> <br /> performance of all the players well done, with some nods to Jamie Lee Curtis and Pleasence. Ms. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode, because she is so nice and vulnerable. This is even more frightening when it persecuted by Michael Myers, because the director and the audience so much invested in it, we want it to survive and escape. <br /> <br /> Pleasence plays Dr. Loomis, as a man on a mission, and it works well. It adds a sense of urgency in heavy city finds himself, because he knows that evil pursues them outside. <br /> <br /> In general, not only a great Halloween horror film, but a great film. It works on many levels and attracts an audience and never lets up. This should be a standard viewing for those who want to experience a really scary movie. And even more terrible time, try to watch it alone with the lights off. Do not be surprised if you think you see "The Shape" lurking around in the shadows!
