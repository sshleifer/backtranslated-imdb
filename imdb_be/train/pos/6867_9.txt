I was born in 1982. The majority of my childhood memories in an extreme case in the late 80s and 90s. I watched Groove Tube for the first time in 2001 when I was 19. <br /> <br /> And I found it to be fun. <br /> <br /> So for those who think that something is "off" can "t be quite funny 30 years later .... think again! It's funny, even if you have no idea what the 70s were like the idea of ​​flared pants make you cringe. Who can argue with Bosa clown type, which reads adult literature? There is a lot to laugh. Scrotum doll in the end, it's the best.
