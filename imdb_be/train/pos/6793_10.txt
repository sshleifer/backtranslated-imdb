I love this game to death. Ever since I was 9 years old (I'm 15). It great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and do not forget, ultimately, strange shapes dragoon! I'm still waiting for a remake, prequel or sequel to this exciting video game. <br /> <br /> You play Dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be quite the hero. In this adventure, you will encounter wonderful creatures and bosses. You will also be faced with some friends on the way, which have their own special element. Such as fire, darkness, ice / water, Thunder / Lightning, Earth, light and wind. There are also elements known as the Dragoon Spirits, which allow you to turn into a magical creature of legend. Dragons, wizards, creatures called winglies and evil creatures you will encounter in this action-packed adventure, thrills and excitement. One of my favorite games, Legend of Dragoon!
