All I can say is the first film of the season, that caught my attention. I chose it because of the actors Gere and Claire, and the story looked promising..I only watched it, and I can tell you - I'm astonished. There are shocking scenes, true..but is what makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, these things are happening right at this moment. And there are experts who are trying to change things and make things better, and that get laughed their commitment. In fact, I can not feel the "touch of Hollywood" in movie..and that's what makes it better. And Claire and Richard did a great role, and deserve 10 from me.
