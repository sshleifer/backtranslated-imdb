At this time, The Muppet gang are trying to get on Broadway, with Dire Straits to keep them from getting his production, which led to their split. But it Kermen does not stop, and its definition keeps things do not move forward until after the receipt of transaction together, he gets hit by a car and sent to the amnesia! <br /> <br /> This is a mockery, in particular, of those old cars starring 40s musicals actually like on a musical, but there are usually many zaniness and wonderful moments thrown in the pot hysterically funny moments (the boomerang fish N Zealand, the water stunt display Gonzo's, in the rustling of the company, among many others), but with a big heart too. Muppet writers do not hesitate to conventions, on the contrary, they covered them up to the point where it is almost a pleasure to see such "allows you to put on a show," a story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dreams. <br /> <br /> While it is not as original in scope as the film Mappaet, he got a lot of eye-catching and memorable songs, wonderful places around Manhattan, and even some intonation interspecies love (and marriage) !
