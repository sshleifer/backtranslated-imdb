I did not expect that performance Gackt and Hyde have just done as they were, and I do not expect them to be filed in this art well-developed film with enough story to keep you interested and enough variety to make it original . This film was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I will be in search of the next film as it is. I especially like the fact that it's a vampire movie, but it was not cheesy vampire flick, as well as no more than embellish this fact. The characters were all human traits. As shown by the growth of the characters were incredibly tasteful, and it makes you really feel sorry for them throughout their life. I give this movie two thumbs up so far. Definitely the best film I've seen in the last five years.
