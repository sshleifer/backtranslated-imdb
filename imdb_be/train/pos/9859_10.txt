Ice Age, not only animation of the year (in my eyes), it is also the best animation I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Teaser excited me last year, and I spent many happy hours on the site. Scrat is cool! As well as the rest of Sub Zero Heroes. <br /> <br /> The animation is gorgeous. Your heart really goes to the character of this film. They have good lines of dialogue and well-developed. It is difficult to say which of them really steals the picture. <br /> <br /> I felt their way with laughter, tears and bewilderment. Nothing was forced or made. The feeling was present, especially in a dramatic second half. The last film to affect me, it was deeply Anastasia in 1997, as Fox production. And before that it was The Land Before Time, 1988. All of them have a real charm and eager to entertain the entire audience, not just cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
