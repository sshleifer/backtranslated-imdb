This is done to ensure that the crime of "Not Another Teen Movie" made for school. I laughing all the way through as 2 war inept bands with each other and with each other. Unsubtle comedy through open jokes and jokes that kept me rolling all the way. I believe that the biggest gag throughout the film was the fact that the time never seemed to go forward, leaving the characters trapped in the 30s.
