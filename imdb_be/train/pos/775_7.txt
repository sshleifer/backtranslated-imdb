It's strange, but somehow impressive story about love. Personnaly, I have never run a twist-off stories in real life. But, I have an image. <br /> <br /> This is a story that promises to be "sick" from the title. But, after I watch it, I did not get this feeling of "disease", which I would, of course, against the rules of society. It is something beautiful in this film ... something impressive ... I can not disagree with the help of any moral or community rules. <br /> <br /> The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, develops and finally ends. You feel when that love blossoms, the first whispers approaches. You feel a connection. And not only me, but this is not immoral. You even hope that it will not break in the end .... it can not break down ... this is not the case. You feel the pain of broken deer in the end ... <br /> <br /> But, I need to add a negative spin on this comment ... I do not know where the story is not somehow * showed * give a feeling that these relations are only in form but not in content. You do not have a common history, but only in fragments. If the film began, the relationship between Kiki and Sand was already in place. Thus, there is no concept of the nature of communication. You feel the tension between them only ... the struggle between the need for love and the desire to break the connection. I think that this line to Sand Kiki says it all: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do as I ask you» <br /> <br /> The film is likely to stir some questions. what love is and what should be moral ... and where the boundary between them. I do not know if the idea of ​​the film "love conquers all ... even social and moral standards" or "love is not perfect ... no matter how and where." But in my opinion, this film is a success, for the simple reason that it makes you think ...
