This film, along with my favorite WESTFRONT 1918 Pabst-directed movie, and I enjoyed it more than his much more famous films, which starred Louise Brooks (such as Pandora's Box). This is probably because they are both very similar to neorealist films that Italians have perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style is called the film to use non-actors (only common people) in everyday settings to create intensely realistic and engaging movies. <br /> <br /> In this case, a film about the French and German coal miners, so accordingly, the people in the roles, it seems like the miners - not actors. The central conflict, as the film begins, there is a huge mine is located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one large mine, it is divided on the border and the German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite the presence of more unemployment in Germany. It is, language differences (illustrated perfectly in the ballroom scene) and the First World conspiracy to create a huge gulf between the factions - with the result that WE against them mentality. Later, an explosion causes a huge fall in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Risking their own lives, they argue that there is currently a partnership between the miners and men in general. <br /> <br /> Film strong criticism of xenophobia and tried in vain to get the German audience to see the futility of war and hatred. It was beautifully touching film with some of the most frightening and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. Given the history, however, the impact of the film has been minimal at best. It's a real shame as this, Westfront 1918 J√ÅACCUSE (Gance) and All Quiet on the Western Front (Milestone) were large messages of peace and harmony, but in the end, there were setbacks in a positive swaying public opinion. Thus, from a historical point of view, it is surprising and sad relic that is worth a look.
