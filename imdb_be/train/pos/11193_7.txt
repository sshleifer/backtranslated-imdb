I kind of liked the lonely lady. Give PIA break. It looks great, and she has very pretty eyes. What's not to like? The scene where she gets raped by Ray Liotta with a garden hose was kind of rough and brutal. In fact, a lot of things that happens in this movie, rough and tough. But its a bad movie. Many films that trashy is not all bad. I liked it better than the Valley of the Dolls, who was not only bad, but boring as well. At least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> Pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer. Watching her speech about Pushkin and Byron, a man three times her age are incredibly flat. I am sure that Pia nice person in real life, it just does not appear writer vibe. She looked much happier when she worked as a hostess for this guy from Saturday Night Fever and wearing shiny disco dress. <br /> <br /> A few scenes are funny. The one where she says the actor, two-timing, that she was pregnant, and he rolls his eyes and jumps on her to "stop hanging around!" All the time, he almost fawning over every Bimbo, who flounced past. <br /> <br /> nervous breakdown scene Pia good. Probably, it was a mistake to go as a supernova on it (vortex floating face and freeze-frame screaming - wow) and its subsequent mindless stupor like overdone <br /> <br /> The adoption of voice tone. Although. I want someone to do something that we in the classroom drama. <br /> <br /> But, again, it's rubbish, we are talking about. You could find worse than any movie a week ago in the eighties.
