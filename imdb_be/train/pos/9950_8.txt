Very nice effect with intertwined history, which actually does not suck. Interesting enough to deserve to look instead to skip past to get to the good parts. With Jenna Jameson and Asia CARRERE helps revive it, too. Jenna that sweater and these glasses is simply amazing! It is worth picking up just to see her!
