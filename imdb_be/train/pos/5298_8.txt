John Waters gave us a really good movie. This, of course, is not without its shocking Waters-esque moments, but it's tamer than his older material difficulty, such as "Pink Flamingos". "Pecker" brings us back to the early primary stage of John is that it reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor, which was evident in "Polyester". Overall, a very fun comedy with some great moments!
