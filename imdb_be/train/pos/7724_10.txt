Of course Star Wars (movie I saw at least fifty times), beating all other special effects, but this film has everything else! <br /> <br /> He has a horror of (non-graphic), romance, robots, witty witty, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects and drama. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie a couple of years ago in a revival with the recent defeat of the seals, and I was amazed at how well he had today. I thought that the old style of the 40th years of electronics will look fake, but they somehow looked futuristic and Moderne. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with girlish innocence that is hard to beat still get growth because of me. <br /> <br /> Krell monster appears in ray beams still scares bejebees with me. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all know that "Big Bird galaxy" is probably modeled much "Star Trek" from this film. <br /> <br /> No one has yet to beat Robby the robot, from the point of view of the person <br /> <br /> (I'm sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This film is, in general, is the standard that all other films Fiction will measure up! <br /> <br /> Honorary mentioning driven electronic bill that kept us all on tenterhooks.
