I feel a little protective this film, because it was my introduction to U.N.C.L.E. poem. The year was 1972 and I.T.V. I spent all eight functions in one bumper-term (and then reboot runs «The persuasion" starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore) on Saturday night. He was chosen «The Karate Killers», to open the season. It started with a cool sequence of actions as Solo and Kuryakin sports car got attacked by a squadron of thrush mini-helicopters. I was a fan for life from now on. <br /> <br /> After the basic credits (nice to see a title sequence is a special place of the usual practice of slow action shots), we go to the lab of Dr. .Simon True (Jim Boles), the inventor of a new formula for the extraction of gold from sea water. True wife Amanda (Joan Crawford) had an affair with thrush agent Randolph (Herbert Lom). Ruthless guy actually, he kills the doctor and his wife, before hunting for the formula. True prepared for this event - it is divided into five segments, each written on a photo of themselves, and sent it to the five daughters, all of which spread around the world <br /> <br /> Solo. Kuryakin set to get the first formula, which leads to a series of episodes in different locations, and cameos from the likes Savalas (as fisted Italian Count), Terry-Thomas, and Curt Jurgens. One of Dr.True daughters - Sandy (Kim Darby) - accompanies U.N.C.L.E. boys on their global mission. <br /> <br /> Gathering formula yeast turns up and makes them pass it, before whisking them to their secret base at the North Pole ... <br /> <br /> UNCLE Of all movies, it I feel one should was made specifically for the movie. Hurt, being a product of television, even though more than one a little more expensive than usual. No location data was not done, and how the various segments meet are repeated usually between scrap culmination U.N.C.L.E. and thrush. With actors, Joan Crawford memorably unnatural in his small role, and Curt Jurgens bad as miscast sugar daddy. As London Bobby, Terry-Thomas as beautiful as ever, and Herbert Lom well as the main villain. Kim Darby grates, though, as "Sandy." It should be ordered to stay at home. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that it manages to be more fun and interesting than many of the official release film of the time, including "In the stone", "Casino Royale" and "ambush". I would like to know how to Solo and company escaped from yeast H.Q. after Randolph's death, though.
