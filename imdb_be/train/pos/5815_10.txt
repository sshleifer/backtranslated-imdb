I was a kid .. crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance .. It was and is the greatest of all time. A few days ago a friend gave me a gift .. "LunokhodÂ» DVD .. I just could not believe it! So I took my time and seen the movie again .. After many years, and he hit me back in time. I almost cried. Not for Michael Jackson, but the good old days, I remembered back than when I went to his concerts, enjoying the music and dancing. The film gave me some other point of view, than back when I was a kid. You can really see the parody that Michael went through his life. Thank you Michael Jackson get me back to those great times in your great music and dancing. It's a shame that people have forgotten you .. I did not, because you have given me great moments of your music .. All the best for you, wherever you are there ..
