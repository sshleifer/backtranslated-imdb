While prices have gone up a lot, and some details have become dated, any homeowner who struggled with the problems of home ownership should get a lot of laughs from this film. I know what I did. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings, classified with the executive of New York, decides to move his family in the suburbs of Connecticut and build yourself a nice house. It falls into one hilarious jam after another, from mortgage claims to construction difficulties, as the costs and the construction schedule continues to escalate out of control. I thought that was the most ridiculous scene where Blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water. They dig down hundreds of feet, but never found the water. However, only a short distance, a few days later, in the basement of his house, to be a flood! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give plausible idea how harried Blandings steam overloaded problems they never perceived and Melvyn Douglas is even better, as the Blanding his lawyer and family friend. <br /> <br /> The only caveat is that social relationships have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blandings portrayed as a bit naive dimbulb, having no idea how much extra trouble it causes, and there is a black maid (the horror! ). So, you will enjoy it more and more do not watch this movie through a social prism 2003. <br /> <br />
