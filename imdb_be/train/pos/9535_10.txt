Road to Perdition movie unfairly bypassed attention in this year's Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and, in my opinion, his best work), the director, who, three years before won an Oscar for his well-known but controversial American beauty. This is a great movie, and at the same time, in the end, bitter and sad. <br /> <br /> is the story of a relatively wealthy and happy family of appearance in the difficult times of depression, as Michael Sullivan, a father of two children playing great Tom Hanks (I'm not his fan, but I must say that) it You are the people for the local mob boss, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, thirteen years old boy, Michael Sullivan, Jr., perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance learns that his father is working and how much money their families live. Obeying his curiosity and his desire to know the truth, which he accidentally witnesses a murder committed by John Rooney, the son of his father's boss. Such a discovery is striking an innocent soul, and this has led to numerous events that changed his life forever. period atmosphere, all backgrounds and decorations beautifully crafted, editing and cinematography almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the film, the most important points and the points of the film and the film's key success factors is difficult father-son relationship in the bad times. They are shown as deep, strong and believable. Tom Hanks is doing fine and has one of the best performances of his career in a very unusual role for him, and all applicable across the board is excellent. Finally, it is worth noting a very good score for Paul Newman, and as a result we get the excellent work of all people involved in the creation of this beautiful (but once again the sad) masterpiece. I think Road to Perdition film belongs to the greatest achievements of this decade, and certainly one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> My rating of 10 out of 10
