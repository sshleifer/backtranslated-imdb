Yes, it's the top of the film. Bruce recommend it more. Gay or shed his big DOCO for those who love cinema. Very funny, interesting and boring. Never a dull moment. Great access. The film is made with enthusiasm and interest in the subject. Some of the performances, and simply amazing. If you only find this movie on VHS is still very much worth a look. Excellent. 10 out of 10. I have to see some of this years DOCO about ten years ago and did not understand what I was watching. The interview is very revealing about the ego performers who, as a heavy weight boxer is trying to make its way out of the ghetto. The film director was apparently the first timer so that achievement. Cool. Track it down.
