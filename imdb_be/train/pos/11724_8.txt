Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is the host of a cheap horror show. Once she finds out that she's dead aunt left her some things, Elvira goes to England to pick it up, hoping it will be some money. But to his dismay, Elvira learns that all her aunt left her in her house, her dog, and a cookbook. Elvira decides to live in the house anyway, but with her strange dark looks and her amazing abilities, she can not live in peace. All the neighbors are now turning the entire city against her, and outrageous attitude and views of Elvira, better watch because Elvira is on fire! I really liked this movie, it's really fun to watch Elvira get all these adventures, it is just great. The entire film puts you in the Halloween mood, of course, it's stupid jokes and cheap, but it's nice to look at. I would give Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark 8/10
