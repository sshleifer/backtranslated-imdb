Surprisingly funny and original show. Cast since hysterical Julie Brown (Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun) just perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American Girl-grandmother Kim), who plays a lesbian who is always arguing with his partner and business partners (Asian restaurant-WOK-DON "T RUN) I laughed more during this show than any other I have ever I am seen (including Newhart is one of my favorite shows) If you like movies like the Naked gun and Airplane- you'll love this series !! one of the best moments of the show Cindy Williams plays herself. When she snubs Tammy dry cleaners, Tammy is a picture of Cindy Williams in her coat. picture of Cindy Williams does in Mr. eprystoyny act with bowling upside down. it is surprising to see the actress Cindy Williams is able to play myself as. Soap Opera, as with many unexpected twists during its short run. I can only hope that this will ever be released on DVD with special bonus many special functions. Funniest series, I've never seen !!!!
