Anyone with a little boy in the house that will not watch black and white films should put this on their TVs. If the child goes, I wonder what all the screaming on the screen and shooting is about to tell him that this picture is for adults, and that it is not big enough to watch it. This will keep it there for a few minutes; directed by George Stevens and his team will keep it until the end. <br /> <br /> I think my father did it for me, anyway, and I'm the best man for it. This is a classic adventure yarn, located in India during the British occupation, especially the trio of sergeants of the army, who are their close alliance before the dissolution, as one prepares to marry his beloved. Help comes in the form of vicious Thuggie uprising, the soldiers found himself teamed up against. <br /> <br /> «Gunga Din" was one of the great films to come out of the finest years in Hollywood, 1939. Even more than most big movies from this Golden, she entertains in a very direct and accessible manner. The theme music is instantly hummable nirvana. While shot in California, the camera work (only in "Gunga Din", which has received so much as an Oscar nomination) has a blowing grandeur that feels very much like a Raj hundred years ago. Action scenes shot in a very realistic manner, not too strong, but it is very dirty, people fall and shoot and run to all corners of each frame in such a way that feels real, not staged, as some DeMille biblical slaughter festival. <, Br /> <br /> script does not just create a scene, he also develops a relationship of three sergeants with large dollops of humor. The emphasis is on Sgt. Cutter, in pursuit of the tall tales of golden treasure. It is rare for the gunman Cary Grant and his lightness just for a film that never takes itself seriously, even as it develops taut suspense. <br /> <br /> Securing trio Sgt. MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), who is obsessed with his elephant Annie and tries to protect the tool from their own foolish schemes. He's just as funny in his own way, leaving Sgt. Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr., showing some interesting Errol Flynnish dashes) as one of the love interest, and enough ground to know that he has to quit his boyish mate and grow. <br /> <br /> If the "Gunga Din" was a Lifetime movie, it would be the efforts of Joan Fontaine to save their man from his two lost friends and skull crushing jokes. But as this film the children, the emphasis here is on how the trio must stay together and keep Ballantine from fate worse than death, not only marriage, but as a tool indignantly exclaims several times, the tea business, too. <, Br /> <br /> political correctness police hard on this film, not so much a gender issue, but the idea of ​​the salvation of the poor Indians of British soldiers from the vicious Thuggies. It smacks of a colonial apology. Fortunately, this film was made because, when, and, therefore, the producers do not feel the need to explain the apparent liberalism on the basis of the film, that the three sergeants, so full of folly and false racial honor, should be stored together with the rest of his army of modest bhisti, that only one of the three had any time when he was looking for his approval. After all, for all of them swashbuckling glory, the true victim of the movie involves the title character, played by heart so painfully Sam Jaffe <br /> <br /> In the past, when this film was made, a movie mogul Jack Warner was saying you .: you want to send a message, use Western Union. Nevertheless, it seems that the messages were flying fast and furious in "Gunga Din." I watch the movie now and wondering when the audience then had to wonder what Gunga Din was really up to when he led the cutter to the Golden Temple. whether he was actually a plot of revenge against its British rulers? whether he was justified in this case, especially given MacChesney in cold treatment from him? If Colonel Weed gives this glorious speech, a poem by Rudyard Kipling, which is loosely based on the film, was his nod to the madness of imperialism, lords over someone who has proved "a better person than I am" in the end they make more speech Guru acted in perfect manicured English: "You took an oath as a soldier, perhaps, to die for the faith, which is your country England well, I could die for my country and my faith as .. easy as you ... India, bye "<br /> <br /> you know, the same character also instructs his hard followers:" Kill for the love of killing To kill for love Kali Kill Kill !!! Kill! "This means we have the right to hate him and root for the British, and keep questions about what it all means for later. <br /> <br /> What's "Gunga Din" means to me, probably, is the most rapid, reliable, 90-minute ride of thrills on video. Cutter did not find a golden temple, but there is one to watch "Gunga Din for all of us."
