I caught this film at the Sundance Channel on one cable in the late afternoon. You may say, "Who loves the sun" is the perfect leisurely pastime stories, why do not. You hang out with the trio: Lukas Haas Will (refundable after abrupt withdrawal Every year ago), Molly Parker, Maggie (we learn that she is part of the Bloom family) and Adam Scott Daniel (he is a friend or foe or groom) picturesque lake falcons, Manitoba, Canada, captured in graphic compositions are adjacent to each other in bright summer colors against sunlight and shadow. And the support of a trio of two more family members in an open mix: Crewson is a mother Mary Bloom and BC Thomson dad Arthur Bloom. Writer-director Matt Bissonnette put ingenious deployment of the storyline and its various tentacles links - do not worry, Haas may be "sluggish" person, but the humor will come as Scott Parker and enter the ranks of the friends reunited, crooked smiles would break down and knew stir invention. Dialogues may be brief, or even zero, but we got to taste that cooking, stunned or interesting. <br /> <br /> So, "Who loves the sun" could very well be classified as railway sleepers stone. The chemistry between all five principles of certain gels and "burn", which gives an energetic ensemble performance. In the end, it's all in the family, and the film is not exactly treat yourself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Looks like the official site is still available on the «wholovesthesun.com» and there is information on the soundtrack for Mac Makkogany (Portastatic with guitar melodies and strings), where the assessment of exposure playing at the moment, and for the production scene notes, an interview with the writer-director-producer Bissonnette on how film and concept arose, casting and more. Always appreciate Molly Parker as its replacement is still fascinating performances in 1996 Lin Stopkuich on "Kissed", and she married Bissonnette, who "wrote the part of Maggie Molly."
