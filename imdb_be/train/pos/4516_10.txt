On Educating Rita Julie Walters was one of my role models, and its performance in this, as the woman who helps the man she loves to get in sync with his feminine side is gorgeous. I would never have believed her character in the hands of a lesser actress, but Walters pulls it with pleasure and panache. Pasdar gives his best performance to date in the male lead.
