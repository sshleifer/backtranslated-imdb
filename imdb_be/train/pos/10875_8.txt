the first main slasher Australia hits the screen with a bang. And blow. And a piece. And scream or two. . And a lot of blood, fright, red herring and a lot of laughter <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many around the first Cut - this is the first script Dave Warner, to get, although it has a few other or Optioned or in the negotiations; This is the first major film from director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; and it is also the first film producer Martin Fabinho. And for a bunch of guys dipped his fingers in this genre for the first time, they sure know their stuff. <br /> <br /> Cut tells the story of a bunch of Australian film students who hear about the slasher, the Hot bleeding that has not been completed, because its director, Hillary (Kylie Minogue), was killed by an actor playing a psycho killer in the film . <br /> <br /> Despite the lecturer (who was an assistant director on the night Hillary died) warning them that every time someone tries to start production Hot Blooded again someone dies, directed by Raffi (Jessica Napier) and Hester producer (Sarah Kants) decided to go ahead and finish the film. They assembled a team and manage to get the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Ringwald) to return to Australia - in fact, to its original location - for the completion of hot blood ?? 14 years after the shooting closed. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the future slasher, much bloodletting comes ?? for a long time with lots of laughs, some good panic and rocking Aussie soundtrack. Cut shows that Australia can make a good, mass-market horror film just like Hollywood <br /> <br /> This feature finely crafted, with excellent special effects, a tight story and a killer. - Scarman - is a welcome addition to the ranks of Michael, Jason and Freddy.
