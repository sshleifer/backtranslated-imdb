I really like this movie. Bozz is an ultra-cool, not to intimidate the soldier who does not want to go to war. His personality is similar to the way to Yossarian in Catch-22, Joseph Heller classic novel about men and war. This film, however, is not set in the combat zone, but also in the pre-war military training teacher. This remarkable film is all about the sickening realization that the war in Vietnam was a mistake, and the people who were tied to be sacrificed in a losing cause. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is brilliant as Bozz, a soldier who has shown how much real love and compassion for his neighbor to the soldier, as he did the contempt and disrespect to the establishment, who tried to kill him. Bozz quite cool and not plussed, testing and tuning their military commanders to give them a goat at every opportunity. He is a figure of Jesus Christ with a degree of psychology, "salvation" of his fellow soldiers, and showing those in real need, a way out of this man army. <br /> <br /> The acting and the action is clear and believable and as "SleepingÂ», Tigerland descends from Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, as one of the three best Vietnam movie in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Five Star, the top choice.
