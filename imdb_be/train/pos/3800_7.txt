World of Dragon Hunters is a 3D gravity challenged world. Asteroids, bits of buildings and amazing flat plants float in the atmosphere, while the ground against most of the characters served was nowhere in sight. This world is like a neverending story that did not work out, there's a world away. <br /> <br /> It's funny enough, the villain here World turkey as well. This time it is a huge dragon skeleton with glowing eyes. Heroes has a great silent warrior, greedy and annoying sidekick business management side of the duo and surprising useless animals. They are connected by the most talkative little girl in the world, which, to my chagrin, did not die a horrible painful and, hopefully, early death. <br /> <br /> The animation is great. Voices and sounds at the highest level. It is a pity that the story is as simple as can be imagined. They are going to stop the world turkey, they reach it almost at once, they beat him. End. There is no real character development or plot twists. Not even the ones that I would expect from a movie with such a plot <br /> <br /> The result :. It's cute that you need to watch, children are likely to enjoy it, but that's about it. Many depth in the world (pun).
