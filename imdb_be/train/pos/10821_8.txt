I also saw it when it is released in 56, and was impressed since his final scene. If the answer to the «High Noon», it is suitable and appropriate response. The notion that this line is moving, "City comes together" is much stronger than a lone message of personal heroism «High Noon». In this theme, «Concho» is phenomenal predecessor of one of my other favorites of all time, «The Magnificent Seven». Both Sinatra and Conrad give an impressive and convincing presentations, especially the transformation of Sinatra from bullying his younger brother to the liberated city savior. I can only hope that at some point all the friends and relatives, which for many years I have caused my affection for this film will be able to experience it for yourself.
