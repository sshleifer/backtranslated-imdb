I was brought to this film from each other, and skeptical of the Swedish film with subtitles. However, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this wonderful film. Excessive cruelty that man can surely been portrayed, without overloading the image - although animal lovers may have to protect your eyes for a short couple of seconds, somewhere in the first 10 minutes. The traditional history of humility against violence and hoped that, in comparison to the tragedy was illustrated with satisfaction the new angle of view of spectrum use characters with very natural disadvantages and features. I especially liked how the film turned out to solve some aspects of human behavior hypocritical regarding displacement, discrimination and sanctimonious hypocrisy. An absolute gem of a film that I will contribute to all who will listen.
