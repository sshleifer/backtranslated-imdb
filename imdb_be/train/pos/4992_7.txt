In general, I find difficult to accept, Loretta Young, is too concerned about their appearance and too feminine in all the wrong ways. But this lyrical romance Frank Borzage, and despite the fact that she plays with low self-esteem Patsy, who agrees with entirely too much abuse from fornication Spencer Tracy, she was direct and honest and exciting. This is an amazing little film, played mostly in one room hut in Hooverville unusually advance of depression more romantic and idealized. Tracy playing a windy, difficult to accept "a regular guy" who would be a terrible chauvinist bully and, by today's standards, it softens the hard edge of his character, and almost makes it attractive. There is good support for the work of Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never got as far as it should be), and the script Swerling is modest and effective. But the real heroes Borzage, who always liked to dramatize the true love in lyrical close-up, and Young. You seem to want to slap her and tell her character smarter, she's too good for this guy, but she dew and convincing, would you rather watch their story plays to a satisfactory conclusion.
