Narrative ?? Or written, visual or poetic epics ?? As a rule, try to avoid too MY signs; readers and viewers, after all, can be too easily overwhelmed trying to keep track of who is who. This is especially true in the movies, I think, simply because we can not easily go back to refresh our memory in the movie. The audience, like me, however, does not have this problem, because we see all our films on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago, I met with Audrey Tautou, French actress, which I first saw in the Fabulous destiny of Amelie Poulain (2001) and then in A Very Long Engagement (2004), both of which were well-crafted and complex history with great characters. It used to offer more than the other in both directions :. More characters and more difficulty <br /> <br /> Currently, other directors have used these techniques before Robert Altman with a player (1992), Short Cuts (1993) Gosford Park (2001), i others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer made it with a mad, mad, mad, mad world in 1963 in the comedy almost epic proportions. Unlike the film, the first directed by gives us the ability to "see" in the head of some of the characters and the second, some scenes are repeated as a means to refresh the viewer's memory, as the history of flip-flops between the different time periods. <, Br /> <br /> main ?? core, put it this way ?? The story concerns a young woman, Irene (Toto), who said of fellow commuter on the train, she meets her true love on that day. This occurs within the first few minutes of the film. Clever irony at this point that Irene does not know that the young man in front of (Gilbert Robin), it may be that "one true love. And it is not ... <br /> <br /> They go separate ways with neither realizing the potential value of their close encounter. However, chaos results throughout the day, not only for the two young people, but also for the rest of the characters that appear in a series of artfully constructed and interwoven vignettes that everyone would like to nowhere, and yet ... <br /> <br /> If the story was just that it can be, as a rule, boring, and even completely on index. It is not. The script and the director of plagiarism in our expectations with many innovative scenes that are too banal, but which turn into believable, extraordinary events, which allow two possible lovers meet again. For example, the next time some birds poo falling from the sky on your book or paper, consider your alternatives, two signs to do the obvious choice, which should take place before Irene and her man of destiny meet again. Or how about a flying stone chip on your windshield? Consider again what would happen ... <br /> <br /> All of this is quite interesting. What is more interesting to me was to assess each new person who has come together and is trying to decide whether this guy is the one for Irene, whether he was in fact a young man on the train. It held me guessing for a while. <br /> <br /> I'll let you think about that, you should see this wonderful race. <br /> <br /> It is recommended for everyone.
