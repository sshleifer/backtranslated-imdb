Committed films rarely. Even my favorite movies, tend to have disadvantages - Rear window looks a little unnatural at times, the nature of Chris Elliott in Groundhog Day is not working, the score in the best years of our lives too cheesy, early night Kabir is a bit too slow - but this film perfectly executed from start to finish. <br /> <br /> script is brilliant, great acting all around (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston is strange, all the cast shines), directing and inspiring photos, and music notation in contact without being intrusive (as some Miramax estimates that too manipulative). Every sad moment really moved each time the light makes me smile. This is truly one of the best films I've ever seen, and I wish there were more films like this. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Reese Witherspoon went on to stardom after this film, but I am sorry to see that her recent films much more escapist and foolish than this serious film, which is about real people , real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! A must-see.
