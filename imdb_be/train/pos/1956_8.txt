In fact, I think that this film is another example of an easier target than a really bad movie. In fact, the film is made very well in many respects, and it is very interesting. <br /> <br /> So, the scenario is a bit confusing, but it's a genre. The film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale. Just like all the old film noir classics, it also has a script that twists around you so that you do not always know how to understand it at first, and it can be stretched when you think too deeply and try to put all the pieces together. This genre. In general, the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and, in turn, wondering, without giving the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also easy target. The truth is that it looks great, and she says her double entender-laden dialogue so that zhuzh it into something mysterious, sexy and fun. <br /> <br /> Direction more passable, as the person giving it to - you have to keep the audience interested in "or she or is not she?" question for two hours. The annex to the winding scripts and funny performance Stone, this is done effectively through the direction of creating a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very sharp and modern at the same time, with the direct production lines, to go along with Stone sexy curves. The frame is always nice - press pause at any place and there is something interesting to the eye <br /> <br /> The film is effectively based on the fact that there were tricks in the first film, and turns them into something more real. , Especially sex. "Catherine Tramell bisexual ... How shocking!" It becomes treatment more than anything had happened here, and, as a rule, sexy film used to best effect. This still tickles, but have not done so, it is easy to shock and noise, as has been done in the first. I will not say that it is not still a few tricks, because, let's face it, this film is supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> And it's a funny movie. This can be an easy target, but if you watch it for what it is: noirish, femme-fatal drive, meandering, sexy, yes-she-or-didn't-someone who-dunnit, you are obliged to use it ( no pun intended).
