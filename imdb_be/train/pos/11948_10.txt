"Match Point" and now the "scoop" are both convinced me that not only Woody Allen does a neat job, making films in the UK (and that Scarlett Johansson is properly cast), but confirmed that I had known for many years: he should not 't focus on neurotic rich New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays a journalism student Sondra Pransky, which Sid Waterman (Allen) wizard puts in his vanishing box, where she meets the ghost of the murdered reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells her that the serial killings that plagued London were very millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Thus, she finds him, and ... well, I do not know how much I can tell you, without giving away. But I can say that this is probably the funniest movie Elena in years. In the same throughout his unique style of humor (especially the line about his religion). <br /> <br /> So, you're sure to like this movie. If nothing else, it will make you fall in love with London. But mostly, it's just so damn fun. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you have to love this one.
