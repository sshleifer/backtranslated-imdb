SPOILERS AFTER: <br /> <br /> I really am in the minority on this one, but I liked this movie. This is not a classic, but it is certainly engaging and rather adrenalin fueled ride. I definitely thought it was worth at least 7 rating. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the reason I liked, because I have not seen original.Something tells me that the film, as his strong fans will be people who have not seen the original version and therefore have little, to compare it to. This is not a masterpiece, but I get into it quite a lot, and it really made me want to see the original. <br /> <br /> There were a few things that I loved about it. One of them was casting Kowalkski. Mortensen was excellent and really brought a lot of charisma role. After all, the bulk of the film fell on his shoulders, he really should be excellent, and he was. It was a great role for him. <br /> <br /> Another great thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that it is made for television. I had no idea this was the case, if you look. He sure seemed like a major motion picture, and I would never have guessed that it was not a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I also discovered that the story is very exciting. I'm not one for militants, but I got involved in it. Plus it was much more than a thriller that there was a drama, mystery, a love story, quirky people scatter you applied. (I do not even recognize Priestley.) And it was touching. It was not a great movie, but it's watchable. <br /> <br /> And then there's the ending. It packs a powerful punch, and if one were related in the story up to this point, it is very hard not to fade at the end. I do not know how I feel about the final. The idea is that Kowalkski survived and although I am very skeptical about how it would be possible, this is a movie and the realism is not a component that is always in connection with the making of the film. <br /> <br /> So I must say that I found the end of an incredibly unrealistic, but it is very touching in a manipulative way, which I usually do not like it, but for some reason, almost excusable in this film. It should be recognized that many things were just props for the scene (can villains were more stereotypical?) But the creators got a lot of rights, even if they got a lot of things are not as good. However, having said that, I admit that I can understand why someone who is a big fan of the original will hate this version because, although I have not seen the original, I have seen a lot of original films that I liked to be remade with terrible results. (My biggest dislike is actually sequels.) But I can understand the low ratings, if the original of the highest quality. <br /> <br /> compared people is Smokey and the Bandit. How about a road version of the "Legends of the Fall" meets "Thelma and LoueseÂ», eh? I sure felt the touch of both films (both of which I'm a fan.) I do not think, however, that it was a great movie. It was better than average for me, but far from great. But it absorbs, adrenaline fueled, touching film with excellent casting of the main character. My voice is 7 out of 10.
