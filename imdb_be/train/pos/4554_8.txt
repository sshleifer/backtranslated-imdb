There's not a lot of overcoming a handicap stories completely as in Christy Brown. Born with cerebral palsy in 1930 in Dublin, his parents thought that his injury was mental and physical. Although eventually correctly diagnosed, Brown, at the bottom of the family of the working class with almost 20 children, had to push myself just appreciate his family. Through the use of its only fully functioning limb, his left foot, he learned to write and paint like the skills he has developed professionally. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film version of his autobiography Brown's "My Left Foot" such a great presentation is his humility. As a director / writer Jim Sheridan and Daniel Day-Lewis was able to tell the story so as not to scream and seek attention to the melodrama. Merry fight scene and frustration, as well as the minutes of glorious moments winning light traps so miraculous stories, but "My Left Foot" is real and inner inspiration. <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis is the easiest to highlight. Play any such serious physical disabilities should be a daunting task. Not only that Day-Lewis gives us a very complete picture of Christy, but he also manages the chronicle of growth, improvement and internal change at different phases of his life. He plays Christy 17, when he had the opportunity to limited language and emotionally unstable as strongly as he does intelligently learned Christy, who is struggling to cope with, why he can not find entirely platonic love. The last topic of the film's strongest and it would be good for Sheridan and co-adapter Shane Connaughton really flesh it. Regardless of Day-Lewis makes us understand and sympathize with all the element, giving the work, which is so true often is not enough time to think, "Wow, he's such a great actor." Those are the most flattering speeches. <br /> <br /> It is equally important, but at the expense of more subtle means is the work of Sheridan in the film. This story about the day-to-day life and struggle. While Christy has a unique set of circumstances that complicate his life, his struggle is not unlike our own, and Sheridan grasps this concept completely. Christy struggles with love, parental neglect, self-esteem issues and opportunities. His fight only physically manifested (in the literal and figurative sense) than ours. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of a large family Brown and unique place Christie in it. Drama develops naturally when maximum tension and humor comes in much the same way. The dinner scene, when Christie learns that his doctor / teacher - the woman he loves - is about to marry his brother Peter is an excellent example of the film of both Day-Lewis and effort Sheridan. It is built so well Sheridan that comes out when we are ready and Day-Lewis takes us out with his stunning performance. <br /> <br /> On the other film component of strong brand Fricker, Mrs. Brown. I did not know that she won an Oscar, but something about her performances as a loving and wise Kristen's mother just cried Oscar worthy. Her love for Christy and the constant struggle for it just seems so convincing and heart, and she gets a lot of sympathy for her situation. <br /> <br /> Emotional hit film of this story surprisingly minimal. Perhaps it was part of the victim is trying to create a movie that feels organically people. The two must be compatible, but I think it's difficult to tell a story that feels true to life and one that provides plenty of dramatic moments that take our emotions on a roller coaster. Choosing to belittle the last was definitely a wise one for "My left foot". Brown circumstances speak for themselves - they do not have to be compressed to a weighty dramatic impact <br /> <br /> ~ Stephen C <br /> <br /> Visit my website moviemusereviews.com more.
