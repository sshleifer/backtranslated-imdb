I first saw Martin Day, when I was only 10 years old, at home, on The Movie Channel, and still remember the impact it has made on my life. He touched me like no other film did not touch me, and I remember my eyes glands. <br /> <br /> After the first time I saw him, I could not find anywhere else. I would like to ask around, and no one has ever heard of the movie! I believe it was one of those increasingly rare films that many people do not know about that one, and I do not mean, nobody knew what I meant. I searched and searched for years, checking video stores shelves and scanning cable TV listings, but always came short. Finally, I found out in 1996 that I could special order it, I did, and probably watched it at least 50 times since. - and it still makes me cry every time <br /> <br /> Day of Martin Martin Steckert, the man who is in prison (but a really nice guy), who seeks to make it back in a special lake where he grew up as a boy. This is a special place, where he lived in nature, spending time with his dog, and he was left alone to enjoy life. Soon, in the movie, he runs away and begins to make his way back to the lake. <br /> <br /> It is not long before the police found him, and Steckert missing child as a hostage in order to convince the police to back off. Soon Steckert and his hostage (2nd Martin) are the best of friends, and there are many fun adventures together. - rob a toy truck to hi-lifting the train, all on the way to this special lake <br /> <br /> throughout the film, Steckert has great memories of him in the lake, like a boy. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the ending for you, but I tell you that this film is a must see. This is the best film that I have ever seen in my life! I, without a doubt, the biggest fan of this movie EVER! I managed to find a song that the two of Martin sing throughout the film ( "I'll be back to where I came from ...). I was even planning a trip to Canada to see the lake and the house where Martin. The day was filmed Crazy, I I know - but this film is just so much to me.
