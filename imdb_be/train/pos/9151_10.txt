crude savagery Savage Island scare the hell out of you! Trust me. <br /> <br /> If a boy with estranged family Savage performed on some of the city SliCkeR tourists, of Pa Savage wants revenge, and he will stop at nothing until he gets it. <br /> <br /> This is a real horror movie with some really wonderful moments of horror. <br /> <br /> In addition, a negative review clearly comes from someone who lacks the proper knowledge of the film. The filmmakers chose the lighting and camera-work, in order to reflect a dark, murky and egdy mood of the story; in other words, to obtain certain aesthetic. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film won several awards horror film festival.
