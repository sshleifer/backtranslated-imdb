If you've seen this film, you were in Puerto Rico. I lived in Puerto Rico, his whole life, and must shamefully admit that we (PR) live in chaos right now, and drugs are the main reason for the shootings and murders have almost every day. These people will shoot at anyone, anytime, anywhere, and many innocent lives have been lost because of this. We do not feel safe anymore, and in addition to this, our so-called "justice" is no longer moved by truth and righteousness, but the money, influence and power. «Ladrones in Mentirosos» based on a true, a sad fact, and accurately reflects the three main problems of Puerto Rico: the drug-related murders, money and power to manipulate our courtrooms, and innocent people and children, spoiled, and even die -this it. Ricardo and his wife Poli, with their true life story and their award-winning direction (**) were brave enough to present it all as bad as it is in Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country living nightmare It does not seem to end !!! ** They recently won the «Copper Wing Award» for best director in the world cinema competition at the festival Phoenix Film in 2006.
