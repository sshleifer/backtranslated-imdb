In Stand By Me, Vern and Teddy discuss who was tougher, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often discuss who will win the fight, too. Sometimes we get the absurd and compare a guy like MacGyver and Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now, it seems that we are discussing, guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It is pointless to compare, seeing that Lee died, but it is a pleasure. And if you go by what we have seen with Lee Jett in Lethal 4 and a black mask, you should at least say that it will match up well against Chan. In this film, he comes across as a martial art God. <br /> <br /> The black mask of a man who has been created, along with many others, to the highest combat vehicles. Their only goal is to win the war, that other people lose. They are unbeaten in a sense. Now that this premise for a movie, but what makes this configures all strange dance battle scene. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a miracle. He can do things with his body and that no man should be able to do. And that's what makes it look so fun. <br /> <br /> In addition to martial arts in the movie Black Mask with a strong sense of humor, and this is due to the chemistry that Jet has with his co-star, the police officer. They are great together. But to be honest. If anyone is reading this review, they want to know when the movie kick ass in the action department. And the answer is a resounding YES !!! Lots and lots of bloody senseless actions. You will love this film.
