Legend of Zu, I saw, was a very interesting story. I think a lot of people who do not want to not see the underlying mythology behind the movie. They were expecting something like Star Wars, and it was not so. Joseph Campbell, I think it would be like this movie. There were a few metaphors and hidden meaning that the average viewer could have overlooked. We all have within us Mount balls. We all have to go into our own cave when the blood in our lives. We all have to face our own insomnia ever. Of course some of the story was a bit confusing, and some actions were a little hokey at times, but I think that other aspects of the film is easy to do for him. I watched it again. <br /> <br /> I do not know if there is a difference between the Legend of Zu (which I have seen in Chinese with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (US dubbed version.) This can be simplified down to American audiences who really I would distract from the film.
