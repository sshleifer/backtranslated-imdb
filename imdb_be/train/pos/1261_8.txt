I really liked this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) provide accurate reporting and Harris nice top. Lighting and arrows corners in some scenes Harris make his face look truly diabolical. Unexpected plot twist at the end makes it interesting. Not a great movie, but nice. I gave it a 7 out of 10.
