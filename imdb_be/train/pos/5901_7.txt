This retelling of many recent films only it has fewer stars, fewer complications, and a fuzzy feeling to it. Abhay and Hrithik (plays Fardeen Khan & Esha Deol, respectively) are found at a friend's wedding, where their own marriage (unbeknowst them) begins the process are located. In an instant, two strangers in marriage and sent in a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples who go through the motions, like. As they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts are broken and / or corrected and love blooms. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you have already seen this film. The plot twists is the same, there is not a single element of surprise in the entire two and a half hour movie. All predictable. I just enjoyed it, because I've seen "Darling" (also starring wire Deol and Khan) earlier in the day and enjoyed their chemistry is that I said "why not" when my sister offered rent a "young" as well. <br /> <br /> Look: Because Kher co-stars, and it is usually expensive to do it <br /> <br /> Pass :. Because you've had enough of all this nonsense couples Festival! <br /> <br /> C +
