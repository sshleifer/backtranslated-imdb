How the Grinch Stole Christmas immediately stole my heart and became my favorite film almost from my first viewing. Now, eight views later, it still has the same effect on me as it did the first time I saw him. <br /> <br /> The writers Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman Who Framed Roger Rabbit fame do a fantastic job adapting the story of the Grinch on the screen. The direction of Ron Howard brought the story to full life, and, as a rule, the energetic performance of Jim Carrey as the Grinch stole the show. <br /> <br /> Some of the film's detractors argue that it is not the spirit or the principle of the original story. After reading the original story, I have to say that I can not agree. The film makes the same point about Christmas and its true sense, as the original story. In fact, it increases the impact of the story by making it more personal, showing us how and why the Grinch became who he was. <br /> <br /> * Moderate SPOILERS * (They probably will not spoil the movie for you ... but if you have not seen, and you are one of those who want to know nothing about the history, until you have seen it, you should skip the next two paragraphs.) <br /> <br /> I think almost everyone can relate to the terrible experience of the Grinch in school. I think that all of us at one time or another, have been unpopular one at school who was always elected. I know that I was ... and that is why I personally had much sympathy for the Grinch and what he went through. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Lou Who naive idealism, the belief that one can not be all bad, was rend the heart. When everything is turned away from the Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou decided to be his friend. If everyone could have such an attitude. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the only thing that might have made the film a little it would be better to further tone down the humor and adult content. It was quite restrained, but none of this adult humor (as if the Grinch closed nose first in the cleavage of Martha May Whovier c) does not fit the story like this. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to be on his Christmas classic, taking much deserved place next to the book and cartoon Chuck Jones as a must-see every Christmas season.
