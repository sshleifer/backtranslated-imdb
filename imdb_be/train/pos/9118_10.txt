I saw this film with a special screening of the work Owen Alik Shahadah. It is so interesting how this guy came from. Now it is likely to be a key independent African film director in the world. And I'm not talking about black filmmakers, I'm talking about the filmmakers who are rooted in the culture. The idea, if that evidence of the diversity and range of the African, with its 500 years later, the film is an African problem. But the idea does not fit that mold. Display of artistic diversity. The film is an all African cast but the theme is the human subject that most of us can relate to. I just love the soft comedy in it. And with a tandem Kora Zhegeda just strange, it really art-house gem.
