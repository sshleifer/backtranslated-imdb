The minute I started watching it, I realized that I was watching the quality of products, so I was not surprised to find that the script was written by Andrew Davies and was carried Camping Birtwhistle they both brought us beautiful one thousand nine hundred ninety-five production of Pride and Prejudice! So that's my only gripe is that Emma did not run to the 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes as Pride and Prejudice. The acting was superb with I think Prunella Scales as beautiful as Miss Bates, but I loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong in the same way. Language pleasure to listen to, you can imagine, in this day and age, having the right to go to someone without actually uttering a swear word? Samantha Morton was very rich, Miss Smith actually auditioned for a place a lot, as it was with Pride and Prejudice. I liked it so much that I watched it twice in two days !! So once again thank you BBC for another quality piece of television. I saw a version of Paltrow and that's fine, but I think the BBC version is much higher. Excellent production, I am very glad to have in DVD !!!
