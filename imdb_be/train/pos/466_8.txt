It was part of a very good historical drama. John Turturro well as tormented genius puddle and brilliantly reflects the manic mannerisms of the character, such as his strange dance. Emily Watson well in his supporting role as a sensitive lover Natalia. <br /> <br /> relatonship between chess and about madness Gorris well understood and familiar troubles Nabokov such as "eternal innocence" (ie "Lolita") are evident in this film. I think that will go now to read the novel. It was a touching and tragic ending, and it was difficult to keep dry eyes. Brilliant film!
