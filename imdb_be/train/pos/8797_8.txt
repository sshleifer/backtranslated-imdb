Great idea: 11 stories of 11 September. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach talk about the immigrant (as usual), just great (as usual). The Frenchman does a very good job and, while Burkina Faso, the film was a pleasant surprise. Nevertheless, Israel's film was a bit boring, and a Mexican guy, well, he has to stop smoking and to direct the work at a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
