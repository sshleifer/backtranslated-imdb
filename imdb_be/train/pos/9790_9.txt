Although the romance at the center, or rather in the lower part of the film, the story is told beautifully and subtly, and the game is a great actor. <br /> <br /> Yaara, studied at Princeton, returning to his native Israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend, the waist. Since Yaara practically lived with his friend's parents after his mother's death, she lost her foster sister. And because Yaara, blind from birth, guided and protected by the waist, her boyfriend's suicide as intolerable as it is inexplicable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the blind, the one who decides to solve the mystery of this death. Although without sight, she has understanding. Although she could not see that she is able to find what is out of sight, than the "normal" people around her. Thus, the film becomes an absorbing mystery Yaara searches for keys in the memory of her relationship with the state, in the home of her adoptive family, in strips, diaries, and people in the past and the present Talia. <br /> <br /> This was reported by Yara-s point of view, the film can also be seen from her point of view, because it visualizes what she hears, believes and presents. mystery solution is very conditional, but the search is conducted with such fine care and the answer was so nice and quietly, that the stroke time is easy to forgive. Truth is slowly yet inexorably, specifying not only the life of Thalia, but her relationship with Yaara. Tali Sharon as Yaara, effectively using his mobile face and voice, and quite believable and adults and a teenager. We accept fully its capacity by the end of the movie to find its place in the world more confidently. <br /> <br /> Note the precision with the help of place and action is repeated with small but significant changes that have never become tedious, dead -one action on secondary characters, as well as an interesting solution for the submission of Talia only in adolescence. I'm going to find fault with the final declaration Yaara like standing with Gadi, the last boyfriend Talia, on the cutting edge of rock, but the trip to the edge so exciting that the image will remain in sight more than her words will be withdrawn.
