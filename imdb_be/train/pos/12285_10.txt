Brilliant film adaptation of the novel, which glorified the relatives of the president of Chile, Salvador Allende was killed. In the context of a large estate, which arises from the ruins, is becoming a force to abuse and exploitation disturbances luxury property in favor of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, a brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates in the micro, which at that time would be a process, which leads to the greatest infamy of its history to the hardened Chilean nation, and the protagonist of which is Augusto Pinochet (Stephen resemblance to him inevitable: let us recall, as an example, that the image of the senator with dark glasses, making it a wink to the general, to start doing Palace). <br /> <br /> Bill August visits exceptional actor Jeremy Irons in serving the nature of which change from arrogance and extreme violence, a hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change. In Esteban fully apply the law of resonance, with great wisdom, Solomon describes in these words: ". The fact that freckle the same punishment that will serve youÂ» <br /> <br /> Unforgettable Glenn Close plays a splint, spoiled sister of Stephen, whose sin mobile loneliness, spiritual and platonic love was his wife's brother hard snow. Meryl Streep is also brilliant, a woman, whose name came to him like a glove Clara. With telekinetic powers, cognitive and mediumistic, this hardened woman, loyal to him stupid, conservative husband, it is an indicator of character and self-control that we want for ourselves and for all human beings. <br /> <br /> Every character portrait of virtuosity (as Blanca worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo unfortunate ...) or portrait humiliation, Stephen Jr., the senator's illegitimate child, which serves as an instrument for the return of a boomerang. <br /> <br /> The film moves bowel, we recovered some facts that should never be repeated, but it is absurd to still happen (Colombia sad example), and another reminder that against all, life is beautiful, because there is always people like Isabel Allende and only perpetuate the Bill of August.
