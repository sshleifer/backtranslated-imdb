This is an incredible film. I can not remember the last time I've seen the Swedish movie is layered. It's funny, it's tragic, it's convincing, and above all it is a piece of the Swedish small town life. She grinds clich√©s, and lives more deeply. It makes you feel a connection, not only the main characters, but also for all the characters. <br /> <br /> Big city girl tracing back to its roots, her small hometown to celebrate the 70th anniversary of his father, crossing paths with people she has not met for several years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a new approach. In the center of the history of the relationship between the three sisters (at different stages of life), which are not very close. Or, at least, he does not realize how close they are. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film are the undefiled cast. Firstly, I am more than pleased with the fact that there is absolutely no so-called "A-list" of Swedish actors in this film. Usually there are some actors who have the ability to find their way into almost every large-scale production in Sweden. This time the production company managed to keep its real cast of actors who really seem to love their profession. Sofia Helin, was probably the first Swedish actress, as Eve rose to prove that you do not need words to convey emotions. <br /> <br /> The writing is also very attractive. Dialogue more than plausible, and in comparison with other Swedish films from the last year or two, it's miles ahead. Mary Bly controls everything from the beginning, and if you do not know, you'd never guess that this is her first time writing and directing a feature film. I can not wait for her next. <br /> <br /> As soon as you start to look at it, you really want to see it through.
