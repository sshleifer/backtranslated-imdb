For the "no budget" film this thing rock. I do not know when in America will like, but we laughed all the way through. Some really Funny Funny things. In fact, not Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The actors and the music rocked. Cars and fun and even less in your face cracks us things. Whooo Whooo! <br /> <br /> I've seen some of the actors, but never anything like this, one or two of them, I think that I have seen in advertising or something somewhere. Basically it shocked! Fortunately, I was able to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors.
