This film is one for the ages. Firstly, I must say that after watching this one time, he became one of my favorite movies. Why? simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director) put together a work of art. Where 99.9% of the movies these days are purely entertainment, directed by Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us a reality, giving us a learning tool to know why it happened. The media back and back, but Ben Coccio looks of school shootings in the face, able to go where no other form of media has never set foot in the minds and hearts of the two young men who plan to kill their classmates. While it certainly is a graphic and horrible as it may be? Gloves come off, lie and sugar coating of our media masters shallows and we were taken to a place where we can find the truth in what happened. Sometimes it's not just a screw loose, all like to think not, sometimes hatred and isolation deeper, more human, we have shown that these boys are us, and we them. Society has left them behind, and the consequences are terrible and real. <br /> <br /> The respect and affection of their loved ones. The lesson we must all learn, thank you very much for making this film, Mr. Coccio, I hope with great expectation that you continue your career the set.
