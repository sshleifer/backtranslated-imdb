Dick Tracy is easily the best comic book film based did today. The film has the same feeling as a comic book, while remaining true to the color scheme. Series Batman rose, fell, rose and fell again. Dick Tracy is a real endurance, as something that adults and children can enjoy. The good guys will prevail over evil, no blood and gore to get the point across. Al Pacino does an excellent job of his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna's memorable Breathless. But the best work to date is Warren Beatty, which simply represents the Dick Tracy as well as he did with Clyde Hill. I can not wait until it comes out on DVD April 2, 2002, my band is exhausted.
