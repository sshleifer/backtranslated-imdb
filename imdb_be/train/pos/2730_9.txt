I saw it in the theater at the time of its initial release, and it is worrying that, as I'm sure it will still be. It was the first part 68 and it is still making the rounds in cities across America, there has recently been a mass murder in my hometown, where I saw it, when a man went on a shooting. The freshness of this event close to home, combined with the dramatized true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience. It really brought to life the wonderful acting, Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was familiar with the novel based on the true events of Truman Capote and the writing and directing Richard Brooks wove event and interpretation of Truman in convincing gritty cinematic adaptation. Music with Quincy Jones to effectively assess this story. I just saw it a couple of times since then. It was too real. Almost like being a witness to the crime itself and the top together with the killers. I would give it 9.0 possible 10. Society is so insensitive to violence and crime today, it probably seems slow and tame and can be viewed with less effect, but for those who are older than 50 years, this will be the hallmark in the examination criminal psyche.
