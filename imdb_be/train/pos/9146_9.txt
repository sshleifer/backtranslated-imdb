This electrifying music have more than the breath of selfishness from his star, a musical genius, whose prince. The film 90 or so minutes of posing, but in fact it is easy to see why this is such a cult. <br /> <br /> As with the other films that focus around a struggling young musician who is trying to be great, it has a hint of drama in it, to add dimension to the musical numbers. Despite the fact that this film is not as good as 8 miles as a recent example, it is not entertaining nonetheless, and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side of things the story centers around the Kid (Prince) a young artist and a regular place in the club. Club owner upset with arrogance toddler and little kid knows that he may soon be fired and replaced by a rival. One side of the boy's parents had problems with his father abused her violently. In the course of the movie Babe learns a few lessons in life, and learn to appreciate their friends more. These are all things that we have seen in the majority of the drama, of course, but it is combined as a musical, very stylized musical. <br /> <br /> good cast. Prince is actually very good on the side of drama, if it is not striking a pose. He seems to be a man and Relatable. Clarence Williams very well as abusive father as well. Apollonia Kotero makes a good debut as the Prince of sexual love interest. <br /> <br /> The main strength of the film, however, is the excellent soundtrack. Musical numbers are well supplied and electrification. Prince is undoubtedly a musical maestro, though very eccentric. If it is inspired by it's big, but on the other side, he will often make songs that are exclusively for your own taste, and sometimes experimentation may miss fire, but it's the same for many musical geniuses. The soundtrack to this film great, though, with only Sexshooter future weak point. Show-stopping performance of Purple Rain is the standout, though. This is one of my favorite songs. *** <br /> <br />
