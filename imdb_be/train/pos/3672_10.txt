Layout documentary film about a pair of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Rubinek), trying to make his first film in the late 1970s. North Hollywood comic story about the struggle to pull together, despite a number of conflicting streams. <br /> <br /> North Hollywood working as a movie in a very similar, why is Spinal Tap (1984) work so well. Namely, although exaggerated in some respects, it is very close to the truth, and truth is of the "behind the scenes" facts that are very different from the public sector entity. It is not so easy to make a movie, and it should be particularly difficult in Canada in the late 1970s. Films include dozens, if not hundreds of people. Many of them have incompatible desires, motivation and personality. Especially important are the financiers and talent on the screen, no matter falls or becomes unreliable, at any stage, when the film is in production, it could jeopardize the whole thing, or requiring extensive reshoots or failure of the movie as a whole. <, Br /> <br /> So it is not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on those kinds of relationships. The result is a great movie that is both oars and tragic at the same time. The script and flawless performance at the highest level. This is a must-see for any first-time filmmakers, and those with a serious interest in the craft of cinema. It should also be more than exciting for any viewer with a modicum of intelligence and sense of humor. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 from me.
