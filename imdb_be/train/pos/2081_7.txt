First I watched 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): Well said by farmers in China, and their growth in popularity and struggle with what mother nature throws at them. This film is based on the novel awards and chronicle family, beginning with marriage-minded son of a slave. The film does a good job of keeping your interest, despite the somewhat exaggerated performance lead is played by Paul Muni. This chronicle, Wong Long (character played by Mooney) and how it works on the ground, buying more land, eventually becoming very rich, but then returned to the ground, where he initially started. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Louise Rainer, are the main thread of the story (except for the land), and despite the obvious non-Chinese actor, he does a very good job in showing the country and its people. It is clear that MGM has used his money to create a really good epic with this in an age where they could probably afford it. Scene locusts done exceptionally well, and the rest of the first film really looks good guarantee for the best cinematography award at the Oscars this year. The final determination of the epic is the fact that this story, and she pulled off quite well.
