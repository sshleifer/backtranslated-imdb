In my honest opinion, everyone should see this film at least once. It really put things in perspective, as I watched it. Although it was fictional, the film about something that could happen to your kids. <br /> <br /> It shows how easily the two children can hide, and their hatred for their school, and their plans for the murder of innocent students. This film would not work in any other format. They left with a hand-held camera perfectly. <br /> <br /> It reminds us of 20 April 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and then himself. It also reminds us of the media storm that occurred after. Everyone wanted to see the video of the shaft, and everyone wanted to see Basement Tape. <br /> <br /> This film is a fictional version of our dreams come true. We get to see the baby for the monster. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about this film is that it is not very good in the market, and few even knew of its existence. If there was one for viewing on a blockbuster, each would go to see what the big deal was about, Zero Day. <br /> <br /> I believe that this is the best film adaptation of the school shooting of the few who really tried it. Shooting itself takes only about ten minutes to an hour and a half long film, because it is mainly focused on Cal and Andre, and what they were doing up to this point. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, go rent it and watch it. I guarantee that, when it is finished, you will use the language.
