Technique De Palma struck his highest maturity by the time of this film, which is a perfect showcase for his classical methods, but unfortunately, like many of the films written by themselves De Palma, the story is more than the interests of Meta pushing an emotionally compelling story . <br /> <br /> The story begins with CRAZY scene in which Angie Dickinson masturbates in the shower when she looks at her husband. She then grabbed and raped while he was standing next to her husband selflessly ?? - and all this is revealed to be a fantasy Angie as he shakes husband mindlessly away at her in bed. She has a short scene with her son, the dead calling for Harry Potter, who makes a joke that "it will tell Grandma that he is playing with his Peter." Then she goes to her therapy session, where she complains about your dead marriage, before trying to seduce her therapist, Michael Caine. He refuses, and she is sick and feels unattractive and unrealized. <br /> <br /> then begins rousing 22 minutes almost dumb sequence which is perhaps the main point of the film. Among the many things De Palma, borrowed from Hitchcock's film is to understand as a purely visual medium to tell ?? and in typical fashion De Palma, he turns it into a way to show their formidable skills. The problem for me is that in this case, the person begins to feel that the stage is currently unduly delayed a further show mastery of the director. <br /> <br /> The sequence starts with Angie's Art Museum. She is watching a stranger, all involved in sexual or family activities, and then begins to get turned on the man sitting next to her. De Palma was able to say a very very complex story without a single word about Angie bringing in confusion, retreating, and, finally, to find and present the stranger in the back of a taxi, you are ready to surprise the lush evaluation of Pinomu Donaggio, which also killed Kerry. <br /> <br /> The second part of the sequence Angie slept with a guy and gets up to go back to her husband. Again De Palma crams a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue spoken, and Angie realizes that she does not have her panties, her husband at home, and without a doubt, I wonder where she is, she probably contracted venereal disease and that it She lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle. It's all very nice, but a person begins to feel a little strung together, as we are forced to do things such as take a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor, and then, almost in real time. <br /> <br /> ... Spoilers from here on out! If Angie again reaches the seventh floor, she killed a great woman with blond hair. Woman chopping away at it until it reaches the first floor when the door opens, and Nancy Allen to see her there. There is a wonderful sequence of slow, Nancy reaches the elevator, Angie reached for her, and found the killer blade ready to cut the hands of Nancy. This is followed by some shots electrification, Nancy looks up and sees the killer in the elevators of the convex mirror. It's all good, and by the time we have some dialogue again, do you think; "Wow, that was only 22 minutes at a purely visual storytelling!" Or maybe you do not, but I do. <br /> <br /> Junior Dennis Franz has a greater role as a sleazy and tough detective in New York, which would prefer that everyone else is doing his job for him. He Interview Michael Caine, making outrageous consequences (although it runs like a common thing), Angie wanted to be killed. Angie son there as well, and it intercepts with Nancy, and they embarked on a spy therapist Kane and find out who the killer is. <br /> <br /> Once again there is a strong link to the Hitchcock film Psycho in this case (as well as a processing Obsession Vertigo). Do you have a woman, we have to understand secretly a slut who die within the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space, in which case the elevator, but no shower. Then the relatives of the deceased to conduct an investigation, which shows that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill. De Palma even throws in a doctor after all, who explains the psychology of the whole. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting, but at the same time the viewer can start to feel a little jerked around, and this is my main reservation about this movie. This is certainly an important viewing and showcase some of the biggest setpieces De Palma, but it is the feeling that the story runs a solid third in the need to De Palma, to show and several indecent sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on it with wholehearted love . <br /> <br /> --- Check out other reviews on my site evil and bad paintings, film de-Merde, cinemademerde.com
