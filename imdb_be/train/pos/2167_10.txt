I saw this film in 1984, we first started watching «This Is Spinal Tap», and 5 minutes later we were ready to go to sleep. So we went together to see this movie. If you have any conspiracy theory going on in your head, you want to see this. <br /> <br /> The question you should ask yourself when watching this film is: How do you think the government will be able to do this? (In my opinion, there is no doubt that they could be) <br /> <br /> But I do not want to give too much information, as it will be a spoiler, and I think you have to watch the movie for yourself. <br /> <br /> But, just so you know, we'll talk about this film in 20 years, and try to explain it to people, it's not the easiest thing in the world to do.
