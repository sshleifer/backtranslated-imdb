It was one of those movies that I would probably never picked off the shelf, but he came to the IFC one day, and I said - Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If I changed the channel, I would have really missed treasure. <br /> <br /> The object of depressing - the young author paralyzed convalesces climbing accident in the lower class of the rehabilitation center. It would be so easy and tempting to do so manipulative Tear Jerker. But this does not happen, because it was written by Neal Jimenez, after he himself was accidentally paralyzed. A lot of Hollywood happiness here. All patients in the ward come from completely different backgrounds, but they share a sense of helplessness and being at the mercy of others. Stolz well as the type of "lone wolf", is forced into an uncomfortable depending on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is fine, as a former womanizer, the family is falling apart; but William Forsyth takes the cake as the cool guy decided to make someone pay for taking away their independence. <br /> <br /> See this movie.
