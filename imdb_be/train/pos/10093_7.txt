Beautiful saleswoman in London swept off their feet by a millionaire planter tea, and soon finds himself married and live with him at his villa in the British Ceylon. Although based on the book by Robert Standish, this initial setup is very similar to Hitchock in "Rebecca", with leading lady Elizabeth Taylor faced with great chief of staff at the mansion, and (almost immediately), her own husband, who is still under the thumb of the dead, but the dominant father. Taylor, a last-minute substitute for the patient Vivien Leigh looks creamy smooth in her high-fashion wardrobe, and her performance is strong; However, after her husband Peter Finch begins to drink heavily and barking orders at her, one would have thought her devotion to him, and masochistic (this feeling prevents completion of a). Nevertheless, the film offers a heady much for soap buff: the romantic drama, a little travelogue, which interprets the dance, the stampede of elephants and perfectly timed outbreak of cholera! *** from ****
