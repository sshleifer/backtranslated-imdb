"Citizen X" tells the story of Â«The Butcher of Rostov", the nickname for the abominable and corrupt Russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives from 1978-92. The film focuses on the novice detective (Rea), who doggedly pursued the killer against all odds in the face of recalcitrant bureaucrats in selfish and convenient denial. GBY product for TV, film offers a solid cast, good performance, replacement of the audience many of the gruesome details, but ran out of gas, both in docudrama style SANs such Hollywood fare. Even straightforward re-enactment of a serious and relatively little-known story is more interesting than the "Jack the Ripper". (B)
