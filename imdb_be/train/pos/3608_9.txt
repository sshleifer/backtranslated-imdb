Sports movies never my thing, but a handful of them work for me. The best are those that are less focused on sports and more on the character, such as Raging Bull, wrestler and Girlfight. This is an excellent directorial debut Karyn Kusama, and an outstanding first performance for Rodriguez. Girlfight feels like a realistic and involving, that is enough to make it a memorable film. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite forward on both sides of the strait. Diana Guzman, in her fourth year of high school, but because of her picking up a fight in the hallway it's close to expulsion. As a possible means of unleashing her anger, she signs up for boxing lessons at the club, where learning her brother (on the wishes of his father there). <br /> <br /> During the ninety minutes, we the audience to see something unusual. Diana literally change from a girl to a woman. We see it in his body as well as its behavior, especially if one of the boys at the club is drawn to her, and she falls into it. There is not a bad scene or lame / contrived moment in the film. The only fault I would say, can be corrected in the fact that one of the story ends with that feels like a work in progress note. In addition, Girlfight is a great movie.
