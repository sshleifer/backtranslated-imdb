History tells liquid. There are no interruptions. Flash back woven into the now seamless. The casting was excellent. Young Ya'ara were similar Ya'ara would look like at this age. Her portrayal of a blind man was made convincingly. Director Daniel Syrkina did an excellent job in getting the different actors to work together in this story. The cinematography is very good. You feel like you're with Ya'ara and Talia went to the side of the ocean to the edge of the cliff. English subtitles follow the script very close to Hebrew. It is interesting to note that even if "Out of Sight" is not a direct translation of Â«Lemarit Ain" Both names are very appropriate to the story.
