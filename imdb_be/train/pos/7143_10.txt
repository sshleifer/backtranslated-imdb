"Hole" is my favorite movie! Until now, I've seen this movie three times in theaters and is looking forward to buying it on DVD to be in September. I read the book after seeing the movie and was amazed at how well the book and the film were. The director of this film has done an excellent job restoring the book as a movie. In addition, all the actors selected to play the role of well-made plays their characters, especially Max Kash as a zigzag. Props to all those involved in the making of this film, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I would definitely recommend it for all to see!
