After watching the "Whipped" by screening distributor AFM on another night, I must say that I was very impressed. The audience laughed the whole way through. Unfortunately, each territory has already been sold, so I did not have the opportunity to purchase this film, but I really believe that this will be a great success both domestically and on the seas. I agree with the comment that "whipped" should not be pitched as a male "Sex and the City", mainly because unlike "Sex and the City," "Whipped," a satire about the acquaintances who never takes itself too seriously. "Whipped" ridicules the relationship in a way that the majority of sex comedies would not dare. In addition, a film that I screening at AFM had more plot and story than "Swingers," "Clerks" and "Sex and the City" put together. "Whipped" never slowed for tact and presented to the public with a non-stop comedy. Amanda Peet plays and other actors were rock-solid, which only made the film more impressive considering the budget.
