I was drawn to DAN in real life to the wonderful reviews and thirst dramedy, which was well written, thank you Peter Hedges-and because, when Steve Carell star in the film, you know, the audience is going to find in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, work, which is a very interesting and useful. DAN in real life delivered this promise. <br /> <br /> The film is so realistic, many families world wide, that lost a friend, and even went through life in search of something that will give them the magic back to their loss. With Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche amazing, their relationship was so beautifully done and says that their scenes were so real to their characters and their journeys. Cast, sets and story DAN made in real life, to be remembered, as we head into the holidays ahead.
