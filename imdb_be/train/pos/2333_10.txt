I recently started watching this show and I must say that it really made me laugh. You must evaluate the unrealistic aspects of it, along with everything else. Some other people said that this show should have a more realistic reaction of the dead, among other things. If you're going to take that Ned can bring back the dead to life, you have to admit that the other bits absolutely crazy show. I could not help but smile after each episode I watched. I really think that it's great to have a show there that can take a very strange thing, and actually make it look cool. I love the story, I think it adds that extra bit of surprise to the show. You can not always compare the old shows the writer to his new, you have to take everything as its own object. Definitely give it a chance, and just enjoy the funny parts, as they are.
