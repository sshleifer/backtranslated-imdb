Well that was quite noticeably small number, but I can not think I've seen it before. Reminds me of another movie I've seen in the APC Poitiers called "other days RUBY RAE" was also spots "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Pied Piper" and Lynne Ramsay in his performance. But this does not mean that they are not to the taste of links ... but they feel very modern and very fashionable ... that makes me feel like it's closer to advertising (as an approach to style and history) than work original and real filmmaker to come. <br /> <br /> cinematography just ... too perfect for my soul. Too coral filter (or coal) for my taste ... too cunning frame 12mm. Therefore, the impression left me a bit far - beware of art, which read too easy! French (they are a conservative bunch), seemed to buy it, as they were the jury, but ... but the choice of Cannes short film, as is known, conservative when compared with this selection of features, although it is interesting that happened during the last few years.
