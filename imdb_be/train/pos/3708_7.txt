Attorney drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse, where he is involved with a femme fatale in the film adaptation of the novel by Grisham. Altman creates anxiety, gothic atmosphere, but the script is weak. Sporting Southern drawl, Branagh convincing as a lawyer, and Davidtz is tempting as the object of his desire. Longtime pretty as a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do with his amazing character. Hannah and Beranger complete a large cast. After an interesting setup, bog the film down and really did not put on his original promise, but Altman is always worth a look.
