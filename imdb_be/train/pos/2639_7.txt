Being a supporter of the first Lion King, I'm definitely looking forward to this film, but I knew that there was really no way it could be as good as the original. I know that many fans are afraid of Disney direct to video films as I have mixed feeling them. <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1½, I tried to find out what has their own point of view was on this film. I'm going to be so pious about The Lion King, that I will cling to certain scenes, or am I just going to take this film as just another look at the story of The Lion King? Most of the time, I found myself embracing the latter. <br /> <br /> The Lion King 1½, of course, have their own cute and funny moments. Timon and Pumbaa eclipsed in the first movie, and, of course, deserve a film centered around them. People just love these characters! My favorite part of the film include the installation of Timon and Pumbaa takes care of the young Simba and surprise ending showing some great cameos. <br /> <br /> I could do without many of bathroom jokes, though, as the real reason all bowed at the beginning of the baby Simba Lion King 1. I believe that this type of jokes for the younger set (which in the end with ' is the target audience. I do not think a lot of kids are really concerned about the profitability of Disney on a straight-in-video movies.) <br /> <br /> However, I will say that I was a bit annoyed when they are directly related scenes from the original film in this film. I was just too familiar with the original, that these scenes are just stuck out like a sore thumb to me. Something will be different from the music or voice, it would just distract me. <br /> <br /> As for the music, it was not so bad, but do not expect any of the classics to come out of this movie. At least, LK2 had a good ballad «Love Will Find A Way." As voicework, it was well done in this film. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a great job, as always, and even new actors, classic comedian Jerry Stiller and Kavner (best known as Marge Simpson) did a great job too. You can even enjoy these great vocal talents even more testing Virtual Safari 2 DVD. This feature is definitely a lot of fun !! <br /> <br /> So, in general, The Lion King 1½ entirely perfect film, but it's cute and interesting. I think many fans Lion King will enjoy and appreciate it for what it is - a fun, light-hearted look at a masterpiece Lion King at the prospect of our funny friends <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating :. 7/10. My Yahoo! Evaluation: B (Good)
