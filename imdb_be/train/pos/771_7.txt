I watched a movie with homophobic way, my wife and her friend. Thus, I had views from all kinds of directions. Mainly, the movie made me laugh, the sexual tension was actually non-existent, and only notable actors Cyril and Mary Tudor Popistas. Yes, I think it is well played a role, even if the script is not suitable. There were good Romanian actors around, they just do not have a complex role. I welcome Puya entry into the film business. I do not know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope that it will be a good actor. <br /> <br /> My wife loves the movies, though, and I think that may have been the chords being played and to which I had no hearing. If the movie is trying to present an unusual sexual behavior and its consequences in today's Romania, it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Just imagine that the girl is actually a boy and a girl, the same story is simply boring, uninteresting story. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why he got all those BAFTA awards. In his book, he had to get into the "Better luck next time" award. (BAFTA = success in Romania).
