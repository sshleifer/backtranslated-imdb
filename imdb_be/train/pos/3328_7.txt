It is rare nowadays to find a romantic comedy that is not incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the film (eg, Big Fat Greek Wedding ;. I, Myself & Irene). It was only a few izlishnh crazy jokes in this movie, nothing unpalatably offensive. All around, it was a cute movie with cute characters. I thought the ending was a bit abrupt. A feeling that they must end it to the World Series for a real blast to finish. Act left much to be desired, but was offset by the pace of history. If I knew that it was a film the Farrelly brothers, I would suggest that it is the stomach turning a piece of debris and have not looked, but I think that even they are able to casually making okay movie. Good for them, I hope they pull their heads out of the rest of the way and begin to consistently make good films.
