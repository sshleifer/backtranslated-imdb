This, together with the "Hare Tonic" is considered one of the best Bugs cartoons, one of the best mistakes ever. There are some comments on how errors in these cartoons is a "core", that is, I think, that he has not yet fully developed. I prefer the "basic" version from the mid 40's (Chuck Jones' was the best option), which is actually larger than a rabbit and much more fun than the ultimate long-legged version, which towered over Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck . Novoyavlenny Bugs come too suave and sophisticated for my taste. Also check «Hair Raising Hare» (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (one thousand nine hundred forty-eight) for great examples of classic mistakes and classic Chuck Jones.
