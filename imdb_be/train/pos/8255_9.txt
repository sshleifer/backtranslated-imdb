Fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially in view of the ruling of shit that should entertain us in these days. <br /> <br /> As noted above, this is hardly a true zombie movie, but rather a sweet satire that uses the undead, to show fingers. Although there are definitely a few bloody scenes, there is almost no gore and the way this film is presented (feel-good '50s style), I can not imagine anyone being really scary or off Fido and his fellow sufferers. <, Br /> <br /> while the actors are usually, well, I felt like Moss and Nelson stand out. Humor is not in your face, and conquered; there is a lot of attention to detail, and I found myself a few good-natured smile throughout the film. This is certainly not a masterpiece of cinema, but he does not aspire to be - instead, Kari manages to deliver heart warming black comedy.
