Simply the best Estonian film I've ever seen, but it is made by the Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallinn Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a heap of bandits who are trying to steal a large quantity of gold, a national treasure that belongs to the Republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is a kind of summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at the time. In the early 90-ies of the Soviet Union broke up into pieces, and in many countries, such as Estonia became independent. Now, conditions may be better in most of these countries. But in the early '90s, many of these new States, had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era has left them a legacy. (And many of them are still ... at least on some level ...) <br /> <br /> Tallinn Pimeduses very realistic film of that era with believable characters and well-written script. Actors also very good, especially Yarvet (perhaps the most well-known Estonian actor plays Snaut in Tarkovsky's Solaris), and play the old gangster who is becoming tired of his lifestyle. But the most surprising performance comes from Monica Magera, child actor playing Terje, boyish girl in early adolescence, whose presence in the story is very important. (And her name is not even mentioned in the list of IMDb-credit !!!) w <br /> <br /> There's not a lot of films in the world, who manage to be fun and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses doing it. other films Unfortenately Järvi-Laturi far from this kind of achievement. His first one, Kotia PAIN was too artificial, and his latest, History Made at night was just amazing mess.
