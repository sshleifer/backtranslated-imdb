Johnny and June Carter Cash financed the film, which is a traditional rendering Gospels. Music is big, you get a real sense of what the world looked like Jesus (I was there), and June enters the part of Mary Magdalene with enthusiasm. Cash narrative also good. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was miscast. 2. There's no end to the story as puts cash in some of his faith on the basis of music. 3. Because it is uncompelling, I doubt that we will see it ever again widespread. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy a CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine, Texas, USA
