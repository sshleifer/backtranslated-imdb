I may be biased, I am the author of the novel The Hungry Bachelors Club, self-published in 1994. The script was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor Fred Dresch, who was the inspiration for the character of Marlon in the film. I could not be more pleased with the trailer, I hope that I will see the movie in its entirety, and I will continue to comment. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, my character, is a star. It carries the bulk of the emotional vehicles in great shape. I could not have done better myself! It looks like real people, it is hardly the formula given and fortunately drives my statement against racial prejudice at home, elegant and cordial.
