I remember the first watch Sabrina, when he came on TV in the UK on ITV1, when I was 13/14. Now I'm 24 and still love it now the same as I did when I first saw it. I'm getting a little stick from some of my friends are still observed, as "children show," but I do not care! lol Caroline Rhea, like "Hilda" is my favorite character, and later, Morgan has also become one of my favorite characters. I remember spending so much time watching a variety of special events in honor of Sabrina on the television station Nickeleoden UK. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, it was great to Â«Clarrissa explains everything," but it's much better at it. I was gutted when they decided to finish it! I hope that will soon be released on DVD here in the UK - I'll be first in line! lol x
