Good show. <br /> <br /> The basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads. There are many moral dilemmas that are currently facing. Mankind has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but humanity is mature enough to deal with his new toys? There is a moral decline in the virtual world. There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention. I predict (based on the background BSG), which is a problem with the Cylon and slavery. In addition to this, there are other problems that we humans bring upon themselves <br /> <br /> This is a show not to BSG. - at least, not as far as humanity is to be on the run from ruthless problems, which was ultimately their own production. There are not a lot of shoot-em-up or space-based special effects or -. At least not in the first few episodes that I've seen so far <br /> <br /> What does he have very good stories, characters, and themes. He also has a good performance from the actors. They can make culture, which is similar to a modern society, but an alien at the same time be completely believable. As the BSG, this show of humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and weaknesses. This may seem a little strange that the human society to another set of worlds has ties, antique cars, and chicken. But these things do more to create half a familiar background than anything else. Those who stuck to these details really missing the point. If you are from a culture of a mafia or a rich and high-tech culture, people and human nature is no different 150,000 years ago in the high-tech past than what we see in today's world. Interestingly, when the authors are trying to tell us something.
