I love old films Burt Reynolds. They funnier and better than any other film together. They may have also stopped making films after Â«Cannonball Run 2", but I think they might know that there will not be any nicer? Man this film well. Burt Reynolds should dress like a chicken and go round in a racing car lot and lush Loni Anderson on his hand, looking very hot in eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I'm used to this magazine, which had Loni Anderson in it an advertisement for a vacuum cleaner. I am sure that he loved this ad! Plus there is one part of the film, where the public is upset at the racetrack on the Stroker Ace (Burty R.) does, and it shows a guy in the audience leaning and sticking his finger up his example to show my disappointment! I laughed so hard that I almost died in the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never watch another movie again, because I'm telling you right now: there is no point.
