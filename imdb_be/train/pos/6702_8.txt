Even if there are no new episodes, and he rarely showed. I loved the magic and witch Sabrina teenager. I never got to see the last episode, but I want to know what happened to Miles, or Josh? Why aunt should leave the show for good? I am sure that the end of the matter, to be perfect. But there are many questions unanswered. And I want to see the last episode S.T.T.W! Because I heard that it decides between Erin and Harvey on her wedding day! I very much hope that it chooses Harvey! And I can tell Nate Richart is HOTT !! Too bad HES too old for me, though. Melissa Joan Hart has its own sense of wit that it adds to the show, but there are a lot of little "stupid" things for the show, such as how well-known bands come out of nowhere and play songs and listen to all the actors, it kind of foolishly. Plus cat starts to get really lame as the show went on, the jokes began to just get silly, and that the sound under the "audience" control will laugh, I think it was so lame. Do not get me wrong, in some parts it was interesting, but I think that the show is just kind of lost its "magic", so to speak, as the show went on. I give kudos to all the actors, even for, despite the fact that Salei Moon Frye she had no taste, and it was a terrible actress. Interestingly, Melissa, or any of the actors are doing right now on this issue now, when the show was over.
