Lillian Hellman, one of the most famous women playwrights of America, was a woman with a mission. Her left-wing views were not well regarded at that time in the country. In his memoirs, she recalls his trip to the Soviet Union, as it was intrigued by the so-called achievements of the system. "Watch on the Rhine", must be the result of these years. The left wing in America, as well as all over the world have problems with the growth of fascism, not only in Europe but also in Japan. <br /> <br /> «Watch on the Rhine" was a play produced on Broadway for eight months before the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese. It was a g-Hellman heralds the entrance of America into World War II. Adaptation is credited Mr. Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, her long time companion. In accordance with the directions on the screen Herman Shumlin, the film was well received when it premiered in 1943. <br /> <br /> We are acquainted with the Muller family, when the film opens. They cross the border into the United States from Mexico. They must continue to the house of Mrs. Muller in Washington, DC, where her mother, Fanny Farrelly, is a minor celebrity hostess. The Mullers, we understand flee to Europe because of the persecution there against opponents of the coming of the totalitarian regime in Germany. In fact, we think, in a sense, Mullers might be better justified if they were Jews, fleeing from certain destruction. <br /> <br /> We see that Mr. Mueller had a terrible time in his native land, as well as in other places, because of his sincerity in denouncing Fascim. Little does he know that he was coming to his wife's mother at home, that is housing one of the worst of this philosophy. <br /> <br /> The film offers excellent acting all around. This curiosity often due to a supporting role of Bette Davis. Paul Lucas, reprising his Broadway role, is quite convincing as Kurt Müller, a righteous man, who wants to make the world a better place for himself and his family. Mr. Lucas does a great job, which shows Kurt Mueller, repeating the role that made him a star in the Broadway stage. <br /> <br /> Another best result is Lucile Watson, who played Fanny Farrelly, the matriarch of this family, Geraldine Fitzgerald is regarded as Marta de Brancovis, guest Farrell, married to a despicable flowed de Brancovis, Nazi sympathizer played George Kulurisa. White Bondi, Donald Woods, and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances, guided h Shumlin. <br /> <br /> The film should not serve as a reminder of the dangers of totalitarianism, anywhere.
