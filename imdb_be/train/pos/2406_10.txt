This is the best show that I think Jesus was really like. most films show God as a spoiled, lobotomy or torture. Jesus laughed, played, and was serious when it was necessary. JESUS ​​is the kind of people can be held, as a rule, is not hollywood version. <br /> <br /> the movie took some liberties, trying to "fill in the blanks." but fillers, seemed impossible, or even improbable. one thing that I could claim was that he never explained that the Romans were against Jesus (the film drew, that the Romans were the main driving force behind the death of Jesus, rather than that the Jewish authorities were opposed to the idea). <br /> <br />, it thought that the film was well-researched. One example was an impromptu commentary on the teenager, who has been called a "sign." It is believed that the sign (or mark john) boy was referred to in the Garden of Gethsemane, whose cloak pulled and ran away naked (mark 14:51). I get the feeling that they were trying to make the film as accurate (even in the spirit) was as much as possible.
