I thought that this movie was very well together. Voice-overs were also great. I liked how they have overcome their conflicts, and achieve their goals. I would recommend this film to anyone. It is definitely worth the money and time to watch it. Atlantis has a number of comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And the other was forced to wait for me. This is a film of any age can enjoy. Since Mila insane "Profesor" or until he gathers a team for a fantastic journey across the sea. After I watched the movie, I read a book. It was good as well, but the film puts the best pictures in your mind. This is the same as the book. But go ahead and watch this movie!
