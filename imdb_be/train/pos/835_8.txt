Pierce Brosnan newest, but not James Bond, is a killer. He is very very good at what he does, but he is getting old and tired. Greg Kinnair really good as the straight and narrow business man. Now that the story opens the movie shows the two men in their individual lives. One night they have a drink at the bar, and they start talking. Then suddenly you will find these two people get pulled into the events of the series. History of fine acting at the highest level, and cheerful humor I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would it funny, but he really is, and I have to say that this film is a must see.
