This is a great movie in many ways. Everyone in my family loved it. The animation is excellent, and easily shows that there are many manufacturers who create films that are visually brilliant, like everything that comes from the Disney Studio. <br /> <br /> One of the differences from the normal tariff Disney that this film Dreamworks has some wise cracking side impact comedy relief. And there is no sudden moments where the characters break into song. I am sure that the scene early in the film will not appear in the film of Disney: the birth of the Spirit. But this is done in good taste and not offensive at all. "Spirit" was a big breath of fresh air. Do not get me wrong. I loved the Disney over the years and will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> Â«Spirit" is another example of a large animation tariff. Once it was over, my children wanted to watch it again. I had the same feeling. I highly recommend it.
