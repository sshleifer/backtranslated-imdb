I went to see this movie with a bunch of friends one night. I really did not hear about it. So I did not expect. But after I saw I liked. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good. But I must say, Giovanni Ribisi Acting Performace needed a bit lively. But such a small shortcoming, this can be overridden. <br /> <br /> Gone in 60 seconds on a retired thief who must raise of 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life. The film is not predictable. Thus, the end should be a surprise. I think this is just another, fast car driving the film? Well, you would partially. There is much more to it. Each person should watch this movie.
