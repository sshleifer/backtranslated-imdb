Breaking Glass is a film that everyone wants to be in the music industry should see more than once. This is a very dark story about how the record company manipulates a singer to do things your way and make as much money out of it as possible. Looking at some of today's "Star Search" in the style of TV shows in the UK and abroad, I am always reminded of this film. Although not an expert on this issue, the winners of these shows tend to have a very large initial blow and then its downhill from there. This film even before these shows, although the effect seems to be the same. Once rid of his manager, he played quite brilliantly Phil Daniels, slowly but surely, the record company changed its lyric puts it on a stimulant, and it will eventually completely burnt. You are the potential stars of tomorrow .... SEE THIS AND BEWARE !!!
