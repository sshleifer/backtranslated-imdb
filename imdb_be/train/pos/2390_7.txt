My 2 year old loves Doodlebops shows that seem to keep his attention for a while. The characters are interesting, with bright primary colors and all. There's not a lot of educational content that the intended target audience can use, but they seem to be the theme of every show and try to teach the child about sharing and i respect other grounds, so I love him for it. This well produced with high production values. But it's really just an average show, like most of the shows on television these days. We do not buy at the corner of goods is our son to wear all Dooblebop. I do not think we will be spending the money to go on the air, if they ever came to town. Going to the zoo or the Science Center is a much better experience for all the participants and, in my opinion, it is better to spend the money.
