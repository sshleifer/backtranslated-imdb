To begin with, I did not even know about this show, because after a year or so, because of the Internet. I have seen him on TV before in my country, and many people usually do not know about this show. It is a pity, though, because it is easily the most original and clever animation I've seen in recent years. <br /> <br /> I do not give 10 points a lot, but this one is a show that truly deserves all of 10 points. Even if at first glance it may seem like a typical cartoon, but keep in mind that these are not the children show, though. If the full story unfolds, you know, it's real deep storyline, with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based on the spirit-animal, the old Indian believe that persisted for many years. This gives the show on an original twist that you can not often find in the animated show. <br /> <br /> In general, the design is also something very different. Sometimes he reminds Spawn little in terms of design of rough, and sometimes it takes on a more cartoony approach. I believe that David Feith, who also created and directed Cow and Chicken animated segment in the show (he also drew this segment in the comics). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the mind twisting show, show that takes on various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something that you should not miss. Once you start watching, you're likely to see it through. One minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic book, but it's not too annoying. The only question remains, though, where there is a DVD?!
