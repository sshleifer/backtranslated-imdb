From the very beginning of the show Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of it? The show is not the same as before. It is much worse. <br /> <br /> The best episodes were Carmen in them. You can not replace someone from the very beginning! That is, as no South Park Kyle or children's play without waiting for! This is not true! Niece, who replaced her just, ugh! Awful. She does not fit into the story at all. She was one of the main characters, and niece can not replace it. She was an amazing actress. Way better than a niece. Get it back, or you'll lose a ton of viewers.
