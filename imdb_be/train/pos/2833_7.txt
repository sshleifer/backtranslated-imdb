Just saw this movie again after thirty-seven years. I was eleven years old, and caught this movie on South Beach in a long time took place in the cinema on Washington Avenue. I thought in 1969, where it's at! It was a very good movie. Now, however, after almost forty years, it is not as good as it was. Times have changed, and this film is now a tired old retelling of the war between the generations. It does however, catch a place in time that just a memory. It's really interesting to see fashion fashion, old Vegas, thin Don Rickles, smoking chains, and the opening song of the thigh. The acting was decent, a few old-fashioned script, but the memories are still fresh. Where B may not be where it is on you, but for me, it was still nice and fun trip down memory lane.
