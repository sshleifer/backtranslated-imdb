Perhaps some people may think this is a slow film. Nevertheless, this is a "slow burning", which allows it to deeply affect the spectator. How amazing the first scene: first, we can hear the voice; then we are allowed to see the characters; Finally, the camera slowly scrolled back and to the side, and we see a different character, a young man who just sits there, apparently, not even listening to the conversation, or at least not very caring. The fact that this young man will lead role of the film shows the strategy: allows a character to develop and define its environment, but without the comments point more than necessary. People come and go, the flow in and out of his life. While most of the film follows him (and most minor characters seen only when next to him shall be determined in accordance with the relationship that supported him), we are taught that we are to be objective, so thin is the director touched.
