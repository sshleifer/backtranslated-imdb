I was a fan of Jodie Foster's since we were both children of her Disney years. I loved her Tomboy antics in films such as Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> «fox" was such a huge departure from it all. <br /> <br /> Where other young women actors of that time turned to sexual child under the guise of comedy ( «Little Darlings», anyone?), Jody went depressing and tragic story of teenagers dragged to their deaths powerful charm temptation and drug addiction. <br /> <br /> It was not Disney. It was not Spanking years. It was not «Halloweed». It was a dark and powerful story of the destruction of young lives. Unfortunately, this is a fairy tale, which is still playing on a daily basis across the country, this film can be replayed (from the current audio track) and remains fully relevant. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie ever made, he gets tired at some parts, not all speech is especially beautiful. But Jodie Foster continues to demonstrate his chops as a real adult actor (the trend began when she was very young to the taxi driver). <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 Barki
