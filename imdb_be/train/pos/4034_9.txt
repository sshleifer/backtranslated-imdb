Pinjar is a really good movie with great acting, good story, good performance, touching emotions, etc. <br /> <br /> I think that the quality of the films that Bollywood produces quite an improvement in these days, and this film is one of the evidences <br /> <br /> A lot of Bollywood movies that I remember what It made such an impact on me. - I was just thinking about the movie for a few hours - surprised by the variety of emotional situations that test a person in person. <br /> <br /> film is based on a lot of action in Urmilla Matondkar, as well as some of Manoj Bazhpaev. Urmilla plays a girl in northern India on the background separation, and all the trouble seem sweet when compared with the problems, it is to face. <br /> <br /> must-see film. Technically excellent product of Bollywood, which I feel is comparable to the best movies that come from other countries.
