What a great Barbara Stanwyck movie that I happened to see that night. «Jeopardy» was fantastic. This was done in 1953 and is likely to double counting, but it kept me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays Elena, who with her husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker) led to isolated fishing spot in Mexico for vacation. The husband has falling from the pier, and the only way it should be saved, when Barbara driving back to the garage for some rope <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it falls into a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker -. One of my favorite), and that should be a game of cat-and-mouse for him, as Barbara tries everything in her power to humble, to return with her to release her husband. <br /> <br /> The film was so disturbing, and such a surprise - I did not expect such a big movie. But I suppose I should have realized - if there was Barbara Stanwyck doing anything less than perfect?
