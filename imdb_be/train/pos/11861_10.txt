This film is very interesting and never ever get bored even works almost 3:00. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and other actors in the film are great and very believable. Violence was a bit extreme in the film, but then he showed how fascinated drug trafficking was at the time of the film. The ending is a strange and probalby one of the hottest scenes ever. Great movie, and you'll probably really like.
