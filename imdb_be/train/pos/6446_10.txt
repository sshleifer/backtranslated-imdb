«Så catfish himmelen», probably one of the 3 most beautiful films I've seen in my life. The fact that it did not win the Oscar, I do not shed a tear. This film is in some class that Oscar win may have been distracted from it !!! My dear friend, Anders (Nyberg), you make a really greatness here with a feather! Kay Pollak, creation, and all the troops, you are given a gift of love to our world. Between the point of entry into this world of ours, the way out of it - you can actually say that you have done it better! Special personal thanks from my heart to all of you, that you returned some precious memories of the second decade of life. I grew up in Sweden, and has been formed and shaped many beautiful Swedish influences, people, traditions, music and nature, my young mind and current Genesis. My blessings with gratitude to all of you. With love and light George Gabriel Berkowitz Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
