This is one of those movies that you continue to think about when you wake up the next morning. This will give you that warm, fuzzy feeling, and leave you with a smile on his face <br /> <br /> Of course, we are tired of the typical stereotype of the characters and the story, but it do the trick :. Entertain. <, Br /> <br /> Being from Sweden and lives in the US for a long time, it's funny how we react. "Aperiodic husband is going to kill him", "She (Gabriella) is going to die, and then it will be heartbreaking larger than life ends." We know how these things work, everything comes together in the end. And it was done. The characters were more simple, they were so complex that you really do not think twice about it, there was nothing really left to your own imagination. The closest will probably be the Sioux, it forces you to ask yourself if it really was in love with Daniel, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> But the film is beautiful, located in the countryside Norland, the music is absolutely amazing and cute characters. Nyqvist is really a genius, with his crazy unique look and Frida Hallberg charming and available. Maybe a little too well. <br /> <br /> Most of all, this film makes you feel, and that's the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and identify. I do not know about you guys, but it does not happen often.
