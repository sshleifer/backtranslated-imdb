On the night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets a gorgeous dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) in the bar, they drink a lot together, and the next morning, he wakes up with her on the bed. His future in-law calls him and tells him that his fianc√©e, Karen (Selma Blair) may come to his apartment, and he desperately asks Becky to leave the place in a hurry. Early, he comes to the conclusion that it has a crab, and later, in preparing his wedding dinner, he realizes that Karen's cousin Becky. This is the beginning of a very funny comedy with hilarious situations. The first attraction of this film is certainly a central trio of actors and actresses. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who is a wonderful actress and very lush, and Jason Lee, who amazingly funny, have a good performance. I laughed a lot together stories, but there are some scenes that are really fun. For example, if Paul finds Becky in her bed; when he finds her paint; his imagination in many situations; in the pharmacy trying to buy and get clarification on the crab medicine; Most of the scenes of his neighbor, minister; if Karen calls the department; or when the police found the suspect in the attack on Paul. I could find many other scenes, but it is better to lease or buy a reader this movie and having a lot of fun. . My vote is seven <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ( "Crazy for them")
