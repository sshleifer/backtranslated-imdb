With the mixed reviews this I did not expect too much, and was pleasantly surprised. This is a very interesting little detective film with interesting characters, beautiful paintings, writing that is fresh without being brisk and a good pace. It looks too good in a funky way. Apparently people or even like this movie, or just hate, and I'm the one who loved him.
