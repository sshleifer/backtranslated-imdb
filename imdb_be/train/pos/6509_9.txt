I just can not believe some of the comments on this show! The show is a genius! Of course, this does not means tested and the truth, but do we as consumers always want the same thing, stuck in us again and again. Should we not be able to sit and enjoy something new from time to time. Style is not as realistic as the previous show "Scooby Doo", but it should not be. Show, he called «Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Clue», what part of the name says, the whole cast of other favorite renditions would constantly participate in the action. And nowhere does it say that they will solve the mystery, and they can not even stand a monster, so why would not they? I'm actually glad that they put some old story, working on the show Scooby-Doo. They are still working jokes, awkward jokes, quick change of clothes in the chase scenes, gag standard corridor and even Scooby snacks. In fact, I am glad that this show is there, because I just love it. I'm glad that they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and focus only on the two main characters and a villain. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is ridiculous, it should be! Of course, this is different, it should be. This should make you laugh at the villain and cheer for the stupid robotic butler, to defeat all the invading parasites, no matter what size. You need to get a running «Roobi-Roo" joke. All this is just to put together so well, there is not one thing I can think of that this happened to him. Drawing up, acting, animation, all at the highest level. The name of the music is amazing (my computer playing "get a clue!" When it is loaded), and the background music is simply breathtaking.
