An American in Paris, in many ways, the ultimate blend of art and Hollywood musical. Made at the height of the MGM musical powers as a power plant, the film features memorable music Gershwins, which were equivalent to the 20th century, Beethoven and Mozart on the right. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was also at the height of its powers in this film, although it may be fair to say that this film was only a warm-up for his best performance in Singin 'in the Rain (1952), two films on the actually closely linked. Besides communication Arthur Freed, the segment in Broadway Melody "Rain" is obliged to exist incredible American in Paris ballet sequence in the film. This may well be the only time when the number of dance specifically mentioned in the opening credits of the film. And it deserves to be, as it demonstrates the skills Gene Kelly as a dancer and choreographer of the utmost degree. <br /> <br /> cast film is uniformly excellent. Leslie Caron, incredibly making her film debut, shows the maturity that makes you think that she made films over the years. Her introductory dance sequence, and then her work on the ballet, provides some surprising moments of sexual competed in MGM musicals only work sub Charisse in Singin 'in the Rain and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levant cheerful as stoic friend Kelly, who gets two of the best moments of the film: during a sequence end of the game (which I will not give to those who have not seen the movie), and one of the most memorable musical numbers of the film connects his incredible playing skills on Piano with the state-of-the-art (for the time) special effects. <br /> <br /> In less memorable are Georges hetaryl romantic rival Kelly, although it does get a few musical highlights and Foch as a romantic rival Leslie Crown. Relationship May to December between the character Kelly and Nina reminded me of the same "kept man" relationship between the seen and Peppard, Patricia Neal in the breakfast. <br /> <br /> Tiffany There are several elements of the film that made it less fun than for me Singin 'in the rain. Ballet, although generous and well production, not really fit in with the rest of the film. Without revealing the plot, ballet just happens, with no real rhyme or reason. And unlike the sequence Broadway Melody, it really has nothing to do with the plot - and the best musicals, the songs always have some meaning to life. <br /> <br /> And what's worse, the film's ending, which occurs immediately after the ballet. While the end should not be a surprise (it's the MGM musical, after all), I was hoping for a little more ... after the movie ended Ballet. It is as if the director Vincente Minnelli felt he could not go for a ballet with anything else. The film just left me in the lurch. <br /> <br /> This negative aside, An American in Paris rightfully ranks alongside the best of Hollywood musicals. It's not quite reach the heights of Singin 'in the rain, but it is close, and is testament to the skill Gene Kelly as one of the greatest dancers of all time.
