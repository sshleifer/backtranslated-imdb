this film was just brilliant, casting, location, scenery, history, direction, everything is very suited to the role they play, and you could just imagine yourself there, Robert Redford terrific actor, and now the same time, the director, Norman's father came from the same Scottish island, as I do, so I liked the fact there was a real connection with this film, witty remarks throughout the film were great, it was just great, so I bought this movie as soon as it was released for retail trade and would recommend it to everyone to see, and Nakhla Art was a strange, actually cried at the end of the day, it was so boring, and you know what they say, if you cry in the movie she was good, and it certainly was, and congratulations on the two little boys, played PÃ¤rt Norman and Paul were just brilliant, the children are often left out of the list of praising, I think, because the stars who play them all grown up a large section of the film, but these children are strange and should be praised for what they have done, do not you think? the whole story was so beautiful, because it was true, and it was someone's life, after all, that was shared with all of us.
