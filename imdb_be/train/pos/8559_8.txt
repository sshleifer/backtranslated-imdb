There is a certain genius behind the film. I laughed throughout. The scene in the office phone sex, discussing how love heals double was a nice try this brilliant / humor. Performing poorly, but you can see the message of the writer and they have some talent. Split double in the end it was like ... "well, not really expecting it, but let's see what the movie has to say." Of course funny but sweet idea indeed very coherent story in a strange way. <br /> <br / > is the point of the film to be logical or will it be entertainment or to communicate on an emotional level? I'm easily bored a lot of movies, but this one has kept my interest throughout. <br /> <br /> I think that the story may have some auto-biographical roots, but this is only speculation. Horribly bad, but good. I'm looking for other f lmav, this man could have done (with more experience).
