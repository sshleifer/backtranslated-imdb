As an advocate of the film genre, a child of 80's and a fan of heavy rock music ... this film has a special place in my heart. It has everything you could want in a supernatural movie: action, great special effects (for 1986) and a guitar which howled moaning i glam- rock soundtrack. This, of course, was a film for all fans of heavy metals at the time. I have not seen it in a movie, because it was never released theatrically here ... but it's popularity on video from the mid to late eighties has provided its cult status and eventually led to the (unfortunately mediocrity) DVD release in 2002 . If you are not a fan of creepy movies or rock music, then this is probably not your cup of tea ... but, believe me, there are worse films of this type out there ... and despite the medium of action and some outrageously funny situations , trick or Treat most definitely riff wailing above the usual fare horror. You will never look at the stereo in the same way again. Or should I say, MP3-player? <br /> <br /> It's no joke TRIVIA- Mark Price refreshments (Eddie) game is Skippy Handelman on the popular long-running comedy comedy "Family Ties."
