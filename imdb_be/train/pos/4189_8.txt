Thelma Ritter busy information sale of almost all body. Jean Peters's amazing how a girl glowing Widmark. <br /> <br /> This is a part of the period during the McCarthy era, where the Red Scare rights policy and worked in this area is quite beautiful. The singularity of this film is that Peters & Ritter are victims of violent beatings in an era when women were rarely more than sex objects in the movies. This is what makes this film noir, as women often received different roles in this type of film. <br /> <br /> The film lasts only 87 minutes and was obviously made by Fox as a card for dual functions in the theater, lot of show this a limited budget film. The script did Hoover crazy, because patriotism is given rectified. Hoover wanted it changed. <br /> <br /> Instead, he became a B picture card, which was sleeper hit in 1953 Script & acting in it is better than the other major features were this year.
