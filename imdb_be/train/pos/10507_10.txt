This game is awesome. In fact, you should get it, if you do not have it. Despite the fact that this ancient now it was no surprise when he came out. I believe that this game will always be a classic. This is as good Super Mario World or so. When I was young, my friend, and I will sit down and play this game for hours, trying to beat him, which we eventually did. It is not as developed as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a guy Mario fan is necessary. It's fun and entertainment complex. Everything you could want from a fantasy game for good graphics, in addition, (well it came out in 1996) ROCK ON 4eva MARIO Luigi and Yoshi !!! Nintendo is the best!
