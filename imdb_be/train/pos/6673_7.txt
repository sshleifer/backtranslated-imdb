Many user comments I saw on IMDB, this film does not do it justice. First of all, let me say that this movie is not worth taking seriously. It should be fun, but a stupid movie that does not require one to think, just enjoy. If you watch the film with the intention to see a masterpiece in any cinema or humor, you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you just want to watch a dull film with some talented actors / actresses and some good catch-phrase, you'll enjoy it.
