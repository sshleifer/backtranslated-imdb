Rawhide Western was a great TV series. Focusing on the strip trail drovers lead the trail boss Gil Favor. Most episodes - especially the first 3 seasons were really character study Tabor and his men. Guest stars have come and gone, but in contrast to the baggage they rarely prevail episodes they appeared in. Rawhide was true, gritty Western Gil Favor and stand out as a memorable sign will never be forgotten. Thanks to the performance of Eric Fleming show was a hit. Of course, he is ably supported by an excellent cast of good actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All these actors have left their mark on a piece of television history. Rawhide captures the aroma of the time the west, that no other series is not for me, while in any case, failed to do so. Later seasons tend to divide customers and give them some storylines. For me, for a while it did not work - cattle drive and patrons provided the best stories. However, there are still some classic stories were Rawhide top box business. Black and white photos are added to the dark, realistic feel that other Western series rarely able to capture. Dealers, Indians, Commancheroes, beautiful girls are in trouble, serial killers, they all have been shown to give the heroes of our problems. It came to an end for a series of quiet, when the last season was dismissed less than half way through. Reason - Erik Fleming left Rawhide is now head without a body - gritty realism gone, Gil favor aroused respect and exuded authority - he was never infallible, and that made it even more interesting. We will not see his like again. Watch the episode, when you can, they rarely disappoint.
