Wow, I forgot how good this film until I stumbled upon it while looking through the garage. It's kind of surprising combination of bio Michael Jackson collection of musical vignettes, and a story about the super hero fight to keep some small children. These vignettes are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is a super hero segment in which Michael Jackson turns into a machine, a robot, and finally, the spacecraft (and this is as strange as it sounds) . Joe Pesci is hilarious, and has enough cool down, and beautiful music to entertain for! <br /> <br /> The real gems, but it is incredibly «Smooth Criminal» video that makes this film worth having just for this part!
