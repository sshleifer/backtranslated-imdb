I'm a fan of wreck and Blade Runner, and this film explores some of these mortal highway and 80th noir that I like to see, so I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> In general, though, it is important nonsense film noir hero is not pulled off a good female role and its hero is almost Neanderthal, therefore, prevention of kitsch.
