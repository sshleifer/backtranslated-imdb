Currently, the new schedule METOO at 4 pm on weekdays, right after the "Maverick" and right before "Wild Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). <br /> <br /> I do not know if I ever actually seen an episode of it when it was originally, but I'm really fascinated by it. Unusual, unusual surreal stories set in the mythical West. . A look at the "Naked City" westerns <br /> <br /> And there are guest stars: Dan Duryea, Lyle Böttger, Donlevi, Macdonald Carey, Rick Jason (as the wily Mexican), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry Jr. (as a colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ( "war of the worlds"), Gloria Talbott ( "I married a monster from outer space") <br /> <br /> It ran for eight seasons, more 200 episodes, from January 1959 to December 1965 <br /> <br /> Erik Fleming is very common, as the boss Gil Favor, the most phlegmatic person, it is cal ever lived, with the samurai code of honor, and just the right balance between strength and open arbitrariness. I would vote for him for president any day. (PS He had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And the young Clint Eastwood is simply amazing how impulsive his right hand, "Road» Yates, addition of veteran Western actor and country music figure (the immortal "one-eyed, one horn, flying purple tastier») Sheb Ula is there as an experienced scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character cook, you might ask, how «Wishbone». <br /> <br /> And then that great song, performed immortal Frankie Laine. (At the same time, and «Maverick» topic, I got a Western theme songs that run through my mind all day.) <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to every episode; I collect the whole set. Good time (not to mention the experience of moo-Wing) is always guaranteed as one waits to see if the guys will get them straightened out before the commercial difficulties. <br /> <br /> "Rollin ', Rollin', Rollin '..".
