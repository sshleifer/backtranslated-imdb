I just saw this movie for the second time on television. This is a wonderful, warm, sentimental, very, very romantic. I have rarely seen better actors to reveal their movements and gestures of love for others -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson just outdo themselves. Masterson, probably has the most difficult role and simply magical. <br /> <br /> The film is in the spirit of both the romantic films such as While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and "high trick" kind of movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got married. I do not want to talk about it, because this cast was very rich, and I would not change any of itself but I think this is not possible, as well as the films mentioned above, since the cash appeal of actors just are not that great how. Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time the film was made <br /> <br /> It is not perfectly written - for example, the character line is not particularly memorable. However, it is executed to perfection. <br /> <br /> Romantic desires really are sensitive, the "feeling" people who fall in love delicately reported, the hard times of love and all-embracing scope, sense of loss and the desire to regain the connection, so touchingly delivered. Again and again, you will be moved. In fact, a comparable film Made in Heaven As romantic pursuit <br /> <br /> You see it -. It's great.
