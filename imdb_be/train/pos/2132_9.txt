The cast really helps to make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man against a woman-argue-all-in-time, but wind up in love-type eccentric Hollywood melodrama / comedy. <br /> <br /> I usually do not go for those types of films, and that the exhausting of the plot, but this was a refreshing, fun to watch, and oozes with charm. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Sallavano play off each other well and make a very handsome couple. The supporting cast is outstanding - always nice because Felix Bressarta Shildkraet villain. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen him do in his career. He takes the film and turns it around in a very different mood some time, unless something dramatic happens to him. This "twist" is another reason why this film rises above others of its kind. <br /> <br /> Once again, when the film has a good combination of categories is usually successful. This is a perfect example. In this film, it is romance, comedy and drama, and that's good. I'll take it for a remake of "You've Got Mail" on any given day. And do not compare.
