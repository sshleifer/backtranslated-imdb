Zombi 3 has an interesting history in its making. Firstly, it is a continuation of Fulci You Zombi 2 Zombi 2 with itself is, of course, a marketing ploy to deceive people into thinking that it is a continuation of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead aka Zombi. Error enough? In principle, none of the films have nothing in common with each other, but who cares when they make money. I believe that he Fulci does not begin to take care of the production about halfway through Zombi 3 when he decided to leave. Bruno Mattei was brought on board to help fill the film with additional scenes to extend operating time. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 in plot your typical zombie fare. Scientists are developing a serum on the island in the Philippines, terrorists steal the outbreak of the plague, and the zombie rampage. Scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is set to mow all without harm. There are also short inserts from radio DJ preached about how we treat the planet. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really liked this movie. I've heard awful things, but I feel stupid dialogue is very pleasant. The film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness about pollution, corrupt military man playing God, etc. I get the feeling it was some time a serious film, but it turned into a strange direction, apparently, when Mattei came on board. <br /> <br /> In addition, tearing the other zombies clicks, it is very similar to Romero's The Crazies. You hear a radio DJ breaking the good news of "If you see people in white robes and masks, run to them for help." This, of course, playing in the images of men in white shoot zombies. Later on, they just steal the scene with the Crazies, in which one of normal, uninfected people are killed by mistake. <br /> <br /> Gore factor is very good in this one with hordes of zombies around every corner. How cool? Let me count the ways ?? 1. Zombie 2. Birthday 3. Flying zombies head zombie birds. 4. Zombies without swimming legs in the pool. My favorite zombie was a machete-wielding maniac at a gas station. He was a bad ass and nearly destroyed the entire building is trying to kill her. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quotes ?? If the sergeant insisted on cremation zombies, scientists asked, "Do not you think that as soon as the ashes into the air, it will fall to the ground and contaminate all?" To which Sargeant boldly replied: "Who are you talking about science fiction." He also continues mention «Science Fiction», told scientists even at the end when all die <br /> <br /> in addition :. Gallery, trailers, and interviews in the first place one of Matteo's, where he insists that he sent 40% of the scenes, but can not remember any of them, or any other important details <br /> <br /> result :. must see for zombie and FULCI supporters <br /> <br /> Ratings :. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
