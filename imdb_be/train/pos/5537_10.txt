Maybe it was not as good as a whole, but the second episode, which was the first person I spoke to was so memorable, I still remember it today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in jumping and mysteries. <br /> <br /> COC jargon sidekick, Chico Barnes, is much more fun for those of us who have never been close to a hearing in London Bow bells, but the conclusions are attractive, and the show was entertaining. <br /> <br /> Sid Halley was one of the most interesting characters Francisco and the show actually minimizes some difficulties with his hand. Interestingly, the electronic hand variety, which is used in the story, apparently, less functional for the user than invented after the Second World War.
