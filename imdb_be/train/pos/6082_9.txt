I have always enjoyed the version of Kenneth Branagh classics of Shakespeare, as he always does a very good job, but in this film, the one who picks up the entire movie, not that other, as "on-always-on-the actorÂ» Laurence Fishburne, of course, he made some bad choices in movies, despite the fact that he's a great actor, but in this case, we are really considering a real Othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy, as it grows stronger, along with well-painted Fishburne paranoia and, in addition, we finally black Othello! <br /> <br /> I do not think that they could choose the best Othello. HT could still give him this mixture of sympathy / antipathy, love / hate, and do not forget the fiery eyes ...? Branagh good as always, but not at its peak, Desdemona Irene Jacob is pretty good, but a bit gloomy , while Laurence Fishburne really picks it up and makes it very interesting and enjoyable movie. how to look.
