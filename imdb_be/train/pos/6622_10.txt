I just went to the film during the Expresion en Corto, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. The film is rolling with the first shot, I was struck by :. One long continuous shot of a futuristic Paris in the famous black and white <br /> <br /> I do not need to go to the cause of the Details, "I think this is a movie worth seeing. The history of science fiction can be found in the middle of a lot ... it was very good. Whichever is greater, the camera is free to fly anywhere, and I mean everywhere. Things you could not do or see done beautifully. casting performance is good, in my opinion, no one gets the wrong note. <br /> <br /> At the moment, what I found strange is the animation. 3D Graphics look 2D.

Details about backgrounds give more texture as if it were done by hand (I'm sure it was, but when the angle you can see the depth). <br /> <br /> Producer screening talked about hard work for the film: 7 years! Director, according to her, is brilliant, but perhaps he was very inexperienced, as it was only one short film to his resume. For example, many people have true faith in them.
