I was pleasantly surprised to find that How to lose friends and alienate people, was nowhere near as "gross-out" comedy, as the trailer gave me wait. I quickly became absorbed in the deployment of the narrative and remained engrossed throughout. Going into more graphic humorous was, I thought, on the spot. (I mean, I got the impression, I have witnessed attempts Pegg in the restoration of lost control of a lot of "real time", so to speak). In other moments was the time allowed to divide the protagonists (ie Pegg in and Dunst), a reflection on how the events affect them, and what led them to where they were right now. All the characters were well matched to some extent interesting in and of themselves, and generally quite nice. (Any apparent ruthless ambition displayed tend to be good-natured hardened appropriate elasticity.) Fascinating, it is reasonable scenario, brilliantly directed and beautifully acted film, which I thoroughly recommend.
