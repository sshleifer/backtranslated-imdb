It is quite unusual and unique small Western, which is made mainly due to its original story, which revolves around the unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and all those who receive it poses at some point in the film. <, Br /> <br /> It is basically a very entertaining movie to watch, but not without also being a real western, as well. The film was made in a typical '40s /' 50s-style Western genre film, so fans of the genre should not be excluded of his somewhat unusual main prerequisite. <br /> <br /> Since the rifle is in fact the main plot the device of the film, it allows the stories to follow several characters throughout the film, all of which are linked, of course, and the story does a full circle in the end. Without it, this film would have been pretty dirty one to watch as the story often jumps from one dangerous due to the other, with the village ayanna different characters involved. It's pretty amazing how they even managed to put Wyatt Earp in this all. But this is not a criticism really. I liked that the film and its history had to be original, and as the film seemed to move from one event to the next. this gave the film a little sense of adventure and entertainment. <br /> <br /> in addition, it is really great to watch a movie. I liked the setup used in the film, and it seems rather strange that it was in fact, directed by Anthony Mann westerns first. Fortunately, he'd go straight to the more than westerns later, which often will star James Stewart in the main lead. <br /> <br /> It was a pretty brave casting choice choose James Stewart as a basic guide. He is one of the softest and most polite prospective and existing actors, so casting it as a hard shooter seems a little odd choice. But Stewart strangely convincing as a tough guy, and it shows how versatile and really capable of as an actor he really is. <br /> <br /> It also has some other strange actor in the film, who often do not get associated with this genre. Shelley Winters plays the female role, and later a well-known actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appeared in several small roles. <br /> <br /> This is also a western with lots of action and fun at him. <br /> <br /> 8/10
