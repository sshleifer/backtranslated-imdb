Old Mill Pond greater tribute to African-American artists from the 30s than any denigration of the race (Stepin Fetchit caricature notwithstanding). Moreover, with whom I have just mentioned, there is also a frog or a fish version of Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, joesphine Baker, Bill «Bojangles» Robinson, and Louis Armstrong. This cartoon happy frets Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising very exciting musical with excellent all around. they all sound the same as the real thing, that half of me thinks they might be. If not, then they, of course, very flattering incarnations. Even the lazy, the helpless Fetchit characteristic gets exciting warm-up here when he gets chased by a tiger as «Hold, tiger" playing the score. Highly recommended for lovers of «30s animation and jazz music.
