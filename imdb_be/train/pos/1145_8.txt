It is a romantic comedy with an emphasis on comedy for a change. As usual fans - Sally Field as almost a soap opera-Hill Queen, Celeste Talbert; and Kevin Kline as marginally employed and marginally talented actor, Jeffrey Anderson - operate contrary, it would seem, not knowing that they are madly in love, etc. Thanks to a little Bette Davis, Margo Channing in All About Eve (1950), and a whole lot of slapstick theater tradition, Sally Field goes to the top fun as it malaprops their path to love and happiness. Kevin Kline, one of the most underrated leading men in recent years, is also very good and very winning, how he manages to be beautiful, vulnerable, self-centered and nice in the same time. <br /> <br /> mishaps center around Celeste fear of losing their audience as it entered it fortieth, and reach the critical point with the arrival of its niece budding actress Measles Craven (Elizabeth Shu), which happens to be its niece with all the attendant complications of plot. Cori is possible to obtain a small role in the soap opera, like a homeless deaf before opening their true attitude towards Celeste (Jeffrey Anderson, a) -., But does not mind <br /> <br /> In the romantic counterpoints or foil with the conclusions of are Robert Downey Jr. (opera director soap David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and nurse Nan). David Barnes oh so hot for her, but she only cares about one thing: to get rid of Celeste that it can shine more brightly on the set. To this end, it receives Barnes to do all kinds of things to destroy the career of Celeste, but through luck and / or distorted logic, all his attempts go awry, much to the delight of the audience. <br /> <br /> Whoopie Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz, chief writer of the show and Celeste alter ego and confidant while Carrie Fisher is a modest part as hard as nails, producer of the show. <br /> <br /> I thought it was funnier than just another parody of the soap opera world, which I saw (Young Doctors in Love in 1982, which burlesqued General Hospital, and the TV was pretty good). Much funnier foam with kooky script and a lot of laughing out loud one-liners, and excellent performance in the field, Kline and downy, Jr. But to see this Sally Field, which is outstanding.
