Antonioni really showed some «cojones», when he had made this film. He went to America to work on the contract, the most generous studio (MGM), and he made the most damning portrait of American society I have ever seen. LA Seeing first hand the most accurate drawing of a crowded, overheated and impersonal city. Unless Antonioni met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The following burial at the studio of course, after such an unusual investment and dismal return. It is sad that people do not get to see this film more as I think of Antonioni was proven right. Here he predicts the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in the American policy. Everything is much more interested in what happens in their pockets and the relentless expansion of living space in the inhospitable (yet beautiful) desert and beyond. How I would like to see the interest in this film lights and lavish DVD release again. <br /> <br /> I pray that people see Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a really unique film commenting on the turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet, and we forgot about it. <br /> <br /> An unexpected gem.
