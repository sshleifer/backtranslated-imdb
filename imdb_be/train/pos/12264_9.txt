If you, as I have a very close and long term relationship with the world of Tintin .... do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life, creating a Tintin. I'ts so bright and very cool production. The whole background story about Hergé and people, as well as a lot of different situations, he was under the influence, for good or worse than strange. There is a very subtle and obvious connection between comic books and only that. I'm in my basement again digging Tintin albums. In addition, the film itself is very well said, and has a great surround sound to it. I really hope that people will find it as intriguing as I did!
