There are some comments on the film, which say that it is bad and stupid one, and such a wonderful actor Pierre Fresnay not accepted to act in it. <br /> <br /> I think, on the contrary, that, even if the movie is amazing and has some drawbacks, Pierre Fresnay work is so great that it turns the film into something beautiful. <br /> <br /> his speech, perhaps the best in history. <br /> <br /> film itself has a very polemical consecration of the wine scene in the cabaret. <br /> <br /> For someone who does not believe that a priest ?? even rank one ?? can convert it into the blood of Christ, the scene is perhaps strange. But for someone who was raised in a Catholic framework, it is very emotional, even if it is very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The scene of the young priest's death is extremely shocking. But it is very well acted. Pierre Fresnay turns mad act of killing something obvious in the temporal madness of his hero, tortured san Moran, who in this terrible way back to his duty.
