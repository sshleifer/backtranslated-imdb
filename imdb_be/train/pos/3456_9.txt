There is no such thing as a perfect murder.Lieutenant Columbo knows that.Ken Franklin, who is the other half of the team of writers of detective stories knows that.He kills his partner Jim Ferris, who had plans of going solo.Now Columbo steps into the picture and asks all sorts of questions from g-Franklin.And returns more than one question.Columbo: murder by the book (1971) is aimed at a young Steven Spielberg before his days fame.Steven Bochco wrote. Columbo fantastic character, with its shabby look.It hard to believe that this man could solve any crime.But he could.Each and every one of them! Peter Falk is the one and only person in the world who could not reflect this character.So entirely remakes, please.This part is a very good example of how Columbo worked.Jack Cassidy plays a killer and Martin Milner plays plays victim .Rosemary Forsythe's wife Joanna Ferris.There victim to conquer in the scenes between Columbia and her.How he makes omelettes and everything.Barbara Colby plays Lily La Sanka.She really met a tragic fate when she died after the killing, as it does here. I Â«ve was a supporter of Columbia since childhood, and I still enjoy watching them.There was erapynak for many years, they have not been shown Columbo story at all, but now he back.Back another question.
