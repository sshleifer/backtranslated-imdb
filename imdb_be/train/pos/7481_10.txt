I can not disagree with the quote "this is one of the best films ever made." If you think, Vanilla Sky a "remake" You could not be more wrong. There is a huge depth in this film: visually, musically and emotionally <br /> <br /> Visually, because the film is soft and delicate times (early scenes with Sofia) and at other times powerful and intense (Times Square,. after highlight scenes). <br /> <br /> music and sounds to relate to this film so great. Without music, this is only half the story told. Nancy Wilson has created an emotional, but eclectic, bound for the film, which may be more suitable for a fairy-tale theme (although not released, I was able to get their hands on the original bill of about $ 60 if you look hard, you can be able to find a copy of their own). other musical selections cues, such as The Beach Boys, the police department, Josh, inspires, Sigur Ros, on the Monkees, and so forth and the like, is also ideal for the film (Crowe ear for great music). <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional themes in this film (ie, love, sorrow, regret) is very powerful, and is amplified ten times by means of visual and musical experience as well as the brilliant dialogue; I admit, elevator scene brings tears to my eyes again and again. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie but (as if it could be better) is that he is so well-established in such a way that every time you watch a movie, you'll catch something new - so monitor closely and be ready to think about! Of course, the issue becomes apparent after the first or second clock, but there is always more to the story than you think. <br /> <br /> This is easily the best work of Cameron Crowe, and generally work shine. Most of my film-making and musical inspiration only comes with the job. He sincerely touched my life as a true art has a tendency to do. It constantly amazes me that there are many people who can not appreciate this film for what it is (I think, to understand the true art is an art in itself) <br /> <br /> The result :. Vanilla Sky in its own league.
