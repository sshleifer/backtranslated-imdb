In this sequel to the 1989 action comedy classic K-9 detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee will return to fight crime, but this time they united with another detective [Christine Tucci] and its partner in average Doberman named Zues, who does not get along with Jerry Lee very well. Dul not get along with his new partner much either. It's all change as the movie goes along. The film intensely as they guy who really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There are several dramatic scenes devoted to the death of his wife Dooley, who really does not seem to be with the tone of the film, because the rest of the film's action sequences, Utah dog jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs bitten by bad guys in a certain area. I know it seems very low humor, but some of them are actually very funny. I have not seen this film for jokes, I've seen it for two reasons. The first reason is that I'm a big fan of James Belushi and the second for the action sequences. James Belushi funnier than he was in the K-9 and the sequence of actions to better too. It would be nice to see more characters with K-9, to return, but it's still a fun movie. If you are a fan of James Belushi, you will love this film.
