Reflecting on this film, I can think of two others to help put it in perspective. One relatively forgotten, but covers the same geography, is the impeccable reputation, others thousands of miles and a lot more ambitious is an unforgettable Indochina. Claire Denis made a film that has some of the great foundations of Indochina, complex and unspoken relationship between France and its colonial subjects. <br /> <br /> I was struck with the dignity Potee, with its struggle for the preservation of his dignity among his peers and with his white masters. I was also surprised by the love / hate relationship between him and Amy. This is the last thing that gives the film its driving force is the last thing that connects this movie Indochina. <br /> <br /> One can never be sure what motivates everyone, although some of the characters required memory of colonialism. It is this cynical piece of history that links it with an impeccable reputation. Theirs is a scandal, perhaps even more interesting in a lewd way, but Denis gives us the memory of how it was with all the tensions and unresolved relationships. <br /> <br /> The American black, which gives France grew trip at the beginning and end of the film offers another interesting side to the confusion that in the western world, when we look at Africa. He says that when he came, he wanted to call everyone brother. He returned home, but they just thought that it would be crazy. France, nature and a girl grew up in Cameroon, but do not fully understand what it is, even if they can remember what it was. <br /> <br />
