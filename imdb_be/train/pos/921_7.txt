MAYBE in an attempt to find another «Hot Property» for adaptation, Fleischer brothers thought back to them very successful forays into the world of newspaper comics with their production in 1933 Once SAILOR (Fleischer Studios / Paramount). Although it was part of the Betty Boop series, Miss B., only made a brief appearance in the short-term; . Leaving the rest of the episode as a pilot for the possible occurrence of a full-scale series <br /> <br /> As is now well known, rough, squinty eyes, brawlin 'Seaman was perhaps the most successful animated series ever; It is going through and literally experiencing in the Fleischers and studios, which lasts to this day. <br /> <br /> Return of King Features for another try for success is without doubt the reason to try a very popular character in comics HENRY BETTY BOOP output; goal is to search for the other series. Meditation is certainly seemed sound. HENRY was the most popular in the Hearst Publications composition; They are and as the Daily and color of Comics Supplement Tuesday, Puck, WEEKLY comics. You know, "What fools these mortals be!" Remember that one, Schultz? In view chubby, little, bald boy comic «Hero» and his antics on the screen, both solo and in tandem with Miss Betty; We were pleasantly surprised at how well the character has been processed. History and director Dave Fleischer, and gets a lot of comic situations and gags like that seemed best suited to the nature of the little Henry. These mostly silent vignettes were very important for the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page; as a feature HENRY mostly done in a 4 'mime' colors <br /> <br /> In the cartoon titled BETTY BOOP Henry :. Funniest American LIVING (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), we see that there is; basically be a situational exercise; It is interspersed with the usual array of quick-fire Dave Fleischer in, machine-gun like jokes. In short, Henry sees the puppy in the window Betty Boop in the Pet Shop. This kind of love at first sight, as Henry tries to buy a small dog puppy with only the money he had, to the coins in his pocket. He is educated Miss Boop, it would be $ 2.00 in the depression era of money to make a purchase. Tears appear as a little guy leaves dejectedly. <br /> <br /> BUT pardoned soon on the horizon, as Betty asks the boy in the head in the store while she goes on an urgent matter. In exchange for their services, Miss Betty promises him the dog instead. Of course, they are dealing with, and Betty leaves <br /> <br /> Getting to work on cleaning the cells and feeding cattle Fleischer offers the opportunity for the crew to fire a whole new line of jokes. this time with the participation of bird seed, bald Henry and click broom. (But not all at once, of course, Schultz!) Henry enthusiasm for mass feeding store to the first head literally seeding the population of birds quickly leads to a massive desertion of birds; from the store to open out in a mass prison break. <br /> <br /> BETTY back to this kind and expresses its disappointment and anger with the temporary care of Henry guardian. All bets were not excluded entirely to dog Henry. He starts to leave; depressed; but he soon convinces the owner to give him another shot at fixing things. His head is covered with bird seed, he is able to drive all the small birds creatures; returning them to the pet store COOP. Fortunately, the little guy out; but this time he has his sweet little face licking puppy. <br /> <br /> UNDOUBETLY is a winning combination. We carefree, full of energy, free lift boy, kindness Betty and the emotion of the situation and doubtful outcome "a boy and his dog" situation. Max and Dave Fleischer gave us a kind of almost negligible mini-masterpiece of surrealistic comedy short. <br /> <br /> We were very surprised that no HENRY series was not. Judging from the fairly accurate interpretation of the character, it certainly could continue for some time. In any case, it Teaming in many ways was the best of Betty Boop try photography. Although the first, hitting SAILOR (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933), was the most successful (and almost any Betty Boop in it, except for a cameo role as a carnival hula dancer); Henry Short was much better than the next two King Features «test», Betty Boop and the little King and Betty Boop and a little JIMMY, like 1936. <br /> <br /> Poodle SCHNITZ !!
