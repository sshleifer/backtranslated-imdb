Spoiler for those who are lucky enough to ever see this film (so really not a spoiler at the end). I saw this film when it was released, and I still remember his part. All this in a small town in the west, or what was left of the city. It looks more like a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them are a couple where the wife is especially evil. She lets her man dies at the end of the film and leaves the city, but should cross the desert. We never know what's going on with her near, but before she left her dying shoots behind her and deliberately hit her, and instead of the water supply. She does not know that soon it will be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in the funny farm - but this is another story, which I do not remember too well. Impressions from the movie was that it was one of the first times I have seen a very evil woman in the film, which claims to be anything but evil - can not be compared with a witch in "Snow White", which, in comparison easy learn. Very close to several Western protagonists and still captivating.
