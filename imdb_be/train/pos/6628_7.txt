I saw this movie at the forefront-premiere at the festival IMAGINA in Monaco. <br /> <br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago, and since then, I've been waiting to see the final result. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is a full 3d film with high contrast black and white imaging. Obviously inspired by some of the comic books, such as those of F. Miller. In this optics, it goes one step further than the wonderful adaptation of «Sin City» by Robert Rodriguez. At this time, (almost) NO gray or any color medium, but graphic style never seen in a realistic animated film. (Can not wait for turbidity) <br /> <br /> The massive use of Motion Capture gives a lot of life and the credibility of the characters, and we forget very quickly the technical aspect, to focus on the more classical elements, such as the direction or area. Direction remains sober and controlled, despite the endless possibilities of the medium, and it is really a good surprise. <br /> <br /> futuristic stories (Paris, 2053) makes it a classic sci-fi film and keep the viewer interested until the end. Despite the classic basic storyline (an investigation that goes far beyond the initial expectations) atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, the absolute power of some firms ...) gives this film a lot of interest. <br /> <br /> Despite this animated film, this one is definitely not for children. You will not find any funny pet or any silly family morality, just the cold reality. . It is much closer to a good film noir <br /> <br /> I have found that the installation is one of the best aspects of the film: we still feel is well-known in Paris, but transformed with a fine touch of futurism. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I regret a few mistakes. Assembling sometimes a little flat, one or two very cliché slow motion effects and some bad dialogue. Even if the technical wonderful, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like the "Final Fantasy" and did). These little things make it 7/10. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to look, if you can. Director, Christian Volkman, knows how not to fall into the potential pitfalls (luckyly, they did not ask John Woo to do the job!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a film with an explosive visual, intellectual history and great art direction. See if you can! <br /> <br /> Please forgive me for spelling mistakes.
