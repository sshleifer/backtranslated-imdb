While 9 it may seem that an unusually high score for such a small film, however, compared to the hundreds and hundreds of detective series of films from the 1930s and 40s, this is one of the best, and very beneficial to Powell later «Thin Man» movies. Now this does not mean that the film, which is similar to Thin Man movies, and booth murder case is not a comedy, but more traditional mystery-detective movie. Now you might think that not having Nora Charles or Asta or traditional comic sidekick (something found in almost all the series of detective films) together to meet it would be damage, but I did not miss them at all, because it was such an exceptionally well-written film - having a really interesting case, and uniformly excellent performances all <br /> <br /> film begins at the dog show and kennel called Murder case, although the film, Phil Vance actually spends. little time for dogs and dog shows are not super-important part of the film. Instead, thoroughly hated man was killed and left in a fully closed room - the idea is repeated in quite a few other detective films (eg, Crime Doctor's Strangest Case). However, all this is explained seems quite reliable and fit together very well - to keep my interest throughout. I'm sure I want other detective films of the day was how to competently written plots and exceptional acting like this. This is definitely one keeper.
