If the subject of The Girl From Missouri sounds familiar it should be. This is because Anita Loos, who wrote the script here also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in the film, Jean Harlow will take any jewelry from men means. <br /> <br /> And it's men means that after Jean Harlow. She goes to the roadside hash house run by her mother and stepfather, because she decided that the best way to get an easy life, to marry him. Her talent as a chorus limited, but it will be able to trade on this beauty. <br /> <br /> her odyssey begins with her and one Patsy Kelly receive an invitation to speak at a party hosted by millionaire Lewis Stone. But the unknown Jean Stone just having a wild last throw before making himself because of money, which he does not possess. Nevertheless, she scrapes a few trinkets from him, that guy millions Lionel Barrymore posts. <br /> <br /> Lionel entertained him until Jean does not set her sights on him the playboy son, Franchot tons. After that, he was not pleased, and he looks to shake Jean from climbing the family tree. <br /> <br /> The Girl from Missouri went into production in the middle of the device code so it went for a kind of censorship. I have a feeling that we would have seen much more risky film. Nevertheless, Jean Harlow as a junior and Sassier version of Mae West always appreciated. What a great comic talent, that the woman, having seen The Girl from Missouri, is a sad reminder of a great loss to the world of the film incurred it passes through the three years. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough casting Patsy Kelly Harlow, no doubt under the influence of successful shorts Kelly is doing with other known platinum blonde Thelma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same easy chemistry between Patsy was with Thelma. Todd, too, would die a year later in an accident / suicide / murder, there is no satisfactory explanation was never really given. <br /> <br /> I do not miss the girl from Missouri, is a bright and brazen, to be away from it all sparkling jewelry.
