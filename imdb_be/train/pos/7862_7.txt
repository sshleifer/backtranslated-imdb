Here's proof of why Mary Pickford was America's' favorite. In this rather complex drama, Mary plays a young daughter of squatters that have dared to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the `rhinestones hills. Scene where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall just stunning. She is even willing to take a bath. It Mary could pull this role from the age of 30 years, it's amazing, and some because of her small stature (5 '). <br /> <br /> Tess have to face many physical and emotional problems. It does this with the courage not seen in many heroines time. Tess packs wallop and does not hesitate to fight with anyone. Why she agrees to help `hill tops' daughter for me, but she sacrificed her happiness to keep a deep secret. Pickford close windows are fine. <br /> <br /> Danish born Hersholt just wonderful, as the villain. The scene in which he manhandles small child is enough to make you throw vegetables (or any other) on the silver screen. If Forrest Robinson (who plays the dad Skinner) had a beard, he would have been a match for the model, which is used in these Uncle Sam recruiting poster of World War ?? He wants you! <br /> <br /> Although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning, it is worth the investment in time to see a piece of the net or `Americana". The film highlights the option available to all with making someone happy, and that he must be a real Christian we have. Recommended.
