ROLL great little film. Toby Malone plays old child 18 years of age (very well acted, by the way), which is football. Cousin Malone takes it on the night before the big game on an adventure with lots of twists and turns with two gym bags, drug lord, some tough bikers, some cops and some prostitutes ... and the film keeps us guessing which characters on which side of the law, that the content of any gym bags, and even the fact that the floor key biker. Parts of it reminded me of CASTLE availability and Two Smoking Barrels. <br /> <br /> For me ROLL reinforced with three thoughts that I have spent in front of ROLL view. These statements: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. Country and city are beautiful, and it looks like a cool place to rest. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best directors in Australia. Cinematography was particularly impressive in the ROLL. I loved the stylized flowers and lighting in many scenes. <br /> <br /> 3. Australian women HOT!
