This series got me in writing of Dayton and the genre when I was younger, and I love this presentation of history. I would not, however, agree with the above comment. From what I've read in the past, this is not the performance of Holm, leading Dayton to refuse to have a number of released but butchering, who received all three books translated to the screen. A perfect example of this is the rewriting of crossing boarder cross, which ended the career field of Samson. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in a mine field has never been in any of the books, and the transition in Georgia was from East Germany to West Germany, and not the Polish border. This whole story cloth. Changes to Block in a similar way to damage the integrity of the story. My view on the hills of the performance is that he portrayed Samson disorientation during flight his wife is wonderful, and I think, well behaved drawing aging field agent trying desperately to overcome the class chasm. Samson, and to pay for his father's idealism and suffers because of his influence on his life. As Clevemore comments, if he got himself the formation he would probably department was launched. I think that this loss of productivity because of appearance more than anything. Holm is diminutive compared to the book Samson - physically great man, able to use his size to impose a presence.
