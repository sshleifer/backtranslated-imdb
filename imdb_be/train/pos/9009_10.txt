This film really captures the feeling of freedom ....... and that the freedom of your own integrity in the stands .... wonderful, carefree way. Nha serious, but fun adventure. <br /> <br /> The story reflects life. We are what we do not always want to get right, but we find that we get what we need to understand why we did not get what we wanted .... which leads us to become more than we thought we would get! You'll get it as soon as you see the movie. <br /> <br /> And this movie is really about finding love and knowing one found it, and it has completely changed my life. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites .... ..not easy to find but worth the hunt ......... I guarantee you will watch it more than once!
