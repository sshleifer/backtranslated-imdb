beauty Clara Bow and excellent handling are the main reason to see this movie. "Hula" is not quite on the same level with the best movies of Clara, but it's still nice. she dances, she rides a horse, and pursued the man that she loves. this film is just over an hour in length, and was directed by future Oscar winner Victor Fleming (Gone with the Wind) .the film moves quickly and Clara Bow has a lot of screen time. if you want to Clara, I would recommend "blasphemy."
