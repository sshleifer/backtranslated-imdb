It takes courage to make a film about Gandhi in India, where it is not specified as a man who could do wrong.This film shows how the Mahatma could not be a decent father (at least in the eyes of his son). <br /> <br /> The performances stunning, fantastic cinematography, direction fabulous, but the film drags.If goal was to make this film without any box office expectations, I guess that's the case, then his brilliant try, but if manufacturers expect that it will be a commercial success, the film's fate was doomed the day they have chosen this topic .. <br /> <br /> 20 YRS now, this film will be remembered for the brilliant image of Harilal Khanna.He Akshay deserves a nomination for Oscar for this one..And honest, it is not only the performance is worth applauding, Shefali Chhaya excite yucha also .. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene where Harilal hears death.No dialogues parents, no shouting, but his voice was shot Khanna.Its one of the best scenes ever shot a movie in the history <br /> < br /> Gandhi, my father is not quite an exciting film, but its a great movie and mandatory watch.Brilliant Attempt ..
