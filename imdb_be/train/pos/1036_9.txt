The clock on the Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films made during World War II. Paul Lucas, certainly deserves his Oscar. Bette Davis shines brightly as a great actress and a beauty it was. I would recommend this movie, who are interested in that era, and of course, fabulous movies late, great, Mrs. Betty Davis.
