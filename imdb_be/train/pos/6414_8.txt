It was interesting to see how critics responded to the fiery, inspirational film, so I went on Rotten Tomatoes, and was alarmed to discover that pompous peanut gallery, which is a film critic of our country gave the film average of 43% (or "Rotten") rating. <br /> <br /> All I can say no, if this film does not move you, you have no heart. (It is interesting to note that the same movie on the same site there is a rating of 74% of the audience). <br /> <br /> Not that, according to critics, that's all that matters to me. In the end, I can not think of a more useless overpaid profession. Some Schmo pay to go to the movies (what a tough life), and does the same, everything else on the planet is: forming an opinion. But these sheep have a way of coming across as something their opinion matters more than you, and even worse, they love to hate. <br /> <br /> I admit that this film is old-fashioned (well, except for the F-bombs), thick and a bit predictable ... in the end, you know, from the outset, Cuba Gooding Jr., drawing real-life Navy hero Brashear, he is going to win (in the end) at every step just by the way he comes across: determined and courageous; strong-willed and optimistic. <br /> <br /> But his statement and De Niro (as Billy Tuesday, the composite character of several real life people) are so strong, so inspiring that you'll be on your feet cheering many movie scenes, especially in the hall of the court climax . You'd have to be a real stick in the mud, so as not to move the scene. As a criticism of our country film. Rappaport is excellent, as well as sweet-natured, stuttering student that befriends diving Brashear Gooding Art. If someone saw "higher education", this character is completely redeems the character <br /> <br /> In any case, it confirms what I have always felt :. Do not listen to critics. Watch this movie and get inspired.
