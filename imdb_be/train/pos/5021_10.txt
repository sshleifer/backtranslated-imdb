I made this film and watched it 20 times before I took him back to the store. Bill Paxton hired a first rate talent to make a good thriller with an interesting twist. History of the original and well-written. Paxton Powers Boothe, and how to deliver good performances. The story is told in an interesting manner with both retrospective 20 years ago, then a spot at the moment, alternating back and forth. This narrative style makes for a good action movie that can not get bored. Bill Paxton, please do more horror movies, you have a talent for it!
