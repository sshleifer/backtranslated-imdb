"Spin it!» <br /> <br /> The 90s opened with a clever Disney favorite, "Miracles on bends" cartoon series that featured characters from "The Jungle Book." Joined Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker ducks as they fly sea, like you've never seen it before: from Cape Suzette, to Louis, to the mountain, through the jungle, on the water, in volcanoes, in search of adventure, treasure seeking, looking for fun, all in one action-packed adventure cartoon !!!! ! <br /> <br /> This was my favorite, and my family. It ran the Disney Afternoon entire first half of the 90s, while the original cartoons moved to Old Disn ey Channel in 1995 that I saw on vacation once in 1996, before the cable in March 1997. <br /> <br /> The good news today !!!!! DVDs here to have fun and excitement "Dun, dun, dun, Miracles on bends» !!!!! <br /> <br /> 10/10
