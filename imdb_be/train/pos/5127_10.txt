Okay, so I've come a long way from Houston now, but every time I see this movie, I took a little shepherd boy to dream to one day ride the bull at Jill's. (Burned before I was drinking age.) <br /> <br /> If you grew up in East Texas, you know that this movie is an accurate picture of modern life at the time. If you do not trust me, and watch a movie. Either you join the many who loved him (and at the same time, strangely repulsed), or, at least, you can make fun of a red-neck. (There is plenty for making fun of the material.) The film does not try to be RS (As it was in the 80s) or to hide white trash element and honest in place and time. <br /> <br /> you have to be 10 for me!
