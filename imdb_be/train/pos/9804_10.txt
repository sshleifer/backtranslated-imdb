Elizondo voice makes the poison, which is much more memorable than forgetting version in "Batman and Robin". Finally, Batman has a secret descent to solve with an "eye" back to «Detective Comics» (that's what "DC" means, in the end.) The revolution in secret beautifully funky twist. <, Br /> <br /> The number adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the film.
