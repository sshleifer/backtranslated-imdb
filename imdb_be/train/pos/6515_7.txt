I almost did not rent it because of all the bad comments, but did anyways.I thought it was like the darkness falls, which I liked, too. The only part I hated the tooth ferry was 2 red cervical brothers in the gas station.They was funny and made me laugh a dialogue, but it is not a comedy. It ruined the film for me a little, because it was unnecessary.The rest of the movie was the way of horror or suspense movie should be. Make-up was good, and I've seen a lot worse movies, then this one. It was a simple story with believable acting.It not the most terrible or goriest movie, but I was not tick I want to return the money after the viewing. The DVD was a preview of other films, all of which look good, and I'll check them.
