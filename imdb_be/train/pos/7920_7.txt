Full Moon High (1981) 3 out of 5 in the Dir: Larry Cohen Starring: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Rose Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is an average guy, an ordinary high school. I'm preparing for the big game back home, a friend in trouble, and the growth of hair in strange places ?? you know, the usual. But the hair of the amazing places becomes a little bit out of control, when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) leaves him with a wicked case of furballs. Who is doomed to walk the world forever young werewolf Adam get any girl? <br /> <br /> «Full Moon High» is not often said, but it's silly and entertaining parody of horror. Larry Cohen (Q winged snakes material) involves so many fastening, as it can possibly come up as the writer / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows good timing in the lead role. If you happen to be a fan of deception as "Airplane" and "student" I think you'll have fun with this laugh-festival.
