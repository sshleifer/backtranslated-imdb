It should be one of the funniest television comedy to come out of the state after the collapse of "Everybody Loves Raymond." Warburton is always fun, and this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. David Spade continues to tickle my funny bone with his extremely completely unique delivery of their lines. After raving on the British series, "Coupling" I can see from the whole, where the creators of "Rules of Engagement" were his original idea, but it is not intended to be a "fragment of brick" - absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way he handed set specific series are totally different from each other. But it takes more than competent throw to bring the success of the new series, in particular, in a very complex field of comedy. Being part of a professional team of TV comedy writers for the better part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate in particular the role of the director and the perceptive and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the few complaints I have with this series is very obviously "canned" laughter. Of course, the live audience could be used in the filming.
