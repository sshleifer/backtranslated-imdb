It's really an incredible film. Moreover, the document of the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to get a proper voice, but it also shows the United States for its dishonesty, tricks and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader is fighting against what can only be described as despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion and justice. These filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything seen before. <br /> <br /> And in the crosshairs, we see the United States, once again pulling the strings and blurring the sense of reality. It is heartbreaking to watch the initial stages of the uprising, knowing full well that the undermining of democracy that we have seen for a long time is a tool used by successive US governments and their seemingly blinders citizens. Footage becomes clear that this is not manipulation of the TV or the average square footage, but the active document people and their government, who are fighting for their future. Really moving experience for anyone with a conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Long live Chavez. <br /> <br /> We have to consolidate the notion that each country should be allowed to choose their own government and develop in such a way that the majority sees fit. The first step in this process is the need to know the realities of the situations there, and the film does a great job doing just that.
