Matthau and George Burns was a famous vaudeville comedy act, Lewis and Clark, who did not speak for 10 years. Burns resigned and Matthau took it personally and held a grudge ever since. This premise of this hilarious Neil Simon play made into a movie. Of course, what makes it so good is Matthau and Burns in the prime of life, and the material is funnier than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin clear as the nephew and agent Matthau in. There's even an old clips of real stars golden era, to get you into the film slot, and character actor Fritz Feld starts it all with a "pop.» Rosetta LANoire, which began in the 30s in the theater with Orson Welles, and later had a grandmother to "family issues," big in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with him (and maybe I "m too picky and / or serious) is a way Matthau heals burns, when they first met. Of course, he had a lot of resentment festering all these years, but some of the things that he would be considered rude or bad manners simply taken out of context. In addition, I used to see Matthau act in this way in other films, but not George Burns. And the lowing Matthau tends to get a little old. <br /> <br /> In general, if you need to consistently funny film to help and forget their problems, posed in «The Sunshine Boys.» They will lift your mood and make you think of a simpler time and way of life <br / > <br /> Benjamin. "You have to slide it.» <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait, I think you have to slide it.".
