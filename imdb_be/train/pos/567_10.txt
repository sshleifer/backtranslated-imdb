Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann teamed up to make some of the best westerns ever, and this is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The real star of the film but the spectacular Canadian Rockies, which serve as a backdrop for the story. Some of the best movies ever made in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> In all five of the Westerns that Stewart and manna did together support roles have been completely ignored. No exception here, down to the details, which may have only a few lines, the characters are firmly imprinted with these lines. <br /> <br /> Stewart annoying cynical loner in this film, the only real friend is his Sidekick Walter Brennan. Brennan is death in the hands of evildoers, that makes him want to finally release the settlement of gold from the bad guys and the way to redeem themselves in the process. <br /> <br /> John McIntyre is the head villain, and he was underrated actor with a wide range. He could play a magnificent old codgers, authority figures, and in this case, a particularly nasty and insidious villain. <br /> <br /> One of the best westerns ever.
