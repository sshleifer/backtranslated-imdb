This indie film looks at the life of a group of people who take adult swim class in Connecticut. The plot is quite thin. What drives the film is the characters, well played largely unknown actors. Movers are cast Brewster as a high school teacher, who have problems in marriage and Weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. The two actresses give natural performances, and work well together. This is an impressive feature film debut for writer Schechter and Setton director. Last keeps the story moving at a clip soon. The name of the movie and the poster suggest something obscene, but it's an amazing little comedy-drama.
