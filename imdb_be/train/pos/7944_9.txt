Have you ever or do you have a pet who has been with you through thick and thin, that you would be lost without, and the one you love, no matter what? I bet you never thought that they feel the same way about you! <br /> <br /> A great, great family film. If you have a soft spot for animals, it is guaranteed to make you cry, no matter your age. I watched this movie all the time when I was a little kid, and I believe that now, at the age of sixteen, I love it as much as I did then. I could never decide on a favorite character then, and I still do not think I can! I love all three animals. Dialogue seems to be very real and comfortable, how to love, but the feuding families. I love the chance and in the end, he says that he has a family in the past. Cheesy, yes, but we must remember that it is meant to be a family movie, and it fulfills this role perfectly. Sassy are just the perfect dose «sassiness» and Shadow is the perfect model of leadership / role of a young, adventurous chance. <br /> <br /> Animal way overshadow the man, but, of course, most watery moments that happened during the interaction with them (ie. save Molly, and at the end). Not to mention an incredible soundtrack that gives every moment even more emotions and accompanying heart swelling feeling. I give it a 9/10. To compare (and even better, than the nominal value) Cats and Dogs and the Kid.
