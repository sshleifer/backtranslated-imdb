I'm not a writer or critic ... I'm just a student, who has seen this movie a few minutes ago .... And I want to thank those who worked on the creation of this film! This is not the best or the most .... but it touched my heart ... why ??? I would like to understand it myself ... and easily accessible..it is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day is spent to look at it without any regret about time! it's about the love and care about the life that we have, but we miss him sometimes because of material things ....... Look at all the time that we have, but we miss him. ... why the fu * k do we do that ??? we have to live like dying ... to take care of every other, and remember that if we do good things, good things come back to us real happiness .. .and he has a special flavor in New York ... I love this city and the world we live !!!! thank you very much for the film, and I'm sorry for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
