I still liked it, though. Warren Beatty is only fair, as a comic book hero. What saves the film is set, and an incredible cast of branches mediocre script. I really expected something more substantial in terms of action or plot, but I got very little. The main reason to watch this movie to see some of the biggest stars in Hollywood at that time in such an unusual film. <br /> <br /> One man who did a terrible job, and do not even belong in this film was Madonna. It does not belong in this film and her acting work was pretty bad. The film is in some places just froze. You expected something more, and you have not received anything. Al Pacino plays a very bad man, and he's doing very well. He and Beattie makes a great good guy and bad guy. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in the film, except Isthar. I have not seen Ishtar, but I've heard bad things. Talking about this movie is good, but it could be much better. I liked it as a kid, because I thought it looked cool, and the film is visually amazing, incredible sets, writing only right and with the cast in the movie, I would have expected a little better anyway. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> I especially thought the ending was not big enough. It was interesting, but I just thought for such a grand scale film that you could end up with little more than a bang. The reason to see this film is the atmosphere. The film uses a 7 color comics doing all that more remarkable visual anyway. <br /> <br /> costumes and makeup were flawless, and his. Face make-up for Scoundrels was great. Beatty is simply not up to such a larger than life character. Nevertheless, it is a good film that could be much more. It is better for me than Batman and other comic book adaptation, which appeared close to the same time. Of course, this film was a lot more in gross terms.
