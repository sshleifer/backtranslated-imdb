I've seen this movie many times, and I like all the bad teachers want to give it a ten out of ten, but feel that it would be unfair to the other good film. Nevertheless, I believe that this is one of those rare gems: a perfect comedy. This venture is one of the greatest comedy films of all time. Matthau and Lemmon and blends perfectly mismatched. The script is so urgent that you need to stop the bleeding. This story is well known and have already been described in other comments. Two wires provide unusual presentation, the girl is beautiful and funny side of the situation. Not one swear word in the field of view (the sign that Hollywood, you must not swear to be funny, you have to be witty) and the transition from stage to film seamless. They do not make'em like this anymore. Timeless.
