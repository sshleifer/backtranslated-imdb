This is truly one of the best films about the love that I've ever seen. Closely followed by none other than "Before Sunset," which technically is not another movie at all, since we are talking about the same two people the same novel. <br /> <br /> This is the "love" in the real world, well, it's only when the majority of people as intelligent and eloquent as the lead in the film. Reading other reviews, it pleases me to know how many other people are going crazy over the movie on the basis of dialogue, as well. And this is what makes "Before Sunrise," as well. Dialogue is perfect. It's so real, so interesting and fun. It is hardly surprising that Jesse and Celine fall in love, "because you fall in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one in the cafe, where they pretend to phone their best friends, the other pretense can say best friend. It's great. It brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life. <br /> <br /> I have to say that if you have a choice, do watch "Before Sunrise" before watching "Before Sunset." If, like me, you watched "Sunset" First, it's hard to shake the feeling of pity and sorrow for the two young lovers throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books, a wonderful action, a great script, and beautiful places. Young love at it's best.
