This film is more than Lupine, the majority, especially if a Funimation. Other then the bad dubbing, it is not bad. <br /> <br /> In the first hour much as Comic (all Lupine third material is based on). Lupine is trying to get a huge treasure. Fudiko using Lupine weakness for women to try to get something out of it. The last bit is not so bad, he is with another woman, but, of course, is still his number one. <br /> <br /> Fudiko in many other movies Lupine more families from the tills of words that Lupine. Any good Lupine fan I think it will be pleasantly surprised (I know that I was heard so many bad things about this film). It can be a little better without the little animation in the rolling credits (they make it a little softer), but overall, it's not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few, I would look back from Lupine III movies.
