Many of the classic films of the late 60-ies retained their ability to disturb and confront the audience. «In Cold Blood» not lost an ounce of his strength. Its exceptionally well done still makes the viewer think. Some of them complained not only about the film and about the source of Truman Capote's "non-fiction novel," that the central message unsubtle. That may be true, but it is certainly the case when the absence of ambiguity does not detract from the film at all. Its refreshing, especially given today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas to watch the film with the political voice of uncompromising convinced to make the audience believe his point. Frankly, I'm not sure if I agree with the central notified it film, but I admire his audacity, however. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not agree with the message against capital punishment, there's a lot to admire about the film. To act from the two terminals is terrific. Scott Wilson (one of the most underrated actors ever) is terrible as nihilistic leader, one who uses his charisma to hide their weaknesses. Robert Blake as frightening as the more submissive of the two, and one with a conscience. His character, obviously, has the voice of reason, but terrified to go against Wilson (Theres a good amount of homoerotic subtext in the part of the character). The cinematography is beautiful, graceful, but rough and really gives the impression that the viewer is watching a documentary. Add another classic account with Quincy Jones, and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
