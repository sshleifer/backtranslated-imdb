This is one of those movies that you wish you had not seen before - so you can see it again, "for the first time." Van Din√© book still brings pleasure - but excessively quaintly referred to by many. This movie is definitely the best adaptations of his works. Nha William Powell William Powell - to say the least. The plot is convoluted. History is moving too fast, because you want it to last. Enjoy.
