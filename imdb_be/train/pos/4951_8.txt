Honestly, if someone had told me the director of Lehman Snicket Series of Unfortunate Events, City of Angels, and Caspers was going to make a neat low budget indie film, and that it would be really good, I would say that a person must be kidding. But that's what made the director Brad Silberling. And it was really good. <br /> <br /> Â«10 Items or Less" has a similar ambition in such films as "Before Sunrise," "Lost in Translation" or more recently "Once." It includes the chance meeting of two people who, if serendipity did not put them there, they probably never intersect, or if they did, they would not say a word to each other. Like those movies, "10 steps or less," focuses on the relationships that are built and how the characters come to understand each other and build on the strengths and weaknesses of each other. <br /> <br /> The history includes Morgan Freeman, playing the unnamed actor who goes to study its role as a grocery store employee for the upcoming independent film and because of the things that do not depend on it, in the end to hold day with the lady in the 10 items or less lane play Paz Vega. It has a rotten marriage and hopes to land a new job as a secretary. Freeman was originally a character just need a lift home. After spending time with her, however, he wants to know it, and may even offer her some advice. <br /> <br /> Brad Silberling builds character almost entirely due to exchange between Freeman and Vega. The plot is just an excuse for these two characters to interact with each other for most of the duration of the film 80 minutes. Freeman fun with his character, he is a stranger in the lower world class that character Vega, Scarlett, inhabits. Vega, at the same time, rising for hard cash clerk frustration with the situation of her life, looking to move on. <br /> <br /> There's a couple of things that really stood out in this film. First of all, Siberling, probably took note of the independent film, to ensure that the relationship sincere and does not fall into any underwater stones Hollywood. This is a very mutual friendship that develops convincing throughout the film. This works even if the situation does seem a bit unthinkable. <br /> <br /> I am also impressed by the performances. While Freeman presence gives the film credibility with the go, it shows a certain amount of charm and fun are usually not seen from him. Paz Vega, meanwhile, pouring himself a breakthrough in the US film sometime in the future. I loved her in Spanglish and is equally well here, as hard, no-nonsense Scarlett. Toward the end of the film, she successfully passes her character growth. I'm looking forward to see her in more films. <br /> <br /> In general, 10 points less than the best features in the sign part, and the script and directed by Brad Silberling. He did not do a lot of writing, and his feature film work consisted mainly of major Hollywood films. But there is, of course, the artist at work here, and I wanted to see if he will be on the road again.
