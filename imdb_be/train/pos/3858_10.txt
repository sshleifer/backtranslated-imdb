American cars director Paul Verhoeven have different quality, but most of the films he has made in his native country indisputable masterpieces. This is the story of alcohol (or bisexual), a writer who moves to a beautiful rich and very strange woman. But the lady does not know what he is interested only in achieving a nice woman lover. At the same time, the writer suffered from strange visions - at first they appear as hallucinations caused by alcohol abuse, but he soon begins to realize that he really feels a premonition. Exciting Hitchcockian thriller, a very original and provocative. I like movies that make you think they are about something, but then realizes that they are about something completely different. This is one of those movies; thriller in the first half, and the quasi-religious surrealist saga in the second half. Very sexy, original and blasphemous, but not for children or people who go to church every Sunday. Big cinema for the next director Jan de Bont. Very Reommended!
