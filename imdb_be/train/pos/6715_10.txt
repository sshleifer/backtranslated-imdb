I loved watching "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" on Friday night at TGIF ABC. I think it was one of the best shows on TGIF. My friends and I used to get together every Friday just to watch the show, and we never missed an episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. He was loved and sooo funny. I liked the guy Sabrina Harvey too. He was hot. I think Melissa Joan Hart played the good witch teenager, too. My favorite episodes of "Sabrina the Looking-Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: in adolescence." These episodes were great. <br /> <br /> In general, I really miss that show. I hope that one day ABC brings it back with new episodes. I give this show 10/10 stars.
