Although too young to remember the first show of the series (as a child), I then caught the replays on TV in the late 80s, just when I was interested in getting the war and all its aspects. It was my grandfather who first showed me the series, and also gave me my first interests relating stories about his time in the Royal Navy in Malta and then in the Pacific. Since then, I have eaten many books and seen many TV series about World War II era, with mixed thoughts. British television channels are usually very good at producing these, World at War can easily confirm, with many jewels made by the BBC and independent companies. I strongly recommend that names such as "Nazis - a warning from history", "Blitz" and the BBC series about Dunkirk. "Britain War in Color", its companion series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​have a very high standard. World At War, by far, the best and, despite his age, never put. There will always be new discoveries about the war, which will keep being that, obviously, are not included in the series and, of course, the Second World War took place on such a large canvas, which is to produce a series with each piece would have taken more time and money then any other, even if the company was even possible. What I feel that I must say to those who condemn that it does not include everything that World at War physically can not do it in the series, but it sure as hell can tell you to do further research - and do it enjoyable. It certainly worked for me: now I have a very extensive library of books, videos, DVD, cassettes and CDs. I recommend to all, even a fleeting interest. The series was so well made that they can not but agree that it is the quality of programming and very informative.
