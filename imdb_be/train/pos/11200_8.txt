This early film has its flaws-- predictable plot and some scenes are too long doubtful relevance--, but this is clearly demonstrated mastery of Hitchcock's editing and the use of powerful images. Also among the most stylistically expressionists of his films; It should be noted that the examples he uses strange distortion during batch sequence and frequent echoes of both the title and the story in images. <br /> <br /> Its core, however, remains the final match, which is still among the more interesting examples of cinematic boxing. Even if you know that the hero should win, then it is quite likely that he will lose, and the movement out of the corner of his wife's champion to him, claiming the final section returns, in a very well intertwined with the course of a match. Insert a stopwatch to do exactly what they need; you can hear the ticking of (even if it is a silent film, visual effects are often surprising auditory feeling to them). Walking becomes surprisingly quickly, and the viewer gets involved in unrest and violence as a match and sexual jealousy, which underlies it. <br /> <br /> The only DVD-release, with which I am familiar is that LaserLight, public domain companies. As every Hitchcock silent they are released, they are attached to different musical selections, mostly orchestral, to action. Sound editing is often messy, and the sound quality varies widely, but some real concern, it seems, went to the most viable options, and the music that accompanies the final match very well; it is unlikely that this sequence will never be better accompanied than here. <br /> <br /> This is a much more impressive film than his current uncertainty would suggest. It deserves its rightful place in the Hitchcock canon and slender list decent boxing movies.
