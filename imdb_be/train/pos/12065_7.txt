"Nothingness" is far from a great movie, the play directed by Nic Roeg. In the scheme of films Rogue is higher than most of his post "Do not look now" work, which is characterized by the use of reasonable Theresa Russell in the title role. It is actually very well here and away from this problem in other films Rogue as «Bad Timing" and "Cold Heaven». As "actress", which is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is a very effective, drawing her as a thoroughly depressing, but pretty siren. It plays well with Michael Emil, like Einstein, which is great, to say the least. He looks the part perfectly, and while Theresa Russell does not look just like Monroe, she is certainly attractive enough to make part of the ring for sure. Other players are adequate, if not quite as arresting as Emil and Russell is. Quite capable, intelligent script sent Roeg well, but, of course, is not that good as «Walkabout» or «Performance». As in other films later, Rogue, he tends to rely too much on vague, immaterial flashbacks that add very little to the film. In many ways, the film would have worked better as a short (say, 60 minutes), a modest part. Nevertheless, it is quite acceptable permeability film. Sometimes quite different, but somewhat lacking in general. Rating - 1/2 *** / *****
