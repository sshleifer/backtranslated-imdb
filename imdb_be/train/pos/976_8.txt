Takashi Miike foray into the kiddie pool in the territory conquered me almost immediately, because it demonstrates the audacity and courage to fight with fantasy elements. It is a tale that dares to be dark. Even as a child I thought that there was something sinister about the majority of fairy tales; terrible things happen to people in the majority of children's books. Miike realizes that this classic tale a little scary (and disturbing) than what they seem at first glance. The director takes the archetypal story of the strange kid on a quest with preschool class. He emphasizes the very real fear of a world filled with endless dangerous missions. Westerners want to downplay the seriousness of the dream stories written specifically for children. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of history, but it also shows signs of restrained. But sustained Miike even more bizarre than most directors. I thought it was a great film. Highly recommended.
