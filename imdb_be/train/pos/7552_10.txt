CAT SOUP short anime based on the legendary Mango Nekojiru. He won the award for "Best Short Film" at the 6th Festival of Fantasia Film, and won the "Excellence Award" at the Festival of Media Arts in Japan. <br /> <br /> If the soul of a small kitten Nyaako stolen by Death, she and her brother Nyatta embark on a bizarre journey to get it back. In a surreal dreamscapes on the other side, they are faced with many fairy tale characters and the remarkable, often disturbing adventures. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an anime like nothing you've ever seen . this Hello Kitty on acid is very original, stunningly beautiful has a great sense of strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP very surreal (no dialogue), and sometimes hard and mountains. So it's more anime for adults than children (they can not understand at all!). A great trip for anyone who gets the chance see this is an absolute masterpiece. A must see!
