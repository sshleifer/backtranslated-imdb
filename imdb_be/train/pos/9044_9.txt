I recently saw this film because of the recent success of Jake with Brokeback Mountain. I thought that I would see movies that I missed. I had no expectations going in the film was so amazed that I missed this film at all. This is an exciting father and son story, and this is also the story of an outsider. I even shed a few tears in the final of this remarkable tale. This film appeals to all ages. The only reason I give it 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a little in the middle, but he comes back strong in the end. Action was fine, the story was very beautiful, and the cinema was given a spectacular setting of the film. GO see this movie! Rent it, buy, watch, I LOVE IT! I know I did!
