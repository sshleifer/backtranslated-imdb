My wife and I watched the whole cycle at least three times. I can not imagine how it could be better. This is not "complete" History of the Second World War ?? NO library could not keep such a story ?? but it's a better view of the story. Many details, a lot of personal stories, and still retains the overall picture in view. <br /> <br /> The story Olivier beautifully written and, of course, gave great. Interviews are on all sides, except the Russian, because manufacturers are not allowed to talk with a number of Russian. It is very much worth having this complete program on DVD. We value our copy <br /> <br /> producer does an excellent job of providing images and actions, where there was almost no surviving in any archive :. There is almost no films convoys and underwater battles, for example, but still, the episode on this subject is very well done.
