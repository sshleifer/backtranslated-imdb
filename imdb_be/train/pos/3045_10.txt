This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh as a redneck, Arjun Singh, cheerful. Best of all is the laughter never stops. The plot is the same old same old story where a child is separated from his mother, who sacrifices everything for his debt - with a happy reunion at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and have brothers (Shash Kapoor) is the fox (Parvin Babhi) and there are fans (Patil) is a blind brother and grandfather, added in for good measure. But this film Amitabh and about everything that you remember, at the end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living, and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms funny. Later in the film he turns into Angry young man, he is known for, but the humor remains. Memorable pieces include in his walk, talk and talk in English, the song (pad gungaroo re-bandha, Meyer Night Thi) and all its Dadu. <br /> <br /> In general, I was rolling with laughter throughout the film. If you want, 3:00 Amitabh entertainment at it's best - this is it. It would be easy to give it a 10/10.
