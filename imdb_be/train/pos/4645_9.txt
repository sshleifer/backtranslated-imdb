This film is very interesting. I've seen it twice, and it seems Glover hit the nail on the head, he says he wants to do. I, for example, may be associated with indignation that the director explicitly expressed against this frivolous corporate nonsense that stress in our every media center, and the things that we, as a culture, are not supposed to "think" about due control corporate media indignation that Glover expresses through "egregious" elements in the movies at the same time it is clear in visceral aggression and beautiful in its poetic potential. I'm glad I saw this movie, and it's even more obvious that Glover for something interesting with the second part, which will be a trilogy. It's great! ALL FINE. See, too. People who reject the film as "frivolous" or "artsy" are really missing the boat. This intelligent films. If you can see his live show he performs before his books, it is also very upset at the time. The way you get to thinking it's really something. You will have experience!
