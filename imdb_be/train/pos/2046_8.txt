Although the soundtrack a little outdated, the story is more relevant in the US is now more than ever. With not only blue-collar jobs, but all jobs to outsourcing US corporations, while the government revenue and US suffer. <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss Emory, steel workers working the same job as his father had done for 35 years. His wife is good at drawing, Pamela Reed, who is very realistic, trying to feed a family with two children when Emory loses his job. The plant is closed on the basis of poor management, but there is also a waste of cheaper wages, where they can pay one steelmaker in one month (outsourcing), that they have to pay Strauss / Emory day. No matter what these people are good loyal employees who have values ​​and try to better their family. <br /> <br /> John Goodman, Gary Cole (as Strauss's brother) and several other colleagues are also affected, it is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and his parents move. Emory hopes that his local union will be able to re-open the mill as they promise to do so. <br /> <br /> brother Emory Lee already sees the writing on the wall. There does not remain in the Rust Belt (Ohio) jobs, and they need to move on. However, when they can go to the US to?. Where it will be better for the blue-collar steelworker?. <br /> <br /> There is a winner at the end of the scene, where Emory and his team filled with cargo of steel products. The guard allows them to do this as a final gesture, one of the men committed suicide, and he has empathy. <br /> <br /> In general, a good message film about the hard times, right here in America. Something that few facials, while not personally affected. 8/10.
