As an amateur historian WW2 / Nazi Germany, I could not wait for it to come out on DVD. I missed him when he was the first on in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has been said in the previous 8 pages of comments on the historical inaccuracies. Better job, perhaps by drawing a "magic" Hitler was made. I also had a small problem with some of the casting choices, not so much for their actions, but also for their performances. Peter Stormare does not look the same as of Rohm, why they do not do Babson, Hess wear a wig? And my biggest complaint..so many have always been made of the bright blue eyes of Hitler, why did not they make Carlyle wear blue contacts? On the positive side, I think that the actors who played Goering and Drexler looked pretty good. Again, by the time people watching it understands that it has to be entertaining the 1st, another story I do not think a lot of damage is done.
