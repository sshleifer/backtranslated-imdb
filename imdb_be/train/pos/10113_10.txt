I loved this movie. Not being a fan unconscious Ed Wood Jr., I prefer to appreciate his "boundless enthusiasm" and to recognize their shortcomings. His films are fun, but his personal story of one tormented by pain. I was hoping, and was delighted to find that this film will be about understanding his turbulent life, and not just heaping his posthumous fame. From start to finish, this film stands out from the documentary film into mythology, leaving the actor and the audience suddenly connected with each other and Ed Wood Jr. <br /> <br /> What do we get people who knew Ed Wood is better to talk about it from all points of view, both positive and negative, and showing us his character, as Ed. We get an idea of ​​the personal and professional life of Ed from his songs to his drink to his sexuality, his friends, his enemies, and even his film-making <br /> <br /> The film itself is shot. in a low-budget way that seems to be made out of respect for Ed, as with most methods theatrically released films from 1996 will be disrespectful (kind of like wearing a good suit than the president). Set designer uses a sense of humor and great insight into the comparison of each cast member from their background. <br /> <br /> Fans will be pleased to hear personal testimonies of Ed Wood disputes and newcomers will be surprised that this man was true. DVD complete impossible to find gems ( "Crossroads Lorado» and gallery), but the real treasure of this film is surprisingly interesting and interrelated story. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood had the habit of determination of the people through their association with him (for better or worse), to the moment when a woman will go down in history as the "Pool Owner" at a time to give him and his friends to be baptized in its basin. This ability to define the legacy of a man emerges everywhere as the most surprising effect of the film not only give a well-rounded picture of the man who was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a complete picture of the community that he created. Anyway, never having more that one member of the cast interviews on the screen at that time, the relationship that Ed Wood made among different people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with a great sense of belonging. <br /> <br /> even the name alludes to the B-list horror genre, but in the end, we see that even this kindness. What starts out as a random unrelated stories of people ending the conclusion that all the cast will be forever intertwined in unpredictable knit fabric that will bring the story to which is the unity with descriptions Wood. <br /> <br /> In many ways the life of contradiction, Ed Wood, Jr. can not be compressed with a single point of view. This collaborative effort is closest to the knowledge of him, that we may ever. Being itself the opposition of the fact that at the same time respectful, provocative, thoughtful, exciting, funny, sad, kind, and fun.
