I saw this film when I was 13 and I really liked Dana Plato, who later starred in a variety of strokes as Kimberly Drummond. I do not think it's garbage .it was not supposed to be a continuation of a documentary. its just a nice film about children 3 children who go after the people are trying to find a monster swampy backwaters. men hurt, and the children to save them from your creatures .haunting shots out of the swamp Arkansas and decorations were clean. this is a good film for children, no real violence frightens some soft, but good fun for young children.
