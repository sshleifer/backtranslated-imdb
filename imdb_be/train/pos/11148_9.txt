"Midnight Cowboy" was rated X with the original version back in 1969, there are some scenes where you can see that, just a little. A film about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) arrives from Texas to New York to become a pickpocket sometimes a bit disturbing. Dressed as a cowboy, he tries to live like a pickpocket, making money is an act of love. It does not work the way he had planned. Once a guy named Rico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first pulled a trick on him and stole money, they become friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Joe and Ratso sick to try to make some money. <br /> <br /> The film is likely to have estimated X to the main subject, but on the way we see some strange things. Editing this film is great. We can see a sequence of dreams with Joe and Ratso interrupted the real world in a pleasant and sometimes funny. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and supporting actors give great performances. Especially Hoffman supplies some known thin line. Cost is John Barry and sound great. All this makes it a great movie, which won Oskara` for a good reason.
