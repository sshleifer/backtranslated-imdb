I work in a store movies, and as such, I am always on the lookout for a great movie. I decided to check out anything as he sat in the section of our Canadian, and I tried to support my country's film industry. I have been a surprise. In the film, David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a very fascinating history, which seems to delve into so many of our minds and relationships ... without working that hard. He consistently comedy through the interaction of the two characters, as well as some funny exchanges ( "We can not be dead, we have cable!"). What else can I say, not noticing that it is worth a shot, even if you give it up for the first half hour.
