I'm pretty pedestrian people, with several tabloid tastes. However, I sometimes try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness. This film was one of my attempts. I was in awe throughout the film. I liked it so much that I got my own band, so I could see him again. This is a very thoughtful and emotionally strange film. I saw a huge question to the audience: What is the depth of the debt sacrifice one can take, may be asked to take, should take? As a war, it is, of course, an important issue for me. This question is a great burden on the viewer of the film. <br /> <br /> recommended.
