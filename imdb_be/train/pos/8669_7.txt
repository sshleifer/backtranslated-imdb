If, in contrast to some commentators here, you are not satisfied a class war, and do not mind to see the lives of others, which are quite successful, extrovert bohemian (suffocation) and not being afraid of the English at the party and get all sorts of trouble as a result of it's not a bad movie closer to the Euro-movies rather than the usual smooth imitation American shit ... I think that the minimum sound design and a cheap camera is a conscious decision, not bad creation of the film, I Â«d to protect it, the film is not worse than the result, and it puts at the center of attention of Mr. dog, some of which are very good (Hardie- Kate thinks it's her name, like a drunk sarcastically spot-on) The only exception is David Baddiel, which should never be allowed to appear in the serious things! ! It is light, and we do not go for this kind of anatomising-a-relationship of shit in this country, but if you do not have real friends, to go to the party with which you could do worse than to sit and watch it.
