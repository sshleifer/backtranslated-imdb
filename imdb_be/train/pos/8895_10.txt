I happen to feel this movie on TV, and I could not leave him .... This is really a great movie, which causes people to learn about the history of the US from the war in Vietnam, while the state flower, the fight against racism in .... This illustrates the generation of conflict, political beliefs, race, which took place in the 60s .... I was born in 1980, so I do not know, all that stuff before ... in France, US history is not It is a priority, and that the film really got to know me a lot of facts! By the way, I think that all the actors are great; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can see this film more than 1 time every day !! It's really great .... what a shame it only appeared on television, not in the movies ... <br /> <br />
