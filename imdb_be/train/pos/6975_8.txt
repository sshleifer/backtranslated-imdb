If I had just seen the pilot of this show, I would rate him 10. I was immediately hooked on this beautiful new world. The following episodes are not fully met the promises, but I will continue to watch and hope that it gets better. Incredible production values ​​and the effect of the first course. I do not mind that he does not seem to quite match up to the BSG, because I was so intrigued by the premise and let's face it, these are two different shows. I am very pleased that both Esai Morales and one of my favorites, Eric Stoltz, again in my life (if only once a week), I missed them both. This is a show that requires a bit of thought from his audience, and that's always good. You seem to have to wrap your head around some aspects of the show; things are not always as they seem, and, of course, there are shades of gray, as well as figuratively, in the storylines, characters and, of course, a variety of virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the journey seems to be quite a ride.
