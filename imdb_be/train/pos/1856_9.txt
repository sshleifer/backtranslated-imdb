He distinguished himself as a great actor in 'Fame', he proved that he was not `Malcolm in the middle" of a mediocre actor in `Malcolm X« he showed his brotherly love for acting in 'Philadelphia', he pulled out a slam dunk 'it game, "he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in` The hurricane", he gave us an effective education Thespian in` Training day, "and now he has shown that he can also send! Denzel Washington's directorial debut Antwone Fisher `is the most moving film of the year. This sentimental story `fish'er not in connection with the defeat of what happened with the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. In contrast, dolphin tragedy, `Antwone Fisher has joyful emotional conclusion. The film is based on the true story of a young naval officer who has anger management problems due to disgusting he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays a marine psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his anger and convinces him to find his birth mother. Debut performance of Derek Luke, Antwone how excellent is the best actor I've seen aspiring actor in awhile. I did see some of the eccentric action of detailed Luke, as I have seen in the past Washington speeches. It was as though Washington said Luke- `la-la-la-Luke I am your father's an actor. Good! I dismissed Star Wars jokes before my readers to send me to a galaxy far far away. Speaking about the great Denzel, his work as a psychologist was imperious. But what can you expect from the current `Master D» itself. `Antwone Fisher was written by none other than the Antwone Fisher. Emotional enthusiasm he put into his script storylife was a `fisher king" of the material. I welcome the chief `Mr. Washington to "catch the right bait in` Antwone Fisher." ***** Excellent
