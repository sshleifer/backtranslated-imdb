I must have seen it first approximately one thousand nine hundred ninety-five Since then I have returned to it many times. That's fine! I especially like the first and second clips, "Creation" and "The growth of civilization." Wow! It was so great to be back in the glory days of CG animation. CG is way older than I, since I know that the movie "Tron" was made 7 years before my time. But this film was a landmark in the early 90s. Probably, it was the first collaboration of various CG experiments in music. I love it so much, I think I'll go watch it now. goodbye
