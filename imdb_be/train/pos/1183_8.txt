The man corrects alone after 45 years of marriage life. He also has to solve the problem of family cash cow, tulip, which refuses to afford milk. By that time, that is, he visualizes his wife, who was the one who used to Tulip milk. <br /> <br /> Tulip based on a true story told in the family Griffith, from the generation of her grandparents. The film is a nostalgic look back at a vanishing way of life, one where people still feel some sense of responsibility for each other, located in the green Victorian (Australian state, not age) rural areas. <br /> <br /> The writer and director Griffiths, obviously, has other ambitions in both areas, and this multiple award-winning 15-minute short is a great start to her reel.
