Andie MacDowell facial expressions are great again in this film. When you enter a 40 and was single for some time (or life), you may feel you are quenched. sweet reminder of the movie that love can be found anywhere when your antennae sharply active. I liked the fast sexual intercourse, which is to be out of character for the normally reserved schoolteacher (McDowell). Her former student cute enough, still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that I thought rather unrealistic or impractical, though. For example, in the scene where the other female jealousy override and the scene was created to make Andie MacDowell to lose a young man will mature police officer (another friend McDowell) allow her friend to make such a sinister act? It is so easy for those who do not stop in front of the car? Of course, accidents happen all the time, but I was hoping to get to see the heroine in a happy marriage with the first man she got involved with (this was the hardest part to believe !! For such a beautiful woman to remain single for so long ??) ... <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie makers are aware of the fact that many of the romance between the old woman and the young man will not last long. Next they know that a happy ending did not want to appeal to the public, especially the jealousy of women over 40, who are expecting some miracles to happen. A sad ending to a glimmer of hope to the sad woman who has lost her true love is sweet, but if people continued to live, it would be the last time? How long? No one knows. Nevertheless, this is a movie to make you want to see it again after some time .... in a year, maybe.
