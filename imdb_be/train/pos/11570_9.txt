Elmer Fudd laughing, relaxing in his chair and reads his comic book, his dog comfortably sleeping next to the fireplace. All peacefully until the flea does not come from being reflected. (Bloch dressed in farmer's type meetings with a large sombrero and carries a bag with the name of "A Flea" on it.) He pulls out his telescope and see the dog. (We see a great shot of the dog flea butt and whistles in a flurry of shouting He sings, "There's food around the corner, there's food around the corner!» «T- bone!") <br /> <br /> This creates a storyline that cute but-nasty fleas tormenting the poor dog. Dog fun as it responds to the flea. <br /> <br /> image of his huge teeth chew right next to the traveling flea clever dialogue and a dog made me laugh out loud several times. It can be funny dog ​​I've ever seen in the cartoon! Poor dog, threatened to take a bath, so as not to react when the stupid flea causes him pain. It is almost painful to watch, like a flea use pickaxes, hammers and the like at the dog. He puts firecrackers in dogs behind. It is cruel!
