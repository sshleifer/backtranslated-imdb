I watched it as part of my course at the University of Aberystwyth and baffles me, as it does not have a distributor in the UK. Well actually, it's not, because this movie is the whole movie Hollywood zheniya - original, creative, nimble and with a sense of humor. It seems that today no one really does not want this type of film, in the most simple terms, this is not consistent with the general conventions of most young viewers to look in the film. <br /> <br /> I haven 't written a review for IMDb for centuries, but felt inclined to give this film a special mention, even if during my 30-minute break between classes! In fact, it is nothing, as the two main characters are immersed in their own world of nothingness through the hatred of the world. The magnificence of this is how the director maintains interest through most of the execution time of only two characters, and when only the mise en scene is composed of half of the house and a huge white, empty space. This is due largely stellar performances of actors, both of which offer some great laughs at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth of their role. <br /> <br /> I would like to write a few more, but I'm on a pretty time. However, I urge one and all to give this film a try. Very unique concept is brought to the screen in a consistent and well-made fashion, with a combination of good performances, strong script, a good design and sound (relatively) impressive visuals that create a very entertaining film. <br /> <br /> It's just a shame that so few people know about anything ....
