Tragic moments were noted such as the death of Tasha in "Skin of Evil", as well as elements of the pulse-beat of danger in the "Heart of Glory", "conspiracy" and above "evil skin."

And, yes, I am biased in my opinion, declaring, "Shades of Gray" as a solid episode, because at the time of its initial airing, my face was covered in sweat, wondering whether Riker sliding it alive and live to see the other large, galactic, Outerspace adventure for the final frontier ... <br /> <br /> you know, in the years that followed, I seem to have formed a special assessment of this particular episode ... but when the decision is to go on a "best clip show episode in the history of television, "I believe that this episode should be highly valued in this relationship.
