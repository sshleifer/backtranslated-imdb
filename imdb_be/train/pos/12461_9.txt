Clever script from the end SEBASTIAN Zhaprizo and smart performance of the two male leads - Alain Delon and Charles Bronson (or should it be the other way around) leads to interesting and entertaining thriller <br /> <br /> Add. above the competent direction of veteran JEAN Herman and rare but effective account of Fran√ßois DE ROUBAIX, it becomes easy to why this film has an odd timeless quality. <br /> <br /> This is a friend of a friend or a bonding story with two singles, both disappointed and tired of the world, returning, presumably from Algeria. Like other colonial powers of that time (after the Second World War, which led to 60 years), France has struggled to keep up appearances abroad. Loss of Algeria was a cruel blow. <br /> <br /> Farewell L'AMI (original title) chronicles the actions of our two (anti) heroes as they fight to be a success, after their discharge. <, Br /> <br /> One thing happening after the other, and the audience really needs to pay attention, because Zhaprizo lean and cost of its script, if it is, then there must be a reason <br /> <br /. > Suffice it to say that these two men are fighting, physically and psychologically, one long weekend. Their motivation is quite different, their goals are different - their survival is completely dependent on each other. It Alain Delon and Charles Bronson looks so different - the former may have a pretty boy, and the other ugly thug, adds to the chemistry <br /> <br /> This makes the search for a great story, which, in turn. Makes a great film <br /> <br /> not to forget there are women in this film, and true method Zhaprizo, they are also memorable, though not concretised. . To say more would spoil the pleasure in discovering their true nature <br /> <br /> Goodbye, my friend was released in the UK; Anamorphic images, 16,9 ENHANCED; English only (even subtitles for the hearing impaired); Duration 110 minutes; MONO SOUNDTRACK but music DE ROUBAIX has a lot of punch! <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended.
