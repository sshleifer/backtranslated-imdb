Surprisingly quirky film with enough twists to pretzel bag. Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother, which may or may not be what it seems. The story is very ironic, and dialogue skillfully understated. Notes of humor and intrigue, none of which has to overcome the characteristic Posey pulls so well. The supporting cast is stellar. The disadvantage? This movie requires your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the film and notes. Posey has more sex appeal in her eyebrows lifting than most actresses all over his body. It is worth your time, even if you do not understand the ending.
