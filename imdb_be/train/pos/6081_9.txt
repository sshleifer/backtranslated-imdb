You do not get darker and more tragic than "Othello" and this film captures the game is pretty good, with excellent performances by Laurence Fishburne, and Irene Jacob. Fishburne's Othello expresses torment the audience, he becomes a victim of his lie very convincingly, even providing a realistic epileptic episode. Yakov loving and loyal wife who becomes a tool of his revenge against Othello, or the object of his anger (not clear what, since no motive behavior of its proposed). Although Kenneth Branagh (sp?) Shows his usual talent of Shakespeare in this film, it is somewhat marginal. Characters box office and Emilia also wander in and out of scenes, even if they like Iago, seem more important to the plot. I have not checked the film against the game to see how many lines have been cut, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop their character, even seemingly insignificant ones, very good. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticism it would be the film that the story unfolds too quickly, and that the relationship between some of the characters do not spread more. The director was a big shot, and no one offered to poor performance. The relationship between the ticket office and Othello, and that between Emilia and Desdemona need to further develop earlier in the film. I have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the film suggests, but you get the feeling it's too late in the movie. In addition, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their Nadra convincing amount of interaction they have with each other gives the impression that they have just met. On the other hand, maybe even just to meet --- like Romeo and Juliet <br /> <br /> In short .. a good show, too short <br /> <br />
