This is a film in the middle period Antonioni, that most critics dismiss quickly as "shortcomings" look at 60 years of American youth culture / politics. For what it's worth, I found it more touching and memorable than his more famous films like L'Avventura, perhaps because it shows more emotion & empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as a basis for brilliant observations Antonioni in this area and criticism on the American consumer culture, college life, counterculture, and the whole anti-establishment, anti-war play, which was so prominent at that time. <br /> <br /> Even from a purely technical point of view, it is perfectly processed film; from the opening credits sequence in a bizarre desert "black cumin" using billboards, and until this stunning result, laxative ending used cameras 17 installed windows (in its own way as powerful as culminating with Wild Bunch). In addition, Antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful ever to decorate the screen. There is not much "acting out" is involved, as it is more like a docu-drama, and therefore the use of non-professionals as the leading pair is working quite effectively in this context. And the soundtrack is not only filled with great music, its use is impressive as well (I can not forget about the beginning of the film, mainly due to the choice of music - Pink Floyd - that grooms visual as well). <, Br /> <br /> Contrary to popular belief, it is a great achievement in the movie, and one I enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for withdrawal stroke. Well worth looking for, and one of the key films of 60-ies, which requires a DVD restoration / release.
