In the first scene, eye patch wearing a daredevil named Hawkeye has a smooth forehead, but when he goes to Johnny in Pueblo, he showed the scar over his eye patch. This is just one of the many gaps in the continuity of this sharp "spaghetti" western, rather than detract from the picture, it gives a special flavor to the proceedings. <br /> <br /> The other occurs when Sanchez converted his three dead bodies, they should be checked for their identity - "You just can not imagine how many false corpses we have in our city." Immediately thereafter, Carradine (Lawrence Dobkin) shows up to collect his generosity of not more than wanted poster in his hand. <br /> <br /> As for the main movie Johnny Yuma (Mark Damon), he showed his holster alternatively on the right thigh and lion throughout the film after replacing gun belts with Carradine bars after a fight. Johnny heads to San-Margo at the request of his uncle, but will have to avenge his death by the hands of a false wife Samantha (Rosalba Neri) and her treacherous brother Pedro (Louis Vanner). It takes a while to get there, but it's fun to ride with one of the best musical scores on record. With regard to this interior fight, I got hit with a kung fu sound effects every time you hit connected. <br /> <br /> Care for some more plot exaggeration? After the duel with Pedro for the first time, Johnny wipes a small amount of blood from his mouth, which he manages to smear his face with Pedro. Similarly, when Pedro Pepe smacks around a bit later in the film, he does not cut it, but by the time Johnny comes Pepa's face covered with blood. <br /> <br /> «Johnny Yuma" is probably one of the best of the genre, which does not have Clint Eastwood in it. Johnny, Mark Damon is quite suitable to stand without boiling appearance. Carradine appeared, replacing the binding nature of Lee Van Cleef, not being generally a bad guy. First, the exchange of identity between Carradine and Johnny, it seems, does not make sense, but all connected in time with one another movie ended. Did you know that every handyman will wind up getting it on the merits; time for each marking was part of the expectations. <br /> <br /> In case you're wondering, the title character has nothing to do with the character Nick Adams from the classic TV Western «The Rebel». In this film Johnny got its name from the gunfight he had in Yuma once. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most unique element of the stories had to do with how it is linked with a wicked thing Samantha, who pulled strings behind the scenes in all. After shooting Carradine it beats a hasty retreat before Johnny can get his revenge. Still alive, it seems Carradine tries to shoot her and misses, but it does not take much time, Johnny Sanchez and to keep track of it in the desert, where she died without water - Carradine aimed at its buffet.
