So much has been written about the plot of the film, played by the wonderful acting, script, melancholy, bitter atmosphere, excellent direction - what can I add? Just watch out for one of the most heart warming, acting fine, piercing scenes ever filmed. It's Christmas Eve, and the character of Frank Morgan (the shop owner - Mr. Matuschek) is recovering from a broken marriage and suicide attempts. Since each of its employees to leave, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each and every one of them politely to turn it down. They all have their own plans for Christmas Eve. At this stage, there is a deep sadness this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career, and this scene is easily brings me to tears. Fortunately, we have a happy ending to this very special stage. New employee, an errand boy, is the last to leave the store in the beautiful snowy street scene. Desperately Mr. Matuschek approach to the boy and asked him how he wanted to spend the evening with him, he will treat it all the beautiful Christmas food that the errand boy, probably never seen! The guy is overloaded, it is also, obviously, how lonely, how Mr. Matuschek and together they can have a great Christmas meal. Every time I see that scene, he moves me. If you can get a great look at the DVD large trailer with Frank Morgan, introducing himself as Mr. Matuschek and appearance by the film director Ernst Lubitsch talented. This film is a joy from start to finish.
