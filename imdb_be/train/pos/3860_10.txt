In the Netherlands, a gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbé) lecturing. He stays the night with a beautiful woman by Christine (Renee Sautendizhk) and has sex with her (imagining that it is a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but gets a look at the picture hunky boyfriend of Christine Herman (Thom Hoffman), and decides to stay to try it. Then things get weird. <br /> <br /> Great pornographic art house hit in the US in 1983. Why is the X rating? Let's see ... there is strangulation, full frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, the scene in the church with a cross that will shock most people, gay sex scene in the basement ... and it's all comedy !!! !! Paul Verhoeven made it after «Spetters». «Spetters» was attacked by critics for this ultra sexy sequence and condemned as trash. Thus, the Supreme filled the film with a very obvious symbolism thinking critics will think that it is an art, and to praise it. He was right! Critics like the movie not knowing what Verhoeven plays a big joke to them. Nevertheless, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is a beautifully filmed Jan de Bont (now the director himself), and there is so much symbolism and explicit "hidden" layers in the dialogue, you will never get bored. All actions are great - Crabbe plays thoroughly despicable character, but (somehow) have you rooting for him; Soutendijk simply stunning to look at and has a role in perfection - a little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with it is frightening; Hoffman is very beautiful with a great body - he deserves credit for the sequence of the church and go on with Krabbe in the basement <br /> <br /> This is not for those easily offended or faint of heart, but if. Do you like extreme films that playfully challenge you (like me), this is for you! 10 all the way.
