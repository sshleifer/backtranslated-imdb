This funny Bugs Bunny cartoon to see a return still nameless Marvin the Martian and his inseparable green K-9 dog. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of trying to destroy Marvin Earth on a mission on the ground to take over Earth creature and take it back to Mars. Of course, being, he takes it Bugs Bunny. First Bugs thinks Marvin and K-9 trick or treating, but realizes that it can not be right when Marvin dramatically increases the rabbit hole bug with ray-gun. Error trying to cheat their way out of the situation in several ways, including Marvin convince that the K-9 is planning a rebellion. In the end, he is captured by using Acme straitjacket pushing bazooka. Surprisingly, for the Acme product, it works as advertised, and the beetle have to use your mind to get the K-9, to release it soon became irritated and two were tied up and Bugs Martians trying to fly their saucer back to Earth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it, although the ending is a bit weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice changed a little bit here, and it becomes visible emotional when he gets angry, but that does not make me like him or the movie less.
