I just want to add my two cents worth, and forgive me if I repeat what I have already answered, but I feel that it is necessary to remind people about everlovin 'genius of Damon Runyon. Without great outdoors, fun work Damon Runyon this film would not have ever done - nor most of the other great classics that deal with the players and the like to the 1960 Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man, and he was from Colorado, but he is confident that I made _get_ street scene of the East coast. If you are not a dedicated fan of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend a few clicks of the other works of Damon Runyon in; «Lemondrop Kid» and «Little Miss Marker," as a function of Bob Hope, who, apart from his policy has always been funny man. (As a liberal west coast, I believe his policies is quite funny, too!) Damon Runyon lives! !!!
