Those who are not familiar with the alter ego Cassandra Peterson Elvira, this is a good place to start. <br /> <br /> Â«Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" begins with our heroine with gravity ignore boobs who receive the message. It seems that most of her aunt died, and that she must be present at the reading of the will. In an effort to raise money for the show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go in hoping to get lots and lots of money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the place where it needs to go to the city Fallwell, Massachusetts. Having to stay a spell over her car breaking down, she learns that her grandmother left 3 things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. Residents have mixed reactions: teens like her, women hate her, and people desire (While trying to remain moral foundations of society). Her biggest problem is her great-grandfather Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard), because he wants to be a cookbook. It seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that make it more powerful sorcerer. <br /> <br /> The film is actually very funny, with Peterson aka Elvira, using her "talent" and sexuality as a joke ( "And do not forget that tomorrow we will show a head with two things ... I am sort of thing, with two heads "). Especially funny as Makklorg like Chastity Pariah, woman that her most difficult to work to keep the city lines, but ends up being incongruous (picnic scenes is an excellent example). It deserves a look (the film, not her boobs, of course).
