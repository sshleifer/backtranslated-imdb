New York, I Love You a collective work of eleven short films, each segment runs about 10 minutes long. Shorts not really related, but they all have one thing in common, the love. Each short about finding love, or, in the case of a pair or just two strangers chitchatting.The movie stars an ensemble cast, including Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson, and Anton Yelchin. With such a star cast and an interesting premise, I expected a great movie; the problem of New York, I Love You is not. There remains the sum of its parts. Some of the segments funny, original and interesting, but others are so meaningless (Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q segments), it's terrible. The film, of course, has a very uneven and pilot tones. History-wise, it is similar to several students, the film could put together. Having said that the film has a lot of things, and one of the best being a segment about an old couple, played by El Wall and Leachman, walking along in Brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. And it's those moments that made me, as a spectator, the desire movie was more consistent, because there is a lot of potential here. But as poor as the overall story ends with the fact that, for me, the cinematography and the soundtrack kept all things. Editing was perfect, as the film was shot was very impressive and ethereal soundtrack, can not be more appropriate. In the end, New York, I Love You feel like an experimental film, as in the majority of experiments have highs and lows. This is how one looks at the film as a whole, which will determine if he likes or not. This can be useful for some, and a waste of time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
