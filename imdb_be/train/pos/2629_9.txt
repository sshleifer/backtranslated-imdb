I was not sure, when I heard about it coming out. I thought how dumb Disney gets. I was wrong. I found it to be very good. I mean, it's not The Lion King, but it was cool to see the other side of a point. It was very funny. In addition, he was not one of those banal sequels were Disney animation sucks, it was the same as The Lion King animation. The only thing that I had a whole eritated cinema that in the movie. Do not give anything wrong, but you'll know what I'm saying. I, too, have fun, it was great to have a large part of the original cast to return. It was a very good movie at all.
