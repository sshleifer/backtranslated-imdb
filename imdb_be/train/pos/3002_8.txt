"Kennel Murder CaseÂ» begins on the go and does not stop until the end. All the reasons to kill the victim, and several people have tried. William Powell is terrific as Philo Vance, the gentleman detective. Mary Astor as a refreshing offended niece, who only wants to marry his Scottish gentleman and enjoy its heritage. This film is available in a pair with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you need to remove the disc (or check it out from your local library), do it. It is pure entertainment!
