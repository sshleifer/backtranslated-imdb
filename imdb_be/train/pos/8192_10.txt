This two-parter was excellent - the best since the series returned. Sure beats stories were squeezed from the previous films, but what TV shows do not do that these days. What we got here was a cracking good sci-fi story. Great great (very scary) monster in prison on the basis of a deep well, some excellent aliens in Ood - the best "new" aliens revived series comes up with a set of mostly sympathetic and believable human characters (complete with some unnamed "consumables" the safety of people in this Star Trek fashion), some of the major philosophical themes (love, devotion, faith, etc.), and some of the top drawer of special effects. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
