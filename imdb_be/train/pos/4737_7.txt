Hak hap (Black Mask) is what I like to call the ballet with his fists and explosions. Of course, the plot has been tested and heard (biologically engineered soldier who is part of an elite fighting force of supermen who decides that he feels that murder and brute force are not ways to solve every thing and becomes a pacifist and a librarian. but when he learns that all his group is trying to get the antidote that will keep them alive, taking on the police is its best friend becomes COP-black mask.) style, the film goes on, very visual, works at as it is interesting to me. I love martial arts movies, which are spectical. People fly lighter than air and recovering the fraction of a second after a pin holding action tempo and non-stop. But that's what this film is about any order, Showcases Jet Li does what he does best, and that is an impressive sight of his skills, which, to put it mildly, at the highest level. Like most fast-action martial arts movie ala. Jackie Chan and Hung summit, which is only now showing themselves here in the States for the first time, these films are little plot and high on the amazing physical feats. But I must say that even large holes left in the area (for example, as we see it in a safe in his apartment, when only one scene, before he was 20 people, which are no more than 15 feet away from salvation sign? Who knows the scene just cut it in the apartment ....... ohh well suspension of belief, I think), the film remains interesting to me. It is not only the last 20 minutes, the film seems to feel that it might be a little shorter. But until now, all around a great big paced thriller.
