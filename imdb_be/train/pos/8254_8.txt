Set in a middle class neighborhood in an imaginary town of Willard in 1950, this dark comedy with a light touch toys with American obsessions like a gun mania and violence, materialism, and keep up with the Jones, the fear of other people, slavery, golf, and disposal of the dead. Yes, it all sounds a little difficult, but trust me on this, almost as light as a feather. <br /> <br /> Zombie occupies a prominent place among the characters. Crucial questions arise, such as: who will be the zombie (90% Willard people choose the latter path, while only 10% prefer the traditional funeral)? Who owns how many zombies to make their orders like robots (they have become a symbol of social status)? And that the range of possible relationships that can be developed between the living and a kind of reincarnation of the dead? <br /> <br /> Anyway, directed by Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the script live (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), retains this incredible stuff percolating together for one and a half hours, never faltering for lack of good laughter. Super cast helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principles on the basis of young Kn Ray, both by those innocent child with a kind heart, which acts as a just witness all fainting from adults. (Seeing it only in "Memento" and "The Matrix", I had no idea that Mrs. Moss was such a wonderful comedic chops.) <br /> <br /> The design of the production and the music 50s gracefully to a tee , Perhaps, this is one not for everyone. It will certainly be difficult to beat my film annual award Bizarro. But smart comedy that remain funny from beginning to end are among the conquered achievements in film-making. For me anyway, «Fido» is a hoot! My assessment: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (Seen on 01/30/07)
