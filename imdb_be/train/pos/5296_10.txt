Absolutely hilarious. John Waters' tribute to the people he loves most (Baltimoreans) is a twisted little ditty with plenty to see and laugh. It turned out freely in the museum of kitsch! I have not laughed so much in the theater as Serial Mom. I loved seeing old friends since the Dreamland, Nisep Sharon and Susan Lowe, back in front of the camera Waters. The cast is just fine (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). It uses the best elements of past crimes Waters (especially undervalued polyester) and many new surprises. It made me sick, miraculously. Thank you, John!
