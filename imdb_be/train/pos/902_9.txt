I thought this movie was really great because, in India cinemas now, all that you see the skin, music and a bad game ... in this film, you can see some of the traditions, ethnicity, and at least some decency ... although some parts were a little dramatic, I guess what? is that all Indian cinema! After watching this film, at least you will not get a headache from all high-profile musicians inflated, or any violence, it is only the truth, it teaches about love, and, of course, care about the person you love for a lifetime .. . I think it was a strange movie ... Children can watch it, without a doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that is used to verify the depth of India ... until all these hits rap, miniskirts and leather show It became part of it.
