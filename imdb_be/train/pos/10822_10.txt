I was lucky enough to see this film many years ago in England. I have seen hundreds of films since then, but I will never forget this one.Although Sinatra did not play a very endearing character, he was very rich in role.A many people seem to think that he did'nt really come into its own, while his role in Â«From Here to Eternity", but in my opinion, he was great in Concho.The another role that sticks out in my mind is the fact that William Conrad.I'd never seen or heard of him for this film. Conrad plays a tremendous role in this film.I remember your deep and harsh voice, and he uses it beautifully to increase a few words, he said the threat, which sets the tone for his character.Also I remember the music that introduces and Conrad and seems They surround him when he appears.An a great movie, and my only disappointment is that I never got a chance to see him again. It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. I see in the credits, he says that the film is in black and white, but when I saw that it was indeed in full color, I remember a blue shirt Sinatra.
