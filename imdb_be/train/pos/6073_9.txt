My college professor said that Othello may be the best drama of Shakespeare. I do not know if I agree with him. I bought this video version of the film. Firstly, I love Kenneth Branagh as Iago, he was quite complicated and has worked very well in this adaptation. Surprisingly, he did not send it, but played a role. Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare, as well as British actors can do. not that there was a British against the American question about it. In fact, when we all work together, we can reach a weight of Shakespeare, he deserves to do. As well as other tragedies of Shakespeare, it addresses the issue of race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between him and Emily would be better and showed the complexity of their associations together. While Othello Desdemona loves with all his heart, he is weak for jealousy and fear of losing her no-Mauritanian people as the box office. It's a pretty big scene at the end of the movie, but I will not reveal the ending. It's just worth watching. I think they edited a lot of lines to 2 hours, but they always edit Shakespeare.
