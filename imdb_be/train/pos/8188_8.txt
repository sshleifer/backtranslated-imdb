I thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two parter, The Impossible Planet, and was a little concerned that the second part will not hold up quite as good as has been true in the past two parters last 2 Who series. But fortunately my fears were in vain, as I discovered, enjoying the episode as much as the previous one. In any case, we start with the surviving members of the crew on the run from the Ood, which have become a pawn of the devil. There is also a bit of philosophizing on the part of the doctor in the episode, which I greatly enjoyed. Needless to say, it was a good solid Doctor Who story. . Maybe a little too intense for younger viewers, though <br /> <br /> My rating: B +
