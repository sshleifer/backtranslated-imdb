Bar some questionable actions (where the musicians at the end of the day), then in the words of Quentin Tarrinno is the "best rock movie ever made ... periodÂ» <br /> <br /> Think of 8 Mile, but without tapping - young musician, trying to prove that he is up to the local community, while with all the power to deal with a broken home and a rival group. Throw in a sex interest and truly exceptional performance, this is a real 8 miles. <br /> <br /> The Prince delivers high performance, as does the day Maurice and Jerome Benton. A decent script, good direction, good story and exciting performances. Not forgetting some of the best rock / pop / funk music you'll ever hear.
