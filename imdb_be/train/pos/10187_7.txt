Well, I'll be honest: It's not quite Sholay. But you can not get Sholay each week. In fact, you could see a different signature "Not without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this film. However, like most of the "inspired" movies go, this one was well inspired one, well handled and well done. Nana Patekar as usually tend to overdo it a tantrum, but everyone else is commendable. Especially because of Dipti Naval: I saw her after a long time, but it has not lost any of her affection. In fact, she has performed much better than when I last saw her. Another of the Bollywood stars who seem to be getting more and more beautiful as they age? <br /> <br /> In general, a good watch.
