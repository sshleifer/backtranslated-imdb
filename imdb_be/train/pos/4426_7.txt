I'm glad I saw this film, seeing some of the other director's films in the past. I thought the production was great value as the costumes and setting the bridge. It was interesting to see how the concept of the spirit and the demons have been processed. <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the other comments about the fighting scenes. They were hard to follow at times. <br /> <br /> In the final analysis, a moral story. It would be interesting to know that some Japanese viewers thought of the film. This is a movie that I wanted to see again. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes, such as those where Benkai and Prince fought in the "psychic" level were well done. <br /> <br /> I came out of the cinema thinking, what just happened here. Intensive.
