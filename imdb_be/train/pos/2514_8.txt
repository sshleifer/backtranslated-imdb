8 I voted for this film because of some minor flaws children. In addition, this film is one of my favorites! It's interesting, to say the least. filming scenes funny, though, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes a little too much of his "Matrix obsession" with him. It seems that their enemies are just worth it ... wait to get shot at. However, this film is touching, and it always makes me cry. It has a lot of great humor in it, it makes me laugh as well. Gackt is an excellent actor, I have to say..he he shows much emotion. It was Hyde's first time acting, and he did well. The role suits him. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely gorgeous. The entire cast is what I would say, is perfect for this film. Do not miss it! Sorry!
