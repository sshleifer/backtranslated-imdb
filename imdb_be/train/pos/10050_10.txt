Dad Daniel Steele, than a refreshing story. This film glorified the importance of family and the importance of parents in their children's lives. How rare is that? In these times, "Veras has two moms" (or something, you fill in the blanks), it is easy to see why this topic is not for everyone. With his father being a prominent role, I was hoping it would be one more Danielle Steel Saga. How disappointing to end it. Each character is important and did an incredible job, which has a role. I would love to see every character developed over many years. I loved this movie, this is one I will defiantly look every time it is. Good story, good acting, and I hope that this is not a spoiler, but not intrusive sex or profanity. Yes, it touched my heart. Warning, Kleenex to get ready. What I find sad is that this side of family life rarely seen today in our amusements, whether TV or. Film. Daniel, when your hear, You Go Girl, give us more.
