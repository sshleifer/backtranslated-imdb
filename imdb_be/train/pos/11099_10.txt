Chase has created a true phenomenon with Soprano. Unfaltering performance, immutable letters, and some great music make up what was quite possibly the best show ever. <br /> <br /> All the cast strong, but Falco and Gandolfini earned every inch of the Emme. Anyone who doubts this need only try a few episodes; in particular, from the first season. James Gandolfini absolutely rigid, absolutely horrible, and you still find yourself in love with him. - mesmerized him <br /> <br /> Many of the people I was talking about The Sopranos (who have not seen it yet) will say: "I'm just not a fan of mafia movies / shows." Anything. Run - do not walk - and get it. The same people tend to love «E.R.», but I'm sure they do not much care for hospitals ... It's not about the context.
