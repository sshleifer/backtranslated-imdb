Midnight Cowboy made a lot of noise when it was released in 1969 by assessing X. By today's standards, it would be difficult to draw the rating of R. Jon Voight, who was better qualified in his role as Joe Buck, a city of Loch He wants to make it big with homes in New York. He meets a seedy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo, who is trying to make friends Buck for their own purposes. The two eventually form a relationship that is both touching and pathetic. As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman was often brilliant, but no more than this figure. He's so into the character that everyone else around him pales in comparison. Losing an Academy Award, John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlesinger has deftly hand with its production, but this film has a gritty underbelly, which leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. It is worth to look at just the performance of Hoffman.
