I believe that I got this film when I was a young buck. I remember watching it as a kid, but I could never find a movie. I remember the good old Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, Greedy King Koo Koo. I searched high and low for this film and still no luck. But one day, when I walked out of my childhood home, I found him. We met. I'm 17 years old now. I'm still looking. All the while, actually. This is one of the most funny and touching films I've ever seen, and enjoyed at the same time. And personally I think they should make a sequel. Mmm, yes sequel actually. Now I'm even considering getting captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body!
