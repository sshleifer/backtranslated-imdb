Ogre is a film made for television in Italy and was not intended to be a continuation of the Demons as Lambert Bova even mentions his interview on Sheirk Show DVD, but it was named Demons III, to be part of a series of demons. Music in Demons and Devils 2 was 80-rock music, and it is more terrible music, and while the first two were bloody horror Demons III: Ogre is an architectural horror, so that, as the Demons III is not properly continuation of the Demons, but I still like this movie. <br /> <br /> music is awful, and adds that the tone of the castle, the film is set, The Ogre is one more thing why I like this film. There are two other films, which are classified as Demons III and Black Demons (Demoni 3) and the Church (Demons 3). Demons III: Ogre good movie as long as you do not compare it with demons and demons 2.
