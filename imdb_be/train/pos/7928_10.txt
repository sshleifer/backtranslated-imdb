Let's get some things straight first: Zombies do not exist, so the director can have them walk, run, hell even FLY, if he wants to. This is what makes this original zombie movie so well. All they were doing was so damn original. I hate it when filmmakers do everything as Romero or when the fan boys are waiting for all as Romero. Some idiots think zombies should growl just like a typical Romero film, once the zombies do not exist, so the director can make a zombie ~ d whistle whenever he wants. Zombies all looks very good in this film, but obviously they do not decompose corpses, as they just freaking died! They are pretty messed up, though full of split face and blood. One of the coolest scenes was half eaten by a cat. It looked so damn real My daughter cried when she saw him. This film has received very good reviews at Fangoria and Rue Morgue, so I wanted to go see. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to the taste of the horror fan in. 10 out of 10! Go rent it!
