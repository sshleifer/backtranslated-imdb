This is one of the best classic movies from the German Edgar Wallace series - it has every reason to be very pleasant Wallace Flick crime film way back from the '60s: In spite of the fact that His Majesty, Mr. Kinsky, no, you're still young Joachim Â«Blacky" Fuchsberger, she appeared again as a typical smart American "womanizer", you have a young Eddi Arendt at her best (and just typical) role in history - a cool, elegant British butler - and you have a (not so young ) Lovits both melancholic but very "dry" ironic (and such way:. very interesting) police investigator In addition, you get offered a quirky and very campy "evil man" behind the mask of a frog (hence the title of the film), you get mad-rocking soundtrack, classic action scenes b-movie partly filmed with exceptions! most daring perspectives (! remind the time of its origin), yell scream queen, and so on ... All these ingredients get well shaken sweet tastin 'cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace campyness - highly recommended !!
