Well, I can only say that watched this fantastic film, when my nerves are still ringing! Jacques Audiard director should make a name for himself in France, and rightly so. Vince Cassel NO Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos Sun Penelope Cruz anything but these two fantastic actors, and it is tight and compelling thriller that starts off slow, with some reasonable character of the building, and then begins to put pressure on the tension other than menopause. Others have written about the subject, so I will not say more than anything in this film plays the role perfectly, director, actors, up to the operator, and everything seems so real, not stupid gun play, battle if it is so credible , expression, emotion, it's almost like you're there as a spectator. Do yourself a favor, get a DVD, a bottle of wine, turn the lights low, take the phone with a hook and a dip in the Hitchcock thriller :)
