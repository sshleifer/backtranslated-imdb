The concept of a great movie, exploring the tensions that arise in family life in an idyllic island off the coast of Galiano British Columbia, _The Lotus Eaters_ clouded by the fact that it has been packaged as a film made for television, decrease itself in all ways of adding fun music over potentially strong scenes, as if to prepare for the interruption advertising. A pity, really.
