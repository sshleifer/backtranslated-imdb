24, to be the best spy / adventure series ever aired. The whole idea is to tell a story in a 24-hour period of real time dazzles. Style shootings and stimulation is what hooks us to watch it. And Jack Bauer is one of the greatest heroes in the series for a long time. I appreciate it, along with The Simpsons and The X-Files, my three most favorite serials. <br /> <br /> This is the first episode begins with conspiracy to murder US Senator David Palmer, who also works for the presidency. Bauer called to his office to find out who is behind all this and, at the same time, to find out the way to his daughter unkwown after escaping from her bedroom. Thus begins the adventure of a better political style, and it's better that it always takes place in real time, which makes the TV show the real work of originality at a time when almost all of the TV programs, appears to show us the same things again and again and again.
