I saw «Fever Pitch» such as accidentally; he played on the plane going to Europe. It really was not bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the world's # 1 Red Sox fan, but his relationship with Lindsay mix (Drew Barrymore) can strain that. The film is an interesting look at how world events might affect peoples' relationships. This is particularly instructive now that the Red Sox ended their 80-odd-year losing streak. I think this kind of thing happen all the time, and we just do not tend to notice them. Not so bad. <br /> <br /> Another film portraying unusual attitude towards baseball 2000s "Frequency". Check them both to.
