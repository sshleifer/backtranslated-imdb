In order to evaluate this film enough, you have to think about the genre it should be: children. They had more guidelines to follow to make this film (which means that he can not get away with some of the humor or language from the 1st), taking everything that was fun and nice to look at in this film. For usually it makes me nervous, but this one has done very well for himself. Knowing that he has star power, George Frazier, they capitalized on humor and I think, Showeman did very well as a master. The plot is located is easy to follow, and perhaps sometimes mannered well-suited for a younger audience, if you want to watch a movie and hope for the Academy Award-winning is not, but if you want to see is simple, fun, energy filled movie you'd make a good choice with this.
