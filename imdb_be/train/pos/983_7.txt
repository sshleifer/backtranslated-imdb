I think that this film has a lot to recommend it, in particular, is particularly ominous appearance of David Morse and more on-road performance is always worth watching, Mr. Fox. Although there are many holes in the story and motivation is very, very difficult to adhere to, in some cases, in the end, it makes for an enjoyable time in front of the tube.
