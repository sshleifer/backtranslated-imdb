If Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) stands precariously on the edge of a balcony high above the city, apparently under hypnosis, and only step to his death, he was immediately reminded me of an almost identical scene in another movie made nine years later, "the woman in the green" in which Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone), it's just going to throw myself into space, being under hypnosis. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, as Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes through these unscrupulous criminals attempted murder. the fascinating cinematic suspense in both these scenes. If they know can not overshadow the minds of the great fictional detective?
