Amazing performance from Simon Pegg, who just gets better and better with each role. As usual, he plays the role of a very cringy character that makes you want to hide behind your pillow in the awkwardness of his times, but that is all Pegg. <br /> <br /> laughter was a regular and eyes of fuel and each of them aimed at Penn. The film was very reasonably put together, where each character has a very complex and important role with Penn as the only participation of humor which is a huge credit to director Robert Weide. <br /> <br /> And I can not let it go without a quick round of applause to Gilliam Anderson, who shone throughout. Highly I recommend to all.
