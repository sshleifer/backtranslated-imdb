This Hong Kong removed trash bags more melodrama than a week's worth of «The Young & The Restless». It is one of more than a return to the original trilogy of "Emmanuel" (especially "Goodbye Emmanuelle") than sleazefest D'Amato. Lee Chai (Emy Wong) is undergoing tremendous change from the harsh nurse to hot to trot-Streetwalker. Being an Italian porn star / politician, Illona Staller, who would later go by the name of Ciccolina (and has sex with an HIV-positive John Holmes) plays EMY competition. Exotic locales and some decent soft single-core scene this round. Recommended for fans of the original "Emmanuel", with which I am one!
