I thought that the children in the show did a very good job. I especially liked the performance of the character Emma. Well done! The stunts were pretty good for the budget shows a low. I was able to follow the movie and enjoy it, even though the clock every 5 minutes.I enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and burning it. Ghost opening baby shower available as well. Another good point of the film is the fact that he continued to move forward. There has not been a lot of slow scenes. Adults also leads believable and thus helped keep the show interesting. Overall, a nice evening watching movies.
