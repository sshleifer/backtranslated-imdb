This film I loved since I was young! Its great. Although it may be too much for the average observer of the film, if it can not interpret some of the subtleties in the film (for example, the name of our hero is Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alexander, he shot in the heel with a rocket, the same as the Achilles heel shot) was killed in the mythology. It's just a little fact, that's kind of funny! Anyway, a great movie, a good story, it would be neat to see it remade with today's special effects! Ironically, Gary Graham had an average success, starring in the show-filler Alien Nation ship. This film is fun to watch and should be a higher score!
