Men of Honor stars Cuba Gooding Jr., as in real life Navy Diver Brashear, who defied the male fleet, to become the first African-American Navy Diver. Sometimes, on his side, and sometimes his opponent was one person who really admired Brashear. His name was Sergeant Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro). Sunday, in many ways were pushing to get worse and helped Carl to become the man he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this film. His portrayal is both liberated and powerful, like Denzel Washington in a hurricane. Through each stage, we can see his passion, motivation and persistence in achieving their dreams. We can see the struggle within him when he goes to his father proud. I also loved how the director has created and brought a lot of tension in some key scenes diving. Brashear meeting with the submarine during a rescue mission and shiny heart-stopping. <br /> <br /> The only drawback that I could see would be in the support cast. Cuba and Deniro characters are very complex and interesting to watch. What makes you a little bit sad when they are butting heads with such two-dimensional supporting characters. Wicked Lieutenant Commander. Hanks, his wife on Sunday (Charlize Theron), the eccentric Colonel diving school (Hal Holbrook) and love interest of Cuba are symbols that I found to have a very great depth. What could make these characters more substantial and more effective was a little more time to develop them. Why is it always the colonel in his tower? As the wife on Sunday was so bitter and always drunk? <br /> <br /> Another interesting question should be that way. What happened to the wedding in Brashear? I mean, when this film chronicles the life of this man of his wedding will not be a major event? Maybe it's just me. Men Honor, however, is an excellent example of celebration and belief that envelops the human mind. This movie will inspire and make you feel the struggle of this man. What I think was the cause of this powerful story was told. My hat goes off to you Brashear. I really admire your strength. <br /> <br />
