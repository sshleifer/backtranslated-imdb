I was reminded of this as one of my favorite books as a child, and had long wanted to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now. I knew that the movie is coming out soon, so we went to the library to get a book, and they gave us a preview of the pass the next day! We rushed home and spent the day reading a book, so that we can compare. It was not necessary. The only thing in common between the book and the film is the first name of the main characters, the fact that there is a bet, and a whole lot of chervyachnoga food. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, a child who prepares most of the worms love to present their masterpieces with a French accent. As children know each other, the number of children involved, the bet is held, the number of worms that should be eaten, the time frame in which it should have a worm as they are prepared, the progression of the friendship, the climax of the scene, etc., nothing not the same thing. But anyway, it will not ruin the movie for me. The characters are all nice, and the film did not leave me disappointed. A word of caution for parents was a moment when it was possible to hear adults collectively draw your breath in the room, and it was when younger brother, Billy called his penis as "Dilli member." The unpleasant part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us, "Does anyone know what this moronic dick?" Lol. This casual "shut up" as foul mouthed as the film gets. My daughter thought she might get sick around the worm 3 and 4 (and holds an empty container Nacho just in case), but it was great worm 6. She and I both liked the movie and there was an exchange of experience is an excellent time.
