Thus, the cells were in the right place at the right time. It's so interesting to see how the world leader (Chavez), which supports poor people in the country, can be held in such low esteem in the United States. His worst "sin", in my opinion, is to take care of those who are at the bottom of the barrel. What could be so bad that? I've always been fascinated by the US Government + Media reaction to Fidel Castro. First, Castro was a good guy (around 1959), when he ousted Batista. Soon, however, Castro began to turn the corporation in Cuba to the poor instead of fat cats. We have a decent country, but why are our media and government have a problem with sharing with the poor? If these guys are "dictators", we could use a "dictatorship", especially the poorest of the poor live in the world.
