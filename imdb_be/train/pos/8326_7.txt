While Skepisi in "IQ" does not really have any important qualities, it's still worth a look. Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help the mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with mathematics at Princeton doctoral student Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) trying to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up as a French impressionist <br /> <br /> Obviously, that is not enough. film historically accurate, but it is not important. It is not intended as anything other than a light comedy, quite the opposite of the famous film from 1994 Robbins (The Shawshank Redemption). The film is about the whole of Einstein's life to focus not only on its scientific achievements, but also his political activities, namely, he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and opposed nuclear weapons (it got to the point where the FBI kept a file on him). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this one is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Shalhoub, Frank Weil, Durning and Keene Curtis.
