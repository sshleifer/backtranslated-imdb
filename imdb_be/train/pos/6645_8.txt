Ultra-modern house in an affluent area, seems to be the reason for each of its population (and deadly) behavior. Or, at least, is what maintains the character of Larry Flynn Boyle, the Col Kennedy. After a series of deaths in a giant house next door, Col knows something has to give. Gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect <br /> <br /> My opinion :. The house next door works because Lara Flynn Boyle and localizations (beautiful home) and stylish sets. Boyle talented and dynamic actress, not to mention the absolutely stunning. It brings confidence in her character and makes the film intriguing. Without it, it would not work. "It is so alive," announces a potential buyer in respect of the house. Yes, he is alive. But the story is not so much. <br /> <br /> If we exclude the presence of Boyle's not so much what's going on here, because a huge amount of the film is spent watching or wait to see how the house will affect its current owners. predictable results. But I still liked it. The cinematography gives the movie a polished look. 8/10 on account of Boyle, the premise of evil ultra-modern home, in locations and cinematography, as well as set decoration and wardrobe.
