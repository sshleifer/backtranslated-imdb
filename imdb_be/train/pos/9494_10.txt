White light was recommended to me the guy who owns it into two separate releases of DVD and VHS. He argued that it is one of the funniest and coolest low-budget actioners ever made. I do not watch a movie, knowing that they are going to be bad, but I made an exception for this ... and I was very glad that I did. <br /> <br /> It's filled to the brim with action (a large part of his amazing graphic bloody) sleaze (isolated on nakedness with the key female character, but there are so many, in one scene, she becomes oars) and po- brutally uncomfortable dialogue, all of which adds to the laughter- causing the tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Ginty, unusual looking star exterminator (and countless other low-budget action kakashek) interesting in the long run, which gives the best performance he could muster. Williamson better than usual, clearly hamming it up with unprecedented joy (and it does not come until the middle). The rest of the cast is also interesting to watch, especially the villains, one of which is a sadistic sexual Babenko, who speaks with an accent that seems to be a hodgepodge of Spain and Italy. It is priceless. <br /> <br /> Again, I can not stress how bloody it was. It is not so bloody that sick, but it is extremely hard to part with some meaty squib go to the shooting and has an exhausting sequence of torture, that no one would soon forget. Also, if Ginty is currently consulted a bunch of bad guys, he takes possession of a chainsaw and convenient spray points arising will have any and all actions of supporters cheering and spilling their beer. <br /> <br /> Don "t miss the white light. This reckless - when the mind numbingly stupid - classic.
