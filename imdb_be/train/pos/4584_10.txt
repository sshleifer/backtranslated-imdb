I have not seen every one of Chan's films, but this is probably the best I've seen so far, each. <br /> <br /> The history of it I have nothing much really, so I won 't go deeper into it. What makes it special stunts, fighting, good acting, a warm sense of humor. The film is obsessed with the pace all the way through, and you're just stunned by seeing it. All the cool tricks (of course, made by Jackie) makes you want to jump into the couch and screaming. Winked just amazing! Even my mom was surprised this cool movie, when she saw him. <br /> <br /> I know that the police story may be a little hard to grasp, at least here in Sweden. But I can assure you, wink is worth a try.
