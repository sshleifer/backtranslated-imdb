I was a fan of this movie for years and years. Because of Terry Excretory go to the fore, I had to take a movie with shelves and watch it. Why do people in 1991 did not see how wonderful this film was for me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are beyond fabulous. Although I never watch daytime soap operas, this movie kills me every time I watch it. There are unsurpassed for comedy and the writing of the reasonable. I highly recommend you watch it if you have not already. You can see Elisabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, and Carrie Fisher ... to name a few ... all give excellent performances.
