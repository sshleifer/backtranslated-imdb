Just watching this movie again in 1998, showing a VH-1, I just had to comment. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie on TV, it was about 1981, and I remember writing to his film from Betamax my mother. He wound the tape in black and white for some reason, which gave him time to see what I liked. <br /> <br /> I remember very clearly the film, starting with the song «My Bonnie», as the camera panned over the scene of Liverpool. I also remember the opening scene where Paul points to some girl and says: "See, the talent," So it was with great annoyance, that I appeared in my one thousand nine hundred ninety-eight braid version and "remembered" that the film begins with "! She Loves You », instead of« My Bonnie ». If you see how slowly Camera vs. the speed of the music, you can see that «She Loves You» just does not fit. In addition, this "later" version, when Paul sees the girls, he says: "Look, girl!" .. and somehow remembering the earlier version of that word just did not stick, either. Why do they believe that they had Americanized the film for the American audience for me. Personally, when I'm watching a movie about the British band, I want all British colloquial and such that it would be part of their speech, manners, etc. <br /> <br /> Another annoyance was as "jerks" was editing for television. Only after Stu beat, for example, the film cuts to a commercial break, LOTS of them. Yes, I know that it depends on the network, but it really destroys the effect of the film, so he sliced ​​from each other, as we all know. The fact that some people might find as insignificant in terms of dialogue (and, therefore, good for editing) can actually go through the interpretation of a particular action or scene forthcoming. <br /> <br /> I want to say, the "best" version of the film was probably an older version I taped since 1981, which just so happened to include «Shake, Rattle & Roll» scene that my version 1998 did not. I began to suspect that there had to be two different versions made for television, and look at "alternative version" link on this film proved me right. This American version was somewhat shorter / cut / different scenes and / or dialogue is a huge disappointment for me and something worth mentioning when one takes care of such things. Imo, those are best to try and grasp the European version of the film, if it is possible, and (perhaps even less, perhaps), the unedited version. Unfortunately, I had to abandon my old Betamax European version, because I do not know how to convert it. <br /> <br /> All that aside, I found this film is perhaps one of the best movies that deal with the history behind the "birth of the Beatles." As is well known, that the artistic and creative license are often used in movies and TV when drawing event in history, I did not allow any discrepancies dampen my enjoyment of the film. Of course, you can see the Beatles perform songs in Pechora, which made me wonder: "And they even write that then ?? I do not think so, "but, nevertheless, I thought it was a great film and performances, great. <br /> <br /> real stand out for me, in fact, was the actor who played John Stephen McKenna. I just about fell in love with him. His eyes, mannerisms, personality and speaking voice seemed spot-. It is quite similar to young John for me to do a double take before the end of the movie when you see the Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan for the first time. I actually turned out to be in doubt whether he was or not an actual Beatle frames, until I saw the other actor in the scene. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a dead accurate history of life and began the Beatles, you can not get better than "The Beatles Anthology», as it was "written" the boys themselves. However, if you are looking for a funny picture of the days before the Beatles fan leading to their arrival in America, and you leave your anal critical assessments in the door, you can not go wrong with "The Birth of the Beatles» - -a must for any "real" or accidental Beatles fan.
