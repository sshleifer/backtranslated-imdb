Kurt Russell Elvis, plain and simple. His attachment to this role led what I think is the best film ever bio. If you're a fan of Elvis, and see if you can. <br /> <br /> Made-for-TV film was made two years after Elvis' death. <br /> <br /> One piece of advice there are two options - one for 180 minutes and 117 minutes on one. Only one to watch is already one. The shorter one has over one hour video cut. It simply does not work because of the scene in it often depends on the scenes that have been cut. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece takes you on Elvis' childhood to his emergence entertainment to the greatest stars in. Shelley Winters, and Bing Russell (Kurt's real father) perfectly, as parents of Elvis. And Hingle provides a very competent, Colonel Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Long live the king!
