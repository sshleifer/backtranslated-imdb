Kurosawa weaves a story that has a cast of characters as diverse as any Shakespearean drama, action and true stories, with each star playing its role as part of a larger story. It is touching, funny and intriguing in all parts. Character development is almost perfect, the cinematography is bright and attractive, and the story draws you in. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that Â«Samurai freaks" and those who receive the end of the 18th and 19th century dynastic stories about Japan may disparage the film, if not the best work of Kurosawa. Maybe not his best, but even at its worst Kurosawa better than many of the best. This story is so based in improving the mundane lives of ordinary people in an era of great change, that it is eternal, even though set in the not-too-distant past. <br /> <br /> I would heartily recommend it to any fan of the movie, and especially for those who are likely to continue to read the novel on which the film is based.
