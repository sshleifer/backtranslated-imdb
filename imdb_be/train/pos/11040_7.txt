I watched this French horror film last night and pretty much liked. The entire film takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who are handwritten journal in the wall of a serial killer who escaped from prison 20 years ago, somehow, without leaving his cell. As they look through the diary, they discover that delves into the black arts and the team, which could be a way out of the cage and freedom. What do they know that something quite different, and the terrible, to say the least. I like the low-budget horror films that deliver goods in pretty quality, as well as tell a good story. This film does just that, despite taking some time to go. As a result, and the horror they unleash is very interesting for me and I enjoyed the trip. Not a lot of gore, but it will not match the stories, though the blood he has pretty good.
