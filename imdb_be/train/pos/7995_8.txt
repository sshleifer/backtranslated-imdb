Here the sand, get the worst story of the children of revenge starring implacable and brutal Denzel Washington. He has three faces here :. down-and-out of the low-key, is now drunk- former mercenary, the type of person who loves the father to the little girl, and then the hard maniac to freedom in searching for answers and revenge <br /> <br /> stories about Washington hired to be the bodyguard of a small US a girl who lives in Mexico where child abduction occur regularly (at least according to the film.) It is linked to the child, the child playing the charming actress of our day, Dakota Fanning. If Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington is following the men in charge and does not spare anyone. Caution :. This film is not for the faint of heart <br /> <br /> This is a stylish film industry, what is good and bad. I liked it, but the number of people considered too violent for their tastes, as the camera-work is the one that can give you a headache. I thought that it fits into the suspenseful plot was interesting to see, but it (shaky camera) is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> In addition, the two stars have always-interesting Christopher Walken, in uncharacteristically low-key role, as well as a number of other great actors. <br /> <br /> film indulges basic emotions in all of us, but it works.
