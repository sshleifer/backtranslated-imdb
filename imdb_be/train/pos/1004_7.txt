After a brief prologue showing a masked man tracks down and then fray throat older gentleman in the desert, the city, the turn of the Australian outdoors century we meet Julie (Gibney Rebecca) and Peter (John Adams) as they go out of house hunting, they manage to get a loan for fixer-upper on the elegant streets of Sydney, but it turns out that a physical problem is not the only problem with their new home. It may just be pursued. <br /> <br /> 13 Gantry Row combines memorable when several clichéd story of the good in the average direction of Catherine Millar to slightly above average shocker. <br /> <br /> The biggest disadvantages seems partly due to the budget, but do not be forgiven to this obstacle. The crucial problem occurs early in the film. Opening of "thriller scene" shows some shaky editing. Freeze frames and a series of photographs are used to hide the fact that there is not much action. Suspension should be established setting, not fancy "fix it in the mix of methods." There is a lovely atmosphere in a scene from the place, lighting, fog and such, but the camera is going to be slow killer and the victim, a sharp back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street, showing their increased intimacy. Monitoring and reduction should be slow. The attack was supposed to be larger, clearer and better blocked. As it stands, the scene has a strong "made for TV" feel, and low budget in this. <br /> <br /> After this scene we get to the present and the film flow is significantly improved. The story has many similarities to The Amityville Horror (1979), although the budget makes a much more subtle approach. Millar and screenwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of cleverly terrible scenario, often dramatic in nature, rather than a special effects-oriented, for example, a mysterious man who comes to pick up the old slab of iron that were intricately attached to the inner wall. <br /> <br /> For some horror fans, the first part of the film can be a bit cumbersome realistic drama. At least, the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter are trying to arrange financing for the house, and then try to settle. But Morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue. The material is made well enough that often suspenseful, as well as the more traditional aspects of thrillers that arise later - especially if you have gone through similar hardships when trying to buy their own home <br /> <br /> Once they receive. resolved and things are starting to get more surprising, although the special effects often leave much to be desired, the idea of ​​good. The performances help to create tension. There is not a wealth of death and destruction in the film - have more wealth repair nightmares at home. But no threat is really the point. <br /> <br /> The fact is, human relations. There are a number of edges of characters that are very interesting. The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship, which can make it acidic, and possibly destroy it. What is in a chic area, and that the relationship between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems are not only upset those who can lay the blame with some external mount, for example, money or health problems. Peter's character develops from aspiring corporate worker with a "normal" job on the basis of friendly relations with someone with a lot of despair, when he becomes a subversive intrigue to achieve something more free and meaningful. At the same time, we will know how shallow this professional friendship can be. Julie runs an almost literal nervous breakdown, but in the end is the liberation, when she frees herself from her faulty romantic relationship. <br /> <br /> While 13 Gantry Row never entirely goes beyond the scope of his made-for-TV clunkiness of, as a TV movie, is pretty good, with great ambitions. Any love ghost movies home movies or psycho horror / thriller with a bit more metaphorical depth should find a lot to enjoy. It's certainly not worth spending $ 30 on DVD (it was the price of my local PBS station requests a copy of the movie after they showed it (factoring in the shipping and handling)), but it is worth a rental, and it is definitely worth watch for free.
