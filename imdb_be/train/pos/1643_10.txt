This is a film that should be seen by all, if you want to see a lot of action. Mr. Thorne and Ms. Farrell do an excellent job. I think they need to have on TV again, so new audiences can enjoy. Wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> This gives a real sense of what the pioneers had to go through, both physically and emotionally. Big unheard film. <br /> <br /> This was done when Ms. Farrell was very young. I always thought of her as a comedian, but it is certainly not a comedy, and it is just fine. There is very little dialogue, but it's just to make it seem more real. Mr. Thorne, as always is a great presence and only his breathing has a great feel. I have to see the film.
