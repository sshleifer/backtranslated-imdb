Why the crap this film was rated so low? I saw this film more than 25 times, I know that every line in this film. It is obvious that I like this movie. Troy Parker and Matt Stone (South Park creators and a new puppet masterpiece Team America) stars as the main characters, Joe Cooper, or Coop "Aviator" Cooper and Doug Remer, or "Sir whistle." Basically, they just called Coop and Remer throughout the film. Just like the film, he begins reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts, they even go so far as to make one up called «Townsell.» I have to quote this part of the movie, since it is true, some sports begins " And after playing in New England, San Diego, Houston, San Luis, year for Toronto Arganauts, plus one season, as much in the Desert Inn I am glad to finally play here in the fine city of Miami. " His agent is tilted, "Minnesota." Let us not forget this important part of the film. So he begins to Co and Roemer is situated in a high school reunion party and realize that they still have nothing, as they say with their old classmates. Outside, they create a sports BASEketball challenged after that, probably, it was a high school basketball heroes. After a shame their sport comes in about a year. During that time they manage to score his third partner in the Squeak team, which is actually the day after they invented the game. As the film Next, we learn that Coop, Roemer and Squeak only virtuous sports heroes left. The story follows from stupid blackmail, Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and humor is so absurd, that will leave you crying anymore. Careful, dude, it's fun.
