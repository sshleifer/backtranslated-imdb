The Marquis de Sade has to do with the Egyptian archeology and mermaid worshiping cult? Toba Hooper is trying to answer this question in a strange little movie. <br /> <br /> Genie is a young cutie who visits her father bot archeology in Alexandria, Egypt. Genie comes with an enigmatic hooker (and glaring lesbians), which works with the Pope side. Dad goes back to the site where it exposes the grave with what appears to be a mermaid on it. Genie meets the descendant of the Marquis de Sade, and provides for the laborers of Egypt (of the hot scenes in the film). In the end, Genie learns that she is to be a victim and a protracted and bloody climax disperse. Wrapped around this story is the footage of the Marquis de Sade in prison, talking to the portrait that looks like a Genie. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is terrific and the Marquis and his descendant. His acting ability has always been sideswiped his makeup requirements, so it is allowed to shine here. His best performance is still in the "Killer TongueÂ», if you have not seen that yet. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, including young Genie, and pretty average. The script, however, is problematic. You will soon learn that the scene Marquis is not necessary, except perhaps the filmmakers had access to a cool set. Mermaid cult that ultimately saves Genie makes no sense. Mermaid who never explained, and its relation to Christianity (which inflated throughout the film) there is nothing. The film is very anti-Christian, the Bible as an archaeologist who beats his father, but likes to be associated local prostitute. There are a lot of scenes of debauchery and violence, but Hooper, probably had a vague idea that the writers were trying to say. I know that I have no idea. <br /> <br /> So why do I recommend this movie? It's weird. There is an extended sex scene. For the ladies, hard worker Egyptian rides a horse completely naked. Englund amazing. Do you like snakes? This film is full of them. This is how Roger Corman with a big budget. Experienced Hooper came up with "Crocodile" after it's pretty boring. "Nightmares" is not perfect, but it is definitely worth a blink, not a serious look. <br /> <br /> This is the ranking (R) physical violence, some sexual violence, blood, foul language, female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, sexual references and drug abuse. <br /> <br />
