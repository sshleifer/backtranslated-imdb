I loved this film the viewer recognizes the intelligence, allowing layers to clear from the characters through their interaction with each other about the unspoken loss that so affects every one of them. <br /> <br /> beautiful cinematography, and it inspired reflection of the vision of someone I believe is a very talented new director of artistic maturity and insight to tell the story of how others with much more experience did not succeed to reach . I see a bright future for this writer / producer / director who had the opportunity to focus on the goals and fulfill its integrity. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this achievement.
