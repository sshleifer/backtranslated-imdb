Infinite limits of our inhumanity to our own mind will never be able to stun me. This story is really appalling abuse and largely unprecedented population is a compelling, well-documented and February. As an American, I am constantly humbled behavior of my country, and this is just one more in our catalog a long international corruption. We suck. This is perhaps the first documentary by John Pilger I saw, but he immediately made me want to see what else he did. My only complaint, and so I gave this film only 8 out of 10 that Pilger shows us the terrible parody and cooperation the United States Governments and the UK, requires that we have viewed / citizens are complicit in our own inaction ... but does not any suggestions on how to help. I do not know about the UK, but America has made it almost impossible to citizens to participate in the affairs of his government. Gesture in the right direction would help the cause of the islanders.
