Definitely one of my favorite movies. History is a good, working perfectly, all the pick-ups (especially cinema) are sharp and clever script. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is terrific as Edward 'Ned «» Kelly. It captures the legendary criminal, and is also supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All the action sequences are on the point <br /> <br /> The film edge of your seat until the end of the material. One of my favorite movies from the late legend Heath Ledger, who was a nail in every movie he starred. And do not make any mistakes here. <br /> <br /> A great movie from all sides.
