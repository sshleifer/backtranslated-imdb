This film is about generation of determining the value for some of us were born in the early postwar years that (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953, and liked to spend a Saturday afternoon in your neighborhood cinema), you will almost certainly have seen him, and the memory of seeing it is likely to remain with you. This style is the material of the short and somehow gloriously exciting moment in our younger days. <br /> <br /> It was a modern, space age storyboard for viewers at this time. The set was any town with a supermarket and a cinema, which will be packaged in a midnight show on Friday. It has hot rods, and rebellious youth, but also "why can not they let us have fun" way, not broken, theatrical way of rebel-without-a-cause. All of the characters have been identified to us - teenagers, parents, old, doctor, nurse, mechanic, boy, puppy, even cops - sympathized with us. We could treat them all <br /> <br /> This was especially horrible monster. This is the first victim is heard moaning 'sick ..... it hurts, and we were confident and scared. The threat is growing continuously throughout history. There are extensive waiting periods, colorful effects, fabulous lead McQueen, and moments of humor, as expected, and no. He was even almost at the very top of the sad, to make it more sensitive of us want to cry. <br /> <br /> I've seen it in the summer, age 9 or so, a double bill with "I married a monster from outer space," and was so delighted with the experience of this particular double function, that I went back a couple more times, before he left. Everyone I know that has seen him. Everyone I knew, loved him.
