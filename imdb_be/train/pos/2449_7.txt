when I saw the ad for this I do not mean "nothing NPK AT NITE DONE!» because it took away "Fresh Prince" slots. Well, I still love the Fresh Prince. but George Lopez surprisingly good show. I love as a non-stereotypical Benny is. Carmen is quite a good character, it's really funny to see how stupid and overemotional it can be sometimes. I feel bad for the guy who plays Max, he looks much younger than he really is! but no more than a fun character, and well acted. and let Angie a bit stereotypical, but it has funny moments. haha ​​George with rounds have a big head! Nah, but it can be very good. fun show! it certainly needs to be more likely than home improvement.
