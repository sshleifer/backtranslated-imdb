I found this movie by mistake many years ago and ask, then (until now), why he did not get the recognition it should have. Well written, beautiful acting, one ironic twist after another, and there is some in that vile characters trying. I would not recommend this movie for people with a short attention span; it requires sufficient intelligence to understand that there may be a grain of truth in this story.
