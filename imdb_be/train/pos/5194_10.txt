This is one of my favorite movies of martial arts in Hong Kong. This is one of the earliest films of John Woo and one of the few traditional martial arts movies he directed. You can see his work under the influence of Chang Cheh in this film. The action is good, fight choreography performed Fong Hak On, which is one of the bad guys in the movies. It stars Wei Pi a "five poisons" fame and a number of people familiar to fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers productions. The storyline is interesting, there are a few decent twists and building the characters and their relationships with each other intelligently made. This film was only VHS release in the UK. Media Asia has released a DVD region 3, and there are versions of it on DVD, are available from the United States. The film is a pleasure to watch in all its original language or in the English version of the name. I highly recommend this film.
