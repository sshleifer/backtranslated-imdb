I read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties of Liebe de Totes (Love dead) or something like that. This, of course, woke up my curiosity, so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and the death of the King (The King Death). Movies Nekromantik serviceable, even kind of interesting and unique in its approach to the subject of necrophilia (even if they are clearly record a horror opera, and is not meant to cause fear in the audience objected, they were actually pretty funny.) <, Br /> <br /> TODESKING, on the other hand, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. It consists of a series of scenes that show many aspects of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a reliever, death as a very fysical body decomposition. The film is a metaphor of life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives. This reduces their audience to Childs, they (we) are actually. The fact that we are unable to understand the nature of death, and therefore, neither the process of dying, it is the main idea of ​​the film. This is the most realistic film. Never try to hide anything Buttgereit death for roses or whatever. Regardless of any moral norms that you created, not death unevitable, and sooner or later, not fiction, and your reality. This applies to you, dear reader, as it relates to the movie audience. Some minor reviewers do not seem to understand it, which is completely free, as they certainly will live forever ... <br /> <br /> This is not exploitation cinema. Why? Because death does not exploit us, the people. He gathers us. We grow for seven days, we returned to Schopenhauerian state before birth, there is death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest tales. You choose to regard it as "optimistic" or "pessimistic" to you. At first glance, this may seem very dark. Consider, however, that in order for something to live, something else must die. "Who wants to live forever?» <br /> <br /> I believe that if Buttgereit shows the body, which is consumed by larvae, it shows not only corruption, but the generation of new life. Is it not better to die and give birth to maggots, then poultry and eventually become soil, than to remain living dead zombies, which is one of the most favorite pets of the genre? <br /> <br /> If you are aware of it, you see that the death of the King of his right context. <br /> <br /> Sieben Tage hat die Woche, siebenmal Letzte Stunden. Seven days a week (weak, mortal!), Seven times in the last hour. <br /> <br /> Dont fear the reaper, Buttgereit tells us, because the reaper takes only what is in time. But apples are not ripped off for food will rot! <br /> <br /> Have a good life, comrades IMDB'ers! <br /> <br /> (And watch this movie, which only compares Ingemar Bergmans "The Seventh Seal" in terms of depth and universality)
