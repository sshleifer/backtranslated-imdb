This cool docu-drama, which covers no new ground, recycles all the clich√©s and untidy with the facts. For example, Munich is a very flat city. So why is hilly in the film? For example, at the end of the First World War in 1918 was not a capitulation, but a truce. Nonetheless, it is declared as a capitulation. For example, European producers are not news (and not) screaming headlines as they sell their papers. However, this is strictly an American custom to use in the film. For example, the Nazis did not accept the German Eagle, until after they took power, but there at the lectern, Hitler delivers one of his stem PRS. Indeed, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than Hitler's eloquence. The film also perpetuates the myth that beer at the Munich putsch hatched Hoffbrauhaus. It was not. Robert Carlyle makes an excellent image of your subject. But his supporting cast is adequate at best, and often not even that. These comments are based only on the first episode. One can only hope that the second will be better, but do not bet on it.
