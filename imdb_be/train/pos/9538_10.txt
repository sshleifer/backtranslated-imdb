Why can not more movies (especially American) more like Meatball Machine? <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review and I am charged with "electric ecstasy" after selecting "Meatball Machine", my first endeavor. This is a review, so I'll try to stick to a simple reflection and emotion bowel. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is a creative part of the job, even if it is clearly inspired by the classic Tetsuo Now! So if it is not all original? I have both of these films, and although Teee is one amazing son of a bitch, Meatballs machine is much higher and can be stayed without a strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind of psychotropic drugs to clarify the importance of the film. Meatball machine as a complex in his history as a great blood and blood flow. Thank you Jesus for the Japanese cinema! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the last time when my dreams were captured by the vision of horror happened after watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7 or so. I could imagine the language coming out of the phone in my dreams for several weeks in a row. At this time, (31) my dreams were pleasant it can be in awe. <br /> <br /> In this film, a host of human bodies Aliens whose sole purpose is to try to fulfill their endless hardening of human flesh and blood. People become cyborgs flesh eating !!! There's more !!! The fight scenes !! Great music !! Big point of view of the shots! Decent acting cyborg women (at least better than her male colleague). The fight seen in the end, it is necessary to look ten or twenty times. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot to mention that this is a love story! Wow, I hate love stories, but this takes the cake! <br /> <br /> I can not wait to have friends to see this movie again, just to see the reaction on their faces. Unfortunately, I found the time to write this review because I am afraid that most of the friends and family understand Meatballs custom machines. The truth is that America as a whole is not ready for Meatball Machine. <br /> <br /> And finally, my wife came in while I was watching the culminating fight at the end, and she was speechless. She usually says something like, "Why are you looking at that garbage?" This time she did not have anything to say. I was happy! <br /> <br /> It's not junk. It's not just splatter (splash for splash also great). It is the art of my friends. Art. <br /> <br /> CHACHO
