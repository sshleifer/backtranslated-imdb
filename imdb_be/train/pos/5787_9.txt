Many still standing in this episode (as well as most of Twilight Zone episodes), such as the Women's incredibly sexist military "uniform." And some things are so incredible as easy access to clean water. However, consider the year it was made, and the time, and you'll quickly realize why this episode is so special, you see. It has a pleasant sense of hope, something missing from many dark areas, as well as an interesting female character (despite the fact that she rarely says), something still rare in the Twilight Zone. "Two" is a perfect example of how the Twilight Zone, a little more than 20 minutes, may raise more emotion and drama than most two o'clock cinema today. And it's great to see two people who have become American icons so early in his career.
