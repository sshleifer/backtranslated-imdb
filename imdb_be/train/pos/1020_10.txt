"Stargate SG-1" stands intergalactic search team called SG-1 by using a device called a Stargate and all the surprises that await on the other side of the wormhole. <br /> <br /> After watching this series is sporadically for the first few seasons, when it first came out, I do not know how good this series is really, 10 years after the last time I saw the episode. The old impression that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just science fiction series, is one of the most well-made, interesting, long stroke, exciting science-fiction ever created. And why? Because it works in a strange room. <br /> <br /> This is the value of the series is far superior to the film was based on, and I think that is a very good example of what television as a means by suitable premises to be able to ensure that no work restrictions the time of the film. The feeling of familiarity created long series, observing the character and circumstance progresses over time is staggering and simply adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and everything is the result of a good written form and a lot of dedication by the entire crew of the show. <br /> <br /> Â«Stargate SG-1" continues to offer great adventures for 10 years, but never afraid to challenge moving story and it gave ground for some very different periods of time display: <br /> <br /> - the first few seasons, perhaps up to 4/5, much more focused on the study of planets and a variety of situations, keeping the episodes are not quite related to each other if it were not for always coming Goaul'd threat. <br /> <br /> - From the 5th to the 7th had more episodes with an emphasis on the fight against Goaul'd and prevent attacks on Earth. After that, planetary exploration season is almost just an excuse to enter the SG-1 in place Goaul'd / replicator / Ori conflict <br /> <br /> - Season 8 is probably the most controversial. He has Feed episodes, which includes small land cases in which the Stargate is hardly even mentioned, but recent episodes have some great moments replicator. <br /> <br /> - 9 th and 10 th passage together, because they are one and the same new enemy and Jack O'Neill. They are both good sequels, although the first few episodes of the 10th season, a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than SG-1 and the person / Jaffa lose battle after battle in the Ori. <br /> <br /> in principle, after Season 7, exploration was pushed into the background, that in many ways was a shame, because of the possibility and mystery each planet (episode) presented; On the other hand, he has done so many great episodes with continuing conflicts that the changing nature of the show still works, and shows how big and bold writers were. <br /> <br /> Even tough I believe that a number of high quality have an ending that beautifully puts it at ease, a feeling I have that it can go on; the people involved are all great professionals and a number of story had a lot to offer. Last season back to top the nature of the series was very doable and would be welcome, but ultimately, things as they are. <br /> <br /> In the end, due to the fact that I liked it all, it's a little hard to find that it ends. The big picture, however, one shows the work of hundreds of people for 10 years, is a spectacle of beauty and authentic evidence of self-sacrifice of the crew, these great actors and characters, which we will always remember, as a team called SG-1.
