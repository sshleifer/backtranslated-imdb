I have not seen this movie yet, but I can not wait to see it! It seems very interesting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting trailer I've ever seen: questions he really delivered stopped me and made me think, a unique approach to boxing sport as a metaphor for the "Battle of the" ... Thank God, someone hitting another angle with boxing things . This movie looks so fresh and reasonable. And the actor is really hot. I especially liked the short clip with an actor of the Rocky movies, really smart. I thought the theme is chosen, poverty and childhood traumas, eternal, and God knows that many people need. Bring it.
