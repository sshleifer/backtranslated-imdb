First of all, I do not understand why some people think this film as anti-American. Of course, there are times when the United States accused directly, as in Youssef Chahine segments, Ken Loach and, to a certain extent, Mira Nair. But come on, they are not naive charges; instead, they are based on real and documented facts and all the documents that the CIA released about Chile confirms this, for example. <br /> <br /> But, returning to the film itself, what I like most about it appears a variety of moods we find in it. We believe children are raised in respect of all the people who died in the case; we find the unfortunate pair that will change the tragedy of that day; we find the simple people who have downgraded their feelings on the shadow of September 11, and react differently to it, with dignity or disappointment; we even find someone in a movie for anyone falling towers bases moment of true happiness <br /> <br /> All these visions and others. - as powerful as it is, and even more - make a consistent mixture and help the viewer to have an idea of ​​how different people spread around the world responded to the events of 11 September. Thus, we see a panorama that is much more complex than that of whites and blacks, and it may make some people mad; but it is a world in which we live, and there is no room for manicheistic ideologies, irrespective of the presidents or priests can tell us. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think it's a shame that there is not even the date of release of the film in the United States. It's a shame, because the majority of the American people asked why this accident happened, and this film could give some clues to it. This film puts very clearly - in different ways, some people think that this forum - everything we do today will determine our future and that past mistakes will affect the way we live today.
