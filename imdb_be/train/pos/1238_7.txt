While this film has a lot of shortcomings, it is actually fun to film 80 minutes. Eddie Murphy peak during his 80 movies here. While his character is no different from the earlier films, it almost perfectly with the ideal partners and foil. <br /> <br /> Couple this with the hypnotic beauty of Charlotte Lewis, it makes to meet the rainy day action comedy flick. <br /> <br />
