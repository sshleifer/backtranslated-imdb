As perhaps one of the few Canadians who have not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. After seeing the film without knowing the story in advance in no way detracts from the film. Characters have so much difficulty, everyone can relate to them in their own way. Gloss adaptation is something that everyone can project their own perceptions on the life of the characters, rather than spoon-fed opinions. You can love them or love them, and still feel the emotional impact of the film. Excellent performances, Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life. I highly recommend it.
