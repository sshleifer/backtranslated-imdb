the only word that sums up this movie is quirky. This light-hearted romp through existential concept. Inflatable (more than one way) and a bit nutty. I would not call it a spectacular and unforgettable movies, and it does not seem as memorable as the first film "cube" of the director, but it's a good pit down to see on a Sunday morning. acting veers from respectable to the irritating time, but I believe that is how it should have been written. done in a serious movie it might be possible, or very large may be a step in the pre-tensioned state. a bit like a "matrix" responsible "head" meets "human nature." <br /> <br /> 6.8 out of ten
