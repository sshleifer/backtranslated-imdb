This feeling is a good movie, one man dreams, and drive or push to implement them. This beautiful and inspirational film. Why do some people have to try to find fault with every movie that comes out, especially good. Dennis Quaid gives a good stable performance in this true story of Jim Morris, a science teacher and baseball coach a high school, which push his team to take another shot at a professional baseball career. With a great supporting cast, including Brian Cox as crisp old former officer of the Navy, which let so many achievements of her son go without his support. It was good to see him as something other than the villain in the film. If I have one complaint with this film it is: Never let Royce Applegate sign the national anthem again. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie belongs to the handful of great baseball movies like "Field of Dreams" and «The Natural». It evaluates two thumbs up and a big "well done."
