This film is constantly there with the classics. Music, camera shots, and action perfectly. Screening of the film in black and white gave him a much better look and complements the music perfectly, like a psychopath. It's amazing how few people have commented on this film. I think it's hard to find film. I gave the film 9. Watch the movie and you'll know what I'm saying.
