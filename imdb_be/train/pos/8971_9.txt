Actually, I'm not a big fan of stop motion films and at first entirely Haru grabbed my attention. However, knowing that this film was made in the repressive Czechoslovakia during the Soviet-era domination, the more I watched the movie, the more I realized how subversive this innocent looking little movie. This subtext really made the film come alive and gives him a real staying power, and as a work of art and a political statement. <br /> <br /> boring film is done without any dialogue, but it's pretty clear what's going on. Cute little wooden man doing a clay pot and having a great time when suddenly there intervenes animated hand and destroy the pot - turn it into a sculpture of hands instead. Well, a wooden man over and over again trying to get rid of the hand and do their own thing. However, over time the hand is becoming more and more insistent and eventually humans cells. And, in the end, a man is dead because of the intervention of his arms and hands, as a sign of the real hypocrisy, gives a person a hero's funeral! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is an obvious attempt to brave Trnka criticize his overbearing government. Not surprisingly, although the Czechs liked the film and gave it a critical evaluation, the state (ie, hand) banned this little parable. Unfortunately, Trnka did not live to see his people freed a little more than two decades later, in the course of joint-called "velvet revolution".
