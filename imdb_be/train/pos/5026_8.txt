This is a great movie that everyone should see. He plays like a Dean Koontz book. <br /> <br /> performance Paxton was great, it really seems that he believes in what he says and does. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the audience should be read in some of the religious propaganda of murder in the film. It's fantastic. The ending is surprising, but fictional. So what? I think that's what makes this film so well. Spoiler NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU Havent seen the movie. Throughout the film, the viewer is constantly shocked by the nature of the disease Paxton, the impact on the children and how children cope with this outrageous behavior. And then in the end, it turns out to be true. God set him on a mission to rid the world of demons. Paxton Sun clairvoyants, others offer viewers. Of course, he is informed that he could not know otherwise, but the film goes on to show how God "protects" Adam through convenient video quality problems and a complete lack of memory of the second FBI agent. The film does not protect the Christian murder, it just takes the audience on a very unexpected trip.
