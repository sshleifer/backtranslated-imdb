I found this film to be in suspense almost from the get-go. If Miss Stanwyck begins his story, it is just a few minutes, until you realize that the trouble comes. The desert zone, the lock on the door of a deserted gas station, all the sets you wait for it ... here it comes. At first you think it will be a boy, but very soon you start holding your breath, watching the tide coming in. I found this movie to be really busy, but I watched it before, and was ready to climax. Now, a film that can keep you in suspense, even if you've seen it before deserves some specific rating may be white Knuckles awards?
