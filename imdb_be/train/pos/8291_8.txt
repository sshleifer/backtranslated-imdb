"The lady in question (1999)," starring Gene Wilder is a well-acted mystery drama that reminds me of old black-and-white series Perry Mason Raymond Burr. Both Perry and «Cash» kept me guessing until the very end. There were many suspects with motive for the murder, but I had no idea what kind of character she is. <br /> <br /> Gene Wilder has a special magic wits about him, even his facial expressions and vocal intonations that make it ideal for this role. Parts of the film depicting actors acting was done very well. I am sure that this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull off. I'm not surprised that he made some of the letters for the film. Even his singing was a delight. I love him in this role more than his former "dumber" role as "Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka." I hope, & E will continue this series. They should call it something like "The A & E Gene Wilder Tyne". <br /> <br /> Music is suitable period. I enjoyed the cool live combos and swing tunes. I was a bit confusing in the beginning, we were seeing a flashback or whether the action takes place during this time period. And I do not agree that the inclusion of profanity must be a script stream. For me it is always a distraction <br /> <br /> In general, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well thought-out beginning in what we hope will be many more - as well as one of our other favorites :. Raymond Burr Perry Mason.
