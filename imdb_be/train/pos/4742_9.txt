This movie has more action for the opening of credits than in whole Hollywood films of this kind. This film is produced Tsui Hark and Jet Li stars. This command will bring you a lot of worthy movie performances in Hong Kong, including Once Upon A Time in China series. The action was fast and furious with the amazing work of the wire. I only saw wire in two shots. In addition to actions the story itself has been strong, and not just used as a filler. In order to find any other action movies to compete, you should seek out a movie in Hong Kong in your area. They are really worth checking out and, as a rule, never disappoint.
