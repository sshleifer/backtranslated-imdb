Very nicely done movie. It does stay in your mind. Better billed as a novel than flying or war, Altho volatile parts are realistic and almost without errors. Flying enthusiasts like me will enjoy this film, even if the involved aircraft, if they do not have the sensitivity or have never been in love. <br /> <br /> Pin Up early blood. He is a good and oozes charm. His reading of "High Flight" is excellent. <br /> <br /> cheers, Boom
