Of course, this film is sweet and juicy and full of cliche, but it's fun, and it's something that I watch movies. For entertainment. Henstridge is stunning, even with short hair. Her smile and her shining beauty can not be disguised. As for Vartan, I am sure that women love it. Two of them seemed to enjoy eacb other in this film. I do not understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them. I think we see that we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli was fun to watch, even if the British accent d'Abo in so creep into her alleged speech Bronx. Honestly, I was not really noticed it until I read these comments, but I'm back on DVD and now her dialogue sounds more British than American to me, but it is perfect for their roles so that, with one exception . <br /> <br /> This is the story of two good men who marry significant others, but who find like-minded people in the other. It may be unlikely story, but who says that movies should all play like documentaries? It is not unrealistic more than any of AMD are screened every hour on the tube. That's why we're watching them to get away from the humdrum of daily life for a short period of time and enter into the world of the characters on the screen. I thought that the actors did a good job of it, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy that rips easily. Do not get me wrong though, it must be a sentimental scene, and this film was a lot of them. <br /> <br /> I give 9/10 only because I'm saving a 10/10 for this still invisible super wonderful movie that I know that will come some day. If you see what is advertised as coming up on the Lifetime Movie Channel or movies, or any other, to take notes, to watch it. I think you'll like.
