Just finished watching this film that upset me greatly. It was also in South Africa twice, around the time the film is set. <br /> <br /> This, of course, an impartial and introductory scene, as a rule, "set the scene". A slow but steady increase in the rate hardly allows you to make a break, and there are certainly a few light moments. <br /> <br /> Never will not be able to view the Hawthorne same again. He came across as a very twisted man, and I have found loving it more every time he appeared. <br /> <br /> I fully agree with the joint Steve thomp and well-thought-out comments.
