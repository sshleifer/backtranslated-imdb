A series of vignettes, most of them spoofing television of the 1970s, but with some digging on the government and corporate America. One of the longest segment, "dealer" is not funny to me, and I do not know what it parodies. Some of the others, though, it is absolutely side splitting. I especially like the cooking show segment. Most of the dirty words I know, used in the film, and if you object to full nudity, stay away.
