Those of "instant pleasure" era of horror films will undoubtedly complain about the pace of the film and the lack of gratuitous effects, and the body count. The fact is, "Empty Acre" is a good example of how the independent horror films to be made. <br /> <br /> If you avoid indie rack, because you are tired of the pesky teenagers and twenty-something killed by a villain whose backstory could break the back of the box of Count Chocula, "Empty Acre" is the film for you. <br /> <br /> Set in the decaying remains of the rural American Dream, "about the empty Acre" is the story of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby. How weak the couple's relationship is falling apart, the big story is played in the background. In the night time, shapeless dark masses seethe sun baked barren acres on his farm and, seemingly devouring everything in its path, leaving no sign that it was ever. <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with mysterious signs and visual clues as to what's going on, and ends well executed ending that resonates with just one question left to test the writer / director's faith in the intellectual audience. <br /> <br /> There seems to be sub-text, on the death of the American dream, but I would hardly call the film an allegory. Riveting, well-acted, and technically astute, "Empty Acre" is a fantastic little indie that think horror fans should love.
