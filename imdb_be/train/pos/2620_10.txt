What a pleasant surprise: Disney DTV (Live Video) sequel that really well. «The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy business, which includes favorite Meerkat and Warthog each, Timon and Pumbaa. It starts with their view of the original film and make comments while Timon complains that "we are not here yet." After the struggle for the remote, Timon and Pumbaa decide to tell the audience, "your story." They start a new film, and the laughter begins. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I'm losing hope in Disney. Most of them are straight to video fare was terribly aggressive, with scenes of desperate to cash in on the original. "1 1/2" decided to try something different: it tells an original story from a new perspective. Well, it adds some things like where Timon came and he and Pumbaa met, but it is an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella great win relationship and friendship that made us love them in the first film. There are also some neat parody movies (including one scene, which also replaces the "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and "Cool Hand Luke), and the script is full of funny memorable lines. <br /> <br /> Added to methane are Kavner ( «The Simpsons»), as a worry wart mother Timon, and Jerry Stiller as Timon slightly crazy Uncle Max. Matthew Broderick shows how Simba and his "teen" scene reminded me of Ferris Bueller. Everyone is doing well, especially Robert Guillaume (that's how it's spelled?) As Rafiki, who exudes more and more Yoda-speak in this film (Timon commented on it several times). <br /> <br /> "The Lion King 1 1/2 'is the perfect alternative choice for those of you tired of Shrekification animation. 10/10
