«Moonstruck» excellent short film directed by a superb storyteller, Zhuison (In the middle of the night, Fiddler on the Roof, hurricane). The film is great on many levels. It shows a good piece of Italian culture, there is a touching romance, and (best of all) fun comedy. <br /> <br /> One thing I loved more than the entire film was a relative non-traditional appearance of actors. Nicolas Cage looks positively strange for most of the film, and ... well, Cher, Cher always looks a little strange. <br /> <br /> In general, it is an entertaining film and easy to recommend. <br /> <br />7.4 10
