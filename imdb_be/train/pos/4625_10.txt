Shakespeare in jail was the most strange and wonderful film that I've seen all year. We are talking about a prison program, somewhere in California, if I remember correctly, where prisoners are rehearsed and performed another Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film's behind their production of "The Tempest" from casting on performance, and in the process we learn some pretty strange things about these people, who are for the most serious crimes. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction - if someone tried to adapt the story in the film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it really makes it exciting to watch - in the literal sense; I gasped out loud when I learned about a crime one particularly gifted in felon. It's like a rabid episode of Oz, and more interesting, because the characters and their amazing stories are real.
