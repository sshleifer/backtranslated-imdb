This is a film the US do not. That's why people hire foreign films. It's a great story about how one man, even if it is late can make a person to find the cause of an empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people who are mentally retarded suffer in their lives, and shows them in a very realistic (I think). Like its classic foreign films, this film has a bitter end, but this makes it a better film only.
