Possible SPOILERS: Not sure <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1 1/2, I could not help but have mixed feelings about the film. This is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing about it that would give you the same feeling that made The Lion King. History, for those who have not read the other reviews about how Timon and Pumbaa meet, and how they influence the events in the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> There are actually some very funny jokes in the movie. My favorite part is when they show a couple of lifting Simba. However, for me the worst part shall be when they show Timon and Pumbaa directly interfering with the original events. I can not look at the "Circle of Life" or Â«Can You Feel the Love Tonight" sequence in the same way again (I'm fine with, "I just can not wait to be king" sequence). <br /> <br /> voice talents perfectly. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do an excellent job as Matthew Broderick, the guy who makes Rafiq and hyenas. Even the actor who makes the young Simba sounded enough like Zhonaton Taylor Thomas for me. But why are they even include voice actor for Zazu? He literally had only two lines and none were really needed. Additives Kavner and Jerry Stiller only add to the talent, but still can not hear the voice of Timon mom and I do not think that Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that do not seem to fit into the original, one comes to mind, as if they are the pride of the rock at the end. As they have the time to fit in the initial battle with the hyenas? <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, you can not help but feel that for a set of 2 CDs, special features, especially not to be missed. They could have easily fit a comment, or a different ratio on the 1st drive. I enjoyed the "Who wants to be king of the jungle" of the game, even if it is the most infamous example of cross-promotion I have ever seen. Some of the questions, really hard. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie, but not as good as TLC or even TLK2.
