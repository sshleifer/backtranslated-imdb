Initially, I saw this movie years ago during Cinemax on Friday after the onset of the dark series (back when the cable box was built as a keyboard), and it intrigued me. While there meaningless aspect of the film is good acted.The performance Depardieu and Dever very enjoyable.They has good chemistry together and Miou-Miou does look pink fur breathtaking.A film like this probably will not be done in these politically correct times (at least in the US), as it appears to be a sensational things like violence, robbery, and casual sex. This film proves that a talented cast and a talented and Sun directing a good movie a good movie no case subject.It upset me to see brother-in-law committed suicide, and in the near future I LL I check it with Depardieu and I'm -Miou in Get Out Your handkerchief.
