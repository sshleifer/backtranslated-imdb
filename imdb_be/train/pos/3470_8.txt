Despite the fact that I was quite young, The Beatles is my absolute favorite band! I never had the opportunity to hear their music, as it releases, but loved them since I can remember. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of film that is worth a try once. I can understand why it was not released in the movie, but it's definitely a great film to put on TV. I was leafing through my TV Guide, and happened to see this film, it was not so much detail, except for something like: "John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles broke up, Jared Harris stars I've never heard of it (. he played John) and Aidan Quinn, who played Paul. However, they are certainly underestimated actors! <br /> <br /> The film had a slow start, but as it developed, I could see how good of Quinn, but especially Harris played their characters. as a huge fan, I kind of know what the real Lennon and McCartney as. The script was brilliant and Ha Figure Lennon got the focus, face and manners on the spot! Quinn McCartney played pretty well, but sometimes came in his Irish accent. Grimm artists made them look great <br /> <br /> After this point may be regarded as a spoiler * :. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, he had gone to a slow start, but has developed rapidly and become quite emotional film. I found a little park a total waste of time and not in the nature of both musicians. As for Lennon's rough lines in an Italian restaurant, it is not necessary. The ending was very bitter and brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it. <br /> <br /> It is quite different from other biographical films that I've seen where we are talking about how The Beatles came together and became famous, and those who have never done characters that well. eg «Backbeat». <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say, if you're Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan, give him a chance, you can have a pleasant surprise. At only about 95 minutes, it should expect the film to develop. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows whether there was a meeting in 1976, please send it to "page comment" for this film, I 'd be very interesting.
