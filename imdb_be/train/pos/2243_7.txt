I thought the whole movie was playing beautifully with fresh designs and interesting movie all the way through it. Actors were on the top of the back of his character in an almost perfect time and looked great. Music was juicy and well thought out. He even had a decent twist ending. So that every vote it? History is not very fresh (felt like a relic of the "Running Man" with the whole idea of ​​the television show), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism on how the public chooses their Messiah certainly sounds accurately. It made sense to follow that one person who was faced with the modern crowd and put him on a pedestal due to its capabilities. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Christians and other religious people choose it because the film has the word "God" in it, but it shows that the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach people the opportunity that probably never seen the world like this, especially in today's world, where Christianity was more common and have forgotten about some of them. <br /> <br /> I gave it 7/10 stars here on IMDb. I thought that every ounce of the film was interesting and original, for the most part-. Check it out if you're not too offended to see the spectacular film in Madrid, Spain, on the possibilities of the future Messiah modern to a TV near you.
