Absolutely brilliant show. The second season began where the first ended, with a big secret. Pausing in most, if not all the episodes and mysteries of the world. One that made me think and think again. It's really amazing how the writer can come with all connections and connect all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the life of the characters in the show so meaningful. Never exciting, and I look forward to the new season. Hopefully, more secrets to discover and at the same time, a mystery to be solved. A good choice of actors and for the show, the characters fit perfectly. Really can not wait to finally discover the secret. Hopefully, all the hype will not spoil the ending.
