I sincerely hope that at least the first season of The Cosby released on DVD ever. The episode of the eccentric genius brother Hilton, George (played by the late Roscoe Lee Browne), is a classic fun. It reflects the classic related rivalry and love between the brothers, whose lives have taken different paths, but both were happy. <br /> <br /> Mr. Cosby and Ms. Rashad brilliantly recaptured the chemistry they shared on the Cosby Show for many years, and put them in a middle-class role shows the size, they can take as artists. <br /> <br /> In the register of comedy dynamite ... Madeline Kahn, Rashad, and Mr. Cosby's classic ... genius!
