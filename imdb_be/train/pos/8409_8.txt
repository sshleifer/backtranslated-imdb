A good movie, and one I will look several times. Rich (previous commentator) is right: there is much more going on here than is evident from the name of the board, and I need to know how many have suffered in translation. We were still in the original? Or the native language of the audience is expected to lip-read more? Or - because the script was written by the author of the novel on which it was founded - it was currently popular theme with which viewers are already familiar? In short, it is worth seeing, but it is likely to require more work from contemporary audiences than the original 1913 spectators had to put into it. <br /> <br /> Release Alpha Video touts new authority account, but the music does not correspond to the progression of history in any case. Of course, it begins promisingly, but degenerates into repeats, Philip Glass-like monotony, which does not reflect the personal on-screen action. After listening for a while, I turned off the sound and just watched: much better!
