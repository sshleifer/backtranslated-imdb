How to start a typical day in Point Place, Wisconsin ... <br /> <br /> First of all, red, tyrannical father Forman family and World War II veteran, is sitting at the kitchen table reading the newspaper, his wife Kitty happy fall breakfast. Then comes the worst of their son, Eric, he is sitting at the table, as well as his father starts his daily cries, usually involving putting a foot back Eric when (insert reason here). When his angels with random face sisters Lori house she comes, the red stop clapping and talking gently to her, which makes Eric feels left out of the family. <br /> <br /> After that, every day (painful) rite ended, Eric rushes down to the basement of his house, where all his friends are hanging. And if we see them, it becomes apparent, Eric and his mischievous red-haired friend, neighbor and childhood friend Donna Pinciotti Sanest are people around. Meet Steven Hyde, a conspiracy theorist who hates disco and do not really care about that around as long as it is not funny to watch; Michael Kelso, the kind of guy who thinks that he will get through their lives only because of its appearance, and that carrots grow on trees; Jackie Burkhardt, one who thinks of himself as the most beautiful girls around, spoiled child of a rich father, and, of course, a fan; and Fez, naive but hypersexuality foreigner who loves sweets and can not keep a secret. At first they just hang out, gossip and ridicule Kelso, but then they all sit in a circle, and let the fun begin ... before going out to do something they will regret later. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Red goes out and meets a pervert Donna parents, Bob and Midge. He was rude, but they do not mind because they think he was joking. Somewhere Leo, an aging hippie who constantly confuses and makes a play on words, not even noticing. <br /> <br /> Do you imagine that the seemingly peaceful coexistence with all these strange characters? Of course, most seem to be "templates", but the show takes a cliche to a new level. Throw in some of the worst scene Cibitoke lines to offer, sit down and enjoy one of the best TV shows ever. One that never does twice the same thing, and that, compared to most comedies that are "cute funny" pure hysteria. If you subscribe to, do not let this show will let you go. The bite on the hook again and again, and the man, you will see a sitcom genre with a whole new perspective.
