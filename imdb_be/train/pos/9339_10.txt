For those of you without this link, clubberin had 4 cams hit one body ... <br /> <br /> In any case, a viewing. <br /> <br /> I miss WCW Saturday Night. Some of my favorite moments of wrestling occurred at this stage. I remember watching the Extraordinary Steve Austin, Rick Auburn, Brian Pillman, The Villain, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP in his zhobberskie days, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, Sting ... I would be here at a list of all. The point is WCW was strange to list the pre-Hogan days, and they made entertainment television. Dusty Rhodes on comments gave me a whole new reason in his later years, to see when I started smoking pot as a teenager ... I would really want to put Vince on his microphone for a show or two, maybe, on the next Great American Bash ? They CLUBBERIN! But DA PLUNDA! He was great. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
