I saw this movie back at the International Festival in Palm Springs in 2005 i 14 films I saw there, I would have rated it # 4 900+ theater was full, and in the end he got a standing ovation. It was a classic Peter Falk, if you're a fan of Falk and showed a lot of chemistry between the characters, Peter Falk and Paul Reiser. The name of the film, it seemed too long and odd sounding to me. I'm surprised it did not make it into general release. It was much better than most of the stuff that major studios throw at you. Maybe too old that it was aimed at baby boomers and older audience. Many people can relate to the situations in the film. This is likely to enjoy the revival of sorts years now, when people look back on this film, and I think this kind of stone. I would rate it 8.0 to 8.5 on a 10-point scale, and definitely recommend it.
