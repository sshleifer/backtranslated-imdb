I watched it many times, and I plan to buy the full function. I love all the comedy style of Jason. This is a very different and unique and very enjoyable. I love indie films, and this one is just fine. The plot is strange, but very funny. This short film is about speaking spatula named Edward. The order of events is a bit confusing, which makes this film very interesting to watch. First you see Edward struggles with a spoon, but then change the focus at the beginning of his life. That's a stupid movie, but, of course, it's still great. I highly recommend you watch this movie on www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It's very funny. Humor may not match everyone's taste, but look all the same. It only takes 16 minutes of your time, and it's free. GO WATCH spatula MADNESS!
