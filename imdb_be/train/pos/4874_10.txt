Kusturika did it again. Another masterpiece. Coral comedy complete their own targets, with a feverish rhythm and a lot of nice things, we laughed and laughed, what a party! Music everywhere, as well as shooting, animals, crazy bastards, sex and amazing gadgets and inventions, all colorfully entertaining visual only. Pure cinema per se. A great experience to watch. And a special thank, as good comedies are so rare, and so great. Well, this one, and if you enjoyed the previous films of Kusturica, you will love it, though, as in all comedy, it is a chemical reaction, and you have to be in the mood for this.
