Hollywood's time to sit up and take notice! If the actors are calling, all you have to do is get the animators who worked on this little miracle. Renaissance, probably the first animated film that makes you forget that you do not see the person. Despite the fact that the voice-over on the composition (Craig, McCormack, price, etc.) are some of the best I've ever heard, but even then the emotions portrayed "cartoons" are nervous . <br /> <br /> This style of animation is not very new, but the use of light and shadow makes the film a live picture. Oddly enough, this technical magic makes you forget that it's actually a very, very good movie. Development of walks and excellent storyline and dialogues crisp <br /> <br /> The plot :. The disappearance of a top employee of mega corporations unravels the story of deceit and corruption with the cold heart of the hero at the helm. I can not say that much, not giving everything away ... except for the fact that while the film keeps you on the edge of your seat, the climax leaves you speechless. <br /> <br /> A must watch..even for 'adults who smirk at the "cartoons"
