This film is absolutely stunning. The new Blade Runner - Future Noir is very rough. Vision Paris well as well-known and far-sighted, with sweeping vistas, rough set of parts and a futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, with a few surprises, but that's not what I like most about the film. It is a visual treat. <br /> <br /> Made in 3D and displayed in black and white (no grays!) only one short spot color, less hard on the eyes than it sounds. There are many «Arty» camera shots - the plan and the odd point of view - but that just adds to the temperament of the film. Overall impression of the graphic novel in the form of video. <br /> <br /> I was initially under the impression that the film was rotoscoped, such was the level of animation and high detail in terms of the character face. But unlike the "haze" - suffering from (or even increasing) the definition of the controversial nature (just to see how some of the hair change shape!) - Renaissance consistent and accurate throughout. If the character is in close, added detail and texture can bee seen, but if in the middle of the frame or further details are left out, but not at the expense of determining the nature. <br /> <br /> For me, the only down side of the film is that one comment, we were told that it is a one-time project. Such a shame, as I would like to see more of this futuristic film noir plot and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style. <br /> <br /> Yes, and the English dubbing is too large. <br /> <br /> a whole big movie and highly recommended.
