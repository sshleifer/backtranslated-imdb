Featherweight plot and characterization doubtful make no difference when the film is interesting to see how this one. Live action and breathtaking stunts - per day - give this film some real zip. And there's some actual comedy by loosening the chemistry between the two leads. Quinn makes a good villain, too, although its role is completely in the shade. <br /> <br /> But do not be fooled by the rigid expanded role Maureen O'Hara, that as sexist as any Hollywood movie of that era. You could be forgiven, because of the time in which it was made, but it is still difficult to pass. For all the heroism and brutally adult voice-over situation, it is still a little more than teenagers a good time.
