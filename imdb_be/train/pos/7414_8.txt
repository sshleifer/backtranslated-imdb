It was a very enjoyable film. Humorous, but caustic view of the family and the obligations that come with it. Story about a man who comes home from his life in the city with his parents in the bath a small Chinese village. There, he learns to appreciate, even cherish the same things that he had left the house to get away from. The film is visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful.
