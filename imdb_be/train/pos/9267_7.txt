Not a bad movie. Somehow I did actually root for the Iranians to win the game, played in the film, even if I did not know about football, and I'm not a fan. The end of the bus was exhilarating. <br /> <br /> The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran, and they are not allowed to enter the sports arena among the people, because their struggle is not suitable for women to hear Despite this law, some women try to get into, but many of them are caught and detained. It is truly amazing that any society may still have the outdated concepts of gender. In an interview, Panahi said that his films are documents of history and its injustice, and that one day in the future we can watch these films and see how Iran once lived. It is hoped that the future will come sooner rather than later.
