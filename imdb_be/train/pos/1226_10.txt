They rented this movie on Long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extra in the film. Apparently, there is some party scene where they all drank beer (which they told me was colored water, the taste disgusting, and it was very difficult to keep swallowing again and again, especially in the funnel scenes). However, none of us had never heard of the movie release in any place, in any form. He never came out in theaters (obviously), and, as far as I know, has not been released on video, and I'm sure that has not been released on DVD. However, it looks like it was, according to some people, although it is probably very small. So there must be something. I really like to buy it for my brother, but there is no way I can find it anywhere. nothing about when / where / how this film can be purchased Does anyone know? And what a format that would be?
