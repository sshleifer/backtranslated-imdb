What a thrill ride! Twisted and thoughtful. Once again, Sharon Stone takes her drop dead gorgeous, fascinating character Catherine Tramell author flawlessly. The original Basic Instinct takes place in San Francisco. The sequel takes place in London, where Katherine is now relocated. Both bustling city known excitement of haute couture ~ and a great place for someone like Catherine Trammel take residency. David Morrissey ( "DerailedÂ»), playing the role of smooth psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass. The character played by David Thewlis as Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard, a refreshing departure from his role as Lupine in the Harry Potter series. Flashy cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor, stress - all "basic instincts" staggering around a great script from the highest opening scene to the sudden ending, this movie is not boring all the theater was glued to the screen...!.
