I will not watch this show. But I'm glad that I did. Critics just do not understand! This is one of the funniest and most entertaining things on T.V at the moment! Although, if the interview was done with ordinary people, they probably seem futile; but put them in the mouth of animals and insects, and this laughter riot. I laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes. Pig with suckling babies and her mother is priceless. The couple talks about bird health problems, and the male bird taking shit after his wife said she locks completely broken me! Zhetsony is the most imaginative show I have ever seen in some time! Hopefully, it will return next summer, when the race is over.
