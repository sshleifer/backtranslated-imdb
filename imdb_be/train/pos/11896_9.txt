I stumbled upon a rerun syndication of the show a few years ago, and fell in love with her. He is Tea Leoni and Holland Taylor and kept me laughing, one episode after another. I believe that this is not what makes it so great, and was canceled after a few seasons, but I think it was a good run, and would suggest to watch it ... if there is such a possibility.
