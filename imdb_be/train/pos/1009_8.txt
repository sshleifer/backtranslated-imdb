Fact :. Stargate SG-1 is cheese sci-fi TV series <br /> <br /> There's no facts stand out. How are you trying to justify himself or explain Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy sci-fi television series. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 makes borrow and steal ideas lively. Special FX is not as impressive as they could be and the action is not going to blow you out of the chair. Or a couch on the matter either. <br /> <br /> But, and this is where I really think Stargate SG-1 deserves credit, it can get for each episode or stolen the idea, which I think you can count on at least one cheesy sci-fi film, which is actually worse than TV episode in one hour. <br /> <br /> In fact, some episodes are actually likely to be 90 minutes long and was still better than most films. <br /> <br /> and being able to maintain this quality throughout the show and continue to deliver and pushing the story further, making Stargate SG-1 special. <br /> <br /> I am very picky with my choices. I adhere to, perhaps, one or two rows of TV in the majority and I think quite a high standard, which made me even more surprised when I found that he had caught. <br /> <br /> So for those who have decided to brush Stargate SG-1 yet another tacky sci-fi show, no. Stick with it and you'll see what I'm talking about.
