I guess I've always felt that the Hotel Du Nord was a studio estimate the movement of people and camera car was too easy and smooth unnatural, were shot on the spot. But no problem - it's still a very underrated beautiful composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems a bit choppy at times, as if they did, how they were, but because unpredictable holds the attention until the end. Money shots when two lovers one in my room burdened with some pretty unnatural dialogue, but it is so great to get to any meaninglessness can be taken. Are these 2 young men characters hopelessness cancer in pre-war France or just stupid? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if suicidees young and healthy with their lives before they would free you to think anything other than what they were simply misguided fools <br /> <br /> Arletty played the harlot well? - it is all that zipper on her dress engaged around anyway! I've only seen a few films with Zhuvom - he is the greatest invention in GDNE like a pimp - my problem is shallow: every time I see his face, I think of Shonen Haley Evergreen <br /> <br /> A ! surprisingly atmospheric, well-acted and photographed the film with so happens that you need multiple views to get all of these in place. Annabella and Aumont did exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perrier in its 2nd film was small fun part as gay. Overall: excellent.
