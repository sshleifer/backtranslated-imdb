Dick Tracy was not the best for many fans of comic books, because they wanted something with blood, like Batman. Dick Tracy plays the innocent just to be a comic book villains who have serious disorders appearance and be fun. Warren Beatty directs and stars as the protagonist who fights crime even without using supernormal. I loved the Dick Tracy since I was a child because of the comic atmosphere of primary colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie for someone to watch their children. Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson in Batman and Big Boy Caprice plays with zest. Madonna, like a baby, which is the second villain in this movie is not playing the same boy toy she is. As I said, there is no blood, obscenities, sexual innuendo entirely or hurt anything.
