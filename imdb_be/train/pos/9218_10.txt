Firstly, let me say that I would like to see this movie for a year, because I knew that Angelina Jolie was in it, and I love her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the film. In any case, no video stores did not carry it, but low and behold local library did. I watched it and absolutely loved it. Yes there were Italian stereotypes, but it was well done and funny. It does not degrade in any way. <br /> <br /> Each actor and actress has done an excellent job. I laughed very hard during sexual humor. Overall, I think this movie is worth a look if you can find it. It's charming and just fun to watch. I rarely rank movies as the 10, but I give it a 10 !!! <br /> <br /> Find it and watch!
