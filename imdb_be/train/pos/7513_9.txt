"The Notorious Bettie Page" (2005) <br /> <br /> Director: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> Starring: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson & Strathairn <br /> <br /> Evaluation MPAA: «R» (for nudity, sexual content and some language) <br /> <br /> it seems that every celebrity is currently receiving biopic made about his life. From Ray Charles to the Johnny Cash biopic now very chic. "The Notorious Bettie Page" is the last of them will be released on DVD. It has Gretchen Mol as the most famous pin-up model in the world, and Bettie Page was shot mostly in black and white with some exceptions in color. Unlike "Ray," "Walk the Line," and "Finding Neverland", however, this film is not going to be one to watch out for at the Oscars this year. The film lacks the emotional resonance is shown in other biographical films and many of the most dramatic moments in the life of Betty Paige or completely ignored or merely suggested. This does not mean, however, that this is a bad film. In fact, «The Notorious Bettie Page" is a completely entertaining performance and film - solid work of cinema. This film focuses more on exciting careers Page and a thin line between sexuality and pornography. He shot with diligence and care and guidance of Mary Harron captures the look of a period of time, as the majority of filmmakers only dream of. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). If you know her as an icon ?? or just porn star ?? you know it. She is a woman, who had a great influence on American culture only by opening more skin than find it useful at this particular moment. Now, most people know it as one of the first sex symbol of America - the legend for many models, especially Playboy and other adult-oriented magazines. She lived at a time when only shows one inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and Paige photo style Kabbalah was only to push the American public in an uproar. In fact, the photograph has launched a full investigation into the integrity of the Senate, and the difference between harmless and porn movies. <br /> <br /> The performances in «The Notorious Bettie Page" is absolutely excellent with Gretchen Mol highlighted. Her performance as Betty Page's just brilliant. I understand that when it was announced for the role, many people were skeptical. Her name is not one that catches my mind when I think of the great performances. Now, it will be. It quite successfully coped role attracted me to her vulnerable and yet deeply attractive performance. Strathairn fresh from last year's «Good Night, and Good Luck," in which he gave one of the best performances of 2005's. Here he gives another excellent job ?? despite the fact that it is slightly underloaded. I was shocked at how very limited time it was ?? the screen, but quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good film. Only performance I've seen from Lili Taylor was that in «The Haunting» (1999). While most people ignore the film, I found it to be enjoyable, if not quite shallow, horror, and I have always believed that Taylor was absolutely reliable as emotionally distraught Nelly. Here Taylor gives one more credible performance. It gives a very muted performance and provides excellent performance to compliment that with Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> After all was said and done, I realized that «The Notorious Bettie Page" can not be compared with other biographical films such as "Finding Neverland" and "Walk the Line." It is incomparable with that, because it tells the story of a woman and her career, from the beginning to the end. Her personal life is short is meant, but it does its impact on the world, which becomes the highest point. We watch a movie, knowing that the page will eventually expose everything, and we know that the impact of its decisions will be ?? but we rarely see the impact they have had on her personal life. She is a woman who has never looked back and can constantly reinvent themselves. In the end, it was an adult model was a Christian missionary. This film is not over dramatize anything. This could include fictitious moments Page sobbed hysterically and ask God to forgive her. This could show page and run screaming through the rain, trying to escape the ghosts of his past ?? and yet it is not. «The Notorious Bettie Page" tells a simple story, and something rare by today's standards. Fortunately, it's quite refreshing <br /> <br /> The final idea :. "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing movie with absolutely strange cinema <br /> <br /> Overall rating :. 9/10 (A)
