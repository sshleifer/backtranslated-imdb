After the comedy scene provisions so mindlessly easy that with her character at the same time to work both inside and outside the context of the rest of the cast to inhabit a kind of experimentation that comedy can really use. The supporting characters are grounded the show in the sitcom reality, which provides contextual counterpoint to the disorderly person Sarah, who, in addition to the general insensitivity is not any specific recurring symptoms to behavioral expectations that are based on, which makes it less character than the web, to be repainted in each episode, if not a scene. Sarah's ability to see everything from the outside perspective allows it to mimic aspects of social behavior, which are thin enough to tend to go unnoticed. Every time she says it's like a self-contained 5-second skit. She overemotes lot, showing the countless things a smile or a change in the vocal field can mean but never sticks to one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be met. This may be the most creative, original and experimental telecast ever.
