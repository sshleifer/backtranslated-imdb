If you've ever seen the trailer for the film "conscript" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you will never see this film. Unfortunately, the Renaissance was as revelatory trailer manufacturer. <br /> <br /> The history of the Renaissance of the detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and a medical researcher. Installation is a futuristic Paris, and science fiction elements are everywhere. The peculiarity of the Renaissance, however, is its visual style, not its history. Renaissance 3D computer animation, like Final Fantasy, but very stylized in black and white with ultra sharp contrasts. The result looks amazing (although the problem of 3D-animation of human beings still markedly from time to TOME: slightly robotic movements, slightly wooden actions of persons, etc.), very stylized, beautiful film noir, Renaissance succeeds stunning the audience, especially visually. History and write, although not quite on the same level of quality as the visuals. This is not a bad story (and, presumably, if you have not seen the trailer, it is much more exciting than it was for me). But this story is not very original, and the curb on the banal. Several lines of dialogue painfully banal, making writing sound like the first effort beginner. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend the Renaissance one. It's unlike anything I've seen before, visually, and I think one of his originality makes it a rewarding experience. It is also watchable history, even if it is not perfect.
