This is a short, crudely animated series by David Lynch (as he says in the beginning), and it follows the misadventures of the wilderness, in general, wearing a large man, with a wife who has a stress disorder and annoying son. Both of these elements are repeated several times in short episodes, and there is no real story is clear. It's easier if you think of it as a very odd little creepy Looney Tunes- with much blood, foul language, bloody violence, and occasional moments of fun. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD together with a rubber band, having previously seen Eraserhead. Do not look at this series, if you want artistic masterpiece- is deceptive. In fact, it seems to be almost a statement on such things as his rough style spits in the face of any kind of convention animations you can see. According to Lynch, "When it's funny, it's just funny, because we see the absurdity of it all."
