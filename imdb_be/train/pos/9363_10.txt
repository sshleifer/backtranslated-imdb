This film was a strange, this is a movie where you see it and instead look at other movies the actor you look at other films of director / writer. Sandler has done a good job working as a character outside of their comfort zone and always good Cheadle did a great job too. This film is suitable for a mature intelligent audience. Action was fantastic, and can be surpassed only by writing and directing the film. This film focuses on the real Americans, the last generation, without any stereotypes or racist just people who come together and realize the true meaning of life. This film is about the loss and cope. Instead, to choose in psychiatry, he defines it, not the one who heals you magically, but through the need to speak out your feelings to a fair someone you can trust will not judge you and will guide you though your thoughts. This film is all amazing!
