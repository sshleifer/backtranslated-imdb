"Invisible Mouse" wonderful and different cartoon Tom & Jerry. It has the usual cat / mouse chase and battle, but in a different way this time. Jerry accidentally falls into a bottle of invisible ink and obviously very happy about it, because he realizes that he can prepare a lot of "surprises" for Tom, to scare him, tortured him and confuse him. <br /> <br /> As much as it is strange, it is also very cool and funny to see that we can not see: Jerry invisible. It's funny to see things, took to the air, without seeing who is doing (we know who, right?) - this is how those things have their own lives, or even almost as a matter of ghosts. It is also fun to see some Jerry eating sweets and fruit, but it is invisible. I really like that instrumental music that plays when he can not see. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes on this short is when Tom sees the shadow of Jerry and slaps him, and even when Tom tries to slap him with a frying pan and Jerry says "Missed me." I also like when Jerry Tom chocolate milk drinks, becomes visible and with a happy expression on his face <br /> <br /> In general, this short has the basic components required for the classic cartoon :. Humor, entertainment, fun and some interesting works of art, too.
