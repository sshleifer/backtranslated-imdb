There is nothing more enjoyable to me than anyone grayish is unknown tale that keeps you guessing over how all this will end. And this is exactly what happens in the trap based on a frightening play Ira Levin ( "Rosemary's Baby"). <br /> <br /> In this, Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve get to pretend that trick Caine and Laurence Olivier was shot in the detective - with about as much skill and as many puzzles as ever existed in this very clever game <br /> <br /> But as it is meant to scare you, surprise you and keep you guessing. in the end, it's hard to write a review about the plot. Let's just say that we know at the beginning that's all you need to know about the film at this point. Michael Caine is insanely jealous of the playwright, whose last play fell flat. When a young aspiring writer Christopher Reeve sent him the manuscript of his play, Kane knows that passing it off as their own to solve all their problems and get his reputation back. <br /> <br /> From this point on, it is no matter of fun and games for the audience as the story unwinds Ira Levin, managing to trump Agatha Christie for the number of twisting. <br /> <br /> Caine and Riva pit with each other brilliantly, each of which brings a certain dynamic voltage to the story and some humorous strokes, which come from a script, drama laces humor <br /> <br /> To summarize :. Well worth a look - but not everyone is happy with the ending.
