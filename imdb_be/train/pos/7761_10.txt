*** spoilers *** *** SPOILERS *** Launched in 1956, and is considered to be very colorful while Circo over the top candy colored melodrama still a wonderful thing. The site refers to the oil-rich care dysfunctional Texas family, which includes older brother Kyle, who is dangerous, weak, injured and very alcoholic, played by Robert Stack in a very touching and vulneable performance and his sister Marylee sluty I played in the extreme way to Dorothy Malone. Statement by Ms. Malone will be telegraphed to us through her eyes, which she uses to show us their emotions, which is mainly composed of lust (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (to Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I've ever seen in a movie, who comes into the room, his eyes first. Do not get me wrong, its performance, to put it mildly, it is an absolute hoot, and is one of the high camp of existing jobs in the 1950s. But it is also scary, because as cute and attractive, like Malone, it is not a very good actress, and she is not able to subtly or shading. Its Performace is one note. It turns out to do evil Mamba, and in a large installation as Pope Loveless plays always a good Robert Keith falls to his death climbing the stairs, Sirk mixes it with an almost insane Malone makes orgasmic dance as she undresses.

Sirk who was a very intelligent man, and had a long and fascinating career in both film and theater in Germany, ended his career in Hollywood in the mid-purpose 1950s with a series of intense brightly colored "women's films" or melodramas. Despite the fact that they were mostly borrowed from the bad or medicore raw material in the hands of Sirko in them were masterpieces of the genre. Sirk had a great sense of color and design, which he brought to play in these films, filling it with widescreen space with characters who have played their emotional life amongst bizarre color combinations and lighting, pretends to be a shadow, and many mirroed reflections. The "written" characters are always out of the window, listening to the door or sneaking around. Thus, in the end, after much violence, accidental murder, miscarriage and a Sirk film ends with the final and strange scene in the "reborn" and reformed Malone in man-tailored suit, sitting at the table, a foundling miniature oil-well,
