I remember this episode as well. It was lovely - such a strong and compelling characters, stylish and sexy ... and so different from everything else on offer at the time - and now ... I'm sure it also inspired the great Canadian drama «Traders». <br /> <br /> And the season 1 and 2 seasons are available on DVD in the UK region 2. Its fun to watch the series again. <br /> <br /> Season 1 13 episodes, and Season 2 seems to be 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this seems to have ended after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> The series was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can get it on special at Amazon.co.uk
