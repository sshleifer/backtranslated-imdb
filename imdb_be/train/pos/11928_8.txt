This film, while at first glance based on the movie of the same name released in 1951, MGM and starring Janet Leigh, is still a great film. Danny Glover in one of his best performances brings George Knox, and down on his successful baseball manager to temper, to life. As for the film to be "stacked," as the addition of Christopher Lloyd (his stage experience, and can be seen in his performances on screen, a great actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Rock from the Sun), Brenda Fricker (magical and well-seasoned Irish actress), Tony Danza (but still it is good in this film), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the show in Dazed and desperate, and its role may not be as crucial a role in this film, but he got exposure), Adrien Brody ( what I said about Matthew McConaughey is the same for Adrien, except Dazed and Mural chi parts), some of the great character actor like Taylor Negron (by David), Tony Long (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Witt Bass) and a veteran in one of his recent speeches, Ben Johnson (of Hank Murphy , the owner of the California Angels), and the rest of the cast do a great job and a great story that is uplifting for quite anyone, I do not care what expression you have depression. I loved this movie as a child, and it brings back memories when I look at it today. I need it to DVD. I recommend it to any parent who is looking for something their children did not see anything else, for that matter.
