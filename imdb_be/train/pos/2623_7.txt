I actually like the original, and this film has its ups and downs. Here are some of them: <br /> <br /> Ups: Most of the original voice actors back <br /> <br /> Downs :. I did not want the voice of Timon in Ma. I know that she did the voice in The Simpsons, but this show is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Ups: We will see Simba as "adolescent". <br /> <br /> Downs: They wasted it with a slug-slurping contest between Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Ups: It was Rafiki, who said Timon of <br /> <br /> Downs "Hakuna Matata.": How FUIB learn about it <br /> <br /> Ups: songs again . (Some of the original songs were, but they were just background music.) <br /> <br /> Downs: But silly songs. (AKA Solo Timon in.) <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very good movie. I would recommend it for fans of the original. But if you do not like the original, most likely, you will not like this <br /> <br /> My Account :. 7/10
