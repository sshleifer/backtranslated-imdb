It's refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily, like almost any other American film, and then wonder if this does not happen. I like a happy ending, just as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's better to portray things in a more realistic manner, and I thought that the destruction of the palace made it very well. <br /> <br /> ending with one another in a substantially sacrificing other, thereby redeeming its earlier misbehavior, which has received them in the situation in the first place, it was very touching. I almost would rather have done without the last line, which proved that she is not actually doing business, she said, because it would have made the movie more about the friendship between two girls, and less about the crime. She did or not, is not so important. <br /> <br /> The most stories bordered on the clich√©, but the actress kept my attention with their excellent performance. Very realistic, very exciting. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10.
