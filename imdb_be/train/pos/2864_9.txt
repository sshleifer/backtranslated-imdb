It must be a joke around Bonanza how it was fatal for any women to communicate with any men Cartwright. In the end, Ben Cartwright was thrice a widower with a son each marriage. And any woman who got involved with Adam, Hoss and Little Joe were going to eventually die, because we could not get rid of the formula widower and his three sons, who began this classic TV western. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Bonanza were made today writers would have a revolving female characters who came from Cartwrights lives. People have a relationship, some are good, some not so good, it's just life. And we are less demanding of our heroes today, so that if the relationship with one of them are in the south, we should not kill a character from the preserve of the nobility for the loss of a breadwinner untouched. But if it is Bonanza has been done today. <br /> <br /> but we still expect a lot from our Western heroes and Bonanza, although it took some time to establish and change the viewing time from NBC, certainly helped, the secret of the success of Bonanza was a noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his strong sons. Ben Cartwright was the perfect TV dad in any genre you want to call. His whole life was spent in the hard work of building a huge Ponderosa spread to her three children. The children were all different from the person, but all agreed in a pinch. <br /> <br /> The Cartwrights became and still is an American institution. I dare more people care about this family than Kennedy. Just popularity that Bonanza is in syndication indicates that. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts, the eldest son of Adam has been written out of the show. Rumor has it that he did not care about the noble characters to Cartwright, who he felt bordered on Hypocrites. Maybe if it was done now, he would have liked better than the way I have described. <br /> <br /> It was only the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people get three television shows to their credit. Landon also has a highway to Heaven and Little House on the Prairie, where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, the hottest head, but the most romantic of the Cartwrights. <br /> <br /> When Roberts left. show kept going with the two younger sons, but when the great Dan Blocker on the left, the heart went out of Bonanza. Other characters have been added to until David canaries, Tim Matheson, and Ben Cartwright took the young Mitch Vogel. But the big, true, but a little thicker, Hess was the nicest of the Cartwrights. His sudden death after surgery remained very big hole in the family. <br /> <br /> So Cartwrights at the Ponderosa passed into history. I got a real taste of how America Cartwrights took to heart when I visited a real Virginia City. It's nothing like what you see in the sun watching Bonanza. But in the Lake Tahoe area, just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map in the opening credits, is the home of the Cartwright set is maintained and opened as a tourist attraction. As the 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, ranchhouse Cartwrights and real. <br /> <br /> And if they were not real, they should have been.
