If you love cars, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are some excellent actors in the film, especially wine Jones, with his usual no nonsense attitude and Hardcase appearance.The other is not bad .... <br /> <br /> There are only two small flaws in this film. Firstly, poor story, but people do not watch this movie for the plot. Secondly, the glorification of theft auto (car crime). However, if people really believe that they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it, then a good look at them, I hope you have a good time in jail! <br /> <br /> When I first read that Nicolas Cage was the main act the part, I thought at first «... Sweeet." but then I thought "... naaaa you suck!" but then, finally after watching the film, I realized, "... yes it sucks'S!». Only joking, he plays the role very well. <br /> <br /> I will end this unusual review, saying, "If the premature death of the offender is in some way enlighten the general movie going audience to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired them to change their behavior, this death brings with an intrinsic nobility. and supreme glory. We should all be so lucky, we can say that I say. "Poor us" <br /> <br /> ps - Angelina Jolie Voight looks pretty good. "The poor criminal."!
