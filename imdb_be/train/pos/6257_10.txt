This documentary Marian Cooper absolutely amazing. I saw him tonight on the channel Turner Classic Movie. I think I'll see if I can order a copy on DVD. Film footage does not look blurry and choppy as you might think since 1925 B & W silent film. Set in Iran in 1925, the nomadic tribe of people in the documentary to leave his home in the desert and cross the raging river, men, women, children, animals ... and then through a snowy mountain pass all barefoot. It's sink or swim and climb or die. In search of grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, and mules. In one scene, a man leads a mule, who is too ill to climb the mountain. Children in all documentary look happy and healthy. They had such a hard life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes of Iran still live like this. It makes you appreciate the modern life in the United States.
