This is primarily a chick flick, this romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between them. This film is the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes, I do not think I used a wire, or if they were not flat out outrageous. It is not very complex film is so easy on the brain, there is no need to analyze everything, to get a deeper meaning, quite simply, good chemistry between the leads, and watch the fun. I would, if they had done was taken the full potential of girls appear only once, because it can be surprisingly nice, but throughout the movie they keep it low-key kind of pretty. I watched it again ... with a girl.
