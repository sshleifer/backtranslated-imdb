Man on Fire tells the story of an ex-special forces guy with a drinking problem who takes a job as a bodyguard of a little girl in Mexico during a wave of kidnappings for ransom. At first he was not friendly, but then they make friends with each other, he decides to stop drinking, etc., etc. ... then one day, when she was kidnapped and killed ... ... <br /> <br /> And he will stop at nothing to get revenge. <br /> <br /> It is basically a story of a man on fire, but to wait for some great twists, at least several times, including the final, which is beautiful and will probably make you cry. <br /> <br /> It is also because of the great musician Harry Gregson-Williams and Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator) in the composition. <br /> <br /> But the most powerful part of the movie ... wait ... the fact is that everything here is perfect <br /> <br /> First of all -. act. Denzel Washington at its best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken good, as always, a great Radtha Mitchell and AMAZING young Dakota Fanning. And it's not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> Then came the cinema, which is dazzling, and with an excellent editing, should have won the Oscar for sure. <br /> <br /> In the history of this ... not just a revenge movie. History wise, the story makes you think ... nice and clean. In fact. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you have seen in your life, at least once!
