This film with a sense of humor, charming, and easily become a favorite for those who like light entertainment. Hollywood is not the place for serious history lessons, so I just accept it as it is. Bing, in his usual inimitable style, performs quite well as a blacksmith, Hank Martin, who accidentally transported back to another era, at the time of King Arthur. Beautiful Rhonda Fleming is exciting as Alisande or Sandy object Hank bias, although it engaged bold and formidable Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> <br /> I just love this episode, when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix), and Hank (Bing Crosby) dressed in ragged clothes and take the high road with knapsacks to experience kingdom on the first hand. Comment King Arthur, "I say that we are not alone" and giving his scruffy GARMENTS good scratch, it's one of those funny moments in the film. portrayal of William Bendix is ​​perfectly ridiculous, not to mention his attempts bizarre «Ye Olde English language. »<br /> <br /> The story is not deep, but it's done well, in my opinion, and I love it more every time I see it. it is a great fun for the whole family too. <br /> <br />
