Frankly, the film went over the heads of most of its detractors. <br /> <br /> In contrast, death (lost) saved (saved), and this film is one of the very few to deal with those two concepts. The film also explores love and frustrations that attend the father-son relationship. It should be noted, first of all, that none of them is currently fashionable theme. <br /> <br /> A precondition is that the parents are on the move, hit man Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman), love their sons and will do anything to protect them. But Rooney's son Connor even more evil than others. He kills one of the loyal soldiers Rooney to cover his theft from his father. If Connor learns that his son, Michael Sullivan saw him, he accidentally kills another son Sullivan (Sullivan and his wife) in an attempt to silence a witness. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decides he wants revenge at any cost, even at a very high price of death. Runite that in one scene he curses the day Connor was born, abandons his son Connor Sullivan, and hires a hitman named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney is joined by his son Connor on the road to perdition. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film, accompanied by his surviving son, the young Michael Sullivan pursues Connor Rooney down the road to perdition, and Maguire aims Sullivan. If Sullivan confronts Rooney in the basement of the church, and demanded that he give up Connor because Connor had killed his family, Rooney says - "Michael, there are only murderers in this room .. and there is only one guarantee that no one of us will see Heaven ". As the movie ends, somewhat predictably, one symbol is preserved and one character repents. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Tom Hanks, but it is a step out of character to play hit-man Sullivan convincing, gives a fine performance and uncluttered. Newman is doing well, as the old Irish gangster Rooney, showing the hard edge in his face and thus, his eyes haunted offenses Connor. Jude Law plays Maguire in properly scared. Tyler Hoechlin plays the young Michael naturally and without affectation. <br /> <br /> cinema has always played by the light from the darkness, repeating the theme of salvation and destruction. Luggage learned from a palette of shades of gray and green. Gray belonged to the parents and the urban landscape era Illinois depression. Greens belong to the youngest son and the rural plains of the state. juicy, clear and pursues music by Thomas Newman was weak Irish overtones and played Copland-like mechanisms. The sets were present average city - factories, church. House glowed brilliant woodwork. <br /> <br /> The advantage of the film is to generate a unique feeling with its deep in distinctive steps and enveloping music and cinematography. The only negative was a small anti-gun message slipped into the script in a film only nod to political correctness <br /> <br /> I give this film a10 of 10. Since it will be recognized as a great film.
