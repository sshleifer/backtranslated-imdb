This movie surprised me. Some things were «clicheish» and some technological elements reminded me of "Enemy of the State" movie starring Will Smith. But for the most part very good mix of entertainment with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and 2-wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (providing some comic relief). This is a film that you can watch over and over again, some say ... Wednesday night, when nothing is on fire. I gave it a 9 for entertainment.
