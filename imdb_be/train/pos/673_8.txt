After a great chasm, which we call understanding, there is still a lot we do not know that it was explained in the early tribal elders. In any case, there is a lot to know about the dangers of too much. On the other hand, there are those who warn us not preparing for what they warn it «End Time». In this film, titled «The Last Wave» aborigine native killed for no apparent reason. If the perpetrators are arrested, they say nothing less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays a defender, intended to protect the accused. While pursuing prophetic imagery of his childhood and prevented modern characters that are given to him in pretty native named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton continues to protect the breach as Tribal Law and, therefore, are not subject to the standard of justice. The film is rich in intricate, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end of the world catastrophes and warned about the future of the island and the tsunami of despair. Black drama and deep ritual that gives this film is terrible attractive and, therefore, is not for the squeamish, in fact very simple haunting ghosts can last for years in the nightmare of innocent movie lovers. Good silent. ****
