I have no doubt that the critics panned the film, particularly artsy fartsys, in need of a laxative. This is a great movie car in the tradition of Abbott and Costello or more recently Don Knotts. He will not shake the world or to change movies forever. What it will do is entertain. When all is said and done it is the most important thing in any case. Watch this movie and forget about their troubles. He even has a simple and good moral message at no extra charge. I've always loved TV shows of Elvira, when I lived in Los Angeles. She did not actually steal it from Vampires feature more than Vampira made from the original, Theda Bara. This kind of mythical character belongs to the one who does it better; & Cassandra Peterson makes it better. Long live Elvira; we need more of this kind of films. There's never enough. Villain, William Morgan Sheppard, also excellent. He sharpens excellent exquisite anger. I could not find any fault. Performing as close to perfect as an art form becomes. It has deep compliments for director James Signorelli, and all his crew.
