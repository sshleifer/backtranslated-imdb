Ah, clichés, clichés, clichés; They are the main part of a wide range of horror films.This one, replete them.Still, this is Stephen King, one of the best masters of horror. This film was really good, too predictable. A horror film is not stupid people? This one is full of retarded victims only practically begging for their lives to be taken. Pet Semetary I found to be a horrible little. The way things work was really scary, but not scary. For the most part, the action was a bit believable suspense is not that suspenseful, but the level of entertainment is set in a large rank; My eyes were practically glued to screen.All Stephen King fans should see this movie, but, as for anyone else, wait Satisfactory thriller.
