Although structured completely different from the book by Tim Crabbe, who wrote the original «The Vanishing» (Spoorloos) it has the same general feel for the style of the Koolhoven, except less business-like and more lyrical. Start of large, middle well, but the sting in the end. Surprise emotional end. As you may have read in several magazines there is some sex in the film, but it is all very nice. Never obvious, but with a lot of heat, and sometimes even with humor. It's a shame American films can not be opened honoust like this. Where Dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this topic, «De Grot" always remains within the boundaries of good taste. "De Groot" tells the amazing story stretched over more than 30 years. If you leave the theater you will be moved. What can we ask for more film? Anyway, this film gives even more ....
