I've always loved Johnny Concho, and I want this film was on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra gives one of the most extraordinary performances in his career in this. <br /> <br /> When we first met with Frank in the lead role of the film, he is the brother of the notorious disappoint anyone from the city at the moment. Brother strikes fear into the heart of the city and Frank to fully take advantage of this to intimidate citizen is safe and secure in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has no feelings for him. She is the daughter storekeeper Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two other militants arriving William Conrad and Christopher darkness and turns, Conrad killed Sinatra's brother, and he comes to his own city to take over. They humiliated Sinatra and run him out of town. Kirk follows. <br /> <br /> The night Sinatra turns from punk into a coward and becomes a man in search of some kind of chain. It is well acted performance, almost as well as his Oscar nominated role in The Man with the Golden Arm. It is a pity, for some reason it could not be seen for many years. <br /> <br /> Two other features worth noting Keenan Wynn, the former preacher turned out to be the shooter, which helps Sinatra find what he needs to get in the Conrad and the Darkness. Then Conrad that I believe the role of his career on the screen. He villain incredible malice, pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> However, I like Johnny Concho unforgettable climax, where Conrad and Dark are considered. Let's just say, I think Johnny Concho MGM was a response to the High Noon and the primer for what you do, when evil is a break down of all law and order.
