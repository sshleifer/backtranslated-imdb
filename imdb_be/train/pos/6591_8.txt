Invisible People is a show everyone s need to love! It reminds me of an old school 80's series (and the team, Airwolf, Knightrider) Special effects are small, but very effective !! but most importantly they enjoy shooting this series. It really shows! all the actors fit perfectly in there roles, and it looks like they can do anything they want !! especially Paul Ben-Victor and Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this one! for me it is unbelievable that the actor with the sarcasm of his acting style is not getting a shot at a big movie (Mr. Tarantino was the show, you should be directed! instead of large boring serious danger (CSI)) Get the show if you can. well worth it !!!
