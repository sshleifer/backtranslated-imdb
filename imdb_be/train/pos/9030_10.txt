This movie took me by surprise. My friend told me that this film was a "chick flick." Boy, he was wrong! This film has a great family attraction, no sex scenes as _other_ films. Jake Zhillenhol does an excellent job in a shoe in Homer Hickam. the supporting cast is great as well. <br /> <br /> Science, awkward age, family quarrels, the big train scene ... This film has it all. The soundtrack is good, although the valuation is very choppily. 50s film music starts on the edge of greatness. <br /> <br /> DVD, definitely worth its weight in coal. Replay value is a great - I've seen it quite a few times already.
