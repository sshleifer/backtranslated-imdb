The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with her. The atmosphere was what caught my attention in the first place. I expected Gore festival, but instead need to look very clever killer mess with your head a scary soundtrack (in fact it is my call at the moment: P). The fact that I could not predict when he would be killed and when he disappeared was a big plus in my book. Predictable horror movies I was bored. Now, I know the story had some differences, but if you're like me, you do not even notice them until after you finished packing movie in bed on criticizing what you've just seen a masterpiece in motion. And finally, as I said, the eternal soundtrack. This is one of my favorite theater scores, so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie leaves it intact in its remake. Speaking about the remake, I read a very comprehensive article about it and now that I know that Mr. Zombie appreciates John Carpenter, I have high hopes for him to take on this classic. This film is perfect for any time you have a craving for the spine tingling, but it's a great addition, a knife, finals, you name it Eve movie marathon gave all the saints. :)
