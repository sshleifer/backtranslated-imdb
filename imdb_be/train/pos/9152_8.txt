This is a good movie on the 99% of its length. I feel that this film is the ending occluded with a higher success. <br /> <br /> It was filmed in a rather naive manner. It is well done, to create a more frightening feeling of the film -. The sense of isolation becomes apparent very soon thanks to the technique of filming <br /> <br /> The terrible characters are very well acted and presented especially the "psycho" called Joe. However, the beneficial (normal) characters are a little too pompous for my taste - for granted, they have to come across as pompous, but it is a bit OTT <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly (and naive camera work smacks of Â«B. "movies to begin with) and very normal, but soon you will get a sense of impending atrocities that can occur. This is one of the most "twisted" movies relatively heartless violence. <br /> <br /> After a sharp and incredibly lazy end I left feeling frustrated. I would give the film 9 when the end was in line with the rest of the film, but as he gets only 7 on the strength of "eeriness" and nail biting his scenes earlier in the film. <, Br /> <br /> Give it a watch and excused the end!
