Halfway through Lajos Koltai in the "Supper" before dying woman asks a figure appears in her hallucinations: "Can you tell me where my life went" line can be strikingly theatrical, but she says that Vanessa Redgrave, delivering it complete simplicity, and the question of pulling out of the heart. <br /> <br /> Time and again, the film based on the new skirts Susan MINOT sentimental and commonplace, it holds the attention, offer excellent performance, and generate emotional involvement in several recent films have. With only six months of this year have passed, and now there are two memorable, meaningful, worthy films in movie theaters, and other, of course, when Sarah Polley in "Far from it." Hollywood has made "Evening" in a spot of celebrity car with two pairs of real-life mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and Meryl Streep and MAMI Homer. Richardson is the daughter of Redgrave in the film (with her sister, played by Toni Collette), and Homer Jr. plays himself Strip, while the younger incarnation of Redgrave is Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson and a large cast - yes, it could turn into a multiple star of the platform. Instead Koltai - brilliant Hungarian filmmaker "Mephisto" and director of "Fateless" - to create a subtle ensemble work with the "Continental feel" the story takes place in a high-society Newport, in the days before the wedding, which is fraught with troubles. <br /> <br /> Missed connections, wrong choices, and compliant implementation of social and family pressure, which is present quite a soap opera, but the quality of writing, the direction Koltai and unselfish way to raise cast "evening" above this level in the rarified air in English, French (and some American) sagas from the beginning to his present situation. <br /> <br /> The complex relationship between a mother and her daughters, between friends and lovers, with the addition of a complex triangle across all clear, understandable, exciting. Individual melodies are woven into a symphony. <br /> <br /> And yet, with all of the emphasis on ensembles and selfless performance, stars "Evening" still shine, Redgrave, Richardson, Homer (new exciting discovery, looking vaguely like her mother, but very different actresses ), the Danes do not carry a heavy load - up to Streep shows at the last minute and, of course, dwarfs. Dance and Wilson is worth the price of admission, too. <br /> <br /> As "from it," "Evening" stays with you at a distance, inviting reinterpretation of its history and character, and re-experience the emotions that it attracts. After two hours, the film is a bit long, but it stays with you in the future are welcome among the many movies that are cool long before your popcorn.
