This review comes almost 30 years later. However, it should be noted that I accidentally copy of this film sometime in early 2008 and watched it several times during 4 months in a row! I just had to write about it! I got killed and forget anything else existed, when I saw this movie. Paradoxical as it may see an ugly male protagonist literature depicting the most beautiful people! Nevertheless, it is desirable that the irony! It suits me perfectly, and more that Timothy Dalton did full justice to his role. He made a surprising and triumphant performance! I've never seen anything like it! All the rest of the cast very well. The entire film was put together nicely. I do not care what anyone says about this film. I just love it and I love it! It made me happy and satisfied. He breaks me a little bit to say it, but I prefer Jane Eyre in 1983, P A & E in & J, which I believe is the ultimate mini-series. <br /> <br /> Excerpts from Jane Eyre scared me a little bit back to school. I never bothered to read the book seriously know the story so well. Seeing is a special production made history come alive for me and took me to a near frenzy. Scenes and Mr. Dalton's voice haunted me endlessly, and eventually led me to read the book seriously, which, of course, a masterpiece. Bravo whole team and especially Mr.Dalton !! This film is now a part of me. <br /> <br /> I give it an 10/10.
