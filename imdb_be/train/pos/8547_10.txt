Many people hate this movie, but I blame on two facts - 1 - They want it to be too much like the first few American Pie films. and 2 - they try it too seriously <br /> <br /> This is one I have found the best one of all six, and I absolutely love Dwight .. The plot is predictable, I say, but the fact that the youth comedy NOT? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds, etc. etc., they are all extremely predictable, but still damn funny! I say this is worth watching, I love it, I think it's fun. Just do not watch it, comparing it with the first, because there is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> After watching the Naked Mile and it became apparent that all the American Pie movies going, and only that, in Stiflers. That suits me. <br /> <br /> Watch. Enjoy. Love. XD
