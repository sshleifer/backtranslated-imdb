The problem with this version of the film 1985 is simple; Indiana Jones was so closely modeled Allan Quartermain (or, at least, is the TYPE Alan Quartermain character) that the director made a mistake 85 robbery IJ films for dialogue and stories too deep. What you got, as a finished product was a messy mixture of named Alan Quartermain, unequal Hodge hash in cheap imitiruemoge IJ saga (with a touch of Austin Powers-Esquire cheese here and there). <br /> <br /> It has been called by many critics, was "a big parody" or "unintentional comedy." unintended word. This movie was never meant to be humorous; witty, yes, but not with a sense of humor. Unfortunately, this weak-minded, and not witty. <br /> <br /> With this new M4TV mini-series, you will get much more of the story, the character of your lead, a solid image and a fine, even fascinating mixture. This story is a bit long; far more than its predecessors, but deservedly so, this version has a real storyline, not only the actions and Eye Candy. While it is the action and Eye Candy, he also corrects an error made in version 1985 IJ forgetting all together and return to the starting materials for the AQ, which makes for a fine, and - thought - out story and some interesting adding sub-plots. <br /> <br /> Currently, this attempt was not all of the action extravaganza that Indiana Jones. And it's not going to be bad. This car is the story and the character and drive a beautiful rendition of the saga AQ / CSM. Filmed on location in South Africa, the audience provides a great (if emptied) perspective, SA Aboriginal culture, and some interesting shots of wildlife, to blend smoothly with the projections and the story here. <br /> <br /> Steve Boyum completely surprised me with this, because I've never been one to subscribe to his vision. In fact, I've never liked much of his work as a director, to the attempt. I hope that this is a new Vienna talent and less chance that it seems. <br /> <br /> This version rate of 9.8 / 10 on "TV" scale ... <br /> <br /> enemy's :.
