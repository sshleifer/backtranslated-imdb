It's a comedy of manners, so sometimes there is a gentle touch of bitterness, but the ease softens all the sarcasm and the irony runs until all of a sudden one time lead to heart failure and changes everything. <br /> <br /> This film, surprisingly written and directed, is a gem that shines perfectly, with excellent acting all. Jean-Louis Trintignant refined, as usual, and Romy Schneider is a gem, a perfect and luminous, that will be missed. Really great movie !!
