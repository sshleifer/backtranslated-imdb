Without the "mental anachronism", the film that I would find in the DVD offers an unusual diving into a welcoming and mental context of the opinion of the people in front of "disappointment of the world." That is thirty years old, the director and the script writer can test one such empathy and a true romantic to do it with their leaves masterpiece amazes me. It would be necessary to be able to see and review this film for a better grip than the temporal and cultural distance us to lose power on / understand, analyze, and, finally, to accept such or such an example of "primitive thinking". Since this idea preservation is almost impossible to experience in a secularized world, however, contain certain keys of our behavior, that their only future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance. If anyone knows where I was to receive a numerical or VHS copy of it or DVD ?? Thanks in advance.
