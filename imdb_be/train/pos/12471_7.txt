I do not know the actual events, when I sat down to look at it, just the fact that it was based on a true story. After the death of the baby's father, she tries to help her daughter Rhonda Desiree (... I do not know who is actually named their descendants) to cope with the loss. It really made for children, as often happens with the "family" clicks (the fact that, go ahead and get together to watch, although I would keep the boy from him, if you are not sure that they are going to buy the concept) but this is not to downplay the sting of the death of a parent is, and it does not really shout to anyone. The plot is interesting enough, and moves very well. Acting varies, with stunning Burstyn outshine most of her fellow actors, Mathis after that is pretty good, and Ferland and her colleagues (with some exceptions) is the least convincing of the bunch (and, frankly, they are annoying, but then again, I'm really not in the target audience for this thing). Editing and cinematography are standard, and certainly not less. Although humor is limited to a handful of funny lines or so, the tone is not unpleasant. There is an intense scene or two in it. I recommend this to fans of these types of films. 7/10
