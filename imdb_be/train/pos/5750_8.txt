But the rest of us who love a good sentimental and emotional story, which is the lock that you crying..enjoy! <br /> <br /> Tom Hals magnificent as Dominic, a mentally slow scavenger who loves wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and who work very long hours. <br /> <br /> Due to the timetable Eugene, Dominique lonely a lot of time and, as a rule, make dubious calls discretion. He really just wants to be a good boy, to do the right thing, and that his brother was proud of him. He stops in the church to pray at one point and express their emotions so openly and so well that the character you cry even really gets started before the damn movie. <br /> <br /> Do not going to give anything away here, but the film is very engaging and sad and heartbreaking. Those afraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story, her loving heroes and great song, I can not quote here, that has nothing to do with the movie at all, but it's weird appropriate..but you hear it in bar. <br /> <br /> I thought that Tom Hals will be nominated for this film, because it was for the «Amadeus», I realized that I could give him the inside track on actually winning. No such luck. Liotta as well, but has a less emotional impact, but then he does later. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis, she does not have many parts here, but it was nice of her to lend her name to the little drama in Pittsburgh about two brothers that you will never forget.
