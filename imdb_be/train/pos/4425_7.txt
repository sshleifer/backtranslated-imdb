Another attempt to revise the contemporary Japanese filmmakers chambara genre. Successful, but not in some degree. <br /> <br /> Buddhist monk has a vision that he had to kill the legendary (and very active) daemon on the bridge GoJoe, to achieve enlightenment. At that time, if not in the forefront, Buddhist thought is in the center of the film, as well as the "Sooner" Kurosawa. This is probably what made the film the most interesting to me, though it nowheres beside "Run" League. <br /> <br /> The stylish visual direction and a great photo to keep film is mainly interesting for two hours and eighteen minutes long. The leading actors are uniformly excellent. Music is really good. Two weaknesses of the story and the action scenes. The film drags in the middle that could have repaired the careful editing. And the fight scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close-up. This works for most of the movie, but the ending feels like cheating. Another recent film, as "Seven Swords", Tsui Hark great film, but I promise the fight scenes are disappointing. Asano did not move like a sword with a demon, its effect is great, but it will be an extra in the traditional chambara fight scene. <br /> <br /> A good movie, you're probably wondering is simply not "wait for the traditional sword fighting.
