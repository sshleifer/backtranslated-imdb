Summary: The next morning after his bachelor party, Paul to wake his mother-in-law to be, and discovers that there is a woman sleeping next to him. Unfortunately, his waitress from the bar, not his fiancee. And suddenly it appears everywhere ... the toll booth on the highway and on his father-in-law dinner. And it's hard to keep a secret if her jealous ex-boyfriend had he walked and photographed. It is not only about saving his marriage ... it's about survival <br /> <br /> Note :. In fact, much better than expected. Not sweet romantic comedy I expected, but something much funnier then with a small margin. This film is not afraid to take the joke a little further. And Jason Lee doing now, how to put the comedy, especially when his character is half-panicked and deep in trouble, as he is here. And he got good support from the lovely ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And actually I thought Locklin Monroe did a good piece as ex. <br /> <br /> So, more attention than the romantic comedy, and the end result was good. I enjoyed it very much. <br /> <br /> 7/10
