I really liked this film because I have a husband in the same way as the guy in this movie. This film is about Lindsey, who meets Ben in the middle of winter, when no baseball season. She falls in love, but when spring comes, she gets the shock of her life when she was standing on the step below on its pedestal that Ben put it on. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie with all the baseball obsession that Ben has. He can not give up what he loves more than anything, is what makes it so funny, and why so many women can relate to Lindsey in real life. In addition, the people he sits with baseball as obsessed as he is. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie, and you will not strike out, if you shoot it.
