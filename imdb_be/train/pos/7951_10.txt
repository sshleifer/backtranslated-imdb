It's really nice and sweet film that the whole family can enjoy. It's about two dogs and cats that are assigned to live with someone else for a while, but the animals do not understand, and they leave and go to find a family on their own. Cat called Sassy, ​​and it lives up to its name. Chance younger dog, who knows a lot about life on the inner side of the pound. Shadow older and wiser dog who feels things. Put these three together in an adventure, and it makes for a happy and exciting time. There are no special effects mouths are moving, so it is not cheesy at all. It is best to talk animal film that I've seen so far. This is a really good movie for the whole family.
