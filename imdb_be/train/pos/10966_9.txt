Gray Gardens is a world to itself. Edith and Little Edie lived in almost complete isolation, eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen at their (apparently) dormitory. Cats lounging about while her mother Edith insulting rhetoric of his daughter. This Tennessee Williams play come to life and should inspire the writer and playwright, as a strange overlapping dialogue and 100% real. <br /> <br /> The situation in the house reminds me exactly how my grandmother and her 50 -i daughter lived for ten years (except that they were poor and clean). They quarrel all day, my grandmother talked about their glorious past perfect while her daughter is constantly blamed her for lost opportunities as men, work and self-expression. <br /> <br /> This film is a must see for those who wrote the mother / daughter relationship of this kind. Sad and spying, but the filmmakers have done a terrific job getting Edies comfortable enough to expose himself so recklessly. It's rare to see a real life and all the more special given the context - the remnants of the powerful family of fading into oblivion in the skeleton of his own mansion.
