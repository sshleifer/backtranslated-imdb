Exciting film based on a true story about an Australian woman, Linda Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), who is accused of murdering his daughter's child. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is very suspicious. The film is really about the media circus that took place around the case, the way the Australians to interpret what has been presented in the media, and lynching mob mentality that ultimately led to the conviction of a woman on the basis of little or no solid evidence. I love movies that have questioned the media and movies that take a hard look at the way people railroaded justice system. I always thought that the jury should be given 12 Angry Men, before they go through their duties. It is not, as is often said, a liberal film, but a clinical perspective on how we, as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and the desire for revenge. Cry in the dark as clinical. Schepisi careful not to make a film on all melodramatic. Some may find the film boring or dry, but I found it interesting.
