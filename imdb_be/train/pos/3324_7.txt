Someone has mastered the difficult task of combining sports with romance. In fact, sports and romance go together like oil and water. Thus, in order to successfully put them together on the screen ... well, that is roughly the equivalent of splitting the atom. I never thought that this could be done. I'll be the first to say that in general I do not like romantic comedies ... but I love sports, and most of the sports movies. This film was a pretty good mix of the two. Being a supporter of baseball, I would really appreciate a comedy with Ben testing Wrightman (Fallon) next ardent fan of Boston RedSox. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows that the curse of ETA embraced RedSox for 86 years, and they know how nuts about baseball RedSox many fans there. Farrely brothers have done a great job of capturing that and it made for a good comedy. It was a very good film that would appeal to many.
