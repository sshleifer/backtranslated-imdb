Both visually and musically stunning. The pleasure for both the eye and the ear. Quintessence of Victorian element opening sequences were completely inspiring, helping to create a Christmas scene in which Dickens himself would be proud of. Technically, visually stimulating production and special effects are ingeniously designed and creatively achieved in a traditional setting stage. Dancing many of the leading artists breathtakingly good. Photos and first class lighting and sound recording perfectly matches the high general level of technical skills, which are used. A great movie for the whole family for Christmas and the most wonderful discovery, which can withstand repeated consideration.
