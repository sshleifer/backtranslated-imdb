I must admit that Purple Rain is one of my most profound guilty pleasures. Purple Rain not only broke the border, he established a decade, costumes, music, dancing and behavior! On this day, my friends and I still jammed in the purple rain soundtrack and pretend to be Prince and the Revolution. <br /> <br /> Now the film itself, I just meant what I said in the title, because for the most part, he made this film to music. Actions? Please do not let me to say that, as it is one of my favorite guilty pleasures, because I know that it is not Oscar worthy any means. But I think that the duo, who took this film was Morris and Jarome, their speech about passwords was just the oars. I just want to appreciate this film concert sequence, because I felt that this was what made the movie. <br /> <br /> The Prince is a musical genius and created great music. Although the film and acting very bad, this film is a pleasure to watch at night, and even dancing too. This film has defined the 80's, so just have fun with it. The prince would like it that way, only to party down! Oh, boy, that sounds lame. <br /> <br /> 9/10
