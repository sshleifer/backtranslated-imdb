Every now and then this film is released, no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short period of time with very little money and resources, but everyone is going crazy about, and it turns out to be surprisingly high. This also happened in the 50s with quite a few small films that not many people have ever heard. There are really some great unknown strange little jewels from the 50's to be digging. "Panic on the streets," another film in such a way that comes to mind. Both films, which are actually not as usual genre-clicking on the time and also are made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by how I ended up like this movie. It was really a film which got better and better as it progressed. Like all the "old" films usually begin slowly, as it were, but as soon as you get into the story, and it's the characters that you are in for a real treat with this film. <br /> <br /> The film has a very long history which includes espionage, although the film did not start like that. He starts off as this typical crime thriller with a touch of film noir to him. But Â«Pickup on South Street" just is not really a film by numbers, so he begins to take its own direction rather quickly. This ensures that the film is surprising, but above all as a very refreshing look. <br /> <br /> I also really liked the characters in this film. None of them are not very good guys, and they all its shortcomings and weaknesses. Really humane. In addition, particularly the higher performance of Thelma Ritter, who even received a deserved Oscar nomination for. It really has to be one of the greatest female roles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Even though some obvious low budget it is just one big, original, special little film that deserves to see more! <br /> <br /> 10/10
