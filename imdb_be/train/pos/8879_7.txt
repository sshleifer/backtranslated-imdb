*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie always seems very exaggerated, as I do not remember what my college campus was a former student, who became a German racist killer, someone committed suicide, also: We called him Benjamin Nathaniel Smith <br /> <br /> look for it in wikipedia- I added some photos in an article about it <br /> <br /> it's hard to believe, but .. this stuff does happen. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps and Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
