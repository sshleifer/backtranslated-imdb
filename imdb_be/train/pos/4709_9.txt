Okay - I admit. This is a movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He does an excellent parody of someone doing a parody of James Cagney, with charm to spare. <br /> <br /> supporting cast all hard working, and a step to the right and do a good job in this 80th comedy, a parody of Â«30s-'40s gangster films, he is constantly opening up new, with a wonderfully original material. (Well, yes - some of them have been copied since then - but when this film was made, it was the original, and most of it is _not_ been copied elsewhere.) Watch Joe Piscopo warn people not to do ______, on the one great slogans of deceptions. Watches Roman Moronie doing things with English expletives to make your teacher spinster laughter grammar. See amazing gags, such as the owner of the home store Johnny Kelly using the price tag gun at his puppy and dusting his kittens. See the most "warning against sex" educational film ever made. See the most amazing distortion of the Latin church done, while the guy who never took a class store assembles Thompson machine gun part. See the line that you would use in a casual conversation in the next decade. See Maureen Stapleton make the perfect antithesis of the hard-working mother, with surprise gags that you never see coming <br /> <br /> If you see the gag, which does not hit your funny bone, be patient. - the other will come within 30 seconds or less, and chances are you'll need to pause until you have finished rolling on the field several times. Duckies and bunnies? Them too. Watch for subtle thing - some of the gags may pass unnoticed the first views <br /> <br /> There are a few minor flaws. - but this is probably the best of lies. Some come close, but none of them is not entirely a good thing.
