Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason why it was so surprising was with The Ramones! You could not do the same movie and put something like the Sex Pistols, The Clash, or instead of The Ramones, it just would not be the same. Acts young Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Raven, Paul Bartel, and monters room, just added to the film. The whole entire film about The Ramones ... especially Joe! Thus, all shown and see Rock «N» Roll High School, when your a big fan of real-PUNK. Not very puny new shit ... but loud and quick look. View only The Ramones could do. R.I.P (Rest In Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
