Some bad reviews here for this, and I understand why, but treat it as a low-budget serial killer in the film, and you can get more of it than most. <br /> <br /> I thought it worked well, because after that I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower, so some degree of success is not it? <br /> <br /> I would like to say that there is just the right level of immorality here to get under the skin, although the action, maybe a little too uneven. David Hess only this brielfy so do not do not expect much if you like the last home <br /> <br /> In addition. - worth a look.
