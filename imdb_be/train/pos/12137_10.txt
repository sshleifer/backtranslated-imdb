How strange this film! I've seen it time and time again over the years, and I have always been fascinated by it. The reason why the film is so easy to re-watch, of course, the arrest of the performance gave the young Bette Davis. It not only steals every scene she is in, but it is actually much nicer and better photographed here (not to mention sexy) than it was in one of the films that she has done so far in her Warner Brothers home studio ( this film was made by RKO Radio Pictures). It is a very good makeup and has a very attractive hairstyles and oh, those beautiful big eyes (especially in scenes of the restaurant, which take place in London's Soho). Her body was so tempting, when she was young. Get a load of this in a cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard. And oh boy, it is an absolute powerhouse in this scene. Howard a little too nervous at all, but it captures the sensitivity of the hero. Frances Dee kills, as the sweet, pretty young Sally who truly loves him. Cost Max Steiner is both charming and bitter. The superior performance of the thirties and the taste makes it a must see version of the classic novel.
