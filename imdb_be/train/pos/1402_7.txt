Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> «Invisible" is probably the weakest film, Paul Verhoeven, director of great films like «Total Recall», «Starship Troopers" and "RoboCop" was never made. <br /> <br /> It's probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven stuck with a completely mediocre script, and he made the best of it. <br /> <br /> In the first part of the film is quite good, with a lot of cynical jokes, great special effects and even the Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the film falls flat in the second part, were degenerates into a standard slasher movie, or perhaps a very bad «Alien» clone. The ending is particularly funny <SPOILER>, Kevin Bacon keeps coming back to life after a series of incidents that have (in the logical sense of the word) killed him. </ SPOILER>. And the whole thing is quite small, in fact: the object becomes invisible never fully investigated <br /> <br /> But on the whole, Verhoeven manages to remain above average, and with this film .. <br /> <br /> ** **** 1/2 stars
