I saw a few comments here about Brando, using a Southern accent, some of whom felt it was a mistake. If this film was made, racism and discrimination have been very strong in the south. Jim Crow laws were still. Civil rights were in his infancy. Could it be, perhaps, was a subtle social commentary, Southern people in love with a woman of another race? Just like MASH was subtle criticism of the Vietnam War? Any thoughts? <br /> <br /> Another comment was made about Myoshi Umeki is "cold". Anyone who has been in Japan understand. The Japanese, at least in my experience, do not tend to show emotion in front of strangers. Were strict social rules, especially for men who meet single women. Americans in Japan were completely alien to this culture, and the stupid attempt to meet women were shocking for the ladies. One feature of the Japanese had to smile when embarrassed or uncomfortable that many US military took as a sign that their achievements greeted. Also, remember that at the time, represented in the film, Japan has just suffered a defeat, and occupation forces were treated with reluctant acceptance. I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very reliable operation, that her situation would be. Watching her interact with American actors brought some memories of my own experiences in the country. I was able to meet a couple of wonderful young ladies who, after I convinced them I was not a typical American man, taught me their language and culture during my stay in their country.
