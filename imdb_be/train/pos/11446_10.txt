It was during this time I watch this movie for the second time (on TV), and the second time, when I got into it when he was running for an hour already (I think I saw 2 minutes longer this time) This film really impressive as Goldsworthy looks at nature, it changes the nature in such a way that you yourself would never think, is really amazing. All this film gives a warm feeling to see how it plays with the world around him with so much love. Or just seeing his hands, covered with dirt and broken nails, it just comes to you.
