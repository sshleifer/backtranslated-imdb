Enjoyed this film in 1936 with a large number of classic cast of veterans and especially William Powell (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts", which plays a role as a doctor and a detective. Dr. Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur, (Paula Bradford), «Shane," and got a divorce and so far they have been able to live with each other as well as to fight all the time. Paula wanted to investigate the murder of her husband and did everything he could to convince him that this is very important. Jean Arthur plays a rather racy look and there are many Comedy in 1936 and the killing method is that you'll never believe it, especially with the jockey on the race track in California. Robert Armstrong (Nick Martel) «King Kong» gave a great supporting role as a bookmaker with James Gleason, a detective who needs the help of Dr. Bradford in order to solve this murder mystery amazing. If you see this film, just remember that it was prepared and submitted in 1936, and people in the audience at that time thought it was great fun, and it really was in those days!
