I love this film and have seen it quite a few times over the years. It does get better with each viewing. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it's rough and tough realistic life on the prairie in those days. I have found that makes a comment, as I watched it. Someone here said Rip Torn was miscast. I could not disagree more. He is brilliant, as the harsh, mean Clyde Stewart, who speaks little and is working as a managed / horse. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as widow Eleanor, Clyde, which employs as a housekeeper / cook (together with its daughter 7). Lilia Skala well as distant neighbors called her grandmother. Also Star harsh Montana prairie. It's so beautiful and tough country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are both repelled and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is not real! It even has an amazing perfect score and a great script. Once you see The Heartland, you'll never forget. He deserves all the 10s he gets here.
