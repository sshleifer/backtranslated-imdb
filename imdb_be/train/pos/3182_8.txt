Handsome and dashing British airline pilot George Taylor (solid image of Guiseppe Pambieri) gets beaten by hooligans after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with a sweet and virginal Dr. Emy Wong (fine and charming performance in perfect Chai Lee). George recovers and returns to work. If Emy hears from George over a long period of time, it flows into despair and becomes hooker. While director / co-author of Bitto Albertini does provide a satisfactory amount of the expected delicious nudity and evaporates soft core sex, this film is anything but routine roll in carnivorous immorality. Instead, it is a surprisingly thoughtful, touching and tragic story of love between two well-drawn characters and very attractive (Chai, like Emy Wong especially radiant and endearing). The picture begins bead and oars, but the tone radically changes into a dark and dour mood about two-thirds of the way through. EMY descent into the clutches after she mistakenly believes that George left her grim and upsetting; same great sad and heartbreaking bummer surprise ending. Of course, the story, of course, melodramatic, but never too stupid or bad. In addition, the sex scenes is quite tasteful and even the truly erotic. The notorious Italian porn star Cicciolina has a nice large part of the carrier as a jealous and relaxed secretary George Helen Miller. polished cinematography Guido Mancori offers many amazingly stunning pictures in exotic locations. funky, pulsing through Nick Fidenko hits to groovy place. Worth seeing for those looking for something different.
