My Super X-Girlfriend is one hell of a ride on a roller coaster. The special effects were wonderful, and the costumes were worn by Uma Thurman Hubba Bubba. Uma Thurman underrated comedienne, but she proved everyone wrong and washed her role as a crazy girlfriend. She was just FABULOUS !!! Luke Wilson has been as good as the average Joe, but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. supporting cast is also very rich, especially Anna Faris, who was very good (much better than in the Scary Movie franchise). <br /> <br /> Ivan Rietman did very well in the management of this film, because if it was not for him and Uma Thurman, the film would not have done so well. This film clearly 10/10 for this throw (Uma Thurman), the director, a script, and from its original storyline. very highly recommend this movie.
