I really liked this movie. I saw a few clicks of Gene Kelly, and this is one of his best. I would really put it over the more famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems that history is lost in the Gene Kelly's movies in wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this movie. It is definitely worth a rental.
