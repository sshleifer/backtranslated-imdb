Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker to reunite to play all the songs from 35 years ago, when they formed a trio called "Cream" Those were the days of psychedelic Britain and America, and these guys are watching him. All evil very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. they played a mix of rock and blues, and it was, for the most part, good stuff. <br /> <br /> Well, these guys are now more than 60 years, and they -prezhnemu can sing and play at a high level in this wonderful concert DVD disc shows us. I have always been very znao we Clapton, of course, who have never been in the shadows, but I do not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, neither of which I had not seen for decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so Gaunt he looked like a drug addict speed approaching death. Now he looks healthy, in shape and his drum game was tough. Bruce looked a little haggard, but his voice is great, as good as ever, and a pleasure to hear these old songs. This is just great stuff and performing from the guys who know what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Some people have criticized the show for being discreet. I do not agree with this. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song, "Spoon" was outstanding, the highlight of the concert for me. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended.
