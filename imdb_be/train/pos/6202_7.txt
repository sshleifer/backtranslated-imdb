When I started watching «Fay Grim», I had no idea that this was a continuation of the "Henry Fool." Now, the latter was not a movie, which I assumed as having a sequel. But one came, and it's very good. I believe that you have seen the original, so I will not explain. This one begins with Fay (Parker Posey) lives with her son, whom she had with deadbeat Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in prison. One son gets expelled for something pornographic toy to school. But this is no ordinary toy. He holds a secret that explains a lot of what happened in the first film. And this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than "Syriana." <br /> <br /> I have to say that I am very impressed by the fact that Hal Hartley made here. Maybe this one does not reach the quality of the original, but it certainly has a good look at what is happening in the world. And the end leaves room for other sequel. <br /> <br /> Also starring Jeff Goldblum.
