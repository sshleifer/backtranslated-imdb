This is my kind of film. I am fascinated by the strange psychotic nightmares and this film just. But this is also a dark comedy. While I see it mainly as a horror / thriller, there will be others who might see it as a black comedy drama. <br /> <br /> But in any case, it is a fascinating descent into madness. The ending took me by surprise, but the fact that the end! It leaves the viewer a lot of thinking. <br /> <br /> performance Powerful, complex and detailed story, great script, filled with fear and a dash of humor and creepy atmosphere make this film worth watching. <, Br /> <br /> Personally, I think that I need to watch it a few times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that lie within. But such a film, it would be a pleasure rather than a chore to do so.
