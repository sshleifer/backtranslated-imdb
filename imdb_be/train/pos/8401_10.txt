Love Trap "must see" an independent film. When I sat down to watch a movie, I came with low expectations, but was left with a blessing. The history of poetry is, in fact, and creative. The author draws you in further and further where each scene that allows us to connect with realistic characters that everyone can identify with. The film allowed me to reflect on my life and what I believe to be love. The film shows what love really is, the action is not emotion. I was also impressed with the quality of cinematography and the soundtrack of the film. The whole presentation has surpassed all my expectations. I give the film two thumbs up and recommend it to all people of all ages and all walks of life.
