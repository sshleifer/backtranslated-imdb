I am proud to say that I own a copy of the director's choice of 70-Crown International piece of cheese on a disk in the comedy of sexual exploitation of DVD themes. It's really stupid and pleasantly inconsequential film with good breezy'n'easy 70-vibe to it. It is a sincere attempt to make a point about true love and friendship be more important in life than the cool set of wheels and quick piece of tail. Of course, this is in fact a blatant teen male fantasy figure - the main character is a teenager goofus Bobby Hamilton gets the girl, the respect of his friends, and a chance to show up the local wagon-racing bully - but it is too sluggish, and easygoing hate. Stuart Getz as our clumsy hero makes for a dull lovingly lead Deborah White of the main object of affection Goetz certain cutie, horse Lisa Marie also quite juicy as the most beautiful blonde babe, and mocking Beefcake Neanderthal Stephan Oliver (a 60-biker movies perennial) strangely hateful how bestial arc Hicks. Pre-stardom Danny DeVito, in particular, is an absolute riot, like a naughty car wash owner boss Andy Goetz in lovably cantankerous slacker slush, which is very ugly loud Hawaiian shirts and suffers from severe gambling habit. I especially love the scene where two thugs severely beat up Denis - one holds hands behind his back, and the other guy working on a torso Denis! And Semy Jones insidiously catchy accident hit song will be bouncing around the skull, at least a week. In short, this is a great fun Groovy retro 70!
