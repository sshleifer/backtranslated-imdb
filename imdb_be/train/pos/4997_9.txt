This is a great film for any fan of Hong Kong militants. Asides from his little plot, weak drama and comedy bits antics movie action with a battery-fighting and martial arts. He kept me entertained from start to finish. I thought that was strange Shannon Lee in the film. <br /> <br /> With the action director Corey Yuen, which keeps the action going strong Hong Kong. This modern movie action is highly recommended !!
