I remember this film many years ago. Of course, the best movie on this subject in my experience. The fact that I remember very well that most of the film after such a long time, is evidence of its impact. <br /> <br /> It's hard to comment on the level of performance due to the language barrier. But they are nonetheless very powerful. <br /> <br /> This theme continues to fascinate us even with the passage of years. And it was most effective to treat here, with the proper proportions of the historical perspective and skepticism. <br /> <br /> I want it to be shown on television at least once. Or at least be made available on tape or DVD. Or is it? There are some archives of cinema accumulates a copy of this ??
