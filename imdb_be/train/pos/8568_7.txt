While it was the best movie than 101 Dalmations (live action, animated version of the Sun), I think it still fell a little less, that Disney could do. He was a good shot, the music is better suited to the action, and the effects have been better to do (compared to 101). The action was probably better, but then the human characters have been given a much more relevant role in this sequel, and Glenn Close is not exactly miss, as in the first film. She makes it shine. Her poor valet and sidekick overdone Furrier interesting characters to play off, and they add to the spectacle Disney has given us. This is a great family film, with little or no unwanted material, and yet it remains a fun and interesting for children and adults. He is bound to be a classic, as many Disney movies. Here's to hoping that the third will be even better still-, because you know that they will probably want to make one. ;)
