I'm not good at writing reviews, so I'll just spout my opinion ... <br /> <br /> I loved this series the first. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I thought it was brilliant. Anderson, Tie, Shanks, Judge Davis ... I loved them all. Davis seemed to be the fifth most important person in the cast. Not a big deal. But if his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, and character Anderson (Colonel ONill) moved out of the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. I do not know whether it is because Hammond More importantly, I realized that there, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned into a ****. <br /> <br /> In the first seven seasons, though, it was awesome. Stargate movie seemed mediocre for the first time I saw him, but it turned out, even if it was not the original intention, the brilliant setting of the series. I recommend you watch the movie and then watch the first season of the show, and then watch the movie again (you'll have a whole new appreciation of his second time, believe me), and then to watch TV series. <br /> <br /> in the last three seasons, the series is not as good as the first seven, but that does not mean they are not good. It simply means that they are frustrated when you first seven seasons got spoiled <br /> <br /> After you have completed this series, do not forget to look to tighten the series, Stargate :. Atlantis. This is a worthy successor to this brilliant series <br /> <br /> EDIT on 7-18-08 :. I just found that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss.
