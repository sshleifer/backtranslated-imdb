Very good for the finale, which was a huge disappointment, with the exception of. <br /> <br /> The script was very attractive, as the acting. Visuals were often very grainy, but it is so added to the film, as the snow characteristics were in good locations, which helped to create a mood in the direction of the film. It affects the very refute incredible finale. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie 8 out of ten, but the ending brought it down point 7, because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the film and seemed to have to do at the end, the filmmakers to look smart . <br /> <br /> This film, although he was much better than a lot of movies with big budgets and seemed to be shot like a home movie with some additional equipment. Not much in the way of special effects as they go, but for the unknown that was very good.
