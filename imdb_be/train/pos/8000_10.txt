... Dont read any plot summaries, because in the words of the story may seem trivial, silly and meaningless. The film is excellent, operating in both Denzel and Dakota (it will go high in the sky, trust me on this) is just fabulous, and the plot is terrible. In fact, "fabulous" little word used for such talented actors. The film is simply based on real facts, and some characters are entirely fictitious, a fact that adds up to the shock that I had the time and after the film. If you are fond of the two actors and a few rabid movie, you still do not look at your favorite one ... Believe me, in the end, you will have a wonderful and inexplicable feeling. The film is surprising to see it, rent it out, buy or whatever ... just do not miss
