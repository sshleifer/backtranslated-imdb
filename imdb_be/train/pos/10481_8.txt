Sweet little film that would even offend your grandmother, «Saving Grace», seems to be cut from the same cloth as half a dozen other British comedies of the past two years ... loser faced with adversity, finds the strength, to challenge and learns something about him / herself in the process. <br /> <br /> widowed and thus broke, Grace master gardener, and enlisted to help her friend / employee Matthew grow its pot. He was doing it all wrong, so that Grace helped him. They understand that it is a wonderful person to harvest the pot, which they can benefit. He likes to smoke, it must raise the funds to pay her mortgage. <br /> <br /> Highlight Grace travels to London to deal with some of its products, dressed in what looks like a white suit John Travolta wore in «Saturday Night Fever» and that sticks out like a sore thumb. <br /> <br /> Blethyn always watchable, and you can not say that about many people..well, I can not, anyway. Ferguson is very good, and brown checks, which I liked in «La Femme Nikita», memorable. <br /> <br /> Or is deeply moving and insightful, but very interesting and lively 90 minutes, feels like a walk with friends. 8/10.
