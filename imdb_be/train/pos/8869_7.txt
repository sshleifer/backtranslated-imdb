In this little movie has some great characters, but a very small portion. It's actually a pleasure to watch, because Singleton does a great job on the presentation of esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. It makes the viewer forget about non-existent realism, this film supposed to. In fact, what we have here all possible clich√©s and stereotypes put on film in a higher rate than soap. Definitely not a deep film (even if he wants to be), but it is better than the average college film.
