It can be argued that it is very good "continuation" is better than the first live action movie 101 Dalmatians. It has a good dog, good actors, good jokes and all rights are a farce! <br /> <br /> Cruella Devil, who had some rather large therapy, is now a dog lover and is very kind to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, the owner of one of the dogs, who once tried to kill Cruella, do not believe it. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (owner 2nd chance Dog Shelter) believe that it has changed. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Matz and his assistant, gave birth to three puppies cute Dalmatian! Ursa Minor, the Domino and Oddball ... <br /> <br /> Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (hilarious macaw), Glenn Close as Cruella herself and Gerard Depardieu in Le Pelt (another villain, the name should give a clue ), is a good family film with excitement and much more !! One drop of this film is that there are many painful farce, but not quite as overweight latest film. It's also funnier than the last film. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
