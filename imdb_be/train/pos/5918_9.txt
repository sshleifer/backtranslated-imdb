One of the most interesting films that will be classified as "black actors," Bakshi in «Coonskin» rich text, full of wonderful insights. He wrote in collaboration with Scatman Crothers and Barry White, who appear in the film as well. Racist imagery can often be alarming, but the message of the film was so powerful that the NAACP gave him approval (but only reluctantly). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the study of the all-pervading atmosphere of racism that Bakshi is trying to destroy. Excellent material.
