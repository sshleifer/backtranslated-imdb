I had no idea that this film was, until I read about it in L.A. Weekly. In general, I agree with the review in the LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film. Molly Parker movie stars (from my favorite TV show Deadwood) and Lukas Haas - who I suspect that we will see more in the near future. The film is funny, touching, especially the big acting, and beautiful pictures. I do not know when the film has a distribution, but I hope it does - will - in the near future. It is destined to become a true indie gem. it even has a music of my favorite band Silver Jews! The only disappointment is that Molly Parker was not there at the screening. even without it there ... it was hands down the best movie I've seen at the festival.
