Indian summers are warm, multi-character film that would make a great afternoon movie (with some editing). <br /> <br /> The film begins in the past with a group of children showed elk, which sets the tone perfectly before cutting at the moment, when a group of people from the "golden age" of the camp are invited to spend a vacation a few weeks head of the camp again, Uncle Lou . Then the film allows the viewer to spend time with these characters, they remember their time in the camp, and to form new memories in my last stay. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds in a great way that brings through his characters in this beautiful environment, and allows them the space to develop without worrying about the development of the plot. Reminisce watching these people, and their relationships with each other, the film is all about and why it works so well. She never goes over the top and melodramatic, always keeping its warmth, charm and realism. I've never seen a movie where nostalgia captured so well, and found that increasingly drawn in despite never been in one of these camps as a child himself. <br /> <br /> For a warm, nostalgic movie character, I recommend wholeheartedly.
