I can not say that this film deserves some amount of vitriol be heaped on him by some reviewers. Yes, it is bogged down with overly soft running time, hamfisted editing and over-reliance on cheeseball effects. And it lacks a lot of the comedy of energy needed to get the average member of the audience to sit through it, without checking his or her watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it also has some laugh out loud funny line of talented actors and the deposit, and the classic outsider premises. Macy, Stiller, and Azariah of genius, as the "core" of the team, and Garofalo Studi and do a good job, adding the conflict and the diversity of the team. I can not say, Rubens or Mitchell added a lot to the film as a whole, although each had a little chance to shine. <br /> <br /> The story, as I said above, your classic "underdog-makes-good" thing. There's no surprises, since you know that they are not going to win. That makes it useful not absurd , colorful heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interaction between the characters. By all this, these people are kids at heart who just want to do the right thing. the best scene in the film give the film its emotional grounding. Look at the relationship with Azaria his long-suffering mother endearing innocence Mace in his unwillingness to accept the mystery of Cap D personality. zivny on; Rage Stiller (not unlike this one weird, spazzy child you once knew, who would always go the creeps impotent rages on the playground); desire Garofalo, to avenge his father This is a childish belief that. sense of justice and kindness will always be a better world, the true appeal of superhero comics, and under his parodic appearance, «Mystery Men» shows us why these hackneyed comic trails matter to so many. <br /> <br /> He never really gels in general, quenching due to a huge number of immature podagovory (romance, family life, conflict within the team, etc.), but the basic plot of this frenzied fun that it does for this. The fact that it must be good, mindless fun, seems to have lost some of the reviewers here, so I'm going to issue a warning: if you are the type of viewer who finds pleasure itching and Scratchy cartoon ruined by an inexplicable and illogical ( "Can I believe that this is some kind of .. * snort * ... _magic_ xylophone? "), then you too literally, and a sense of humor for this film. Go to a movie Sandler instead. <br /> <br /> (7/10 )
