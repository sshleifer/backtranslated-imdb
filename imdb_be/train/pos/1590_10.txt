I just started watching the TV series "What I like about you," and I must say that it is a joy to watch. I've always wanted to see the new shows is not very good, given the many concerts go before you really get a feel for them. I watched, Amanda Bynes, since "all that" she really is a funny girl, that is the best of his comedy is that it's so natural, and what I mean is that it is something that a person can here best friend saying he was not rehearsed. <br /> <br /> I just recently started watching the show and fell in love. I just watch reruns, as it is now, but I'm looking forward to next season. All the characters in the show to give something to the entire storyline. Its nice to see some old faces from other shows that I enjoyed watching in the past, such as Jennie Garth with "90210" Leslie Grossman with the "Popular" and Wesley Jonathan with «City Guys». A new character is very talented, and Nick Zano has that charm makes you love him, even if he does something wrong Holly (Bynes). <br /> <br /> In general, this show has the right ingredients to be successful I'm looking forward to watching it grow.
