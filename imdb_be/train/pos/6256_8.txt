I may be getting ahead of myself here, but, although the film was a technical masterpiece of its time, I watched it, the question arises of the piece-part on TCM last night to me: Why do they do it? putting their lives at risk, many of them died on the march, why they take on a life endangering trip just to find food for their animals (!) as soon as they reached the "land of milk and honey" why Didn Â»T they just stay there? You would endanger his life, and that of the whole community, only to find food for the herds of cattle? As dangerous as it was to do that only for this purpose, showing the inherent simplicity of these types of people. the risk of death for a cow ?? Better them than me!
