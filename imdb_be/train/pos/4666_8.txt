This is a very tricky for all of the 60-ies look at the cinema. Humor is quite fragile, but it grew on me more than I expected. Throw the first class and they seem to be having a great time. Ustinov travels through the film muttering some pretty interesting things under his breath, and all this is very insignificant; I will buy this movie as soon as it comes out on DVD. The plot that Ustinov as the embezzlers released from prison, creating as a computer whiz and squandering the money of the American company with an office in London. Maggie Smith, his secretary for a while, watching her fired from many jobs is part of the fun. Newhart his usual indifferent self, and Karl Malden fun as tastes and untidy office executive working in London. The ending is funny and beautifully cynical.
