What a lovely fuss ?? very well-made film that has so much charm and optimism factor that many romantic comedies are missing. Einstein spoke brilliantly by Walter Matthau, while Katherine Meg Ryan Unforgettable ?? better than I had seen her in these films opposite Tom Hanks ?? as a young mathematician of all forces to be recognized. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a young woman, to understand the struggle of Catherine and immediately feel sympathy for her, and as a young man, it is easy to understand what should be passed (Tim Robbins) Ed mind in reaching its true love. There's a universal appeal in these emotions, even if IQ keeps all this light, fun and beautifully tied. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is not difficult, but if you look, there are some overtones. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, yet he was a great spirit; his statements, such as something along the lines of, 'If this is not possible, then why do it? It suggests that he is a believer in the performance of higher goals beyond their immediate reach. In this film, there are questions that the accident actually ?? such as whether the intervention of Albert and their foolish conspirators in prying Catherine of stiff upper guby-, disliked James (Stephen Fry ?? who gives this otherwise cardboard character's life, and you can not help but feel his lack of feeling) calculations. How the intervention takes place in our lives that we do not see, and comes across as a fluke? <br /> <br /> And, of course, we would like to think, in the real world, despite the fact that we often see people we know we get Edwards Catherines and Jameses must learn to defrost water from ice in their veins. How nice to know that it can work in an innocent (and disturbingly, only Caucasian) Eisenhower-era land IQ of fun.
