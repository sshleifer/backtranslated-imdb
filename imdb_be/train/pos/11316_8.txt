(Some spoilers) I have not read the novel by James M. Cain ( `The Postman Always Rings Twice"), on which this film was based, so I can not compare this version of the movie to it, but I've seen and like 1946 US version (also under called `The Postman"). <br /> <br /> Better yet, this gem of Italy, which I read was 'spoiled' in editing because too many blatant references to the fascist regime. Well, it does not matter ?? what is left, it is a great piece of cinema, apparently, a harbinger of the movement of neorealism in cinema. Of course, you can understand why ?? despite the fact that the severe editing had to go further, and a pervasive sense of social and cultural, as well as private oppression is hanging heavy on the main characters, who thus face many restrictions in life. <br /> <br /> Consider Gina, a young playboy and not well educated, unemployed, and referring to stowing away, stealing, and cheating people to get away from it a pair of shoes, as worn to be practically useless. <br /> <br /> in Giovanna, he sees a way out, but he would have kept going, like Giovanna oppressed her loveless marriage to an older man with money, her work (work in a trattoria for her husband, slaving away for the bar and in the kitchen), and its floor. In the past, she had limited options, and decided to marry the restaurant / gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa) in any case, knowing that it will not make her happy. She tells Jin that she feels sick every time Bregana touches it. <br /> <br /> Under the pretext of helping Bregana fix your car and send it to the village to buy the required part (which he actually scored), Gina wins favor Bregana (in perspective as to fix the broken water pump water symbolizes ?? life, or lack thereof), and is left alone with Giovanna. They immediately begin heating, hot but volatile love. <br /> <br /> Gina soon feels suppressed relationship and feel the need to move again when Giovanna offers them to dispose of her husband. Wanting no part of Gene leaving town on a train ride that he can not afford, kindly paid for it other types of gypsy man named Spagnolo, a passenger train employee. For Gina, Spagnolo is a kind of freedom, and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes morality and conscience Gina), travel and find work at the carnival together. Finally, Gina has a steady job. To her horror (it is not over his love for Giovanna), a month has passed when Bregana and his wife to go to the carnival and Bregana persuaded Gina to go 'back home' to live and work with them again, because it is convenient to have around . <br /> <br /> Too gutless to resist, knowing that it will reunite it and Giovanna, Gina agrees and returns to stay with the couple. After a while it lends itself to the requirements of Gina to get rid of her husband. After an evil deed done, Giovanna becomes more conscious than ever, seemed to be very little conscience, while the feeling of guilt and shame corrode Gina human pain, who never did him any harm. As much as he wants to leave her ?? he was again short, now they are inextricably linked, and must face the consequences. <br /> <br /> I like the way the character back to life Spagnolo Gina, to act as a judge of his misdeeds ?? that was very good and interesting, adding another dimension to the story. <br /> <br /> While 46 US version Lano Turner and John Garfield gets a bit lost in the quagmire of the peripheral characters, especially the police and lawyers, Ossessione not good to focus much more on the psychological impact of the crime on one amateur. This gives the end result even more potency and makes a powerful statement reinforces helplessness inherent in a society in which the characters have to live <br /> <br /> minor quibbles :. The amount of time (hardly any), which passes in front of the immortal love pronounce amateur, how fast they kill the husband (NO unsuccessful first attempt, in the US version); Gina quickly to defuse the relationship with the dancer / prostitute ?? they quickly practice their love, as well, and she's ready to risk a lot for a man she just met! ?? all pretty unreal, is not it? I found this time frame the problem completely distracts ?? it made me think that I have missed something somewhere. Otherwise, should the viewer time. Action and direction were both equally good in everything. Recommended.
