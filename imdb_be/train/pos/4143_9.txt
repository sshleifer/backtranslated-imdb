No, I'm not kidding. If you ever, ever have a chance to see the movie to see. If you need to cut out to see him, to see him. It's worth it. <br /> <br /> Fatty Drives Bus unlike any film you've ever seen. He picks up the trash cinema and build it into a work of art. While it contains bad frames, idiotic character, bad dialogue, strange behavior, and the cinema, which relies on public access in Iowa, he actually succeeds in its purpose as a film. It aims to be blunt, more surprising, the most pointless movie you've ever seen. And boy does it ever succeed. <br /> <br /> I will lay out the plot for those of you who worry about such things (the filmmakers obviously did), but in fact you do not need to pay too much attention, because the plot of the film presented in a very long a piece of text to play the opening credits. In any case, FDTB (as her supporters call him) a bus tour through the history of Chicago, who led by Satan. You see, Jesus is in the city, and all the bus passengers have to die, and all their soul would go to hell except Jesus in the city, a footman in hell withdraws its work, and it angers Satan, because, as he did not want to look like a fool in front of a guy, so he decides to get a person on the bus sign their soul to him directly, but he is the devil, so he needs to disguise himself, otherwise who would go on tour with them in order so that he disguises himself as Roger, and he gets on the bus, where the driver is never mentioned by name, but he kind of fat, so I think he's thick. Bus (and riders) are on a collision course with wackiness <br /> <br /> Examples of some faint: name is repeated 3 times on the screen. I do not know why. by bus to the middle of the trip is a character with no explanation or introduction, as from time to time sitting next to the other, and they look at it like it does not belong. I do not know why. Two characters, fall in love and exchanging longing glances that are actually the same frames are repeated again and again. I do not know why. After Satan gives minute long monologue about the transformation in human form name flash cards, "Satan is going to be transformed." I do not know why. One sign of a woman who is very obviously a man in clothing, and is referred to by other characters as "glam Bridget." I do not know why. <br /> <br /> If there is one good thing that came out of my experience in the Troma last summer he got my own copy of Fatty bus wheels.
