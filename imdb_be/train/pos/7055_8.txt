Although Cinderella entirely obvious choice to continue I love JAQ and Gus, so I did not hesitate. Format mice writing books for Cinderella was an inspired one. I love to write stories myself, and I hope that the children will be inspired by it. Three stories, cute and funny, but the songs were forgotten. Jacques and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also loved seeing Lucifer, Bruno, mice choir and everything. Pom Pom was the ideal companion for Lucifer, and I liked the governess. A sequel done right for a change. My rating 8/10.
