This film was just Absolutly brilliant. It really made me think. Throughout the film, I was confused as hell. I loved everything about it ... it was so confusing and so twisted and weird, it was hard not to love him. All the actors were phenomenal, and nobody could have done better ... This is one of my favorites of the year ... he deserves ocar.
