Film era of sexploitation in the late sixties and early seventies began with the view of gratuitous nudity in conventional films and ended with the legalization of hardcore. It's peak years were between one thousand nine hundred sixty-eight and 1972. One of the most popular and talented actresses of that era was Monica Gayle, who was a small but fanatical cult following. It was in fact able to act, unlike many who filled the leading roles of these films, and her subsequent loans proved it. And it seems to be a deliberate fading into obscurity right when her career took off only enhances its mystery <br /> <br /> Harry Graver, the director, was also a talent. probably too talented for the sexploitation genre, and his skill, combined with the presence of the screen Monica Gayle, makes Sandra exercise by women, nice pleasant experience. The film never drags and will not press your finger on the button to fast-forward.
