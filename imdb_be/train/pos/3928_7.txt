Of course, it was a good shot and did very well filmed and done! But the story was so weak. And Lincoln's image was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was not good, but the character he played was not nothing but insane. Do you want me to say that Lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect for the law or the court. I mean, who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinny? I mean come on, "I'll just call you when Jackass" ???? I know that Ford is going for the big funny guy hero, but I do not like this guy at all. He cheat in sport, says, like a sweet simpleton and do not seem to know, we had to sit in the hall of the court. How should I take this seriously. <br /> <br /> turn was even weaker. I mean come on! It was just stupid. All this history, it seemed that it was invented about 5 years in their dreams. To say that I liked enough, it was very interesting and made me laugh a few times, so I can not say that this is a bad film. In fact, I must say that I have to say that it is good enough, nothing that amuses me and makes me can laugh to be bad, but it's bright and silly plot was just so funny that I can not understand how someone could I would consider it great. <, Br /> <br /> I have no idea how historically accurate the movie was, but if any of this were true, I would really shake her head.
