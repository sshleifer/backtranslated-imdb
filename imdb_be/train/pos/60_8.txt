"Home Room" as "the Zero Day" and "elephant", was inspired by the recent spate of school shootings. But unlike the other two films, «Home Room» focuses on two survivors (non shooters or killed) in the aftermath of the shooting. Making it less exploitative, and more useful, because little effort is spent asking questions to which there are no answers. <br /> <br /> Do not give up on this little film for the first 20 minutes, will be installed to the real story, but plays like a rejected episode «Hill Street Blues». He limps, but carries with it, at least, run the length of the pads is sufficient to obtain a film is classified as a special feature. I recommend to skip it entirely and just jump forward in the hospital scene, there is nothing that you can not take away from the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> How many good little film it was a creative one man show as Paul F. Ryan was as a writer and director. While this mechanism does not guarantee a good movie, usually a good sign, because it would mean a certain unity of design and execution, which is often lacking in the big budget drama opportunities. Because the script «Home Room» is its real strength of this happiness that the author has also performed the production and insured that his vision has made it to the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan takes a big chance with the end of which is testing the limits of tolerance of sentimentality average viewer. He runs it right to the edge, but contrary to the logic leaves you instead of blatant servility. Why the end of the work of some combination of audience need for compensation at the end of this kind of travel, the song ( «Sweet Surrender» Sarah McLaughlin), he goes on and amazing editing the last minute. <Br /> <br /> another strength of the film is cast Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Din) as the main characters. Although Phillips plays its standard alienated surly teenager and her intelligent daughter Kristensna good family, they both bring a greater intensity of their roles than ever before. The family life of both women is more than satisfactory, and little interest in Ryan. What is happening here is all about the two of them, in spite of the lame side of the story of a detective wondering around the city trying to tie Alicia lone shooter. If they are ever again to cut and trim film from this side of the story has to be compressed. <br /> <br /> A tale of two very diverse women bonding and helping each other, is hardly a new idea, and Ryan could easily controlled in this movie clichés and predictability. But instead of his script of their participation in an exciting and compelling sparring, slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability, only to retreat back inside. "I'm dying inside," Dina line just tearing you apart, I can not think of a moment in any other film that I felt as strongly as he. She desperately needs that connection Alicia just as fiercely resistant. Diana only makes progress when it recedes. The viewer keeps waiting arms of a group that never seems to happen. <br /> <br /> In the end it is not only creates a lot of uncertainty, but leaves you marveling at both the character and the two actresses who brought them to life. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
