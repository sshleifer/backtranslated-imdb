Domino is an excellent film. It is about a young woman names Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley), who becomes a hunter hired for its melancholy and its way of life. It connects with two other hunters (Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez), and adventures begin. a good script. Very down to earth and realistic tone to the film. The only problem I had with this film, it focuses on a variety of things that they do, rather than the nature of Domino. <br /> <br /> Even though Kiera Knightley gives a fierce performance. It shows the right amount of anger and self-sacrifice in this performance. Mickey Rourke watching his performance in the Oscar Worthy «Sin City» on the other tough guy performance. Edgar Ramirez does not really do anything but speak Spanish every once in a while and look at Kiera. Lindoi Delray offers a good supporting performance. Mo'Nique was herself, although it surprises me in one particular scene. Lucy Liu has great chemistry with Keira Knightley in her scenes with her. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film, though, is the direction. rapidly evolving style of Tony Scott really brings the film to life. Directing some of the best I have ever seen. He takes a regular cinema and dresses acid. All blacks are blacker, whites are bright and looks like a green glow to it. Scenes are exciting <br /> <br /> Overall :. If you like Sin City & Man in the fire, you like Domino.
