I watched this film after seeing it on Broadway. I love the Broadway musical, and I love the movies. I watched the film, as it was not related to Broadway shows. I am an avid reader and have seen what happens to the majority of the books, when they turn into a movie, so I developed a philosophy very early. Suppose that the film will be based on the book (Musical or in this case), but while the story line may be similar to it will not be the same, it will be different because look at what it is. <, Br /> <br /> I danced for 12 years before I had to make a choice. I was a good dancer (picking up the chorus work in local productions as a child, etc.), but I was not super talented.I was, however, a super talented rider the show. I was told that my dance instructor, and my coach (which I spent several months a year on his farm with the state), that I had to make a choice when I was 14. What do I need to go from four to two o'clock dancing five days a week, and driving 3 hours a day, 7 days a week .. and to devote one or the other. So I love dancing and I love this movie and many other ballet and dance films. I just wanted to see this movie for what it is, it is a great film about raw emotion and human interaction. We are talking about the power of foresight and sorrow, if you work really hard to get what you want, and you just do not get it. I love movies. I love the Broadway musical.
