What about Mr. Moore? He is the godfather of rap, he is the king of cinema Z-level black actors, and here he is again, as his most famous character, Dolemite! Can you dig it? This film is one whacked out a roller coaster ride politically incorrect humor, trippy kung fu, poverty, cheese, violence, and a lot of other things, you will never find in most modern movies (or any films, actually, haha!) . Standing routine it provides early on not to be missed! Anyway, D2, of course, an interesting way to spend an hour or so. Dolemite: Â«He thinks he's bad and did not get entirely Class I gon 'rock this shotgun to it * beep * and **! "
