My sister and I rented this movie because we were in the mood for something rubbish and not very demanding to watch. However, the film far exceeded my expectations very low. <br /> <br /> This is much more than just an idea of ​​the century. It has a very real images of the characters within it, and most of the actors are doing a terrific job. Various stories are baked together with actual footage from the time, which gives him a unique bond. Watching it, I really felt that I cared about what happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> I would also like to praise the infinite number of Julia Stiles in her drawing Katie, she was great, so that stood out! <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone ..
