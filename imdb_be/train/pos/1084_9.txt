Musings: Pure delight from start to finish. Do not laugh riot, but more subtle, sophisticated humor. What a treasure trove of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr .. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant is in the building of his new house, which at the time being framed. Young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants to be «lallies be rabbeted», or some things that only a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to seem to the uninitiated, it responds positively. At the same time, Barker yelling to his companions, «OK boys, he wants to 'em rabbeted, so .... pull" EM OUT! »After a moment you hear the sound of ripping and tearing around 20 large nail pull from different boards. All Grant could do was moan. <br /> <br /> So, the film is dated. You will never see that many carpenters work at once on a single family, and a place like this, in Connecticut all places likely to run to several million dollars. <br /> <br /> A classic film, which is really a treasure.
