It was a beautiful film. A real sense of a good movie when you need to. The history of the world (it is not Gone With The Wind), but sometimes you need this kind of story. Funny and warm characters, fantastic acting and beautiful costumes / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. heating (also from the TV show ER) is perfect in the role. It is certainly a new bright star in Hollywood. Everyone should keep an eye on her, she will be BIG in the future. <br /> <br /> Also impressive was the soundtrack for this film. A good mixture of modern tunes and indian. I danced for most of the film. <br /> <br /> It is recommended that if a movie is fun that you need.
