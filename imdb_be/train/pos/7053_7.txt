Do not confuse «War Inc.» for the sharply precise satire or brainy comedy, full of inside joke for news buff. This is not so. <br /> <br /> This is an old-fashioned eccentric comedy with ludicrous plot twists matched, roles (including some depth in the cheerful performances by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hilary Duff) and a simple approach to the political content. <br /> <br /> You see, the political point of filmmakers things almost all countries already knows are true. Yes, we understand that corporations Profiting stop fighting the corrupt, incompetent pig, political leaders responsible for it even more inept buffoon, and US imperialism has never looked crasser and more detached than it does now - but none of this is a ' It is the point <br /> <br /> that's all that noise is a parameter which they lampoon. - sometimes ingenious ways - as a backdrop for a silly fuss, as a symbol of John Cusack (the hit -man heart) is trying to change their lives with the help of a benefactor of the journalist, who did not trust him (Tomei) and young sterlet Middle East who want to withdraw their marriage ( duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays his assistant with the almost caricature quality of enthusiasm. Ben Kingsley, I thought, unused in its lower part, as a ruthless CIA boss. <br /> <br /> That's all, and it works. It's just fun, but if you like something you can not see the reality, and you think that the war is going well, and all participants with him doing a good job, and there is no corruption and the people in the Middle East want our Western culture to displace them, then you might not find it funny. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, it was a light comedy with a political edge.
