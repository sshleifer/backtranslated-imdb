"Enter the Fat Dragon» is one of the funniest martial arts movie I had the opportunity to see. Hung summit reflects the Chinese farm boy who comes to visit another city. Just as Tang Lung with the "Way of the Dragon." Everywhere, where the summit is, the trouble begins, so it must rely on their fighting skills of art to solve differences. Fortunately, the hero of the summit to learn martial arts, mimicking and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. He even stroked his nose with your finger just like Bruce Lee makes and releases its screeching cry. It also uses Nunchucks in the scene. It was like a fat Bruce Lee. There's excellent showdown towards the end of the film, which is composed of foreign fighters. The summit must face each opponent one by one. Kind of like "Game of Death", where every soldier has a different martial arts disciplines from each other. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that I really enjoyed watching, as well as the very first films of Sammo Hung I «ve seen. Excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughter. Rare classic film Sammo Hung, I strongly recommend to all of you fans of martial arts there. 8.5 / 10!
