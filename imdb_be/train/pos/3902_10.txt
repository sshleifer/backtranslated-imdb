I heard Eddie Izzard, but have never seen it in action. I knew that he was a transvestite, and when I saw that it was on HBO one night last summer, I set it up, not knowing how my husband would react. Well, it blew us away. He's better than Robin Williams ever had. He has full control over the audience; if he makes Â«Englebert is dead - no, he does not" routine, the audience does not know what to think through. God, James Mason as an inspired touch, and his version of Python Spanish Inquisition as carried out by the Church of England - "? Cake or Death "is invaluable. My jaw ached with laughter until the end of the show. We scoured the TV for a few months in order to be able to see him again, and were lucky enough to record on his film the next time, when he came on. If you get a chance to see this show, cancel all, and the tape, you will not be disappointed.
