I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was that funny moments, some moving parts, just all around good. Personally, I really liked the movie, because it is something that in the end I can relate to my childhood. This film, in my opinion, is more focused on the young gay population. It shows how a young gay boy will be considered while growing up. All mocking, name-calling, and not knowing anything, I, like most of the other young women boys will always remember, and now, finally, the film, which shows how difficult it really is to grow gay. So I would definitely recommend seeing this film. Probably should not really watch it until the person is old and mature enough to understand
