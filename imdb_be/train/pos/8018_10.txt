In this film, Muppets Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, animals, Janice, Zoot and college graduates who have decided to bring their successful College of Music, Manhattan tunes to Broadway. Unfortunately, none of the manufacturers will not even meet with the dolls. After it was rejected too many manufacturers, Scooter suggests that the Muppets decided to move on their own. However, Kermit still believes that he can get his Broadway show, but after he finally does and let us all know that he has sold the show, amnesia Kerman to get and others do not know where he is. <br /> <br /> It has many great scenes, including a live action sequence, which introduced the Muppet Babies, the wedding sequence, filled with the Muppets, including actors Sesame Street and Traveling Matt (from Fraggle Rock), Scooter in a movie theater usher, and the scene where Rizzo and the other rats to make breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that the more characters that are not included anymore. Of course, many of them were at the wedding, but there must have been some important roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetums, and lips should be a part of The Electric Mayhem in this film, as it was in the Muppet Show in the last season and most of puppet journey, and Miss Piggys dog FF should have been with her, as well as (in the end, Rizzo the Rat, as well as by Steve Whitmire, had a big role in this film, and he was not very well known at the time).
