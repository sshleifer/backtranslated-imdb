I think I read this somewhere: Joe Johnston (the film's director and one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic for the first Star Wars film) and one of its producers or something puzzled for a title for the movie , «Rocket Boys» (I think) was that there is not enough <br /> <br /> one day they were messing with the PC program, which forms the words of other words (eg :. you enter a word or series of words, and he mixes up the letters and other forms of words) I believe the technical term is "anagram» <br /> <br /> anyway, they entered in the "Rocket's lopchykav "and sure enough, it returns to the" October Sky ". They were shocked, to say the least. Name summed up all that is in the film, as the film revolves around the Earth's satellite. At first Homer Jr. did not like the idea, but he warmed up to it after "movie poster in paperback novel" I came out and took off.
