Another powerful chick flick. At this time, it revolves around Diana Guzman, who is always getting into fights at school. Instead of being thrown out, she takes her anger elsewhere in the boxing ring. She is training to be a boxer and there she meets featherweight Adrian and begins to fall in love with him. This film has a strong message to take your dreams and go with them, even if someone does not believe in you (in this case, her father did not believe in it). This in itself makes the film worth the price. enjoy
