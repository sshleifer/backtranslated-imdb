Gary Busey is the title hero, Frank "bulletproof" McBain, your time attendance unreasonable Maverick cop who earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets it takes (38 and counting), it never ceases to go after the bad guys . <, Br /> <br /> If the ultra-US tank dubbed "Thunderblast" set in motion across the border to Mexico, he arrested the revolutionary / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enriquez) and the Libyan colonel Kartiff (Henry Silva), who joined with Russian villains. Army personnel involved kept as prisoners, among them the main Devon Shepard (flyugel), who happens to McBain's ex-girlfriend. McBain then recruited by the army for the rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Busey may not have the physical presence of, say, someone like Schwarzenegger, that would be another appropriate lead to a film of this type, but it is an explosion as an independent confident man, who swiftly with jokes. Fluegel is a big feminine role; it not only looks incredibly sexy, but it makes for a thin legs butt baby actions. Silva Henriquez, Juan Fernandez, and always welcome William Smith (as a Russian base) disgusting scum in the classical tradition militants. The supporting cast is full of familiar and fairly reliable character actors: L.Q. Jones, RG Armstrong, Talmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo and Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman put the script based on a story Lankford and veteran director Fred B reindeer Rey. This kind of scenario where you just know that the writers have their tongues in their cheeks: they know their stuff is absurd and cheese, and just have fun throwing confidence in the window. Veteran Executive Steve Carver action keeps it moving and provides a respectable amount of shots, explosions and general mayhem total. <br /> <br /> Â«bulletproof" good fun for the action of the fan, who do not think eliminating their brains now and then and just enjoy a generous range of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
