There's no people like «Show People» Marion Davies (as Peggy Pepper) and William Haynes (as Billy Boone). My acquaintance with Ms. Davis was a "clip" from the film; spoofy perfectly one, in which she puts a scarf to detect different emotions. My acquaintance with the g-Haines was watching this movie at the moment; though perhaps I saw it in a less memorable roles. Haines makes an incredible impression when he joins Davis for cooperative food - throwing his hat in the ring with some wonderful bits on the dining table. In fact, Davis Haynes and deliver great comic performances. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) daughter Management Davis in Hollywood, I'm sure that it will become the latest sensation in Tinseltown. In fact, Davis had already arrived Haines become a comedy star. But Davis is committed to become a real drama queen. Davis Haines reserves and partner up with regularly Polo dramatic rally. But viewers prefer Davis more comic roles; perhaps the director King Vidor offers up a case for art imitating life? <br /> <br /> Full big Hollywood location shooting, both on set and off. Full big "cameo"; dinner in the studio at the table of stars, Davis is between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. Best 'bit' player, however, Charlie Chaplin, who has enough courage to ask Davis for an autograph! Although fun cameos, they are episodic and sequences do not help "show people" become less important film, and more of an important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
