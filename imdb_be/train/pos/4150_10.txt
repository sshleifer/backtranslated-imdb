I look cool thing because the real life experiences drawn. This one was very close to me and touched me deeply, so beautifully crafted, thanks, Merideth. All the characters are well-developed 3D especially Coop. Material is still difficult to approach, the United States is far behind the developed countries. Only this kind of honest factual empirical patterns and treatment has an impact on the population. Of course, not everyone sees things the same way, but I am inspired that 3/4 of men surveyed under the age of 30, the crowds have voted the same way as me 10. You reach a hard one - I will always leave behind "the best episode of the" place for this episode . please continue to take risks and accept my heartfelt gratitude.
