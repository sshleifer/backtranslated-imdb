I would recommend this movie to everyone. Not just for fans of the rocker Ligabue, but to the entire movie-goers. Because it is sincere, moving, funny and true. Since Ligabue a born storyteller and movie buff, and each frame of the film it is made with love and care. Because his characters love and asking to be loved. Since the majority of Italian debut films filthy, and it is one made by an outsider, it's a real joy to watch and listen to. As Stephen Accorsi lush and reminded me of Andrea Pazienza, who was as FRECCIA, beautiful and talented and kind and lost his life because of the heroin that Ligabue shows how this unpopular and ugly, wholly surrendering lung moralism. Because this is a film that tells our hearts, our ears, our souls. And because I lived the experience of an FM radio, and it was so. Thank you, Luciano!
