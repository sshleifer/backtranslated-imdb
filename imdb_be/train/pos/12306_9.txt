Chinese Ghost Story of the late star, great Leslie Cheung as the Ling Choi Sin, poor customs officer, who decides to spend the night in an abandoned temple, where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful woman named Tsinghua (Joey Wang). If Lin discovers that Tsing actually a ghost, who was forced to lure a victim of bad tree spirit, which eats "th" (life force), he decides to try and free the girl, giving her a proper burial remains. Enlisting the help of Swordsman Yin (Wu Ma), a crazy Taoist monk, Ling successfully defeats the spirit of the tree, but also must fight against the evil in hell, Lord Black, who Tsing should be married. <br /> <br /> The first film of Hong Kong, I saw that was not pure martial arts action, Chinese Ghost Story opened my eyes to the incredible world of Asian horror fantasy, magical realm inhabited by beautiful female ghost, bumbling innocents characters, sword wielding Taoist monks, monstrous spirits and dark god of the underworld; I immediately fell in love with the movie abundance, energy, humor, inventiveness and visual experience. <br /> <br /> After two decades, and this amazing film is still one of the most outstanding examples of the genre that I have seen? ? luxurious, breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly combines horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. With direction from the high-Tung Ching Siu, excellent editing by David Wu, stunning cinematography and a whole slew of creative effects (including Humongous killer language in many tentacled monster, and several volatile heads!), Chinese Ghost Story is a totally unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish.
