Pinjar is one of the few films that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard. Set in the Partition of India, this film shows the true reality of the partition of India. Urmila gets full marks for its beautiful and deeply emotional figure woman suffers, without having the ability to walk. Her freedom, personal identity and family respect taken at night over the tragic land dispute. Manoj Bazhpai simply brilliant as her remorse kidnapper. There are several points in the film where one is brought to tears. The film at the points deeply traumatic. Some of the sections of the spine chilling scenes, but endurance and survival Urmila is characteristic. Of women deprived of their liberty of a woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations. Great movie, which should give credit to the intellectual character and narrator.
