I just watched «The Last Wave» in fine arts library of my school. It is intriguing how things are Peter Weir, but it is not always holding the attention, as I would like. I found that fascinated the ideas thrown at me (because they are very well handled by the director Weir), but at the same time I did not stimulated enough of them. AKA I got a little sad in the spot. <br /> <br /> The plot surrounds Aussie lawyer who becomes receive some dreams he has to associate it with a group of Aborigone he defended himself. <br /> <br /> It starts with an intense weather sequence and has some very strange effects mood everywhere (especially fancy, "burp" sound design) and strong direction; but it just does not make me happy, as the later films Weir do. I might just have to watch it again, though. <br /> <br /> A good film about obsession and mystery. Because, in the end, the mystery that exists between white and Aboriginies offers some very serious consequences. <br /> <br /> God bless Peter Weir, though. For him alone this movie is worth watching ... very organic Director. As the Australian response Malik! I would give it a 7 because it has a large enough ideas to overcome their sad moments.
