I remember watching it as a child in the UK, mesmerized by the history and the story of Laurence Olivier. We would talk about anything else at school the next day. I believe that the ratings for the first show were enormous. It is quite simply the best most comprehensive documentary series, despite the fact that they had to cut the story down to the bone they were able to capture so much. What is interesting is that the Battle of Britain and North Africa are crucial still widely unrecognized as such by the Americans. The series reflects the rivalry between the Mountbatten and American generals, the suffering of the German forces on the Eastern Front, the mistreatment of prisoners of war of the Japanese American troops. The image of the Holocaust made me, gentile Europe, feel eternally guilty about the treatment of the Jewish people. I do not know why it is not number one in the ranking of IMDb. Perhaps they show their prejudice against documentaries. Spoiler - we win.
