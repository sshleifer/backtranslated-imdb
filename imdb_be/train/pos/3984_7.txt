To celebrate the release of Casino Royale, the film with a new Bond starring in it, it was stated by director Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost ruled him to be a bit boring, but I'm glad I stuck with it. Basically May (Anne Reid) is a single mother Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones), which is unlikely to see anyone and did not have a boyfriend in years. Her daughter says that she may want to marry her new boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). After knowing each other for a few days in May and Darren have a secret affair. And at her age, with 30-something, and the new Bond? Anyway, they obviously want to keep it a secret, but my regret is a miracle and when Helen learns. If it does, Darren gets less hassle than in May. In fact, Helen asks her permission to hit her. Also starring Peter Vaughan as a Tutsi, Danira Govich as an Au Pair, Harry Mitchell, Harry, Rosie Michell like Rosie and Johnny English, Oliver Ford Davies, Bruce. Very good!
