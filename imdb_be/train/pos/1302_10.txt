So often the group will meet for the re-union concert only to find that they simply can not get it together. Not so here. This concert is a brightness shift from start to finish. These three musicians are obviously going to advance and built and planned, that it was necessary to ensure that it was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone's ego. This is evident from the very beginning, before they even step on stage. Many faces in the crowd were not even born when these guys first met. From the first song they capture that old magic that was cream, 3 men, 3 device, not hustling. Clapton, by his own admission, said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there was no keyboard, synthesizers, etc., so we get to see him at his best. Ginger Baker demonstrates why so many drummers today speak of him as some kind of drumming guru. Jack Bruce just fine. They really managed to collect part of the magic that will stand the test of time for many years. This one is 10 for me.
