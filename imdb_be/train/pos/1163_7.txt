This film was produced by Roger Corman, so you know that the filmmakers did not have much money to work with. <br /> <br /> While some viewers may miss the subtleties in the film because of the very typical "obsessed killer" type of marketing approach, there are unique differences about this film. <br /> <br /> AMANDA, since the game is clearly talented, Justine Priestley, is a complex character. Some people like these movies just because that violence may seem random, but the consequences of past abuse (described in a realistic but tasteful way) what form of psychosis Amanda. Surprisingly, Amanda redeems himself in the end with an act of love, where the majority of these films have become a typical, all of the fight to the death and evil character dies just as evil, in the end, to start with. <br /> <br /> Some of the roughness in this picture, but I have to give it a 7 out of 10 stars, based on its thoughtfulness and let originality compared with the usual - especially on a budget.
