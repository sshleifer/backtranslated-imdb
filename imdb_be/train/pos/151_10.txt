The film is intended to influence an audience, and this film left me dumb. Gorgeously photographed and well acted with the dialogue that comes close to poetry film includes lust, hatred, murder, rape, theft and deception. She weaves an intense web that left me unable to tear his eyes away from the screen to the end credits. History sweeps. It takes the viewer from the atrocities of the civil war in Spain in the human wreckage left behind. Roger Kasamazhor and Bruno Bertanzoni two young actors who command the screen. Supporting players are perfectly cast and give a real sense of authenticity. Sets, lighting, scenery and excellent cinematography. I love to take pictures.
