If you are a supporter of aa one or both Chuck Norris and Jadson Mills, this film has a lot of adventures see.It in it.it is an excellent follow up to President Man.The chemistry between the main three stars (Chuck Norris, Jadson Mills, Jennifer Tang ) is incredible.My personal opinion.This movie with the original, it turned out so well that the network should consider turning it into a normal series.If you saw the man President, I recommend this film for you.If you have seen the man President: line on the sand, but you have not seen the man President, let mn ie the right to claim that you will not be disappointed do.You none.
