I think you have to be from the United States to get a lot of jokes. But if you liked the Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you would like this film. You can not compare the quality of shooting for those who, of course, but the cameraman trip obviously done on purpose. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times better than Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I am confident that the people of France do not appreciate cartoons in French. So this film is not for the global audience. And while I'm not trained critic, I know what I like. I could not stop laughing throughout the film. It has my hand and jaw pain at the end of the film.
