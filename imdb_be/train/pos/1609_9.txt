«Moonstruck» is a film that I liked the first time I watched it. I really liked it a second time. I loved him for the third time. Now it is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> Humor thin, but really good. The film offers a lot of heat humor. the story takes place in an old school in the Italian city of New York. Cher Search for love pleasure to watch. This movie is definitely the best work of Nicolas Cage did on film. Old character is fantastic. He lights up the screen, without saying a word. The scene with the dogs howling for a month has been fantastic. But perhaps the best character is the one played by Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> climax of the film is the scene where the protagonists explain oatmeal for breakfast in the family kitchen. The exclusive direction and wrap.
