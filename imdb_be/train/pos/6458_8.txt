Great movie, deeply touching to the very simple but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This film was nearly perfect, and, seeing nothing in this world can not be truly perfect, very good. Only minor thing I mind is subjective, is the stimulation of some points in the middle of history. The acting is also very good, and all the actors easily top actors in high-profile films. The actual direction seems to have been well thought out, and the script was amazing. There are some really exciting moments of the omens, and quite magnificent continue the circular structure of the story. <br /> <br /> At that moment in the movie when the main character achieves that feeling that the sky is the perfect ending to a truly brilliant yarn.
