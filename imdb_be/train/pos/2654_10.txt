Every person should see this film all the way! It's damn scary, but do not resort to lame "leap-in-with you-just to surprise you-and-pass-it-of-as-scary" things. It's really cool. See this fucking weird movie !!! Directed by Stanley Kubrick, easily the greatest director who ever lived. Every one of his films masterpieces, including this. Bright outside the family that runs the hotel in the Colorado Rockies as wipers for the winter, and get snow. Well, the house is haunted. A child's mental. Husband easily influenced by evil ghosts of hotels, and ... well ... hilarity ensues !!!! Not really. It becomes an exciting thriller, where the material is thrown at the viewer from all different directions, and it is frightening. Not only the classics, "That Johnny" scene. This memorable, but can not speak for the entire movie. It's one of those things where the words do not explain it properly, and you just have to see it. So on Netflix, and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
