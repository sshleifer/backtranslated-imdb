Once in the tail of this movie channel surfing on cable movie and was so intrigued, I was looking for the next show. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what to expect after reading a brief review of the program, but I walked away from this film feeling very disturbed and concerned. He also gave me an adult who attended high school in the 80s, a little better understanding of what our children have to contend with these days. <br /> <br /> The fact that you do not see the shooting adds only chillness plot. To see how the child and the adult, so the struggle to understand and come to terms with the senseless images sometimes superior. And I confess that I have shed many tears throughout. <br /> <br /> In general, not a movie that I would have to look for anything, but I'm sure glad I did not see him.
