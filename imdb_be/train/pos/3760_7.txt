It may not be for academic honors and admittedly, it's pretty bad, but it's so much fun! Nothing makes me smile, like Bill and Ted. Lovable, optimistic and cheerful, Bill and Ted is a great way to relax. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I love Excellent Adventure, Bogus Journey funnier to me. Flippin death cheerful and Bill and Ted even more attractive. People give me grief about love this movie, but the movie really pretentious observers say that it is not even a little interesting. If you like this, you will probably also be a supporter of Wayne's World, Dude Where's My Car, and Dumb and Dumber. Admit it, though stupid, they make you smile and turn to tickle the window again. So watch them just for kicks and giggles !!
