Surprisingly good. Action was fun, the script was hilarious, music was cheesie fun story was enormously fun. It was a fun movie to watch and give your brain a rest. Parts of the plot and the quotes that I found to be very creative. 7 out of 10. In fact, what it was, it would have earned 10 out of 10. You should not compare it with arthouse film or bloody slasher.
