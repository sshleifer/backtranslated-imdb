Some of the recognized Altman's "masterpieces" now seem more boring to me. Maybe it's me. Like the last reviewer, I do like this "lesser" Altman (as shown recently on FMC), although I do not think he was aiming at a wider audience. policy of the organization as a "microcosm" for public companies. Some of this satirical "docudrama" is now dated, Dick Cavett watching the Tonight Show, but I found most of the dialogue is funny and insightful (eg, "You're the real thing. It means that you are not a threat to anyone"). History is not "deep", but I liked it. And speech is ridiculous, especially Cavett (like "himself"), Lauren Bacall, as the aging conservative epistaxis, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a member of parliament) as a left ideologue wing (in the initial stage lecturing someone dressed as a carrot policy holiness) and Carol Burnett in the case of the basket. All in Altman's incomparable style, although perhaps not quite as incomparable as usual. But quite unique.
