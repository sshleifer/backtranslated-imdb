To be Honost with you, I think that all was not well in this film should be no reason why he did not go to the theater, deaths in the movie are awesome FX are awesome, if used, there are some sad moments when the story after a little girl, but overall it was a very good movie that I hope ever to get it props it should.The the very first part of the film sample, why he came straight to video them the murder of a little boy, but after that the story is based on a small girl and her mother, who came to visit the mothers boyfriend, who has moved to try to become a writer, he is the purchase of a property where the Witch (Tooth Fairy) and lives of those who live in her house is on her property will be in great danger of not He wants to give anything away really just a bit of information, if you want to see this movie, you do so it is worth price
