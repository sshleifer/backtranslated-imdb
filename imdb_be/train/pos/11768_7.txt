This movie surprised me in a good way. With the boxes I have the impression that it was a thriller, but it was too funny to be a thriller, although it was somewhat interesting. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of good jokes and funny situations in the film and James Belushi was born to make, Bill Manucci, he does a great job. The rest of the cast is not half bad, and especially Timothy Dalton pleasure. <br /> <br /> history can get quite confusing at times, like new characters appear in the movie. Things become more complicated, because no one is rarely tells the truth about things. If you do not pay attention to things you might get a little dirty in the end, but I really liked it. <br /> <br /> Louis Morne is not all that well known, but it did the job perfectly OK with this and I never grew impatient while watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Made of people should be checked.
