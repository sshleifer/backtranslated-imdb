One of the obscure gems of the 1980s, especially the scenes ... razor satire and excellent performances with Arnet Walker (as she does not get a ton of roles after that?) And Wallace Shawn. This delicious promise to the class struggle and the people in those classes. Drawing up the oars and symbols, not thin, they have their own characteristics. And, sorry, but the Asian gang (if you can call it a Japanese man extorted one of the other "gang" characters), it was not put into action for the "sociological values" as another review suggests that they should have been. The implication here is that the film ridicules and sparklingly wicked way he does it. I found it to be creative, funny and kind.
