I saw this film as a child, and it broke my heart! No other story had such an unfinished end ... I grew up on a number of large anime movies, and it was one of my favorites, because it was so unusual - the story of injustice and cruelty, loneliness, and life, and the choice of that can not be undone, and the need for others. Chirin done alone when the wolf kills his mother, but the wolf one too, when Chirin follows him to the mountains. The wolf does not kill the lamb, but every night he said, "maybe I'll eat tomorrow." The tape that I have broken and degraded with age and use. I will repair it and see the movie again someday and cry as hard as I have a child. These stories, with this depth and feeling, and this confusion of meaning, it is very rare. It's a sad story, but I have never encountered any catharsis more nicely done. I'm glad I saw this movie, and I'm glad I saw it as a child.
