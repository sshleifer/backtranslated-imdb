Josef von Sternberg directs this beautiful silent film about silent Hollywood and the former Imperial General, the Emperor of Russia, who found himself there. Jannings won well-deserved Oscar, in particular, the role of a general who casts ironically in a cameo role in the silent film as a Russian general. The film recalls his days in Russia, leading to the country's revolutionaries to fall. William Powell makes his big screen debut as a Hollywood director who throws Jennings in his film. The film is an interesting look at the fall of Russia and in the imitation of Tinseltown overs in the first days. Background Sternberg provides another classic and one that is filled with large elements of romance, intrigue and tragedy.
