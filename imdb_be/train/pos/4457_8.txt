Yes, this is one of the greatest musical films that I grew up with such great artists as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the miniature and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson. Music and dancing is superb. I understand, Frank took lessons from Kelly; is Kelly dancing with Jerry the Mouse, which is quite unique for its time. Betty Garrett plays a waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of the great underrated stars of Hollywood. I saw it again on the A & E TV and also have it in my old VCR tapes. I never get tired of these old musicals. Whatever happens in Hollywood ??
