So, Keaton looks like it really like to do this film. With the omission of his walk on the findings striped suit, he will remind you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is a young hood, which makes it only to pay expensive medical bills and her mother to send his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) Law School. No one even knows Johnny Dangerously Johnny Kelly later in the film. Joe Piscopo is a parasite and does not like Johnny one bit (& I do not like parasites). Marilu Henner has a pleasant routine of singing / dancing while Johnny revels in it. I love the part when they are in an ever-changing car shoots! Cop who "calls on all cars" is the Skipper from Gilligan's Island! See this for the 1930 gang laughs! Gag in the movie funny, but you have to catch them or you miss them! Look at the background of each scene.
