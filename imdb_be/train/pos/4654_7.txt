It is about embezzlers, Peter Ustinov, which saturates the British company, Texa-Conn or something like that, pretending to be a computer whiz and security expert. He secretly learn to hack the computer, while collecting the delight of his boss, Carl Moldna hostile to his office Newhart competitor, and the love of his inept secretary, Maggie Smith. <br /> <br /> Some of the business part was a little cloudy this, entirely business-oriented eye, but they are quite believable, and I got an idea. Peter Ustinov peculating sets lime business in Paris, Rome and Stuttgart, and uses a computer Texa-Konno send all kinds of money on these ersatz institutions. Foreign companies, of course, consist of not more than themselves, Ustinov, and the address of the artist abandoned attic in Paris, a hairdresser in Rome, and a bakery in Germany. He just visits to collect their checks, which he sent himself. <br /> <br /> I do not think I would like it within the first few minutes, because it seemed more likely on the slow side. I have something with a faster pace and more indignantly waiting on line «The Pink Panther» or «The Lavender Hill Gang». But this film insinuates itself in your favor, as you have come to appreciate dry humor in the plot, characterization and dialogue. <br /> <br /> Probably, it would be nice to give away too much from the relatively subtle jokes, but here are some examples of the more visible <br /> <br /> Ustinov Secretary Smith :. "Let me have the assets of these companies." Smith: "Assets What they" Ustinov:?. "Little female donkeys" At the present time, has done nothing this little exchange there very quickly cut and without delay of any laughter, that's right, so. that its reaction is likely to smile than to laugh. <br /> <br /> Ustinov looking for that lousy loft in Paris. it is covered with cobwebs. Bricks are scattered around and a few pictures of the former residents have been left behind. The owner who spoke no Ustinov English and knows French. Ustinov indicates the child as a picture of shaved women and chuckles, "Oh Pham FYE-wah, and" The landlord also giggles responds: "Vous les Prenez pour une anee" Ustinov:.?! "On - Annie, so that her name is" Landlord: "Oui" Ustinov? "Entente» (Mes weight when I got the sex wrong, I love m'excuse.) Newhart in Willard Gnatpole (!) My fuse for Maggie Smith and have to be behind the wheel of his house, but tells her that he takes "scenic route." There is an urgent sequence suggestive of road signs. "Caution!". "Lay-By". "Make way." "Yield". Ending with the authorities «STOP / children." There's another installation, if Ustinov scheme is going to be found by the Board of Directors - blurred roof, police cars, a farewell embrace with Maggie, finishing mark :. Prison Wormwood Scrubs <br /> <br /> Well, maybe one more. I still can not get over Molde boss, declaring emphatically, "I never agonize over the decision-making" and then swallowing a handful of pills and washing them down with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> Effective undeniably good. This is the best role in Newhart, for example. Not that he had that many, but not the fact that his range was not limited, but it is ideal in this respect. Score Laurie Johnson obviously had a lot of effort put into it. She seems to have written a short concert for flute. Ustinov passion musician and its foreign head fake names such as Debussy and Rossini Giacconino. Stuttgart fake president is a man named Schmidt, and he is abnormal clinker. Maggi Smith pretty, sexy, bourgeois, and is not as dumb as she seems. <br /> <br /> Great, in the sly, but do not expect the fireworks comical.
