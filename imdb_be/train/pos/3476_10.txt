Let's chase: If you are a baby boomer, you are bound to have spent some time wondering what in 1976 McCartney was savvy to jump on the city of John the hermit life and spend the day with him. In addition, of course, I wondering how everything went. I heard the same messages that the author of this film had heard from John and Paul's perspectives, and I admit that I have reconstructed the meeting in much the same way, this film does. But none of my fantasies could not buy the tears in my eyes, as this incredible part of the work and activities does. I found it to be surprisingly realistic, plausible, and 100% free of saccharin. Now, can anyone explain why I have not heard of this masterpiece before it was broadcast on CBC last night? I mean, it's already three years old, for God's sake! And so, if you are fan of the Beatles, it must see performance! Even subtle paraphrase the Beatles music in the background is inspired.
