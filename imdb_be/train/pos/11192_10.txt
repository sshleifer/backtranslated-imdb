I screened the film a few times here, in college, and every time I show this, the number of people watching me growing exponentially ... in the annex to virgins, who I have shown it is necessary to see it again! It takes a while to get into it, but in the end the whole audience screaming, screaming, screaming, rewinding scenes repeatedly, repeating dialogue, but simply fully involved in the experience of moviegoing, which Pia Zadora in Â«The Lonely Lady"! Scene after scene after scene of the most awkwardly filmed, badly written, badly acted TRASH thrown you into all-out attack, which ranks as the campiest thing I have (nearly statements, friends). Nothing compares to the U have 2, Pia ... and I do not think I'm the only one who has ever felt this way!
