I absolutely loved this film when I was a kid. I cried every time I watched it. It was not surprising to me. I completely identified with the characters. I would like to see him again (and I hope that I will not be disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was really drawn into the world of fantasy. And I will take the film was too much. I wonder if I've ever seen the series and confused them? Act I thought I was strong. I loved Jack Wild. He was so dreamy An 10 years old (when I first saw the film, and not in 1970, I still remember the characters vividly flute was plausible, and I still can "feel" the evil forest Witchy poo .. it was terrible - I I would not want to cross her path.
