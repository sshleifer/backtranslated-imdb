I saw this film many years ago, and it made an indelible impression on me. Unfortunately, I have many films hardened for years and is not expected that there will be impressions «Kalifornia» at the recent watch again. I am pleased to say that it did not care and watchable as it was ten or so years ago. <br /> <br /> There are two things that really give the film its power. His first shot. We have dramatically disturbing turn of a young Brad Pitt as Early Grace. Experienced Pitt, like all of us, as one of the most enduring heart throbs Hollywood has never been, it's nice to see him play a nasty, unsightly character. Pete pulls brag, without resorting to the white trash clichés or parody, and manages to remain a truly terrible throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Juliette Lewis as impressive as the tragic girlfriend Grace, playing the character as a ten years old girl with life experience forty years of art. Lewis managed to evoke pity (for his character in the life of the station), as well as contempt (for its naivete), but it supports her statement with a view of the subtleties rarely seen such a young actor. Personally, I believe that it is a tragedy that neither Pitt nor Lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here. <br /> <br /> David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes, both perfectly cast as Yuppy couple who unwittingly end up traveling across the US and Pete Lewis. Duchovony is aptly cause and naive, and the Forbes, seems decidedly cynical and shut-off, but both the actor has turned strongly reflect changes in their characters, they are equally intrigued, repulsed and strangely attracted to Pete. <br /> <br /> fine casting and a uniformly brilliant acting side, this film really captures our proverbial balls through his perfect stimulation. At that time, was released "Kalifornia", Hollywood released to kill those good-digit twists-a-to-be-psychotic films ( "Single White Female," "Pacific Heights," "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle," "Cheated" 'Sleeping With The Enemy ", etc.). Most of these films using the same formula, the only change is the nature of the relationship between the good guys and bad guys. «Kalifornia» actually not too far from this area, but the first two actions are a perfect example of slow-boiling thriller, and we kept on the edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn. <, Br /> <br /> If the penalty does fall, and Pete allow free play maniacal bad guy, the film shifts gears completely, and the last twenty minutes did not quite live up to the rest of the film. Nevertheless, the action thick and fast, and the resolution is good cold. The fight ended, but the scars will always be there. <br /> <br /> Most of the narration (available a few whiny pre Duchovony X-Files) is a bit unnatural. Of course, this meant that the book Duchovony journalist who wrote the character in, so it can be argued that self-conscious narrative is meant to be a tribute to the kind of sensational style in which most of the journalists wrote. <br /> <br /> the film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above the 90% of thrillers in the last twenty years. It is strongly recommended, but not for the weak of stomach or mind. This film is worrying on more than one level. But then, it should be.
