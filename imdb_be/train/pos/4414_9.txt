Cuban blood of one of these sleepers movie that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way. I actually watched it while sailing around Cuba in the western Caribbean cruise. He details the life of 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time is not spent on the revolution to the very end, when he came and took the boy's mode of father's property. Much of the film is a boy coming of age and relationships occurring in a small town where everyone knows each other. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. Class with a thin film and guiding action. This is a film that tells the story without special effects or grand schemes or real twists. This is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes and their triumphs. Good movie worth watching several times a year.
