I do not really agree with the guy-Yardley-Rees, who (if he watched the whole movie) would have seen some absolutely stunning Scottish scenery (some of the best ever shot of Skye) and found a movie with the beginning of the heavy combined in a very bitter general . <br /> <br /> This is not a big-budget film. . Rather, it is a film that has a strong sense of community <br /> <br /> I can not say how many "standard" movies bother - pushing the polished material over and over again. Seachd not give up, that at all. It actually seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more than any Scottish Gaelic recent film. <br /> <br /> So, acting is not a blockbuster style. This is because the actors seemed to be real people. I actually thought that the key role of the boy and his grandfather were very convincing - and sometimes extraordinarily beautiful <br /> <br /> Seachd does a second review, as there are many streams that become clearer the second time. - that actually fed in the final. <br /> <br /> as a whole, the combination of music and (sometimes) stunning visuals, as well as the community approach to acting and not the normal structure Seachd turned in a very unique and memorable film. More of them, please!
