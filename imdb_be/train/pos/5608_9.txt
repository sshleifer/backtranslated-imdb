Of course, he quickly became uneven after this film, but with the "Knife in the Water" to this Â«The tenants," Roman Polanski can always count on to deliver something exciting and unique. Despite the many running order (alienation, paranoia), not two of his films are not very similar. The history of this is somewhat similar to his "aversion" from ten years ago, but the tone is completely different. "Lessee" manages to balance the darker dark absurd (I was a little hesitant on calling this humor, although the protagonist of strange behavior and the dialogue was sometimes funny) with some truly disturbing paranoia. Polanski has always been a master at building awkwardness and moments in this film almost unbearably awful. In general strangeness of the film is also a plus. <br /> <br /> In the annex to exquisite Polanski as a normal direction, the rest of the cast and crew offer a great contribution. Polanski Polanski actor often overshadowed by the director, but his work here really captures the awkwardness of his character and feeling rejected. Themes of social discrimination makes this film more than just a fad for the sake of being strange. The rest of the cast also offers strong performances, especially nice turn Isabelle Adjani and Melyvn Douglas and accordingly those annoying Shelley Winters'. "Lessee" is often underestimated because of how people are willing to extol as "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby", but just as brilliant as any of these classics. (9/10)
