in one of the best games of Neil Simon. Creaky, cranky ex-vaudeville star, played by Matthau and George Burns combined for TV comedy special. The problem they have not even seen each other for ten years. Full Zippy liners and inside show business jokes, the story flies with a continuous stream of humor. Good work also Richard Benjamin as harried nephews, Rosetta Lenoera as a nurse, and Howard Hesseman as a TV commercial director. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller are like themselves. General Note: The opening montage contains footage from Hollywood Revue in 1929 and shows Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards, and singing Brox Sisters.
