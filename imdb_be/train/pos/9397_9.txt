Vaguely reminiscent of the big 1940s westerns like "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948), «Red Rock West» is the story of conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is down, and, but, to be honest, the young man from Texas who goes to the West in search of work and money. He finds both, but not as he had expected. <br /> <br /> The script of the film contains a lot of surprises and plot twists. Excellent cinematography, film editing clever and whimsical western music to add tension and suspense. big sky country Incontinence provides excellent conditions. And the range of the good to excellent, with large projections of Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. specially recorded country / western song Dwight Yoakam provides the film with a strong finale. <br /> <br /> Properly labeled as neo-noir «Red Rock West» strikes me as something else, as well. The plot is full of amazing coincidences and unbelievable time, so that others may consider a scenario as erroneous. Normally, I would agree. In this case, however, in conjunction with the moody atmosphere, and the fact that the small town of Red Stone seems almost empty of normal daily life, accident and unlikely to offer a timeline history that besides «noirish», it is a ... unreal. It's almost as if fate intervenes deliberately improbable events, in order to get Michael to come to grips with themselves. From this point of view, the matching scripting flaws at all. They need the plot points in the young man's nightmarish stories that must confront his own demons ... under the guise of other characters. <br /> <br /> All you need is Rod Serling, in a postscript, explaining his voice is always clearly announced that ... a young man searching for himself, stopped in a small, almost deserted city thousands of miles from nowhere. This is his last stop on the road to ... dull area.
