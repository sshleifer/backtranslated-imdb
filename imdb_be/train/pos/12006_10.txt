The most amazing thing, spiritually uplifting film about the restoration of the gospel. Much better than any other film, or a film made of the restoration so far. If you have not seen it, get on a plane to Salt Lake and see it now. You will not regret it! You really get a sense of what the early Saints had to fight to the end, putting a complete and total faith in the Prophet Joseph Smith. You finally get some understanding of things, the Prophet had to fight through and persecution he and his men faced. If you have any questions about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and of our humble beginnings just watch this movie, it will make a complete and total sense later.
