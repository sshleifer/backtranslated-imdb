I had a hell of a good time watching this, and was surprised by its superb features more erudite. For pervyhi, the film is undoubtedly cheaper production from its cardboard sets, limited options and creative scientific details. Existing ranges from very poor (two strippers), just professional (Herb Evers as a leading man), Gothic overstatement (Leslie Daniels as an assistant to Kurt) for the first year from Virginia Leith starring as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and lustful passion of her groom. Scenario, although very good, and the dialogue is fantastic for this kind of film. Problems are many that have the role of science and medicine in our lives and that their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking movie in many ways. However, do not be too fooled by his real intention. This untidy story of a man obsessed with his ability in the field of medical science, which wants to merge his dead girlfriend's head with a perfect body, thus creating the most perfect woman for the man with the best of the body and soul. Another very striking aspect of the film is a saxophone music that resonates strongly every time the doctor scour the city for the beauties of women.
