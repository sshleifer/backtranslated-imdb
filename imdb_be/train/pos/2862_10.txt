My comment is limited mainly to the first season, 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This beautiful series was one of the first to be televised in color, and he was very influential in convincing Americans that they had to buy a color TV set, which was about $ 800 in 1959, that equivalent to more than $ 3,000 today. How many of us would pay so much for the privilege of watching the show, transmitted electron-beam image of the tube at a 17-inch screen? I was eleven when the series began, and I watched it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Watching now, 50 years later, a few things that come to mind. Firstly, many of the story lines associated with the Comstock Lode silver production and prosperity, which dates back to 1859. For 1859, weapons and clothes, for the most part, is not genuine. (Haircuts omitted debate). It is basically a quibble. <br /> <br /> And it would be impossible for Ben arrived in the area of ​​Lake Tahoe in 1839 and has accumulated a 100-square-mile ranch in the next twenty years. The pioneers were still trying to solve the problem of Sierra Nevada, at the end of 1847, and the Gold Rush did not even begin until two years later. <br /> <br /> Indians plays Native American actors. John Ford used Indian actor in the 1920s. Manufacturers Bonanza could easily do so, thirty years later. This is a major quibble for me. <br /> <br /> There are other problems of the time line. In season 1, it is Mark Twain, and he is depicted as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. The stories also fluctuated between 1859-1860 (before the Civil War), and what is more suitable for the 1880 timeframe. There are continuity problems again and again. <br /> <br /> This is somewhat off-putting, as there are so many murders in the first season. Over time, the murder was reduced. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes take socially liberal bias, which will be hard to believe, given the timeline, but give credit to the writers to predict the seismic shifts in relation to the nation since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, working well, and I came to the conclusion in my recent years, the character of Adam was made better than any other. I do not think that Pernell Roberts ever got the credit he deserves. In addition, the season 1 confirms the fact that Dan Blocker (Hess) was a good actor. <br /> <br /> Many of the stories to follow actual historical events. Guest stars were interesting. <br /> <br /> It was a great family entertainment and a number of stands is very good by any standard.
