Well, I have just discovered that there is a show more disgusting and shocking than the «Little Britain» and I love it! "The League of Gentlemen" sick British comedy about the most horrible, crazy and disgusting a small town in the whole of the UK. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from the "Vicar of Dibley" and "Father Ted"), it seems quite normal !! The format of the show is a lot like LITTLE Britain, except that it all centers around the residents of this one hell of a city. Both shows again and again have the same scenes of each episode, and some clearly inspired by the «Little Britain» (in particular, the work seeks a class skit). But the show is characterized by the fact that in spite of the fact that crude as «Little Britain» (hence not a show for children), the show has a sick and sadistic quality that distinguishes it from all these shows. In particular, animal cruelty and mass murder are recurring themes throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Now, if you have not already guessed, this is not a show for children, easily irritated or normal people, and this is probably why I like it. However, you really have very oily skin and terrible love to enjoy it to the maximum. Funny and irreverent incredible beyond belief - you have to see it to believe it.
