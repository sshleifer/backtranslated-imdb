Moon Child was one of the most emblematic films that I've seen. What I really liked it it was a figure on the immorality / mortality, as well as obstacles and precepts through life. The film reflects the great vampire Kei, who has the power of the immorality and the advantage to him. Regardless of when he feels supernatural powers or eternal life, is that people tend to want. Moon Child shows the pain and weaknesses immortal, as sentiments in the loss of exposure almost all of the characters, especially on the main characters and Sho Kei. The meaning of the name «Moon Child» shows how the film draws to a close, where it clearly shows that all this month that shines the way other people give directions. I am a person just like a moral film, shown on. Disadvantages of the film lies in some parts of the action and special effects, as he made the film less specific. The scene in which a character dies Toshio could be more powerful and realistic, if more real emotions at work have been put into it. Some scenes with special effects such as gunshots could also be more precise, without making it seem too much like a video game action. Sparks, who came out of the cannon were too fake, and I think that could be removed or corrected. Nevertheless, I think, Moon Child should be a film everyone should consider looking. Symbolic of idea and image of the film show will be readily accepted by all and may be interested in a lot of viewers. This is a fairly thoughtful film, as well as entertaining to watch.
