More weirdness follows, including Don Juan observations Siberian tiger fighter WW2, etc .; Kirk meets Ruth, a beautiful old friend (of course) and the bully from his days of the Academy, Finnegan. Chase / fight scene with Finnegan continues for too long, but at the same time, McKay run with a lance knight on the horse and apparently killed. Finally, an elderly man is and explains what is happening. Planet is a futuristic "amusement park", where visitors only imagine something, to make it appear.
