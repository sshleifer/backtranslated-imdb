We loved the movie. I am a mother of two young men. I love the movie I can watch them, where people have the integrity and character. Moveis, where money is not the most important thing. And the family forever, and love means more than words. <br /> <br /> I wish we saw more of the Davis family. But for all that I loved, he left me the same feeling that the others did, "Please, no more." We're both actors desire will not change.The new actors were good substitute tho. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old son loved the movie too. asked me to go out and buy all of them. he critic so that it to say that it tells me something. Family all need to see that the move to buy it for friends. Help the return time values . we read the book now, when we sat down. I hope to see more. blessed happy moving
