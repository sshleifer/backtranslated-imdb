I just saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival 2001. The working title was «Dog Days». The reaction of the audience was mixed. Some people have found graphic sex and violence is realistic to be too much for them. Others seemed to accurately assess how good this film. <br /> <br /> This film is not for the faint of heart. It's like "Happiness" with explicit sex and less optimistic view of humanity. There is poisoning animals, a strip of the pensioner, orgy'esque »Bath in a shopping center, anal penetration with candles, and harassment furious. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds like too much to handle, then this movie is not for you. This film shows the humanity in its most desperate and miserable. The banality of our being shoved in our face with great joy. <br /> <br /> Seidl has no interest in saving humanity here. And why should he? This film shows the excellent performance of all the participants, it is always interesting, and probably the smartest social statement was made into a film in quite some time.
