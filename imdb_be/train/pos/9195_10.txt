I do not give a movie or show ten very often, but this show has touched a nerve in a way no other show has. I found a whole series on mysoju.com and thought the room looked interesting, so I looked to see. I was not disappointed by what I saw; I was touched. This story is on the delicate side, as the main characters will move us through the scenes. Sumire Iwaya, played thoughtfully on Koyuki, shows us human nature, she wants the problem did not appear. No one wants to lay his soul to the prospective mate. Thus, instead it replaces the man who plays magic Matsumoto Jun, as a pet. This animal, like any other creature, we would consider a pet. difference; he can take revenge in the same way, after all Momo is a person, not a dog. As he is treated as a pet, it is responding to the situation, it may enter into the dog's reaction. She spends time with new boyfriend, jealous of Momo. This is when she realizes that her pet is not only animal that the sexual tension between the two starts to become thick - Momo dance prodigy. Her thinking is gradually changing as we begin to get a look at your own thoughts. Matsumoto takes us to see the character, which is very one-dimensional in the beginning, before the two-dimensional, when we see that he is a dancer, a three-dimensional character in when we see how it starts to fall at his master as a person, not a dog. In my opinion, it is worth watching this story just to see the character develops. Plus Matsumoto Momo plays with such tenderness, you almost start to wish you had, too. None does not want to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but, as Momo (the name she gives him, as one might call their new puppy) States ?? we both knew that it would not be able to finish. Watch this show with an open mind, it's worth it.
