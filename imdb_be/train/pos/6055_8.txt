I was not expecting much from this movie, but was very pleasantly surprised, as it is light and funny, and very clearly visible. The central trio of bikers defaulters were surprisingly likable as they staggered and clowned his way through the drug at the center of the trip to Wales. Humor was soft and delicate, as, indeed, were three characters (witness their cute little old lady shopkeeper treatment). Atmospherics rural Wales have been captured perfectly, and the sound was very well chosen. Skillfully and carefully script, with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic image of alternative culture - I felt like I was there with them. Very light contact and full of fun - not what you might expect from a film about bikers and drugs. Pleasure on all fronts, and it is difficult to criticize, but I thought that the last two scenes were a bit weak - the film was to be completed, when they left Wales. But overall, an unexpected treasure of a film.
