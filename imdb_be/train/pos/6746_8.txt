This is an excellent example of a relatively simple film noir story, which is handled exceptionally well - thanks to the excellent direction of Otto Preminger, as well as some outstanding acting performance. Dana Andrews stars as a hot detective who too often uses his fists instead of his brain. Shortly after the film begins, Andrews reprimanded for it, and warned that if this continues, it will be on the force. A little later, during the investigation of a crime, he attacked the suspect and Andrews have to fight to protect themselves. This time he did not use excessive force, but the attacker was killed. Andrews panics and thinks that they will not believe him, so he tries to hide death -. Although instead of an innocent person ultimately blamed for a crime <br /> <br /> There's much more to the film than this- include plot involving slimy villain (Gary Merrill) and love interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney). In general, this is one of the best examples of the genre - with a lot of rough dialogue, well-lit and simple, but very effective story. This is the way Noir was supposed to be.
