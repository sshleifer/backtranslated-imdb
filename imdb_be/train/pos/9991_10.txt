I thought that this movie was hysterical. I watched it over and over again and recommend it highly. Mel Brooks was great. The cast was fantastic..I not understand how this film gets a 2 out of 5 rating. I loved it .. I've seen his other films, and they were too funny, but it really is one sticks out in my mind because of his sense of humor .. I just can not say enough about this movie. I look at it is not on a periodic basis, but it is never enough for me. People who play the homeless compared to the ridiculous standards too. Please put this movie on more often. I can not see it enough..Leslie Ann Warren was also another favorite of mine since Cinderella. I always thought that it is not really funny, but loved her action. In this film, she was very funny..and her and Mel did a great job together. They should pay more of his movies on tv.
