Obviously, that was not a huge budget of this film, which is definitely inhibited the production. But the story and the ending was so hard that they have done for many. I mean hard on Ju Dou level and other (large) Chinese films. I first saw it when I was 14, I ran home and asked God to forgive me for everything ...
