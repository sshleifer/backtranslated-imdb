Most people would say that, if one were to spend Saturday night to watch a movie, you have to be very boring. In fact, I just got home from that, and turned on the TV and there it was, "Field". <br /> <br /> I missed the opening credits, so I do not know his name, but I saw that he was Cheech Marin in it, so I naturally thought I was set to "Born in East LA -Andzhelese "When I saw him talking with a talking parrot, I was ready to dismiss it as a flop movie they show late at night. <br /> <br /> Happy to say it was better than that. As you know, if you have not lost Paulie and trying to get back to its original owner. It seems that it took years to find her. What should be an advantage Paulie is actually dis-advantage means. People come through competent parrot and all they see a way to make money or get benefits for themselves. <br /> <br /> While the character Cheech Marin "is" to make money from it, it does not mean that to him. Dance sequence with parrots are what kids will find cute, I found them amusing. <br /> <br /> Paulie, who naively "learns quickly that not all people are good people. Especially the owner of the animal research laboratory. Man lies to him saying that he would help him find his master until he helps in its communication on animal studies. Paulie is now delayed, but decides to make a fool person to demonstrate other vocal ability Poly. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film Paulie tells his story to the objects of the janitor, who is finishing his release, several other animals and find the whereabouts of the owner of Poli. It is a touching reunion. <br /> <br /> 8 10, scene clipping wing must be assumed, and not shown. This part may disturb young children. Otherwise, this is a great film for older children and adults who have a child at heart. (END)
