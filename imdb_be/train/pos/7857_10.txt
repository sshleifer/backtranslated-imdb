This film does not cease to be engaged and move, even in 2008 to an audience only familiar with current over-produced sound and computer techniques to improve. <br /> <br /> Experience cinema goer in 1922, who could only see in the movies with others on your big screen, must be really deep and completely satisfying experience. <br /> <br /> you need to ask a filmmaker could do today two o'clock silent film and make it interesting and the achievement of the same structure and the pace of balance in this film is. Silent film creation was pure art, it had to keep the attention through its structure, direction and action - there was no indentation with more words or distraction of the computer. Poorly made or uninteresting silent film unwatchable. <br /> <br /> This film should be placed in context for those who might be confused with the mention of Christian themes. This is not a film «Christiany», he does not sell anything. These topics, along with the reference to the current moral standards often appear in this era - the same church meets on Sunday was a national past time, Christianity was given in most families, so the film only shows a normal life, as it was then . Topics have rang true and deep at the time. <br /> <br /> This is the most strange, given the strong support of a good Christian thought this particular movie (and not preach the religion of anyone, only emphasizing the difference between the hypocrites and honest), that in 1922 the pastor in an open discussion with a representative of the film industry with a large Pickford crowd condemned as an example of immorality, together with some others, he called. The New York Times 1922. <br /> <br /> Perhaps they watched the film, which also came out in 1922, and learned some lessons. <br /> <br /> The pastor complained that the film industry since the beginning of church attendance declined 500,000. The representative of the film in the discussion, however, the following observations were made; that the interior of visitors also fell, which was much more pastors in prison than actors (fact), and that the choice of a few examples among many, was not representative of the whole. <br /> <br /> Thus, there is a constant battle between the church and the film industry during the early days of film. <br /> <br /> This is a great film about the honest and faithful to family and friends to be willing to sacrifice. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, courageous, full of happiness and joy, faithful, with sense of humor and silent sacrifice - though poor and uneducated, she represented the ideal character. This, however, will not reverse our throat, but revealed bit by bit through the film. <br /> <br /> This is reminiscent of some of the modern Chinese films where the characters slowly, listlessly shown during the film, and it is this rate which creates a strong connection with nature. <br /> <br /> It has a smooth, even pace in the first half, which builds all the elements for the last section. The last 30 minutes making the film, and it should be borne in mind, this was achieved without the use of sound, start a dialogue - this has been achieved by skilful action and great directing. Sometimes strange to realize that at the end of the film you can not hear a word spoken, but it feels like you've heard it all. <br /> <br /> supporting cast put in great performances especially Gloria Hope Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes of the typical Pickford understated humor, as it goes beyond the pretext of sweeping snow, an almost perfect balance and ends. This particular type of touching humor, which should not be underestimated. Chaplin used this device frequently and copied some of Pickford. <br /> <br /> Another special observation to make about silent films and especially Pickford films is that the star is often necessary to hold the camera for much of the film's audience without becoming exhausted or bored with actors overexposure. It Pickford, as a rule, carefully in the spotlight for most of her films, but people still can not get enough of it, is a testament to its excellent acting skills.
