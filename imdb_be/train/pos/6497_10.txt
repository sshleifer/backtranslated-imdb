I must have seen it dozens of times over the years. I was fifteen when I first saw it in B & W on the local PBS station. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD set for the children to see, and I do watch them. They do not teach history in school, and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century. This enhances their critical thinking. <br /> <br /> impartially, with participants from all sides, which explain in their own words what they have done and why, he detailed that leads to war and the actual war. <br /> <br /> Buy it for their children, as well as America Alistair Cooke. Be careful with them and make them understand. You'll be so glad you did.
