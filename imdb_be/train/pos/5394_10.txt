I was absolutely fascinated by this series since Tom Long entered the shot - the whole "bad boy" thing, it's just a habit <br /> <br /> The story has you hooked, what will happen next. - Joey will get the girl, in the end, after the 5 years in prison, and all the while thinking about his lost love, again crossing the road with her, finding he has a son ... But he's a tough bad guy, you still you want him to find happiness <br /> <br /> A really exciting two stalls. - please bring it to the video!
