Outstanding efforts for the Australian shows. which is probably not surprising seeing as it seems, to some extent the revival in Australia as a drama. I dare to compare this show with glitter love my way? no. but it reminds us earlier secret life. large cast, Gibney works her magic in the first two episodes, I saw a strong British cast and especially Callum Lizzie and signs. But of Foresight can be life-light (not that he needs to save) if this show is to get another season. I was not a fan of his work in frightening amazing time marks a mini-series a few years ago, but it was great as always greener at the challah. it is also good to see Brooke Satchuell again. It lets hope that the show continues to improve with each episode.
