He starts slowly, revealing the dull lives of two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, but did not give up on him. Nothing much going on, but time goes by exquisite, and there are many bizarre jokes (a favorite coach in the storm, which I find a paddle). The film is a romantic surprise in many senses of the word, the scenery is beautiful (as Polly Walker), as well as the resolution in the film is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> the movie takes a few liberties with the book, the biggest creature with Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester business, but I actually preferred the version of the film about it (it may be more sentimental, but I felt that it was in more in keeping with the tone of the story, and anyway I like the feeling when it is well done). <br /> <br /> A great movie, especially as the date of the film during lousy weather.
