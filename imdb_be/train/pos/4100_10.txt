«La Bete" by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the novel "Lokys" written by Prosper Merimée.Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel), American heiress engaged to the son of an impoverished marquis, he comes to destroy the family chateau and learns of the mythical beast bear ostensibly to scour the near forest. it is a legend that the former owner of the house (Sirp Lane) once engaged in sex with a perverted creature, and Lucy finds himself consumed by dreams of what had happened. "The Beast" is an art-house mix of surreal horror apparent immorality and porno.There supposed bestiality, attack and distortion in the priesthood, rich fake ejaculate smudge on the naked breast, masturbation with a rose and, most graphic of all the animal of the same name plays with incredibly large phallus.Still it really erotic film beautifully photographed and tasteless.The women are stunningly beautiful, and they are exposed most time.Overall «La beta" visual feast.Whether with the fetishistic attention to detail or visual reasons pregnant women with information probes, Borowczyk masterpiece should be observed with care and attention.A must see for fans of the cult of the European cinema.
