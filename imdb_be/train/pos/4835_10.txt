This is the story of the Siberian villagers from the beginning of the 20th century until the 60ties. It's about passion and feeling of the Russian soul, and very romantic. This film is not an action, it flowes slowely. In the second part, you can find great songs - Russian romances. It's much better than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this film moved to America and made a Runaway Train, for example.
