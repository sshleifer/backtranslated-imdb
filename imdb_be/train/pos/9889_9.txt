Read review Eric again. It perfectly described his own feeling for this film so than I ever could. I just write here and continue to encourage you to look up and see him. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago on television, IFC, I think. This is such a unique film, I feel free to do the comparison. It was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the barren tireless Koaguila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not the Sedona, like Durango, Mexico (from the movie John Wayne), but really harsh and wild place. I have to find a novel now to test in its place in history. How to place this film is amazing and wild and wonderful and strange and not for everyone. This type of product that almost motivated me to study film. <br /> <br /> I really did not forget this film, it is indelible. However, over the years, I have already forgot about its existence. I do not know anyone who has seen it, never read about it, and did not see any reference to it. Erendira such an unusual name, I even forgot the name. Well, I'll be looking to buy a copy now. <br /> <br /> ** Since I am above the wiring become a huge fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and so regret not having before him to read. <br /> <br /> Regarding MsMyth comments below; the film was shot in Mexico, but the author did not comment on Columbia and Mexico or Mexican history, in any case, although Marquez currently lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still desperately trying to find a copy of this film for my library. Like the movie? You have to read the story, and then everything else Marquz Garcia wrote. And by the way, the original place in the history of Colombia was.
