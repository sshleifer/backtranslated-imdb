Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jose Icherbi star "Anchors AweighÂ» directed by George Sidney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two Navy guys who are on vacation in Hollywood. They meet a young boy (Dean Stockwell) and take it home, they meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls on it. She wants to audition for Jose Icherbi. They are trying to help, but there is confusion. <br /> <br /> This is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly gets to dance with Jerry Mouse in perfect sequence. Grayson sings louver and my heart sings. Not one of my favorite voices, but she's doing well. Iturbi piano work is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Sinatra gets to show off his versatility and why the girls filed into the consciousness of him with those big blue eyes and a boyish face. For Kelly, it was a major breakthrough for him in the MGM. <br /> <br /> A great movie, very busy.
