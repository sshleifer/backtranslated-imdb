Always read Jim Thompson? He is a hard-boiled noir with the extreme fatalism and misanthropy I have ever encountered. There are rarely private detectives in their work - only those who are lost, psychos and small time crooks. This film has Thompson washed - "If God any real mistakes in this world, he gives us the will to live, if we have not received any justification for it." Each character in the remnants of the film on the razor's edge between the surreal and eerie realism. There is a sleazy, conniving Uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and spookily well-intentioned Doc Goldman played George Dickerson. Jason Patric gives an excellent, often heart-wrenching performance as a Kid Collins, not too bright, shy ex-fighter who is more afraid of himself than anyone else. Rachel Ward of Fay, sexy femme, we can not fully understand ... This is not your standard film noir, nor is it intended to be. After Dark My Sweet, along with Grifters, two beautiful adaptation of novels by one of my favorite authors, Jim Thompson.
