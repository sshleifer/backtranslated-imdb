I know that I would like this film, and I am for the most part, but also as a friend mentioned it's a bit long in the tooth. I also found that all the raging hormones of the male crew, to be a bit annoying. It is strange that they did not start panting and howling on satellites as well. I also have to say that the movie leaves me cold as a whole. This is a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. On the positive side effects of large (except for a cartoon monster), as well as effects, props, costumes and, of course, Robbie. If the robot has not been in this movie, I did not think it would be as popular as it was / is. The second half of the movie picks up steam as soon as we begin to explore the forgotten gadget to "Krell." As many times as I've seen this film, then Krell still leaves me scratching my head to exactly who or what they were. On the basis of what is produced at the time, to the same Â«This Island Earth," Forbidden Planet miles above the average Sci-Fi films of the time. Being filmed in color adds to its implementation. Of course, a classic in its own right, flaws and all, and deservedly so.
