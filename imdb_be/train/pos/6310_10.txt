Having the opportunity to watch some filming in the area of ​​Broadway Slavic Village, I could not wait to see what is the final version. <br /> <br /> To view this film in Cleveland premiere last Friday, I did not laugh out loud comedy for a long time! This is a big farce. The Russo brothers have done an excellent job directing. The entire cast does not perform his best comedic acting ... NO slow or dry segments of ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors, and it is great as a cripple safety switches in this film. I was the loan William H. Mays as the fold "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto" they keep you in the "trails". I believe that they have a funny role in the film.
