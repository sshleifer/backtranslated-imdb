This is one of the few movies where I think that the performance of the film will be an improvement over the original book. History is clear, accessible, fun and entertaining and musical numbers, no doubt, exceptional. I loved the cyclical performance of "Old militia" and the magical "Portobello Road", a large combination of early animation + actual method actors who, although dated detract from the charm of the sun. Background of the Second World War, he worked well and was not missed as the film started, which is so often the case in the stories of "evacuees." <br /> <br /> Often, too underestimated the film, it does not lead to the cessation of pleasure for people of all ages. Performances from the actors very well done, and all the text carefully linked and well thought out. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face!
