I just saw this movie the other day when I shot it, and I thought it would be just another movie with a girl, trying to prove a point, but Diana joined boxing, because she wanted to. I thought that this movie was good. I gave it a 8/10. Here as well. Plus the film with Rodriguez always good. Even there it was only six.
