Like most other reviewers, I first saw this film (on TV, but not on the big screen), when I was a teenager. My dad always thought this film very much and encouraged me then, and I have to say that it was not only right, but this film has stayed with me ever in more than 2 years since I saw him for the first time. I saw him two or three times since then (just a few days ago, I gave him another hour) and he did his influence over time is not lost. It has a large and well worth seeing the film! Manr respect Peckinpah's ride highlands as one of the first and later the best western that was a realistic view of life in the Old West, but it is unlikely, of course, the best film and was even fifteen years ago, if known Last Hunt. In fact it was probably 3 decades ahead of their time, or maybe it still ... <br /> <br /> While thinking, and of course, having seen 100s of Western (I love this genre), I can not think of a western as dark and depressing as this. Two people related to each other, partly by hatred, partly without seeming to have other options, surrounded by the beautiful Mrs. Paget, lame old man and a young Inian, leading a life of buffalo killers, until fate reaches for one of them. <br /> <br /> No one who has ever seen this movie can not forget his last and ending frames of the precious stone. If the camera moves on and from Mr. Taylor white buffalo skin comes into view (on the tree), and echoes from the past, when all the hatred began to be present again. Mr. Taylor received a buffalo, but eventually got his buffalo. <br /> <br /> In addition to the best performances of all involved, a smart script and great dialogue, it should also be noted that the last great HUNTING photograped, I saw seldomely Western, who shot well (in the direction of them directed by Anthony Mann, who also photographed all great), all the places that skillfully selected and even the soundtrack fitiruetsya picture very well. <br /> <br /> and director Brooks is really a great story-teller, Master skill! He made quite a couple of really great films and was successful in almost every imaginable genre, but even as a prolific career like this, the last HUNTING still shines as one of his best, if not his best. <, Br /> <br /> Definitely deserves a higher ranking, compared to 7-RIDE-the highlands favor.
