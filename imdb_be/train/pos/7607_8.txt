It's not a very good shot, well-written, well-acted, but it should be the most exciting show I've seen since Twin Peaks. Each opening is timed so well that you should see the next episode to get any closure. They even slowed the pace of the show, where they show only a small amount of information in the episode, but it feels like they just told you everything you wanted to know. However, some steps only of a terrible and some of the Novels downright brutal. Some characters are very two-dimensional. The more experienced actors like Locke and Ecko really stand out on the actor who plays Jack, Kate, Sayid, and so on. The development of the show can also be very frustrating as the next episode to show that the previous episode leads to. Annoying side portions have become part of history, which sometimes do not say anything. However, the second season has developed to the point where the rear stories reveal more about the island than they were before. Overall it a great show, but not perfect.
