The Summit should be 10 out of 10 for this film as it has everything. A great story, great fights, great characters and great cameos. <br /> <br /> This film sees a member wei take on Billy Chong and his fat. The summit takes Lau Kar Leung in the casino, the summit loses the fight, but that fight is full of high-paced action and comedy elements thrown in. <br /> <br /> some great and touching moments in the film, or the I Ching yin pops up in a cameo role and gets killed. - gutting <br /> <br /> end of the sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button, as its one of the best fights I've seen the final. The summit takes on a load of guys and ends up squaring to Billy Chow.
