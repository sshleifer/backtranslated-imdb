In today's world of digital fabrication, no computer, what can replace an actor and writer. Unfortunately, this type of "character-driven" movie too rare these days. Duval performance, as well as James Earl Jones is a true high expectations of its viewers. I wonder if this film was made for television? He has a "close-up" personal quality to the narrative. It is an understatement to say that the performances are all excellent. The only thing that keeps it from being a masterpiece of cinema is the lack of a big filmmaker, but not all the pretty pictures. How can a talent like Jones and Duval continues to produce such excellent work in the era when actors are to digitize?
