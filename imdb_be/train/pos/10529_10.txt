By no means is my favorite Austen novel, and Paltrow it was not my favorite actress, but I found the movie is completely fine. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and one who plays "Miss Bates' all absolutely stunning. Detail period not to alienate; the feeling of the film is just, actually. But the real "find" is the North as Mr. Knightley. There can not be more perfect molding, IMO. I hated Mr. K in the novel, but found it surprisingly human and humane in the film. Northam beauty and smile eye is not an obstacle to the enjoyment, either! Highly recommended. Anar
