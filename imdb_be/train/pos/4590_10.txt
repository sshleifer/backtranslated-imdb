Maybe the film itself is not one of the best films of Jackie Chan, but I think everyone will agree with me that the fight was one of the best fight scenes ever made at the mall. There has also been some memorable tricks that were so impressive that they made this film the action classic. This film had an impact on many other fighters, and I think that now the filmmakers the duration should learn from this film (for example, they could alter that chase scene, I have a thing with the modern technology that they could make it even better ). There were also some funny scenes that make this movie enjoyable, even if Jack did not fight. Althou I think they could have more fight scenes in the movie.
