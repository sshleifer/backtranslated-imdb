This so-called "feel good" movie, but it made me sad in a way. Why? Because I had the talent, but my parents did not allow me to study at the Academy, as well as the fact that at age 12, I decided to quit football. <br /> <br /> And football red line in this film. Along with the struggle of young people have with the expectations of parents have. British-Indian woman and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand, the English family with a dress that daughter as a boy, and playing soccer ... a combination that worries her mother! This film is also a line from the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in Britain. It's about believing in your dreams, and to live their lives one (where did we hear that before). <br /> <br /> Paraminder heating (beautiful women!) Playing Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and the typical 17-year-old girl things. At odds with her sister Pinky, Yasminda complete opposite. <br /> <br /> A real need is to see how the beautiful young girl fights with the traditions of their parents, and finds happiness in the end. With excellent music of Blondie from, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, as well as Indian hits. <br /> <br /> It's nice to watch, but if you, like me, have ever played football, and never made it to the top, then this film will make you melachonic.
