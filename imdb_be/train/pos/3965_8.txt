The film as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart perfectly as Chip Hardesty, with a well-done twists together with Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by legendary director Mervyn LeRoy, constantly checking and approving the script, as well as every aspect of the film, down to the clothes, carefully watched and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not what J. Edgar Hoover did not have much to be proud of. His leadership from 1924 until his death Bureau packed to the best investigators services in the world. But by 1959, Hoover was beginning to worry that ousted and has already started to collect dossiers on influential people, to be sure, and to protect his small kingdom. So he decided to make sure that none of the movie has not shown even the warts on one bureau. The film shows only the continued successes and failures glossed over that took place, and the Office of the witch hunts in the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with tongue firmly in cheek.
