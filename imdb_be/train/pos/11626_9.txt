This is an excellent, fast-paced thriller of Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street), which takes 85 minutes toward the supernatural and presents us with something even more horrible - evil human beings. We are much more likely to encounter a benign evil Jackson Rippner than Freddy Krueger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does an admirable job of presenting a sociable, friendly, even charismatic killer. Performances of Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire, uninvited) are shiny. Much of the film takes place on a very intimate level, between the two men, their eyes, their face. This is not the action of a small scale, rather than the broad sweep of cloth, and it is no less compelling for these restrictions. The cinematography is nothing special, though, of course, you can only do so much with the camera within the passenger aircraft, but the dialogue is great, the story of longing. There are no distractions, no podagovorov not confuse the issue, which is essentially a struggle between the protagonists. Retaining their attention and avoid distractions, Wes Craven is able to accept the fact that this is a very minimal plot and turn it into an exciting, fast-paced thriller.
