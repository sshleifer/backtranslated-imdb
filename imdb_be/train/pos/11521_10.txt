Wizards are a great ride from start to finish, thanks in part to the magic that is generated by the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades. Like any truly thin film is a journey in which the theme of redemption and of sleep. I can not believe that this film is so hard to find - I would have bought it on DVD in a heartbeat, but still find a way out.
