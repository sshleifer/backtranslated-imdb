This is one of the most amazing Datoiti film series because of the very unusual stimulation and the role that plays in the movie Ichi. Interestingly, this was the first film Datoiti with a new production company Shintaro Katz. Now, instead of just playing the blind swordsman, Katsu answers make films. This can easily explain why this film seem so different in style from the previous 15 films. Regarding the role of Ichi, the film is very different, because it's not in the movie as much as usual. It is also easy to deceive and, in fact, for a while, does much to harm people rather than help! <br /> <br /> «Dato Rôyaburi» Ichi begins with talking with his grandmother, who is trying to take advantage of his blindness. Oddly enough, in this scene, Ichi says he was blind small, although in the previous film, he says, that his blindness set in when he was 8. It's a minor error, and would only notice a crazy fan, as I . <, Br /> <br /> This film takes place in a period of not less than six months, and is likely to have taken a year - so you can see what I'm talking about the odd stimulation. Most of the films in the series will take place in a matter of days or weeks. Ichi is coming to town, where there are a host (Asagoro), who is trying very hard to be nice to Ichi, because he knows about the reputation of the blind. The boss is very charming and surprisingly Ichi totally got into breaking. At the same time, he meets another boss (Shushui) - a kind of guru for the poor. Shushui teaches people to renounce all forms of violence and even Ichi falls under its teachings - the rejection of his blade for months. Shushui doctrine very similar to the Taoist teachings of China - non-violence and acceptance of life as it is (good or bad). <br /> <br /> A few months after leaving the city, and thought everything was fine, Ichi knows that as soon as he was gone, Asagoro showed his true colors - the oppression of women, the poor and oppressed to be all-around jerk. In a way, Ichi is responsible for this, as he helped Asagoro and considered him a friend. Now Asagoro captured Shushui and several innocent people killed themselves because of the actions of the evil boss. <br /> <br /> If Ichi returns, it does not automatically recognize that Asagoro is good or evil, but feels it is reasonable. This bit is stuffed with inspired and leads to the final, where, even, Ichi kills villains and frees Shushui. This finale was very good, and there was in the rain. Then the final scene with rocks and Asagoro great, though the decapitation is a bit cheesy by today's standards of special effects. <br /> <br /> Pros film that, although there were bad, it is different and can not be mistaken for the previous 15 (which often seem to be very similar). In addition, it ends very well. Disadvantages (except stimulation) is that some of them may not like to see Ichi so wrong and the scene with Ichi and other Blind, which are included to the comic fall flat ... very, very, very flat. They are sticky and unfunny ... it is a kind of flat, it's there.
