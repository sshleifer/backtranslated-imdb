The concept of Laurel and Hardy, this time in the role of smoke works surprisingly fun. This ensures some funny situations and silly antics, especially by Stan Laurel, of course, as usual. <br /> <br /> The film also has a scene with peanut professor, who works for the rejuvenation formula. It really does not sound like a logical combination of storylines and incoherent, but both story lines merge in perfectly to a memorable end. It's still a little weird, but funny nevertheless, so it works in the movies. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast of the film is surprisingly good. Sam Adams big as the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield is magical on-top, as the Nutty Professor. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with some fine synchronized and fun built sequences that are predictable, but became fun to watch, though, because of the way they are performed. All this helps to make the "dirty work" to be one of the best Laurel and Hardy shorts. <br /> <br /> 8/10
