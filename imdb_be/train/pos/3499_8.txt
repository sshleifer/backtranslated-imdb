Raising Victor Vargas movie you must see. It was a very heart felt and had a lot of humor that gets you sucked directly. It's just like real life so that teenagers have to go through. Victor, defiant teenager, but with a good heart in the end deals with love in all the right places associated with girls and family. In the end, Victor learns the true meaning of love after the deal with the old-fashioned grandmother and the girl he wants to use to actually use it too.I recommends that people watch this movie, because it is like you are watching a real family. How much sense of this film is. One heart felt moment was when my grandmother Victor throws winner over something simple. Victor was really the heart and could not believe that she would do something like that. It made me feel real sorry for him, as it was real. Overall, I give this film B +
