This is an extremely-powerful based-on-true story movie that can be infuriating to watch. I say this because, as the brutal persecution of the press can be for the people, in this case, an innocent Australian pair is accused of murdering her child. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep won great acclaim for her performance, when this movie came out but I thought that Sam Neill was just as well. Let's just say they were both wonderful, but the role was a little harder Streep because she had to study the Australian accent. (She had learned that so well it was hard to understand it in parts.) <br /> <br /> Without giving anything away, all I can say is that this film will wear you out emotionally.
