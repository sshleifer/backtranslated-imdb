There is such rubbish on the channels of cable movie that I hit a stone with this. From start to finish she grabbed me and deserves the highest rating. <br /> <br /> The father of two sons to hear messages from "God" to kill people, which he said are "demons". <br /> <br /> If the opening credits show the director of one of the actors, which often can be a warning about a bad film; Exclusively here is the reverse of non-stop drama from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> And not one moment in the film when one is not fully captured by, as there are no unnecessary or excessively sub-sections, and the script of the first class. <br /> <br /> All the actors give very strong performances especially leading child actor who is exceptional. <br /> <br /> This film is at least as good as the likes of "Silence of the Lambs."
