This motion picture is steady, haunting pace backed by a large current (one of the best performances of Chamberlain) and a story that is revealed to us for a long time. <br /> <br /> In addition, the musician completely sets the mood and helps in maintaining a difficult, careful and somber tone. <br /> <br /> history Weir amplified by natives, their history and their tension with the dominant white population, to deliver a fantasy tale that ominous. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that they have no relation to the story and the genre, it is stored is the same feeling inside me like Ursula Le Guin in the "lathe Sky" (1980). < br /> <br /> Â«Last wave" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. Remember that "breaking and cutting" does not make the movie, horror film, a psychological element of fear and awe that lies within us all.
