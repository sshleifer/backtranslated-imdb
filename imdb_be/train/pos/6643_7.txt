When I heard that the film went on the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I found out that it was a book written in 1978, I had to read it before watching the movie. I am confident that the film would have been very different for me, if I had not read the book. The authors really did a good job staying true to the main plot of the book, with minor differences, of course. I think that I did not like most of the film was Boyle plays the role of Colonel, I'm not a big fan of Boyle, and it seems that no matter what the mood of the film, she always tries to use it for -plumped lips grimly makeup- Ed's eyes, to make themselves seem to be super sexy. In fact, I think that the movie is true to this horror house. My favorite story was the Sheehan family (which is so weird b / c the son was killed in Iraq, and current events there Casey Sheehan, whose mother went to a huge anti-Iraqi tirade). In the book, it is clear that the war was not Iraq, as in Vietnam, and when the house is transformed into a son of this video in a helicopter, I'm really creeped with. Overall, I was impressed with the film, that he followed the book very well.
