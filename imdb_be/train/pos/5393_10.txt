I'm probably one of the few Australians sun watching tennis when the series aired. I must say, I was first introduced when William McInnes, however, that this is one shitty actor! But as the series went on, he softened his work, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. He was such a rotten guy, but he did not tell me. I watched the show, to see Hugo Speers (Heart and bones Full Monty) and Tom Long (Seachange, two hands). It was interesting to see Speers play well, calm person, and even more interesting to see the rippling muscles of Tom Long! Sigh ... Seriously, Long's performance was a complete shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sachs was also good in a small role, and leading actress put in recreational activities. I would recommend this program if you enjoy stories with a twist and watch Tom Long walk without a shirt ...
