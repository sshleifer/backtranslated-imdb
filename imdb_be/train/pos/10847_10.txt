I am 60 years old, guitarist (lead / rhythm), and for the past forty years, I have been in four bands, it's all there, the fights, the confusion, rotten food, the worse the housing, always traveling, with little or no money, and everyone was drunk or high. However, the clubs, the fans, and the music made it all worth it! Just like Strange Fruit! I'm too damn old for it now, and arthritis in the hands and thighs do not mean no more rocking, but the length of the video, it all came back, and it was all there! Birds, fighting and drinking! And I was young again! This is the same as the voice of Billy Connolly God loves, that 70 things! Rock On Forever!
