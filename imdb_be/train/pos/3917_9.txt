I first saw this film when it was released in the US I've seen it a lot in 1984 and many times since then. What strikes me in the film is the inclusion of art rehearsal in life heroes, and vice versa. Throughout the film, the two intertwine and sometimes one is never too sure if someone looks at the life of the characters or the scene of the rehearsal. This continues until the climax of the film. All these years, through my friends and I still love to discuss whether or not "Carmen" in fact killed in the end. From the reactions of other characters in a stylized murder, it is open to discussion. Passion Dance, quality action, love of art and performances shine all combine to create a wonderful film that, once again, the mixture and spins the line between life and art.
