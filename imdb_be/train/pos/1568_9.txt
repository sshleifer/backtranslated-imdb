Catscratch is the best thing to come out of Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This show is not only an appeal to the Maori and Pi. Some people love it, and all of them Australian. At first sight, I admit that it seems to be a little rough, but it grows on you very. In addition, to correct that one of the other critics said In_Correct (Tv.com) does not say, "Does this mean that you're a homo right now?" He says, "Does this mean that you are gay, Owww?" It is his phrase in the show. Mr. Blik is, I think, the funniest of all, as the Playhouse Peww-Weww in <br /> <br /> First, I recognize that early episode was a bit good. But after a while the episode was great! And only then, when it found a number of surreal, fools ... Nickelodeon cancel it! <br /> <br /> I know that Nick is designed for children, but every once in a while it seems a brilliant show that can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults. These shows include the animated series Mr. Bean, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, Rocko's Modern Life (at times), and Invader Zim. All this should be considered very good, except Catdog, because Nick felt the need to cancel them. <br /> <br /> What I like about the famous final scene where Gordon fight a duck. <, Br /> <br /> I would also like to see a DVD, with a large number of audio commentary and behind the scenes docos, and including the last episode. <br /> <br /> But, of course, that I Â«d like to see defined the show will be back on the air. Wake up to the CPP! <br /> <br /> I wish there was a list somewhere on the Internet, with all the plugs closing credits. That would be great.
