This film gives us an interesting reminder of how easy it is to have so much to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing. We, as people of African descent owe it to yourself to make a change in the cycle of "all talk and no action" and to begin to understand in order to make a change, there needs to be less talk and more action. This is a powerful statement of our nation divisions over minor problems, and our shortcomings, to recognize the big picture and the need to unite in order to make a difference ... In spite of the links to the black community, all the audience can learn something from the message, this the film is trying to portray.
