Story then goes into high gear as Tom & Jerry (cat and mouse), but added with a dog chasing after a cat. The entire second act D.A.N.G.A.N. Second place (can be translated to English as "Pinball RUNNERSÂ») on the chase, and the chase continues to the point that by the end of Act 2, ass forgets why he was running away, and the yakuza don 'remember which of the 2 guys he pursues, he remembers why they run away. <br /> <br /> as the later film postman BLUES Sabu, the greater part of the film just all chase and action, with a lot of physical comedy and black humor is injected to keep the audience engaged. That falls short of this is the end to which the pursuit is terminated when the three men out of steam, and in one of the most chaotic Mexican Standoff you will see in the film, which looks as if Sabu paid tribute to Tony Scott's True Romance (written by Quentin Tarantino).
