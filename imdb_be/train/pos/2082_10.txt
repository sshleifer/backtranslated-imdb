The first time I read a wonderful novel by Pearl Buck in my ninth grade history class, and I enjoyed every page of that exciting. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would get it, and the fact that it was done in 1937, the results are excellent <br /> <br /> Some things have to be taken :. In 1937, there was no question of casting Asians actors in a major Hollywood movie. In a sense, this makes the final product much more interesting than if they were able to use a more authentic view of the actors. <br /> <br /> With this hurdle to overcome, executive producer Irving Thalberg and directed by Sidney Franklin (among others) too lazy to manually choose the perfect and star cast. Paul Muni plays Van Loon. Mooney was at the peak of his powers as an actor in this period, and can play almost anything he put his mind. Once you get past the make-up (this is good, but no one is really going to confuse him for a Chinese person), his work has all the credibility of his best work. <br /> <br /> Then there Luise Rainer. Coming off an Oscar win last year for her performance in the Great Ziegfeld star Viennese actress was on the rise, and she got an enviable role of O-lan, despite her lack of experience in Hollywood. Her performance won her second consecutive Oscar for the first time in the history of what happened. <br /> <br /> Most of the criticism stands by Rainer, and her Oscar win here. She was named one wooden and notes. There is a small grain of truth in it. However, that, as they say, all you have to do is go back to the book. For by Rainer, but not Chinese, O-play areas pretty much as Buck wrote it; it's actually a great performance, and one of the best translation from the book to the screen I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, and it was MGM. They had the largest list of stars and character actors in Hollywood at the time, and a large budget to pay for the best, and in the end they got the best. <br /> <br /> The film softens marriage Wang Lung, to On-LAN number. In the novel, with lots of come lust of the flesh, and he takes on a concubine, a move that devastated his wife, but her feeling just a woman does not touch him. In the film, he confessed Wang Lung returned to his wife in front of two pearls death he took from her years before realizing too late that she was his true love. <br /> <br /> Corny, yes. But this is Hollywood. Given the obstacles, they were against it, the film could well open to the screams of laughter. But, despite the noticeable lack of real Asians in the cast, this film is worn remarkably well over seventy-three years. In fact, the most surprising thing in this movie is as good as it could have been so easy to crash.
