This is one of those unique horror films, which requires much more mature understanding of the "horror" of the word in order to be appreciated. Major people can not understand that this story is told through a little boy's point of view, and, like most young children, it gets easily scared. Mainly because he just does not understand things like why his father hardly ever for him. From watching the film you can see, my husband was arguing with his wife, the balance between work time and family time, and you can easily understand, but the little boy does not. In addition, it is possible to imagine that the boy, afraid of the forest, as it is established early on in the film, that the family is out of town. In addition, at the beginning, as the family goes to the house they hit the deer and then get picked up, they argue with the locals about it and a little boy, of course, does not find it a pleasant introduction to the forest at all. <br /> <br /> Â«Wendigo" is ultimately that of his young, innocent mind fabricates to explain it all. There is an American Indian legend, but if you look at the scene where a young boy hears about this, he explained, both directly and simplified. Not because that's what Wendigo actually, but because he understands it. When you look at a movie from this point of view, you can really begin to appreciate it. Obviously, this was a low budget and cheap shot, but jumping the installation, the use of light, and the general horror more than makes up for it. And the last question, the film asks: is it all in your head, or is it really there? 8-10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: bad language, violence and sex scenes
