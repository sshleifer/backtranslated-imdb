This film really deserves more recognition than it is received. It is really amazing and rich drawing blood ties, favors and preferences in the criminal world. The film is shot beautifully, and you go into all the classic themes of crime, such as treason and power. This movie is a movie cinema lovers, it requires attention and understanding and awards in full, in the end. This godfather of Hong Kong and is a welcome change, and not another wire frame of fighting, martial arts epic, which seems to be the main contribution to the world of cinema of Hong Kong and China. It has a great location characters, actors and development, although to be honest, I had to watch it twice just to nail down what's going on with some of the characters because they have so many interactions in the film. All in all 8/10 plot Great heroes, but there are signs that do not stand out enough, and the music does not really get me going, and sometimes I felt that it was not really synchronized with the action (there is action on the part of the way), so that It loses some points for that.
