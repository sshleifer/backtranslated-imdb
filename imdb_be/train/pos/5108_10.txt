This is my favorite movie continuously. Earlier, my Friday night movie with pizza and a bottle of wine when I was a bachelor. I first saw this movie with my aunt and sister Brend Chasity. I was in the 2nd grade. I fell in love with Travolta and Sissy was my best friend. I have read a lot of comments about why Story left and Cisse both Sissy must "learn to act" in a marriage. But let's go back and look at it for a second: SPOILER - My interpretation of the film now, when I was eight is about the relationship Bud & Sissy takes a turn for the worse, because it makes him a fool in Gil's riding a bull. They get in a huge fight. The embryo is trying to do Sissi jealous by asking Pam dance. Sissy thinks that two errors will make a right and Wes asks her when "she needs any help." They are all on the dance floor acting like fools when Bud asked Pam, "if you're going to take me home and ravish me?» Pam says: "If ever you're ready to Cowboy." Whether it goes home with Pam in her apartment in downtown Houston. Which Dad bought her with his oil money and "all that this implies." Whether it is the one who deceives Sissi. Cissé awaits Bud, when he returned home the next day. Sissi is one who leaves bud. Then it to Bud, to prove Sisi that he is a real "cowboy" and bring her back. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is my interpretation. Everyone has their own I'm sure! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> And believe it or not, I'm a real cowboy! I love it too! :)
