I chose this one on inspiration from the library, and was very pleasantly surprised. Many melancholy expressionism of the camera, as a hard scenario, and two wonderful actors all blend together to make a very thin piece of film. Not for the reptile brain multiplex, but rather a true fan of cinema. If Hollywood ever really get their dirty hands on him, I'm sure it will destroy it. The choice of treatment all the way around. Other posters are more than convincing to sing his praises, so you need not worry about duplication of their odes; simply take their advice, and mine, and do not miss this gem. Call it what you like; I call it two o'clock entertainment, well developed. Read my lips: do not miss it.
