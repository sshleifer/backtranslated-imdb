If the Lion King was a version of Disney's Hamlet, the Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata version of Disney's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. As well as filling the film Tom Stoppard, we get to see the action from the point of view of two minor characters from the original: Timon, in meerkats with a penchant for intruding into song for no reason, and Pumbaa, the warthog problems with flatulence. Following their history - and not Simba - we will see why all the animals bowed as Simba was provided by Pride Rock. We learn that forced Timon and Pumbaa decided to follow Simba return to Pride Rock to displace Scar. And we see how they were dealing with a hyena once and for all. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but he was ably supported by Ernie Sabella as the First Ukrainian International Bank. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg reprising their roles. Kavner and Jerry Stiller lend their distinctive voices of two new characters: the mother and uncle in Timon. The only downside is the constant stop-start-rewind fast-forward device that does not always help the progress of history. Having said that, there is a brilliant zoom closer to the beginning of the film. With more laughter than any other third-in-a Disney movie series, Hakuna Matata is worth watching - if only for a hot bath scene, which is still funny, although a bit predictable.
