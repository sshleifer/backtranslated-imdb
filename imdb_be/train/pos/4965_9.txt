Of all the football movies that I watched it one of the best 2. The second step is a fever. But the hero of the greatest World Cup ever, and so perhaps also the greatest player ever to play in the World Cup, Diego Maradona. The story is centered around it, mostly, but also revolves around the other giants of the game for a while. <br /> <br /> The score is evocative and images are powerful. Narration Michael Caine suitably unbiased and quietly dramatic. This story is not about the individual championship games of the FIFA World; rather it is more about the emotions of players and the beauty of the event. <br /> <br /> Exciting game, France vs Brazil (one of the greatest games of all time) were covered in the same spirit. The final Argentin v W Germany was also in the same spirit. Highly recommended. Classical world football. to watch over and over again, especially if you're a fan of Maradona.
