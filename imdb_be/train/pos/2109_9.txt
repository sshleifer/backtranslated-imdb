Several times I went to see this, so I figured it was some kind of dumb, juicy dated romantic comedy. Well, this is a romantic comedy, and perhaps a little dated. However, it is not too sentimental, touching as it does on the themes of office politics, corruption and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything is exactly as you'd expect. But there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. When you meet someone who does not like this film, seriously consider how well you want to know about them.
