I'm a fan of serial killer genre films, and I think that this is a great entry in this category. In addition, Mary Giordano is easily one of the five best works of the character of Alice. It is quite memorable - as it actually exists. I have her on my side, too, if there is a mystery to be solved. It plays a role as she does with her real life, with full confidence in everything that she does. It seems sweet, honest, good ... just as it is in real life. So that acting? Yes, actually, it sort of rebel again. At this time, it is not bad, it's too good, and a little afraid to do things that seem to be above the law. But she does not do anything a normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends her time reading detective MAGS and solves crimes.

At that time, Alicia seemed to play the same characters: the rebellious, seductive, without parents, a loner. It happens here, too, but it's a little nerdy at this time. It does not matter; it's still cool as nerd. Check it out in the near future, or even Giordano will investigate why you are not ...
