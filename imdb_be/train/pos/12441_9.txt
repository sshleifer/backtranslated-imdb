It was humility that we did not know! He hinted at and are summarized in comics for the syndicates to sell newspapers! Ty and Janet Batchler were real fans of Modesty Blaise, received on December job - to tell the story of Modesty prequel that fans have never seen before. In his audio commentary, they admitted that they had made changes to its origins, to make the story work smoothly. The "purists" should also be noted that we do not really know if everything she said Miklos true, because it is "playing for time." I do not rent or borrow DVD, as well as other "reviewers" did, I bought it! And I do not want money back! I watched it three times, and I do not sleep! Great dialogue and well-drawn characters that I cared about (even the bad guy Miklos) as well as in the novels and comics! I also can not wait for the next Modesty (Willie) film, especially if it's "prequel" is a sign of what's to come!
