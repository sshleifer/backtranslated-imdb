It's a decent little flick made in Michigan, about a guy who is haunted by his past, with his abusive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen), and did not grow so well adjusted. In fact, it is quite crazy, but try not to be too obvious. He has the environment, too, his own little demons and angels that followed him around. The demon never says a word, but in fact, it is not necessary, and it is Max Schreck-awful. Let's just say that a lot of angel spins its wheels in this case, as Eric is busy things that make him feel better, as "storm" people, he decides it is necessary, mostly beautiful young women. It is worth drawing a degree and you're kind of on their own at some point, to figure out some of what is going on, but in general, I watched it from start to finish is very focused on the film, because it certainly held my interest, it's a little lacking in some areas, but I can not exactly put my finger. Decent effort, and worth a look if you like a serial killer movie.
