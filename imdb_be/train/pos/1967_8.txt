I do not understand why the reviews of this film is so universally bad, when I am not only from my rocker. I discovered that he was sick, shiny, twisted, and psychologically complex. You do not get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood movie than this. It has layers within layers, nuances of acting on the rock, and a plot that will keep you guessing, even after it's over. People need to get over the fact that 48 Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas not in it. I predict that this film will be a hit on DVD, as soon as people see it for yourself, and stop paying attention to the nonsense put out professional reviewers. Give him a chance, you might be glad you did!
