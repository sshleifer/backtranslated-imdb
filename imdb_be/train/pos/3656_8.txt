If you have any problems, suspended disbelief, then this is not for you. Think about it: a woman in late middle age finds a newborn baby in the cabbage and raises him as her own. Think about it; it makes no attempt to find the mother, which can also be confusing to teenagers in need of medical care and, it would seem, no one from the Italian equivalent of social services makes any attempt to put a child in the "care" (without any social services? I know now that it's fantastic). Before you know it ten or young Toto and his adoptive mother dies, leaving him in a children's home, from which it comes out happy person who loves everyone. In nothing flat he not only gave his suitcase on the person who stole it, but organized a local homeless in the bona fide resident of the slums and the encore, he leads them in the struggle against capitalism in the form of a businessman who buys the land on which slums stand when oil found there. It wants some swallowing without subsequent beginning of the "miracles" with the dead mother Toto (the old woman who had raised him, and not his biological) that is up to him and handing him a dove, which doubles as a magic wand, which allows him to give a modest wishes and A final, which bums fly to a better place, supposedly located somewhere over the rainbow. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film to here with charm and easily give up. On the balance of a small masterpiece.
