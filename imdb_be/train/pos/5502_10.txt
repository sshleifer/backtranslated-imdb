Is this film propaganda or a year (I firmly believe that it is not), it really shows the power of the media. The importance of this documentary to show how well a person, Chavez. It really demonstrate how Bolivarians seen, how it happened, the way Chavez to see it. While it may seem wrong and inclination to support the film, I think the view is shown in the film is quite legitimate. In Venezuelian people through the private Venezuelan media corporations saw only one side of the prospect of a coup, the neo-liberal part of. This film shows us the way in Bolivarians saw him. Call it propaganda, I say that it is a judgment call on your part.
