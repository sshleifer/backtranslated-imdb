Samuel Fuller brings his usual playful and stylish direction of the run-down, meaty stories and managed to create one of the undiscovered gems in 1950 cinema. <br /> <br /> Widmark plays a thief tough guy (a role he has perfected over the course of many films), which grabs the young lady Jean Peters) wallet (on the subway in New York, and with him a piece of microfilm so sought. It is one thousand nine hundred fifty-three so, of course, is the property of the microfilm Commie spies, who will stop at nothing to get it back. If a girl appears on the waterfront in the booth WIDMARK sent abusive boyfriend to return the film, Widmark feels the opportunity to shake her and her "comrade" down a lot of money. The plot thickens, people began to die, and Widmark Peters and fall in love. <br /> <br /> Fuller handles love story clumsily, but more of a feeling of indifference than bad writing or direction. It's as if it included a love story under duress and why did it intentionally unbelievable as love stories so often been, and still are in Hollywood films. Peters gives an excellent performance as a new hard Yawk biscuits, part gangster Molly and part of the damsel in distress. If violence occurs against it, we really care about her well-being, and it is typical for the renegade Fuller, ahead-of-his-time style, a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion. <br /> <br /> But the ultimate success of Â«Pickup on South Street" lies directly on the shoulders sated Thelma Ritter, who plays may, bold lady who makes money in any way it can, whether it's selling neckties or act as a police informant. Ritter gives the performance of his career; in an exciting monologue, she never passes directly appeal to it all the sad trajectory of the life of his character, and the hopelessness she feels to wake up every morning in a world of struggle, crime and misery. It is as if each character Ritter ever played converge for one brief moment to pour out all the emotions that they have not been able to express in these other films.
