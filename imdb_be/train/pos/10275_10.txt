Get ready for this: This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I rather not know about David Mamet (writer and director) of other works, but after watching this film half a dozen times (it's always a joy to watch), I can say without hesitation that he is a genius. This film is very well written, and quickly draws you into his deception environment, con-artistry and pushed back room. The feeling of the film is very similar to The Sting (1973), and it also pays tribute to film noir. <br /> <br /> This is a rather psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motivation of shady characters. It's a little predictable sometimes, but shocking culmination is always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> In general, the game is superb- especially actors Joe Mantegna-, but someone who I watched the movie with me noticed that this is not a good idea to heroine (Lindsay Crouse), which is not only a player smoker and a thief, but also sports a bad 80's hair. I agree, but I think she still outstanding in the role. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this film, the better, as well as the latest movie Mamet, The Spanish Prisoner, because it ended even more impressive. Just sit back and be ready to be taken for a ride on the movie, which comes dangerously close to a shine.
