This is not art-house cinema, this mainstream entertainment. <br /> <br /> Lot of beautiful people, and so on as well, and actions. I found it very interesting. It should not be intellectually stimulating, it's an interesting movie to watch! Jesse and Chase also funny, it's just gravy. Definitely worth a rental. <br /> <br /> So, overall, I would recommend checking it on a little Friday night fun with the boys, or even your girl (if she likes to see the other girls get it!) <br /> <br / > wicked good too. Vinnie, Corey large, hatian guy from Heroes. Very nasty villains.
