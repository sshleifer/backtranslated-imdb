It was the first "Walking Tall," a film that I have seen, I think, in a $ 2 movie theater along Hollywood Blvd. , So I did not have any reference to the first payment made Joe Don Baker. I remember how shocked corrupted County McNair system and cruelty "cattle gangs." I was also surprised by the fact that one person has decided that he's not going to let it slide, and went out to do something about it. Courageous? I thought so - until the moment when he sent a shiver my spine <br /> <br /> I think that this film is a great story about American courage to stand up and do something about the system, which is only serves its own interest .. I was very excited about it, and I think that this is one of the best films of the hero / anti-hero genre that would be laughable, but includes the latest films as «The Punisher», but even more because it is true story. The recent remake starring «Rock» just does not do any justice to the real fire in the history of Buford Pusser. <br /> <br /> A "classic" that I am sure will come to the surface again in the future.
