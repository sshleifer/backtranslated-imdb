Most of the comments were positive, but I would like to add that the audience should also focus on the sets. Set designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatment with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so on. Attention should be paid. The film presents the characteristics and symbols, which is very rich. All the actors were cast gangster - it was like seeing old friends and it was a pleasure. The dialogue was funny, but sometimes stilted far, and I believe it should have been. This is a movie film buff. This was done by the people, for the people who love the environment. Do not miss it.
