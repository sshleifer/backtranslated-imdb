... I saw it on cable in the late 1980s, when I was a big fan of the struggle since 1986, I've seen it on VHS in the bunker 'for sale' and bought it. <br /> <br /> In 1998, I started training as a fighter after the Air Force and always go back to watching it to see how it was a very accurate picture of the people involved in the fight (family and friends who do not understand us, travel, grief, etc.). Henry Winkler funny and sometimes sad to see, no one can understand what a genius he is creative. A great way to separate yourself character he played the Fonz Happy Days while. Also, pay attention to the plaster ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holliday (Alice), and fighters Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you get a chance to watch.
