Who would have thought that this little-known short film can be so memorable and touching? I'm really impressed. It's a shame that more people did not see. I loved as always score Hans Zimmer. And what is the directorial debut of Bernard Rose! But I'm wondering if I should call it a horror film. It can easily be argued that it is fiction or drama, as well. Well, in spite of that, I love explanatory potential he has. Each and every one of Anna (played by Charlotte Burke) dream is real conflict in her life ... the house itself, wood, Mark, lighthouse, etc. It's a lot of details, such as these that make the movie so good for repeat visitors to display. I hope that I have come across another little film as loaded with emotions and psychological sense, as some time in the near future.
