Despite the patronage of George Lucas, this fascinating and totally original fantasy in «Lumage» (through a combination of live action animation expressions) is about as far from the usual fare little children, like everything made by Ralph Bakshi in his prime. Brilliantly conceived characters, such as the shape change dog Ralph (one of the duo's awkward, rejected the hero), Synonamess failure (of The funny swears villain) and Rod Rescueman (pompous rookie superhero) to breathe life into a unique reasonable concept: Frivoli against Murkwood or the eternal struggle between dreams and nightmares. In this context, MOR-infused songs on the soundtrack should not work, but somehow they do. This is very unfortunate, because I had to look at it through the really crappy kind of load (taken from TV screening) uncensored version ?? there is also a softer version, which softened the language for his VHS release ?? since otherwise the film available on DVD. I wonder how Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on this painting in subordinate capacities.
