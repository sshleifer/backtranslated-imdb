There's something compelling and believable enough about this episode. From the outset, the atmosphere of tension created by the realization that some kind of planet is going to explode in a few hours. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy has beamed down to evacuate residents, all of whom seem to have left in an unknown direction, for an elderly librarian, except. <br /> <br /> polite but mysterious librarian advice about where all citizens have gone interrupted by the crisis, in which all three companies are members of the crew suddenly hurled at different times of the past of the planet. Kirk finds itself in a period of time, which is reminiscent of the 17th century in England, while Spki and Mack stranded in the desert, the frozen wastes. <br /> <br /> intercutting between the two stories, and a variety of dangerous situations people find themselves in beautifully handled, with a return to the present unknown chance, while the minutes of the countdown before the explosion of the planet. <br /> <br /> The image writing and in order of action characterize the episode, with a touching performance Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the ice age, and Ian Wolfe as polite librarian. Somewhat reminiscent of a classic episode of the town on the edge of eternity, this time travel story is a rich and compelling series finale, which ended one episode later. This must be one of the best of the entire series, is particularly noteworthy, given the usually low-quality third season as a whole.
