Adaptation of the book "search of fish." This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), which tells the story of his painful past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). Brilliant performance debut, Derek Luke and always stunning performance by Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This film was incredible on many levels, and I was disappointed that he did not win the Oscar, I think it's because it was released at the wrong time, so she was released. I highly recommend this movie to everyone you touched by his story, and it really makes the audience become sensitive to this young man who is Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you want an inspiring true stories, then look Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thank you
