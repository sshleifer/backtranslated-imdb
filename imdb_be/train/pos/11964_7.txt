I went to the movies in the afternoon, which is waiting to be delighted with the shovel. Fortunately, the film has surpassed all expectations, at least a little. Nothing heavy, nothing deep - and not anywhere as good as any number of real masterpieces Allen - but it is also quite pleasant light, teasing comedy. There's something like a simple and sweet about it. «Cute» was the word that I have heard from people in the audience as they were leaving after the show. It does not feel like Allen decided to create a masterpiece here, he feels that he would like to do a little comedy and have fun doing it. Compared with almost all Hollywood produces, the material Elena tends to charm. Even fluffy things. These days it's just refreshing to go to a movie made by actual people.
