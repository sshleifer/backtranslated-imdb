This film is finally on DVD in Italy (fully restored). I've seen this movie so many times, and I believe that even in these days of the actual (2003), when Italy again suffers from a kind of washing of the dictatorship of the brain (or the US for that matter). I am glad that there are rogue states, like the one played by Mastroianni in the film, who can sing out of tune; maybe they can teach Sophia Lorens of the world how to be strong and fight to be recognized as human beings <br /> <br /> Back to the film:., the majority of people here have mentioned the current great, but audio background strange. I have to assume that, unfortunately, something is lost if you do not understand Italian, but I can assure you that Ponte Machism, distortion of reality to the ubiquitous radio chronicle of Hitler's visit to Rome can really make you shiver! <br /> <br /> masterpiece! <br /> <br />
