On the basis of the preview that I've seen, I went to the "soul" waiting for a sweet comedy; What I found was deeply touching drama of family life is told in some of the most stunning photographic images that I have ever had the privilege to see. In addition, the latest reflection made me appreciate the sharp cut scenes from the past (in the arid areas of North China, as well as in the high plains of Tibet): is not it, how often working memory? At one point I was here, the next I'm in the landscape of the past, just so .... <br /> <br /> Not only did I strongly recommend this movie, I would place it among the two or three best films I've seen in my 60 years. <br /> <br /> By the way, a couple of years ago, another Asian "comedy" was released in the United States as «Shall We Dance?» (Japan). Just as with "shower" the preview did not give the slightest indication of the depth of this film, which was subtle psychological research (though full of funny moments). There is concern on the part of distributors, making films seem too "important" or "deep" to refer to the VS viewers?
