I grew up in that time, music was popular in this film. What a great time for music and dancing! My only complaint is that I was too young to go to the USO and nightclubs. I think it sounds like I'm living in the past (I have wonderful memories), so what is wrong with that? !!? World War 2 was a terrible time, except in cases where music was concerned. Death of Glenn Miller was a terrible sorrow to us. This film is my favorite. Cleo Lane was excellent; what a voice! I do not know how I ever missed this film. My main reason for this comment to prevent the current generation of Rap alternative and New Age music, which is offensive to me. Please see this film and give it a chance!
