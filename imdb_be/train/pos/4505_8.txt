Eskimo serious film about the cultural divide between the indigenous population and impinge white man. Although filmed in a documentary style, it would seem, with non-professionals, skilled production Eskimo containing a believable story the audience want to see the final shot. <br /> <br /> A native Eskimo simply have different beliefs and behavior of women and life, than do the whalers, who darken its landscape. If an Eskimo man loses its mate, it is natural that other people share their woman with her boyfriend. In addition, usually they want a woman to take the place of the absent husband. All this seems natural in the context of foreboding desert environment in the Arctic. Trusting Eskimo fall victim to fraud white whalers (heavy-European accents) that do not consider these natives their equal. Deception, drunken orgies, rape and death occur after the Inuit people go to work in the icy cold waters. In the end, leading Eskimo (Little) realizes that he has been deceived, and he takes revenge. The audience would have welcomed in 1930 theaters. <br /> <br /> Enter the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma to return to court Malaya. The stud is played as a sense of police, who know that it is not cut and dry case. Will Mounties get their man? Small rightly keep the code of conduct outside its traditional society? Is there a way that does not punish Small? Inevitably, the white man's law should prevail? Is there no hope for innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but one that you will enjoy the depth of the issue addressed in very different circumstances. I suspect that the shooting sequences with animals has been done up to now of the reservation that no one was hurt in the making of the film - so beware of initial sequences of nature. Highly recommended.
