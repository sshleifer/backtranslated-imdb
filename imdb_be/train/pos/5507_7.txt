I would not be surprised if pressure was exerted Soderbergh to avoid pre-revolution Cuba, both graphically corrupt as it was. Just saying some statistics are not going to make it with the younger crowd. However, one part of which is almost entirely filmed in the jungle, it does capture the feeling of the place, especially when passing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I liked the interpretation Del Toro face of Che Guevara. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, also did a great job, despite all the difficulties. This clearly Soderbergh not look at these people, but it is also clear that he was not going to plead their case to «yanquis» far from the recent past. Some of the most important historical aspects contrary to what I read. As far as I know, not the Soviet Union, Castro's court, while all attempts to achieve recognition by the United States have not been exhausted. But in other respects he is right on, especially in the looting of expatriates, as the island went to another rebel control. the treasury of the country was left blank.
