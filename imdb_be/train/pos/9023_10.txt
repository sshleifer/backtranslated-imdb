Very solid, gutsy image is part of the history of World War 2, that most of us had / has no idea in the United States, never happened. I would like to see it on video. It's only been shown on TV once, as far as I know, even in 89or 90. I asked about the film, and most video stores do not even know about it. Great actresses all around, wish I could see him again. Top series expressions.
