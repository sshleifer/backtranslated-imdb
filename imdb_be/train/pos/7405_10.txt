This movie just fine! It has everything: laughter, sadness, beauty, poetry, though. All in a simple but intense history - like life! You will not be distracted for a second. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Someone tell Hollywood needs a good story to make a good film, and there are so many good stories out there.
