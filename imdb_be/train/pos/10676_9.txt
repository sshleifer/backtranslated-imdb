This film was shot on location in Gerard Gardens in Liverpool, UK, and was the answer in such films as "The Blackboard Jungle." The film stands the test of time well enough, with all the moral stories more (or even more) important today. The film has some excellent work by some well-known British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays a cop Liverpool, intended for minor responsibilities in connection with the assumption that if you catch children at an early age, they are ultimately responsible adults. <br /> <br /> cameos known in the film include Freddy Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvin Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin Chow and Michael play brother and sister (they are in real life, brother and sister), who are caught in the net arsonists. Tsai Chin is still valid and can be seen in the final film, Nicole Kidman's "interpreter". <br /> <br /> Forced site has a gun siege at the school, so it is unlikely it will be shown on television after similar events in Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I lived in Gerard Gardens, where the movie was filmed (although he was not born at the time), and fond memories of the area. I recently finished a documentary about Gerard Gardens, which includes excerpts from «Violent Playground», and a small British film "Coast to Coast" which stars Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. Position were demolished in 1987 and movies in any way in preserving the memory of the living. <br /> <br /> There have been some complaints from residents, when the film was released as a film to reflect the area in a bad light. Time helped heal these wounds. <br /> <br /> A little gem of a film, I would recommend that you contact this
