I originally reviewed this film on Amazon for about 6 or 7 years ago and blew it. I believe I called it "unfortunate" and "turkey". Well, well, by most standards, it is still a turkey. He received almost no production value, what little plot there makes almost no sense, and the acting at the level of third-class games. Nevertheless, it really grew on me over the years, as a kind of camp classics. In fact, all movies directed by Todd Sheets had this effect. They are almost like Ed Wood, in this regard: to watch them again and again, and choose the failed line, continuity errors (the same zombies, two different places!), And other shortcomings <br /> <br /> I will. say: Letter a very nice guy, and at the same time, one of the first performances, not so great that it became better. And I should add that the only really decent actor / actress in a film Casey Rousch, although I may be biased, since I went to school with her.
