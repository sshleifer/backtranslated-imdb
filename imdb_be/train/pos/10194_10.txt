It would work much better if this was done, as the "Mitchell in Malta." At least we would have been deprived of sight of Joe Don Baker is running otherwise scenic Mediterranean area, dressed in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit ... not to mention already it acts as a Gunslinger The Old West. Mitchell being Mitchell, the film does not suffer from the lack of anything gratuitous cruelty of police. Oh, well. At least, humorous comments Mike Bots and made this a nice rate as the MST episode. I can not imagine playing it on your own, however.
