<br /> <br /> The oldest person works as a janitor in a mental hospital, to be closer to his wife, who is a patient there and try to get it. <br /> <br /> It is certainly one of the most neglected masterpieces of the silent era and the absurdity in the history of Japanese cinema. Long thought lost, the seal was found in the 70's and music added to it the soundtrack that fits perfectly with the pictures. This may have influenced the doctor's office Caligary (director Kinugasa claimed that he had never seen a German film). Nevertheless, he is superior to his style and in his more convincing (and chilly) depict the internal mental state of prisoners in a shelter. To achieve this, the film uses every film technique, which is available at the moment: multiple exposures and unfocused subjective point of view, tilted angles, fast and slow motion, expressionist lighting and alignments among others. This is also a very difficult film to follow, as it has not received intertitles. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the installation of rain shots, striking hospital window, the wind shaking the tree and thunder. Disturbed weather metaphor of the mental state of patients and to introduce one of them: a former dancer. The combination of sounds made by rain, wind and thunder serve music that incites dancer to get into a furious, almost hypnotic dance. In another sequence with the same patient to engage in another obsessed with dancing, she is under surveillance by other prisoners. Multiple dancer is a point of view and confused "performance" in the world. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples of this amazing film tries to portray a patient unconscious patients, and the view from the "normal" world. <br /> <br /> In three words must see.
