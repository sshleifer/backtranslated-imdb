My Al Pacino has never been in a bad movie? His name seems to be, for highly Imprimatur cinema. The same good performance as he has ever given. Pacino is the American Olivier. And this political thriller is as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its inexorable impact on people who think they run it. Not only is the performance Pacino convincing --- Eulogy at the funeral of the deceased child is a frighteningly powerful --- the film is fast-paced, gritty realism to it, which reinforces the excellent performance without resorting to subterfuge. This remarkable portrait of big city politics also possible to provide two o'clock the excellent movie viewing without excessive violence, sex or superheated gutter language. There is a murder. There are bad people. But they came across effectively, without crossing the line. The film, as it restores my faith in Hollywood exhausted. I do not award many dozens. This one richly deserves it!
