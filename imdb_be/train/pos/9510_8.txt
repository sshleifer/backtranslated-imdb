Winter 1931, allegedly 12-year-old Tyler Hoechlin (as Michael Sullivan, Jr.) asks that his father Tom Hanks gangster (Michael "MikeÂ» Sullivan) does for a living. Young Hoechlin should Mr. Hanks 'work' one night, and witnesses his smoking several rival gangsters. This leads - in a very roundabout way - "The Godfather" -type Paul Newman (as John Rooney) hiring independent hit man Jude Law (as Harley Maguire), to find Hoechlin and Hank, who have strayed from the cool his heels in Chicago, Hanks finds that they would be safe from the relative who puzzling when you consider the line work character. <br /> <br /> Looking uncannily like Paul Peterson ( "The Donna Reed Show"), Hoechlin does a terrific job of director Sam Mendes; and get the job done with the cast makes it a successful young actor in 2002, but the most surprising thing about the "Road to Perdition" is stunning cinematography Conrad L. Hall, who deservedly won a career capping "Oscar" for the ends of the photographer. The work of Mr. Hall really great degree. This helps to compensate for the overall impression of the measured, contrived entertainment both narrative and visual effects. Deviating end dramatically uplifting (unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned entertainment). <br /> <br /> ******** damned way (12/07/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Jude Law
