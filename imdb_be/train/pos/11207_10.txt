This documentary was nominated for an Oscar, and it's easy to see why. Even after 45 years, it's pretty great piece of work. Why not print a mystery that only Disney can explain. Good use of live action and animation in tandem. It is used to run under the Â«Vault Disney" every few months or so, but I did not see it on the list for quite a while. * Sigh * The most recommended.
