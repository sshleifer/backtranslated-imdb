After seeing this film strictly for power ratings of reviewers, I was most pleasantly surprised. Although obviously low budget, it bears the signs of intelligent ingenuity. For example, if Julia wakes up in a strange house and looks out the window, I thought that her sense of isolation will be increased with an external shot focused on her face, and then moves in the opposite direction to include the house and its isolated location. And lo and behold! The following scene was exactly what the last shot of the house stood alone on a rock at the water's edge. There are other examples of how clever director can take your movie to the level of a very enjoyable thriller. Savvy viewers must have noticed it, but need to be sure that they will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> As for the performances, George Macready it is usually very awful, barely maintaining his composure, while offering the ability to genuine abuse. Foch was surprisingly good as a working woman with no frills, who is not going to submit without a fight. But Dame May Witty, oh boy, she even had me doubting my own eyes and thinking that she can get away with their evil schemes. <br /> <br /> This is a real diamond in the rough, and not to be missed.
