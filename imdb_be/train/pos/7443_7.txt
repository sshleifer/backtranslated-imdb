The old saying goes: "If you think you have a problem, visit the hospital." It has been updated in recent years, "If you think you have a problem, watch TV talk shows ... especially the Jerry Springer-x!" This the film is one of those that is so bad it's good! That's why I gave him a seven-then everything is fine, but not great. This is a great way to spend 95 minutes as a daily talk show advertised as "the hour of your life, you'll never go back!" All familiar themes here ... invalid husbands / guys wild audience on television, women flashing Jerry, etc. . Shocker viewed Hagan, who usually plays sweet symbols ( «Seinfeld» and "Herman's Head") playing a trailer-trash mom and Jaime Pressly ( «My Name Is Earl»), as it is just a bad daughter, performing sexual services for virtually every person with whom they came into contact. men were presented (including the manufacturer of the staff) as the most significant lunkheads, who deserved what they got. I do not want to spoil or to reveal all, but the film plays like a daily show. Here in Phoenix, he showed back to back for two hours every morning and, after that, everything else seems to pale. Again, I give this film seven ... it's good, but not great. Jerry Springer is best taken in small doses for one hour.
