Beautifully shot, well acted, tight script suspense movie. If I was on the edge of my seat. I liked the lead actress very much and thought that the villain was very well done. Not much to chew on here in the way of themes, but if you just sit in a chair, turn off the brain, to observe the bizarre performance of the camera, and enjoy the story, you'll have a great time. The plot is well-worn, and regular movie buffs may know more or less what to expect about ten minutes. But it did not bother me, since I enjoyed watching it unfold. In the old days, they could not be focused so tightly only two characters, and there were some tempting moments when I was hoping that they were going to some other people have multiple lines. But these people were probably right to the film so much focus. The plot is in my throat quite early and never let go. This is not a good idea to think too much during or after the movie. since I'm not sure it makes a lot of sense. Just sit back and enjoy.
