Back in the day, if there was Marion Davies and her druthers, not only listen to Hearst, she made more films like show people, and was much happier. In fact, when you see her get her first big break in the two-reel comedy, she loved to do that in her career, and not such epics as if the knighthood was in flower and Janice Meredith. <br /> <br /> What you see on all the accounts in the Show People is a real Davis, a talented comedian, wonderful mimic and generous-hearted people. It can really identify with the character of Peggy Pepper Aki Patricia Prepoire, she put up with its share of pretense in her Hollywood star. <br /> <br /> If the plot Show people was established in the legitimate stage, you could call it a backstage story. I believe that this is one of the first movies about movies you could call it the story of the camera. Marion seeks young hopes, which arrives in Hollywood, like many others, looking at the big break. She wants drama, but its introduction to the film as a foil for parody comics. She gets his share of the pie and seltzer in the face, but recognizes her trade. And also wins the heart of a young comic actor William Haines. <br /> <br /> It really gets her first big break, but it does not come to Haines, as well as Marion did get to do a legitimate drama with actor Paul Rally, playing Andre Telfair, do not apply in any case count Avignon. Who here takes a shot on the actor Lou Telezhenom, lover and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others and hear tell, one of the most despised people in the movie. <br /> <br /> Show People was one of the first films to be Uninvoiced occasional appearance of stars as themselves. You can see people like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman, etc., just to be themselves and colonies around the film. This alone makes the film to show people worth saving. <br /> <br /> Show People also make good use of the standard song Tin Pan Alley, how we do not Got Fun, I'm sitting on top of the world, you will be surprised, California, here I come. As the film went to the peak of the sound is introduced, a song called Crossroads was put into it. This is not a bad number, but the credit is not given to a boy and a girl singing it on the soundtrack. I think because they are not seen, it felt entirely billing was not necessary. Nevertheless, I would like to know, and I'm sure you would, if you are lucky enough to see the show people. <br /> <br /> It is easy to see why Marion Davis liked this film and considered it a personal favorite. She looks right at home in this film, and her real life is the lack of pretense shines in her performance, which makes it a real treat for the audience.
