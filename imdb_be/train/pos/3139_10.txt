There are many kinds of reunion shows. One species, where old actors take out of mothballs and set out to recreate the characters, they do not play for twenty or thirty years. They have mixed results. `Return to Mayberry», despite some nonsense, all right; `Return to Green Acres', how disgusting (Eddie Albert used the word for the script, I will not repeat here, but both he and the stench of the film); `Rescue from Gilligan's Island" Fill in the required gap in the history of the rejected, though the show itself was silly even to 'Gilligan's Island' point of view. In most cases, the scripts are weak; sometimes stupidity appears in the script, too experienced ?? and comedy, it is almost always fatal for the characters to know that they are funny. New characters are introduced, which are not suitable mixture. Basically, this reunion show rather weak. The second type of 'reunion show "is a kind, where the cast puts his past aside, but sitting around telling stories, recalls, interspersed with flashbacks from the show. Then there is a film based on the exhibitions, which are rarely well; and a film based on the show's history ( `The Brady Bunch" had both come to him, with different results). <br /> <br /> `Return to the Batcave» uses almost all of the above, it is strange, twisted point of view, which makes it the best of the reunion show, and has raised the bar for others. <br /> <br /> Adam West and Burt Ward and caused to show the original Batmobile. Despite the fact that they are there, the car is stolen. <br /> <br /> Adam West is a movie people wisely. He named Jerry, his butler, Alfred '. He opens Shakespeare's bust in his apartment and discovers a hidden pole to slide down to the garage. He will receive a future crime fighter, when in fact it is simply washed actors. If the stolen Batmobile he not only believes that it is his duty as a crime fighter to restore it, it drags and does not want Burt Ward as his assistant. <br /> <br /> The chase pretty much talkative, with West and Ward reminisce about the old days. It is divided into `flashbacks with actors playing the West and Ward in the old days. Modern stage and `retrospective both have stupid lack of reality show supported. There's also the work fun, which show the West is able to laugh at themselves: in the book Ward about his time on the show, he spoke openly about West libido, and that he was a miser (West makes Ward to pay for everything in his quest, down to tips and the bus fare). Evidence they follow, the characters, they appear (even in flashback) all fit the mentality of the old series, and there are several honors, including a fist fight with the written sound effects. <br /> <br /> All of this is very funny and made on a large scale. There are also cameos Julie Newmar (looking like she was the one lifting too much) and Frank Gorshin, reminding us why he has such a cult. Gorshin will Riddler when Jim Carrey, his obvious successor, has long been forgotten. The film is based on the rather obvious, but funny climax. <br /> <br /> This show is a model for the reunion show ?? Unfortunately, there are few that can match the pattern. This show was cast replaying their old characters; young actors playing the movie about the creation of the show; Western actors and Ward remembered; and modern movies with Adam West plays a rabid, Adam West. It has everything. If you loved the old show, it's the cork on the bottle.
