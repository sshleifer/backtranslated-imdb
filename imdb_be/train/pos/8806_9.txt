I decided to see this film on its opening day at the national level in France as a personal journey for yourself to think about what had happened the previous year; a collection of works as intended :. it causes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions, working as an intellectual Hommage, never stooping to cheap sentimentality or a knee-jerk reaction <br /> <br /> There have been many statements made, that the anti-American film: while I can not speak for all in connection with this, I'm one American who has found such a statement, which is absolutely untrue. people are making a lot of noise about the Egyptian segment of Shahin because the voices of the prospects for Palestinian suicide bombers who claim that civilians in democracy "fair targets" they choose bombers government seeking to attack, but it ignores the many other things in the piece discusses some perspective, no one lingers as truth and criticism - even when they saw a piece - it seems to forget the love and warm dialogue that takes place between a director and the specter of American dialogue, and intense sadness director , Learn about the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Almost all films are beautiful, thoughtful and inspiring, in particular the brilliant work Mahkmalbaf, Tanovic, Loach and Iñárritu. Naira, well, as usual, effectively tells the true story of the injustice committed against a Muslim family as a result of anti-Islamic hysteria that swept - and still is sweeping - state. I found a little piece of Gita vulgar loud and right in this criticism of the media of hysteria in the face of terrorism, and a piece of Penn was too impressionistic and elliptical, for my taste, although I expected to like it. Borgnine is a very good and brave it. Spoiler: one reviewer below misread towers fall as a happy moment for the character; has read enough to make the towers fall that, because of its light floods the room, the keys of his loss in his life, he refused to recognize. Again, this is a kind of impressionistic piece, because we know that if the towers were really block the light plane, then there would be nothing of this man, but smoke and ashes, and not light flooding in through the window.
