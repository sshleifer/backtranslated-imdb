I saw this movie a few years ago, and I must say that I really love it.Jason Patric perfect for this amazing role it played.The director? I'm not too many things about it ... and I don "t care.The the script is good, it sure.In just a few words that I have to say about this movie, it's weird, odd, even dark, but it's good one.I saw him a few years ago and had never seen him so then.I want to see it again and again.I know I'm not going to get tired of watching it.The scene, the atmosphere, the actors, the plot ... all good.The the film should last longer .I think that 120 minutes had perfect.I hoped for part 2 of this movie.Too bad din't happened.Jason Patric: you are a man! a very good film. end. :-)
