Salina really touched me with his deep-drawn characters. Being a simple story about the rivalry between the two brothers, it was not just about hate or jealousy. What I really liked about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings experienced Gigi, especially when he had to take his mother back to his hometown in Italy, and skip the part in the festival film awards ceremony, his film was introduced in. To see this character, who fought so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so worried. Even at the end when he makes another attempt to reach his father was so brave. And as in real life, most parents can not get past their walls in order to reach their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo's brother, who, being more assertive and an older brother, so much insecurity. Really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry.
