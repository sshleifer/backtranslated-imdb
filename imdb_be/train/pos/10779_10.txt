Classic cartoon, always pleasant and fun. It has an interesting plot, complete with cute characters. Road Rovers this show is worth seeing, it is short of 13 episodes, and if you can ever control the chance to see it, you should. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios has to release a DVD, containing all 13 episodes. I would definitely buy it when they did, and when they do, you should buy it too. If you have kids who love dogs, they will love road rover! Road Rover should have received more attention while he was on the air, it was determined the original and very special show, which should have been assessed far more than it was.
