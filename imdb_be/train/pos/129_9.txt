With stunning cinematography and floss Kafkaesque absurdity, this film was to me a simple but exciting opening scene. The film plays just like a dream, and I think that may be why people either hate it or love it. Characters painted surface and the story itself is small and perhaps a bit pointless. But these defects of the film, but a conscious choice. Works film does not try to work as a story, but rather a deconstruction of war films of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> I have a problem, arguing that there was a lot of real substance to the cinema, but the film is such a cinematic wonder I was completely swept away. This is one of the most beautifully photographed films ever, and has a wild imagination in his own style. I can fully understand why people hate it, but I give it a 9/10.
