Thick streamers BUS This is ridiculous, the most original and interesting part of the job I've ever had the pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> This film is not in any case to Hollywood standards, or even that the street-in-video movie fluff comedy Terry "Hulk" Hogan, in terms of camera work, editing, acting, budget or anything else. <br /> <br /> what this film really is, though, it's very original and pleasant story, and this is obviously made by people who love doing this, and the enthusiasm of all the cast and crew really break through all his the budget and the current crash. <br /> <br /> This film proves that you don "t need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great movie, all you need are some original ideas and some passion for what you do. <br /> <br /> just the best movie ever. I do not care how you get it, rent it, order it, steal it, download it, just to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I just hope that they make a DVD-version.
