I found it to be a magic tool, it is very lively and full of fun. Except for a few major errors cast perfectly. I have to repeat some of the previous comments - Chynna Phillips terribly miscast as a teenager. In 27 years, she's just too old (and yes, it shows), and not enough singing "chops" to Broadway style of music. Vanessa Williams is a decent enough singer, and for non-dancers, it is adequate. However, she is not Latina, and its character is certainly there. It is also very poignant in all that becomes tedious <br /> <br /> The girl fan club of Conrad Birdie Sweet Apple really sparkle -. With special kudos Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I also enjoyed the performance of Tyne Daly, although I generally not a fan of his work. And finally, the Shriners are a riot of dancing, especially blunt three at the bar. <br /> <br /> a film for the whole family, and I highly recommend it.
