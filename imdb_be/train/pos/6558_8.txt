I disagree with the previous comment about the movie. I think it was cute and fun, and he carried a good message for young girls like my daughter. You do not have to dress like a cheap prostitute, to be cool. You can be smart and very cool, and all at once. <br /> <br /> I think the cast was good, and the story was perfect for the target audience. All in all my wife, daughter (10) and I each thought it was a good movie. I certainly recommend it. He also urged his daughter to start reading the original Nancy Drew mystery, which I am sure she will love much as I loved the Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> It was a struggle to get her to sleep tonight, because she wanted to start reading immediately. I can not think of a better result for this film than stoking interest in the classic series.
