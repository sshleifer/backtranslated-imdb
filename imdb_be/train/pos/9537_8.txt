Some believe that the rating I just gave a little generous, but for the fact that this film I think the director did a good job with this, they have been available to them, it's also a movie film of an acquired taste! <br /> <br /> My thought was to direct a direct link with the classic cult film «The Thing» that is, the parasitic aliens from Outta Space, man parasite-host, so you reek havoc wherever it's possible! <br /> <br /> You can see how this film pays homage to this film and others from the horror / gore genre, but skillfully maintains its identity, and these things to fight with each other for one and then continue to eat the fallen the enemy! Only murder and human choice when he needed a new boss! In order to then pick another fight with another infected host! And this film even throws in a love story, but I will not say no more than another it gives too much. <br /> <br /> GREAT! But, as I say, an acquired taste, so do not be surprised if you do not like this movie. This is a low budget and let's bloodthirsty, with the creatures / aliens / things morph his limbs in crude looking for weapons, ie saw, drill, blade, and even the odd gun for all but ruin the enemy there. I found myself cringing at what I am being shown, but at the same time glued to the screen, wondering what will happen next! <br /> <br /> So, if you like gore you, as aliens, you love to fight, and even maybe a little love thrown in somewhere, I have to recommend this film as a must see. I just wish that I have come across it before I did!
