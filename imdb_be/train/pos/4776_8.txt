I watched this movie on one of my usual time, the real real late at night. Usually, when the film does not interest me, I start to fall asleep and must raid the refrigerator, not to sleep. <br /> <br /> At first I thought it was something I had to do, because this movie is walking slowly began, along with the fact that his arrows have tended to stay with the character for a long time. But after a while, I'm starting to get more into the movie, as more and more revealed about the main character in his story. After all, you feel like you've known him all my life. The film kept my interest so much that I do not know, the sun was about to rise. <br /> <br /> Not much Bizzare Lynch's style, but there are quite whimsical characters to make the movie funny.
