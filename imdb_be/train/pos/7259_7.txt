As the rating of the program to view the film can only be 5.4? Just lovely young Alisan Porter should automatically start you at 6 if you decide your ranking. James Belushi is good too, it is a good first major role in this, I do not love him in anything but last night until this. He was very good in a band with Tupac, too. Kelly Lynch, you have to love it. Well, I do. I was just wondering what happened to Miss Porter? <br /> <br /> I gave Sue 7 Curly
