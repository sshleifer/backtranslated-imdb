I do not know how I missed this one when it first came out, but I'm glad I finally saw. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in and around the red light district of the nineteenth century Okabasho, Japan. He tells a story about prostitution, the caste system and women who are strong in a society based on the strength of the Samurai Code of Japan. <br /> <br /> It is definitely Akira Kurosawa! Despite the fact that he died before he could direct this film, his adaptation of the script of the show. His view of the world and the Japanese caste system is known, and sheds light on how these systems interact with each other. Symbols can be rotated around each other, but the caste system remains intact, if each character back to the world they belong to. Samurai warrior who drifts into the world of a kind and loving prostitutes back to their lives, while she embarks on another road with someone who is a part of her caste system..lowest low. Many appreciate the world of the samurai above all others, but nonetheless, it is lower caste people, who can support each other, and who can love without any restrictions. Samurai in this film is a weak one, while classless lovers are dear ones. <br /> <br /> The film deserves a higher ranking. This is a story of survival of women in feudal Japan. During this time, it was believed that people to be survivors..the strong and women were simply mindless and weak property. This film highlights the strength of Japanese women, and how they did what they needed to survive, and their strength has allowed the Japanese culture to continue as it has. <br /> <br /> I recommend Â«The Sea watching" for those who is a supporter of Akira Kurosawa and even if they are not a fan. This is a wonderful, quiet soul and supports movies, and one to be cherished for any movie collection.
