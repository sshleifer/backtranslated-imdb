Thank God it was not based on a true story, because the story is. Populated by heinous characters depravity knows no bounds, Before The Devil is fascinating, wonderful excursions to distortions that would be laughable (and sometimes, even - or perhaps because of - in nauseating tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction in all) if not carried out with such a wonderful, overwhelming conviction of their stars. Kelly Masterson great script and great direction of none other than Sidney Lumet will not interfere. <br /> <br /> The main dysfunction is a family character, with two important shut brothers (brilliant images with. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) decided to rob a jewelry store of his own parents, an attempt that goes awry pathetically <br /> < br /> the story is told with time shifts (which are marked on the screen, such as "Charlie: two days before the robbery," so that no one should be confused); Some people have said that they do not like this product, but I thought it worked perfectly, adding to skeweredness all cases, taking into account that the two brothers in question is unlikely to play with decks - you could not between them would make a decent poker hand to save his life. Throw in these bad extra tidbits: one of the brothers addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), which deals with another brother, throw in some monumental rivalry, however, that the said drug addict brother hates his father ( performance anguished by Albert Finney), who, apparently, caused him serious past pain, and you have Shakespeare / Greek tragedy on your hands. Be careful.
