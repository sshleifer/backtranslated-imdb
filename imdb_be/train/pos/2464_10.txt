One of the best movies-dramas I've ever seen. We do many things in the church, and it is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that the actors can do their work. I highly recommend this, especially for those who have interest in acting as a "must see." There are several scenes observations. On the one hand, the cemetery scene when Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows that the scene is just going to primary school) was very well done, and its interaction with the skull. The logic used in this scene was huge - I think Shakespeare's last will and testament most. For a moment, I loved the scene where Hamlet, Horatio and the character played by Robin Williams discussed the fight.
