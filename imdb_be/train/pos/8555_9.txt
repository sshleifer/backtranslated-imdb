* In the first place, although many say it is the worst of the series, I do not think this is true, given that perfectly reflects the 21st century teenagers .it mentality brings excellent opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good times teenager if you would like to have as much fun as it makes heroes. <br /> <br /> * I agree with the fact that this movie teens, but comedies are not currently expected that for teenagers? I mean ... movie theaters in the main places for teenagers to hang out; Plus, seeing a movie while spending the night or something like that, which is very good to have a good time. <br /> <br /> * Many comments about the amount of nudity in this film. Well ... let's really ... nya reflecting the thoughts of teenagers boys, like those from a movie? What would you like to see ... clever books, romantic stuff? that is not something that would be in the minds of teenagers ... <br /> <br /> * In conclusion, I think that if you're a teenager, you have to see the movie, and even if you are a real adult male or female you should see if you still have teenage mind or do you often think about what it was like to be a teenager, or the like. Thanks for reading!
