I usually do not advocate a strictly romantic movies, but I've heard it's good. I was stunned. Easily the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Excellent. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. Chemistry is flawless, this letter and directing. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphi such natural and sweet together, you really think that they were a couple. <br /> <br /> In the movie grabs you immediately and does not let go. You can not look away, and you can not stop listening to them. Even small moments just to ignite your heart. <br /> <br /> It jumped into the ranks of one of my favorite ever. Masterpiece.
