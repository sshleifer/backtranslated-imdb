I can not judge the film, because it works. There is enough of noir elements to consider is film noir, but I think it's only in the category. <br /> <br /> There's nothing sinister in this part, and this is where the noir elements fail. Of course, the disease can be seen as sinister, but I have a hard time seeing that. The film hints at a dark side: black may be illegal trafficking of people, police in New Orleans only too ready to arrest the reporter plague specter hanging over all the people in the movie ... but it's really only hints. <br /> <br /> there is no attempt made to question the motivations Reed as one do with Marlowe and Spade, and there is any attempt to bring the parties to the black man, which makes it even more dismissive when people turn was actually played. <br /> <br /> This lack of depth is that you can not film in the end. <br /> <br /> the story well, good acting, writing and direction is well done ... but there is nothing to make this film, you have to go back again and again. Worth seeing once, maybe twice, if you do not remember it from years ago, and then cleaning.
