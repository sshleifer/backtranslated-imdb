Hi, Im Scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love the film Twisted desire, and I like to watch Melissa Joan Hart at t.v, I think she's right. I'm a real fan of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, too, so that helped my watch it (do not ask). I love the way that Nicole plans to her parents' murder very carfully, as it is convinced that someone pulls the trigger, and practice on the bottles, so she wont give it away fingerprints (very well planned idea), so I believe it all backfire on by Nicole as she caught her old friend comes and puts a hidden camera under his shirt. I give this movie nine out of ten, and put it in the top 10 list of movies. And last but not least, if anyone saw this movie in the store, please tell me how I saw it on TV and record it. goodbye
