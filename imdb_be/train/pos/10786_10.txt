my sister and I used to rent it every time we got films and our parents would get so mad at this (but they let us in anyway), and I love it ... I can not find someone that lives near me that knows I'm talking about ... I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who liked this film ... I wish I could find it on DVD somewhere !! I would like to look at it now, just bc I loved him so much as a small child ... and I'm 15 now !!! I remember so much about it ... the one where I received little rabbit FUFU song from, and all my friends know this song, but not the movie !! I think that little girl got it sliding down slide on her little playground stuff
