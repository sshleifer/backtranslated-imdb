"Shower" is a story about loyalty, about the irresistible advance the modern world in damage, and the traditional and more human way of life. A man is forced to choose between his successful career in business, his big city life, his wife and his late younger brother. The eternal question between what we want to do and what we should do. Modern China is compared with Ancient. Public baths with their gatherings, his cricket fights against shopping centers and skyscrapers. Many old men and women who are no longer necessary. China, one country, two systems, Xiao Ping said ... at least one of them kills the other. <br /> <br /> Tender, agile, full of funny moments, and sweet-sour ones.The sensitive will cry and laugh the same way. Actors are enormous, especially one who plays the role of a boy is late; and Yan Zhang is doing a good job, easy, simple, allowing the story to flow simply by itself <br /> <br /> My rating :. 8/10
