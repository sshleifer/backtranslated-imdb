An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly. See how Jean sings, acts and dance their way through Paris in any number of situations. Some purely majestic, others are pure corn. You can imagine just what Kelly had done as he did this film just a year before, "Singing in the Rain." He is definitely one of the all time greats. Interesting to see the parallels between the two films, especially in Kelly, the only major difference between the signs that one is in Paris, the other in Los Angeles <br /> <br /> Some say acting Leslie Caron was less than clean . Perhaps, Cyd Charisse, which was originally meant for the role could have done better, but Caron quite believable in the roles and has a chemistry with Kelly. Oscar Levant short role in the film gave only what he needs, who do not like Gene Kelly. Filling the role as the man in the street is not an easy task, but the Levant did it with the same class as any other lead. <br /> <br /> song and dance routines all perfection. Even overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better movie with him than without him. Seeing that there was in fact not so much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable, Minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if you spent four hours after them. Ingenious! <br /> <br /> I would rate this movie with singing, as it is very similar to the plot and songs. Singing would just get the nod because of the Debbie Reynolds uplifting performance. <br /> <br /> The full recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8-10 star.
