I gave this film 8 out of 10, leaving 10 for the Amadeus, for example, and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire in recent years. This film is close to Slumdog, but it's hard to judge a film like this, not realizing the life of the Balkan mentality and spirit, which is virtuoso Kusturica. To understand this you really need to be one of the Balkans. This is an amazing film, much better and more modern of its previous films, which is boring at this time, I think that Kusturica is moving forward with this film. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is art itself, each scene is the artistic to the limit. The plot is probably a fairy tale, I do not remember now, but remember reading to my daughter, going to sleep, a similar story.
