That's the first EVER .. Friends episode where we get introduced to the Control Freak Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), recently divorced Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buff (Lisa Kudrow), an unknown actor and ladies' man (Matt Le Blanc and very sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry). It's like a scene begins, until you enter the 6th and final one spoiled child Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> The episode better than most people give credit, as well as any new sitcom first episode is not always fantastic. not great, because the actors do not act in this episode oguts identify and ARNT really believable in their new characters (except Kudrow and Perry-, that shine). <br /> <br /> Matt Le Blanc- Man, his action was not down right awful, because then it becomes more sure, but I think he's trying to be funny, but most of the building. <br /> <br /> David Schimmer- Why is he over pronounce each word? he can not speak properly! but he was one of the funniest characters The next season, but he is not sure. and I can not sympathize with Jennifer Aniston- feels hot, and does a good job as Rachel Green, but we only see the real Rachel later in the 1st season, Courtney plow look pretty anorexia in this episode, his anxiety, she looks completely different now (more healthily), it acts a little sketchy, but every 20 minutes in this pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matt Perry- I make these two together because of their comic acting time and the quality was superb, and Lisa, it was one of her first roles, and it is just as natural as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry just Matthew Perry plays itself mainly! episode does improve the quality of later ,,, such as sets, they look dark and horrible in this episode and make them seem hostile, which operates in the manner, characters gain confidence with each new stage, and I am proud that this is a pilot! I hope that we see friends reunite! because they will always be there for us!
