Although it is not the best anime I've ever seen, but I enjoyed Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I've never read a comic book and just saw it in the video store and decided to give it a chance. <br /> <br /> animation was ok, I got the feeling 80 anime of it that set it up for me. Why still I hate it for me. <br /> <br /> The development of the character was in order. I love how they brought the transition from hope to Lady Death around. for those who do not like it, obviously not paying attention. Lucifer tells you, as it happens, and she used his words. <br /> <br /> Creamtor was a good teacher / soldier for her. his dark style bruiting is ideal for this kind of film. <br /> <br /> I think that everyone here who need to beat it again to look at it, and revise. cause all that people have beaten it can be said about any favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
