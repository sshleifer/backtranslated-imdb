I saw the second half of the film about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it on DVD. Recently I watched a few episodes on PBS reality of livestock, etc. None of them did not come as close to telling the story of how this movie does. On the basis of the actual reality, do not pull punches, sad, happy, tragic and instructive, it is a film that should be given by students or anyone interested in the early frontier life. Finishing action on the part of both Rip Torn and finish Ferrell add to the well-made script. Opening of credit claims that this was done, although the means is supplied through the National Endowment of Humanities. If this kind of product taxes can go, I would be happy to see more. I highly recommend it, and will encourage people to let me know if you have seen and enjoyed the film.
