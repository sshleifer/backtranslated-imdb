Brothers with psychokinetic powers (so, actually) fight not only for bias Debra Winger, but in fact a secret from his childhood, which left them in trouble on their own. <br /> <br /> There is a surreal touches (fire brigade, act as a Greek chorus singing), but there is a sense of humor, wit and romance. The soundtrack is also great. And just as An American Werewolf in London has used all the great Wolf song they could get ~ but with fire, and I do not think I ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), setting your own Trailer Rockin ' too, "She's a lady" ~ priceless;) <br /> <br /> The best line is missing in the section quotes the way ~ If you were a clown, you never go back "<br /> <br /> I love this movie (I! just ordered a DVD from the USA), and if the comments written on the kind of people who would be more than happy with Blond-Stamp does not put you ~ give him pasprabavats :)
