I enjoyed this movie a lot. I thought the plot of the movie was realistic and the ratio of the period at any time in American history. There is always that a woman who does what she needs to do to move up to the class system. I feel that the character of Lily portrayed correctly and could not have been done better. What I liked the most when she realized that love really was. Throughout the film, all the men who fell to her were in love with her, gave her all, even lost her career for her. Until she met Cortland is, she does not understand why these people refused all happiness. The way her life ended was far from what she had expected, it's possible. I recommend this movie to anyone mature audience, so you can understand the content and meaning of a laying of the film and the plot.
