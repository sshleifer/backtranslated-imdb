Yes, this horror anthology film, and it was very fun! This is because although the film was clearly terrified, some of the stories had a light spirit - and were sometimes even a few laughs. This is not bad as it is sometimes horror movies a little stuffy and too seriously. Because of this and because all four of these stories were pretty good, it is one of the best films I've seen this style. <br /> <br /> unifying theme linking each story of the house. Four different stories associated with people who either rent a house or to find out what happened to the residents. <br /> <br /> first segment Denholm Elliott starred as a horror writer who has writer's block. Thus, for a change of scenery, they rent this house. Almost immediately Elliott block disappears, and he is currently working on a story about a serial killer. Surprisingly, shortly after his unit disappear, he begins to actually see his fictional character! Again and again, the psychotic killer appears and disappears - It seems as if he was going mad. It may just be the best of stories, like a good twist ending makes the story come alive. <br /> <br /> Secondly, although it is not bad, it's probably the weakest. Cushing plays a bachelor, which sums to a friend, who had died some time ago (although her picture looked surprisingly modern). If he enters the chamber horrors wax museum in the city, he sees a wax figure, which reminds him of his lost lady, and he fascinated and frightened by it. Later, a friend (Ekland) visits, and he also sees the figure and fascinated by it. All this leads to the end that, frankly, was a bit of a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee stars then how incredibly harsh and strict father, a miserable little girl. Throughout most of this segment, Lee looked like an idiot, but in the end you can understand its behavior. Although slow, this one over very well. <br /> <br /> The fourth segment was stupid and had to parody the genre. Jon Pertwee (the third "Doctor" from the television series the DR. WHO) is very temperamental actor, known for his drawings of Dracula. However, there is nothing wrong about the movie he said, and in a fit of anger, he stomps on the set to find the best props for this vampire movie. It's actually very interesting that he played this role as it seemed natural to Christopher Lee, who played Dracula and other vampires through bazillion times (give or take a few). I enjoyed the line Pertwee, when he basically says that Lee and other recent incarnations of Dracula were crap compared to Bela Lugosi! Perhaps that's why Lee did not take this part! Despite some very silly moments, it was very interesting and fun. - perhaps as good or better than in the first segment <br /> <br /> Given that the film is so good starts and ends, had excellent action and write, it is hard not to like this movie.
