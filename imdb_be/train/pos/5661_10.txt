I see a lot of people on this site that wants AG will be released on DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (From the border, no less!) While it is not healthy to have this amazing concert in a boxed DVD form, I am frustrated by the fact that they have added very little in the way of "Extra's" (Director of comments by Shaun Cassidy in the pilot episode ) and the episodes are shown in the same order as they were put on the TV. Missing episodes that have never been shown before work on the Sci Fi Channel in the box set, but the attack on the final DVD. If you buy a set of DVD, to get the actual order they are to be viewed, and you will be happy. (You will need to change to DVD and the player to see them in order, but you'll be glad you did.) <br /> <br /> S
