I have no idea how to describe this film, as well as would like to give others the same opportunity I had - see it without prior knowledge of what to expect. I enjoyed it, but we can also say that I hardly knew what was happening, when in fact there was nothing to understand in the first place. Supporters of David Lynch (tangential) or especially Maddin films should especially enjoy this, and all the fans of the comic book Eightball is likely to be beside herself with joy and astonishment (he came as close as any film I've seen in the tone and Dan Clowes creates a mood so effectively) <br /> <br /> One quick note just to warn anyone resentful. - this film, when the rating is NC-17 for sure. Proponents of male full frontal nudity, but ... um, well ... yes. It's amazing wild stuff.
