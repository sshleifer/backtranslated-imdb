The third and final film with the trilogy finally crystal clear. This is a political film is more than just entertainment. Jason Bourne finally find out who he was, and he will find and remember the torture he had been given to kill his old identity: he actually killed someone, who became his corpse. But the film is finally showing that it was organized and planned as part of the CIA program Blackfriars, which is also clearly indicated in this film as aimed at the elimination of all American citizens who were trying to prevent the control of the whole of society, and established a limited group of people. Who was the one major CIA officer until 1980, when he became vice-president? This goes along with what has been said on the Internet. Then the truth will come through himself, but the main person who will be able to bring the truth to the public and the only body that can decide about the CIA is a woman and that a woman receives Senate participates in the general investigation into Jason Bourne. The woman and the Senate; read my lips. In the US, politicians are in the media and the two media are essential for any presidential campaign: it's music and film. Now Hollywood and beyond intellectuals, academics and intellectuals are using the movie as a whole, and this film in particular, to create the idea in society that salvation will come from women, and from the Senate. So go and see a movie. It is very interesting and has a sweet flavor at the end of a period of great change and some are waiting and waiting for the other, but one can not pretend that will not come: the only point to know how deeply and seriously it will. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, the University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and the University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
