I just saw this in recent years, after a break for almost forty years. He holds up well, especially the outstanding lyrics by Lionel Bart. ( "Who will buy" with its magical counterpoint, just one of the many standouts.) <br /> <br /> I do not agree with another post that condemned him G. rating rating system completely new at the time, never appointed (General) Rated G, means "completely devoid of conflict." <br /> <br /> describing it as unsuitable for children reminds me of the description, I saw one with the Wizard of Oz: the girl comes in a strange land, and kill the first man she meets. Then she goes on a journey in a car with three companions of men and kills again.
