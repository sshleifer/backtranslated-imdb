The Citadel episode Books Movies Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh described as the kingpin of the musical. I am sure that he could not do better than that. This is such an important film in the career of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson did not do too badly with that too. <br /> <br /> Louis B. Mayer lent Gene Kelly to Colombia, where Harry Cohn had the inspiration to allow Kelly choreograph their own numbers, and because of this, the cover girl has become a classic. So if Meyer had not learned the lesson, Joe Pasternak producer and allowed Kelly artistic control. If Anchors Aweigh was finished, Fred Astaire was finally dancing to rival dance movie monarch. <br /> <br /> The main room all talking about here with Gene Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse. Kelly originally wanted to make a number of Mickey Mouse Walt Disney, but Disney Mickey entirely giving to anyone. Mickey will have to wait until someone Framed Roger Rabbit to make the external film. Do not worry, because MGM had it own animated rodent one half of the team of Tom and Jerry. <br /> <br /> Kelly, as a dancer always wanted to do something new and different on the screen, how did Fred Astaire. Over the next ten years, the two were allowed to control all kinds of art and have been praised for their work, even if the films themselves are not up to snuff. It was like one inspired the other, so that more and better work, Kelly to MGM, MGM and Aster for any other studios. In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly got Sinatra to dance. In fact, Frank Sinatra always gave credit to Gene Kelly pointing to him as musicals should be done, he gave credit as Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in getting his Oscar for From Here to Eternity. <br /> <br /> If Frank Sinatra was half of his contract bought RKO at MGM, he insisted on a little art on its own. He made friends with the team of Julia Stein songs and Sammy Cahn. In his autobiography Seogo Kahn tells of how Sinatra insisted that they write their songs for this film. Louis B. Mayer gave up and team wrote some really great ballads for him to sing. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I fall in love too easily. Frank he sings accompanying himself on the piano in the empty Hollywood Bowl. This is Sinatra at his best. <br /> <br /> With Julia Stein, and then Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Kahn richly deserved the title of putting more lyrics to Frank Sinatra's mouth, than any other man. They were lifetime friends and always credited Cahn Sinatra with this significant increase in his career. <br /> <br /> On a bet Stein and Cahn were told that they could only write a song with the help of the chromatic scale. They proved it in Anchors Aweigh, when Kathryn Grayson pressed soprano work on all sudden my heart sings. She also made some classic numbers. <br /> <br /> There are actually singing is the basis of the plot. Two sailors on the holiday through a combination of circumstances to meet with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell. Trying to fix it with Sinatra, Kelly says he can get her to listen to Jose Icherbi. They spend the film trying to achieve just that. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays waitress "Brooklyn" never got the number itself. She received rave reviews from her work as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and what brought her to Hollywood. I have a suspicion that it was a number that was cut out, and somewhere at the MGM vaults in it still can be. <br /> <br /> Anchor Aweigh is a perfect example of why musicals just not done anymore. All that creative talent has been under contract with Metro-Goldwyn- Meyer. If you had to pay the market value for it, the price can off a debt to a third world country. <br /> <br /> But the results of the film is extraordinary.
