After my experience in Finland just over a week, I would say that this film reflects the nature of Finnish society very accurately. Especially the phenomenon of a young couple-with-child-who-is-serious questions, very familiar to me, as I saw exactly the same thing in a man, when I was in Finland. Relationships and problems of the people, the fragility of the institution of marriage, drinking culture, unemployment and the rising monetary problems, everything is very well laid, without subjectivity or exaggeration. <br /> <br /> There are some moments in the film, which is not always easy to understand and communicate with each other, but together the big picture, however, is useful. Not each of the stories is exciting and profound, but, as mentioned above, the big picture does not cease to deliver a sense of "real life" and capture the viewer. I happen to think in a calm moment: What is happening in the lives of all these people on the street? Well, that's what happens. Movies, as well feed the creative forces. It would be safe to assume that the film could be applied to life in many countries, but particularly reflects Finland, like this, and pretty damn good <br /> <br /> One comment about the current :. Being a lover of Finnish cinema, I have never seen any of these actors on any other film, but I found that acting in this function right next to perfect as a whole. Maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good attempt at the whole crew. I'll keep an eye out for future releases of the director and actors .. <br /> <br /> 7,5 / 10
