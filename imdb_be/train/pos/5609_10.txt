When this film was released in 1976, the story goes, he was greeted with a massive shame and contempt --- it is widely considered as a failure. I well remember Ebert giving it one star, and it supposedly was booed at Cannes. <br /> <br /> Obviously, these people do not understand the film, which is not too hard to understand, because it is very esoteric, dark and layered in such a way that still amazes me. Reading numerous reviews here I find (even after 7-8 Visits over the years), many elements of the film I embellished. But even without knowing a lot of the psychological foundations of history, it is still cracking suspenser ... even if you are simply an escalation of paranoia and persecution that catches title character Polanski, like a tsunami wave during the two hours of time. <, Br /> <br /> Considering the source material --- a beautiful novel by underrated writer Roland Ax --- reveals more intriguing layers. Trekovsky Polanski is shy of the highest order. Although it seems at first glance, one more soft daily shower, one gradually realizes that he is one of those people who seem to drift aimlessly through life, allowing him to direct it. He seems to have some strong feelings about their likes and dislikes. He considers himself gently pushed this way and that, but never seems to get too bent out of shape independently. This is a vague kind of obscure-ness is more prominent in the novel than in the film, but there are hints of it in the beginning of the film, too. <br /> <br /> To play in an apartment woman, one Mademouiselle Choule, who is in hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt, apparently, the most courageous thing he tried (even effectively bargain down the price of the deposit transaction). He soon finds, however, that he pays for his "good thing" in more ways than he cares, he finds himself in the center of the maelstrom created by building a complete neurotic freaks management hypersensitive no signs of human life, such as the footrest at night time or a knock on the door. <br /> <br /> Rather than take a stand, though, Trelkovsky becoming increasingly alienated from the situation, and ahead of paranoia and sense of persecution, he becomes obsessed Choule, presenting herself as she, dressed as she was, and Mr. .d., as his own personality begins to quickly wiped his own madness. <br /> <br /> If anyone doubted courage Polanski as an artist, they would be well advised to see this movie. His trademark black humor noticeably (sometimes dramatically) on display here --- --- God bless him, he makes himself an example of him. This tour de force performance in one of the richest, risky, the majority of Gothic horror films ever made. The fact that more people did not see that this is a real crime.
