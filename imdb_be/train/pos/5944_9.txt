I say this to begin with ... Why, oh why, can not Wb do what makes these short film directors? Sandy is obviously an amazing director, and deserves credit from the WB and DC. But I believe that they are supposed to put on edge when a person with a budget of $ 12,000 can make saliva fan of super-hero. The Finest world is one of the best short films I've ever seen a trailer or not. <br /> <br /> I think that the choice of the bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn), to play Superman was the choice of a genius. Let's look the truth in the eyes of people, Superman entirely super-model. It can be beautiful, but GQ Stud, he is not. And I do not know what the guy a few comments above I did, but Superman is actually quite muscular (Have you ever actually read a comic book about Superman?). I think that fact alone just floors me ... It seems that such an obvious choice to get someone with some real muscle mass to play a super-hero, not a nice person. The same goes for Batman, Bartram in incredible shape, and a great Batman ... I do not know, guys ... If you were given a larger budget, and its own film ... I think that Bale would Bartram neck and neck, lower line is one of only a few poor superhero movies with actors who really look the part. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good as well. I do not know what each of them is in question, O'Hearn is not so bad. He damn convincing as Superman, and Bertram ... Well, he's Batman. I mean, come on people, this film had a budget of $ 12,000 a dollar, what did you expect?. Everything else is too large, with the exception of two-faced seems a little crazier than usual ... But hey, we only have Tommy Lee Jones as a reference. Oh, Lois pretty hot. <br /> <br /> SFX are Flippin sweet too. I mean, seeing Superman lift a car up ... MAN!, How cool. Against the scenes "Tank" in Grayson, I may have to put this one above that, as Mike actually looks as if he is flying, and with ease. Flying sequences left much to be desired, but once again, with a big budget ... Oh, and he even used the Batmobile! (This was probably the model, but it looked damn convincing). <br /> <br /> in general, the only downfall of this trailer has been the lack of a serious budget. And the Security Council refuses to acknowledge that Collora a reliable director, and should be, except for some projects ... But no, they (like most projects Marvel) just keep all these hack director, showing almost oblivious to fans and that they care about, and keep those Gamble punched films. Thankfully, Superman Returns was a blow, whether that would have been the end seriously. The world's Finest is excellent, and in my book, it is considered as a Superhero Movie.
