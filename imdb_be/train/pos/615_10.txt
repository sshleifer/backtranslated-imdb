This incarnation of a fairy tale! Villains and heroes completely wicked refreshingly clean. Danes, and Deniro Pfieffer excellent, as well as a new actor who plays the role of Tristan. Excellent performance, excellent magic, funny and dramatic, and perfect fairytale ending to make this film absolutely fabulous! I'm not sure that all the content is suitable for young children, but also for the older audience, there is a lot of fun subtleties! The preview does not do this film justice! My fiance and I was very skeptical, but were so excited, we took a chance on this film, I can only hope to provide about this film one on the fence, to give it a try!
