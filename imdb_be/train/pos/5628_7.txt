Looking at some of the other comments here, I have a main complaint of this presentation. <br /> <br /> The two main characters attractive in their own ways - the beautiful "victim", and a beautiful, obviously very "off-center," the blue-collar hero (unless you do not have enough "totally-insane") - in turn. knocking the hell out of each other, sort of like a Caucasian Kabuki script <br /> <br /> It's all right, and it is, of course, basically, "turning the tables" story. However, my reference complaint is that I believe that the director got up in the desire to show the well-known and obvious physical attributes of Tara. Since it is tempting to be dressed in a thin coat, and with the number of scenes that reflect more than necessary for any dramatic effect - while very pleasant to the eye, they distract from the drama The severity level <br /> <br /. > Her roommates I have some give an idea as script writer and director - however, their respective skepticism and simulated babbling and crying, not ring true - based on previous experience Tara with this guy, a clear indication of his came to him the room with only the worst intentions, and that it will have absolutely no reason to exaggerate what happened. <br /> <br /> But this is a movie and the plot, causing as much despite as because of the work of the director.
