Why the panic is never a good theatrical release is easy to see: it is too clever, and the audience would probably have had a hard time with it, comparing it to American beauty in her probing midlife crisis, and the Sopranos and Analyze This in this study on illegal habits on in the midst of family life. While panic may seem that obtained with non-original material, realistic Brommel characters combined with clever dialogue and supervisory direction to make the film a realistic look at the destruction of the middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> William H. Mays star as Alex, a killer who works (Sutherland) contract-killing his father's business. He leads a double life with his wife (Ullmann) and her son did not know about his real trading. In middle age, he becomes more and more disgusting, what he has done all his life. Under his calm, collected fa√ßade warms suppressed resentment for controlling father's grip on his life. When he meets a young woman (Campbell), he feels invigored and decides that it's time to get out of the family business. <br /> <br /> the fact that the writer / director Henry Brommel decided to make a profession of his protagonist tried to break off the contract-killing is disposable. He could easily replace it with any junk profession; his characters are so well developed and believable, the scene is processed as smooth and realistic, and the dialogue is written so shrewd and naturally, the focus falls on the conflictual character of Mace, not his work as a hitman. Brommel scenario feels Shakespearean tragedy, with a certain destiny theme running throughout. <br /> <br /> In Alex, Macy creates a tragic, easily cute character and turns into another brooding, great performance as always can expect. Donald Sutherland is also effective abrasive and insulting as his overbearing father, and a dramatic turn Ullman Mace's wife is a welcome change for the comedian. Consider the scene in a bicycle shop, where her subtly darkens the mood and peaks in a scene affects the emotional confusion. <br /> <br /> first film Henry Brommel, Panic in the film, which is well treated in his sincerity. With the cast of the first course, a plausible scenario, terse dialogue and good direction, this character-study, we hope, just a taste Brommel hit to create characters who seem real. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
