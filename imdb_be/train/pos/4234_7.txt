WARNING, SPOILER! <br /> <br /> A lot of people have told me that "Planet of the Apes" was the worst film by Tim Burton and besides is considerably weaker than the original film. So I decided not to see him. Another friend of mine, who has not seen the film yet, advised me to watch it, in spite of this, because `Tim-Burton-film still Tim-the Burton-movie." I decided to do it, and I found that he was right. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a remake of the famous film like `Planet of the Apes automatically under the influence of commercial thinking. However, Tim Burton succeeded in his film to represent their surprising playfulness in the same way as `BeetlejuiceÂ« or 'Batman.' If you already love Burton-movie, it's hard not to like one of his films, even if it has some drawbacks: the annoying monkey squeal, over-dressed monkeys and lead actor, who could be without difficulty, be replaced. anbody for more <br /> <br /> The fact that the film gives us in the first place, is to answer the question: what is the result when Tim Burton instructed to create a remake? First of all, Burton was not the Burton, if he did not refuse to call it a remake from the outset; it `rethinking. On the other hand, Burton knows that almost every viewer of his film saw the very first version of the film starring Charlton Heston (as a man), and he knows that there is no remake of its model and that these two films did not stop to compare. So everything that he does, playing with this comparison in every moment of his film, e. G. by reference to quotation. As for the storyline, Burton does a brilliant job, answering questions open the original, and then driving the audience to despair, destroying this wonderful clarity and ending with a movie ?? And SPOILER ?? Leo returns to the earth, and once inside the world, which seems to be ruled by apes forever. <br /> <br /> Currently, it burtonesque response to the expectations of people, they hold because of surprising, shocking end of the first `Planet of the Apes. Ending more unexpected, more strange and: very confusing, because ?? and here I do not agree with the various `Planet Apes'-pages and -platforms ?? it does not make any sense. There can be no sense to it, or simply so complicated that it becomes ineffective. Tim Burton plays his cruel games, he does it with a smile, and he does it well. Burton fans will sure like this, others may feel cheated and complained of a manierism. Well, I do not think that manufacturers will be constantly asking Burton to direct a remake again ??
