In the year pretentious shit like "Synecdoche, New York" film born from their own pampering Charlie Kaufman, comes a film that is as difficult to watch, but about three times as important. «Frownland» is a work of love crew, actors, director, filmed over the years friends. It traces a person who can not communicate through it thoroughly authentic, Brooklyn REAL world. People, you see a step beyond even the stylized "mamblkor" movement. They are real people, painfully closed in their own self-contained neuroses, not wanting to change, can not. The real world for them is their own set of delusions, and because it is a film about people who are so deeply out of touch, it is very difficult to observe. This 16mm film production without proper lighting, money, or any other factors that would have made the film "spot", but his honesty can not be understated, and that would cause a roomful of people to dismiss him and for Richard Linklater, to give him an award, as he did in SXSW. This is reminiscent of films such as "naked" or the best of the "mamblkora". This is a film that is not for everyone, but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it.
