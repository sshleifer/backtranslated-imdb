In a sea of ​​crap that Hollywood (and others) continue to simmer, it's one of those diamonds in the rough. A small, simple film, which is a very interesting and leaves you with the feeling that you do not just spend an hour and a half of his life. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd is amazing in this movie. I've never really been a fan of not noticed it before, but to come back and see it early execution of its convinced me that she is very talented. <br /> <br /> Watching this film was an assignment in a college course for me, so I was skeptical, I would not even care. I thought, "Oh boy, some dumb chick flick or a feminist man bashing indie shit ..." I was pleasantly surprised Nha analyzing many important topics, I'm just saying, if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out sometimes.. down to earth, naturalistic films are the best, and it's a big one.
