This movie was excellent - the emotional power of Tom Hals and Ray Liotta speech brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart - this film shows us that there is hope in the world. When this film was released in late 1988, but not Rain Man would Hulce, of course, at least, is nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. Probably a must see!
