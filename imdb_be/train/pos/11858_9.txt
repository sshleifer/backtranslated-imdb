this film is simply magnificent. if you have a chance to see it, then you have to work to see him. despite the fact that the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932, Pacino does a great job playing Tony Montana to get around. <br /> <br /> Pacino because of him, where he can say anything anyway, and it sounds great. If you thought that Pulp Fiction was good with swear words (if you've seen it), then you also need to see Scarface, to see another angle on how the actor can tell them. (It's pretty sweet) <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film has plenty of action and the plot moves very quickly, for a time, not keeping the aspect ratio in real-time right, it is still easy to follow, but you should keep your eyes constantly lose nothing. personally, I found that watching this film does three hours seem like a breeze, it really just fine. <br /> <br /> This film is one of thoe films that act and directed so well that you forget not only that this film was made in the 80s, but cheesy, it makes you really root for the bad guy ... "So say good night to the bad guy"
