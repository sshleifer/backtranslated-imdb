It is unusual to see a movie where one actor performance is so good that you can feel that the film will be of little interest, if any, without his presence. <br /> <br /> Although not outstanding direction - in fact, there are many scenes that seem to have been shot too quickly and carelessly - seemingly low budget, an amazing story about a man who wants to take in the defrocked priest and another week points, Pierre Fresnay presence is so impressive that one gets a shock from the beginning to the end of the terrible. <br /> <br /> I've never seen and can not iomagine future better performance, even Paul Scofield, who acts in the "man for all time." <br /> <br /> actually end can be considered even funny when Fresnay plays transtorned priest who returned to the church, fulfilling the crime. <br /> <br /> "Je suis Maurice Morand, prêtre Catholic" ( "I am Maurice Moran, a Catholic priest"), as they say, with such a beautiful that one can forget the mind. Ness, which is carried out to this end <br /> <br /> Another impressive thing this film is one scene in Wich Moran - who despite rank one forces the priest - consacrates cabaret a huge amount of grapes turning it into Christ's blood <br /> <br /> Gerard. - a person who wants to return Moran to church or to replace it by yourself - should drink it if he wants it does not apply to leave it in the theater, he does so in the middle of cheers and applause from people who think he's just drinking three out of four litters of grapes. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, dialoque between Moran and the garbage collector is also excellent. "Do you captivate men, too?" Asks Moran, who hates himself for what he had just done. "It would be too much work" it is a reasonable answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is not worth comment, but it is certainly worth a look because of the very strong and surprisingly emotional atmosphere created constantly. <br /> <br /> I think that «Le défroqué» very strange film, but must be seen to all the spectators - if good Catholiques is a must - because it is very rare Jewel in the history of cinema. <br /> <br />
