Great movie, clean style of Cassavetes. Gena Rowland gives excellent performance downward actress, dealing with success, elderly, loneliness ... and alcohol. She tries to avoid his own subconscious spirits embodied the specter of death of a young girl. Acceptance of self, the human condition, though its common difficulties, the real purpose of the film. The parallel between theater and film sequences themselves confused: it is as if the step was the release of the heroin. If all the American films could only be of superior quality, dealing with human relationships at senior level, not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings ... One of the best dramas ever. 10/10.
