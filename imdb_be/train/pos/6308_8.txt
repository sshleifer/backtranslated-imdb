Silly, funny, tragic, sad, inevitable. <br /> <br /> A group of down and minuses to unite with the "seasoned" bend to lift themselves out of their poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the screwup factor. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see George Clooney is doing something really funny for a change. Casting perfect and operating standards are very high. Although it can be said that the motley crew of the subject is not new, I think that this film handles it in an interesting and unique way. Enough so that it stands out from what it was before. <br /> <br /> It is very well done guys.
