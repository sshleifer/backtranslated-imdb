I only had the worst day of my life. . Then I came across this lovely movie, watched it, and now I'm ready to go and kiss lantern <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I only watched it for 2 reasons: FAITH-ELLEN legs, but it is actually much more more. The plot is actually very intelligent and creatively woven. It's almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all its wonderful misunderstandings. And, of course, there is also ... FAITH-ELLEN legs. <br /> <br /> The only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version I bought (the "100 families ClassicsÂ» collection from Mill Creek Entertainment) has the best video quality, and I heard the same most of the Alpha release. Brightness and contrast a bit too high, so many scenes seem bleached out especially when Vera dancing in a white dress. But I believe you can change using the control buttons on the TV to compensate. I can only imagine what it looked like on the big screen again in 51. On stage sets, costumes and colors are dazzling and magical otherwise terrible. - View from "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" Vienna <br /> <br /> As far as romance goes, it's just wonderful. Nha juicy, not contrived, melodramatic entirely. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, you're poor Schmucks, your pathetic life will never be as charming as it is. Har Har Har. Wait, that I laugh? My life sucks just as bad as yours. Oh, shit. Time to watch this movie again.
