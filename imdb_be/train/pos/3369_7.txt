Despite the fact that the name may mean "pig PigsÂ» Pig Spanking is not a star. Rather, it has a young pig with an appetite more insatiable than the character of John Belushi in "Animal House." His mother scolds him repeatedly, but he does not do anything good. So much so that he goes to another house, where crazy scientist force feeding him more than any ordinary person can handle (but there is a surprise at the end). <br /> <br /> I'm basically saying that this cartoon appeared as a place holder in between really great cartoons (Daffy Duck debuted three months after it came out). But make no mistake about it, they're doing some nice things here. All the power feeding sequence is more relevant today, given the epidemic of obesity overtaking our country. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is not the best cartoon, but it's worth a look.
