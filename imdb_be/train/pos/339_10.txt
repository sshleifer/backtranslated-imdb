I read the book (the same name as the film) Schneebaum, when it was first published, and was deeply moved by his ability to see through a lot of ways to "otherness" (his own and the people of the Amazon, with whom he lived and loved) in a way live a decent life. His following books were not as strong, but showed it in the search time. His description of his sexual relations with men of the tribe was far ahead of its time in the early 60s, but his honesty and openness in its welcome. This film perfectly conveys how bizarre and human dignity, but also gives an idea of ​​the imminent death of innocence (which is not a positive moral life, in this case), what happens when a "civilized" people break into traditional societies. Nevertheless, he Schneebaum went into a kind of supreme innocence, which suggests the possibility of the salvation of mankind from its own destructive.
