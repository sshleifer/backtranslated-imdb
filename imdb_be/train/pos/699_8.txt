I saw a nightmare Insomniac not so long ago for the first time and I must say that I really found it very good. If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan, you'll love it. The opening film is going on inside his mind clocked doing this? To act on all the other little rushed and shaky, and some scenes could be cut, but it works in the end. The extras on the DVD is just as great as the film, if not more, for those fans of Dom. She has a lot of open points from the set of notes and a great interview with the director. Anyone who has been through the creation of an independent film will love watching Tessa (the director), the House and the rest on a very small set of close personal tries to scribble this little hypnotic terrible movie. It was pretty nice, and I'm glad to have it in your collection.
