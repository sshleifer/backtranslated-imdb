It's a lovely and unexpected film. You start the next young man who hopes to get into the qualifying football match between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins they will get to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that young man and girl girl (or woman for that matter) are not allowed in football games, "sit with the men." Below is a great comedy, played with consummate skill a small ensemble cast. The film explores the absurd restrictions on women's freedom (and that is important, the young soldiers, who have to drive them). There are some excellent set pieces, not least when one of the girls have to go to the toilet and, of course, the stadium has no toilets for women. The camera work is of the simplest, and in a sense, this story would have said, as a stage play. Nevertheless, it is a small scale, which gives the film its bite. Big cinema? No, probably not; big dream - sure.
