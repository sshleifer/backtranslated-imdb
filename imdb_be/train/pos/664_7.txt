Tales from the Crypt: And around the house begins on Christmas Eve, Elizabeth (Mary Ellen Trainor), kills his Joseph her husband (Marshall Bell), she pulls his body outside ready to throw it into the well, but so misses important news on the radio bulletin that says a maniac (Larry Drake), dressed as Santa Claus has escaped from the local mental hospital and has killed several women with Elizabeth next on his list, but she has other ideas and is trying to turn a seemingly dangerous situation her advantage ... < br /> <br /> is Tales from the Crypt were stories episode 2 with ezona 1, the director of one of the executive producers of the series regular Robert Zemeckis and around the house are fairly decent hours. Scenario Fred Dekker was actually based on a story appearing in comic Â«The Vault of Horror," and was originally adapted for the film, as one scene from a horror anthology film Tales from the Crypt Britsih (1972), which starred Joan Collins as a murderer's wife the character is played by Ellen Trainor. This version is good enough, but nothing special or is too linear and predictable, to be considered classics do. Only 25 minutes in length, of course, is moving forward at a good pace, the story is just about enough dark and it generally provides a decent holiday and I really enjoyed pessimistic ending. At this time there are Christmas themed opening and closing Crypt bunch (John Cashier) segments complete with the usual pun. <br /> <br /> Director Zemeckis does a good job and have a good atmosphere with a touch of bleak Christmas influence, but there is not much gore here someone has a poker stuck in their head, a face cut icicles, someone's hand will be cut with an ax and have any blood splatter, but generally speaking, it does not mean that the graphic. Existing small cast is pretty good. <br /> <br /> And all around the house is not the best story of the cellar, but it's a decent one is still worth a look, but after a history of comics and the original film version of one thousand nine hundred seventy-two Do we really need or even want it?
