This is one of the greatest films of the 80s in my collection, I think all this time. <br /> <br /> Running Man is one of the best and most Arnold`s different movies, even to this day, and when I first saw the man who was running, I was so excited to see the movie as it is. I just love all the fights and it's really special movie. It also features Jesse Ventura, the legendary Professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Japhet Cat, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson, Thomas Rosales Jr., who always seem to death in his films because he He was killed in such films as universal solder, The Lost world, Robo Cop 2, the Predator 2, among others. All supporters of Arnold must love this film from the beginning to the end, because of his action-packed, star-filled, and his friend, one of the best Arnold`s today!
