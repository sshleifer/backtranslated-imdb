This «B Series» Film Noir, and my vote reflects my membership in this genre. I saw this movie last night at the Left Bank Cinema in Paris, where he opened two weeks of the film noir perspective. The film has some drawbacks as well, but too many delicious items to ignore. <br /> <br /> As the previous reviewer noted, drumming scene is unbelievable! (B-movies can occur where A movie was forbidden to enter!) And the plot is intriguing. As for Franchot ton, but I beg to disagree: I, he appropriately mysterious; just the right shade of awful. It should be borne in mind that there is a kind of German expressionism is happening here (directed by Robert Siodmark, was a German who came to Hollywood during the war), and so the air is literally fits in the whole movie. At least it's not for me. <br /> <br /> However, this lovely Ella Raines, who just enrolled her third performance had the audience entranced throughout the film. Type "Girl Friday" with a strong resemblance to Gene Tierney, it is surprising that it did not become a household name. But it is so good here that I just ordered another film about it ( «Impact») from the Internet, and I can not wait to see it.
