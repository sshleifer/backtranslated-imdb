The man with the Snowy River II is not to reinvent the wheel, and the crowd-pleasing beautiful film that hits some high notes. <br /> <br /> For those fans who want the elements that made the original man from the river Snow film hits (breathtaking scenery, sweeping cost, sweet romance and cracking action) this film really delivers. The story picks up several years after the end of the first, Jim (Tom Borlinson) was away to build your fortune in the stock horse droppings. He returns to pick up where he left off with his pluckish bred ladylove Jessica (played by Australian fairy lady Sigrid Thornton), who is still trying to break out of her corset training on cattle stations of its pen (in Harrison now plays American Brian Dennehy ). Foil Jim and character that shakes the story is well-endowed upper class snob Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eddie), who has his eyes on Jessica. Add to the mix some social tension around land ownership and a stallion with a bad attitude from the first film, and this story. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie actor. Meanwhile Borlinson fit snugly into a wide hat Jim and laconic humor. Sigrid Thornton beautiful heroine and the two manage some real chemistry onscreen. Filling solid footwear Kirk Douglas will never be easy, and Brian Dennehy stomps and screams, but never feels very authentic in this part. <br /> <br /> Music walks and excellent cinematography and can be a roll of the drum Tourism Victoria. There is a moment, however, I feel very self-indulgent, as the director wants just another helicopter shot of riders, to show how beautiful the landscape without any personal human drama. Little more grit would be enough here, we are Australian, we can take it !! There are some very JAWSish moments with the stallion that defy belief. However, the funny thing about this film is that in some of the outrageous clich√©, there are some really inventive and touching scenes. Jim put a saddle on a horse (very Whisperish horse earlier time) Jim and Jessica creation of home, fabulous scenes where Jim manifested ride Alistair with his faithful whip. I can understand why this character is such an icon. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very enjoyable sequel. Here's hoping that all the participants want to do another. The man with the Snowy River III: The Craigs. I'm sure we all love to see how Jim and Jessica are doing on their farm. <br /> <br /> The Australian DVD has several additional scenes in it. Worthwhile if you're already a fan of.
