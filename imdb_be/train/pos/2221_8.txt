One night I came across this on the satellite station Bravo.Initially of curiosity, I decided to look at it.To be perfectly honest, I was not disappointed.The protagonist is beautiful, and her body was paraded well.You think her talents will be wasted as the executioner, but, apparently, not after watching the whole film! My only real pressure is a valid reference to discard especially the actor who plays him Melnik.Christ bad! prison guard Hank bitter too.All he never does get drunk and make bad passes were trying to protect his partner Vanda although, fortunately for us, the viewer, and Hank, he gets down and dirty with Wanda closer to the end. Music is used quite stressful and creates an ideal atmosphere for executions. This movie is good to watch alone for a beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
