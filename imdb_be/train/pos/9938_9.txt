We bought the DVD set "Es War Einmal Das Leben» (German) / 'One day ... Life »(in English) for our bilingual children, because everybody loved" Es War Einmal der Mensch »(in German) /" one day ... Man »(in English) series (see our parents as children), and it has exceeded even the highest expectations! The series is very well done, the sun is showing its age, and our children at different ages love to watch. At the same time, they learn things we parents did not know until then, by the way, the path later. The series covers everything to do with the human body from the bodies of all the senses, blood, infection, antibodies, and more animated in 20-25 minute episodes. Topics some people may find the "smart", such as digestion and reproduction are covered with tasteful, discreet and child-friendly manner (episode playback cover begins basically, when the child begins to grow), while at the same time (as a model), informative and fun. <br /> <br /> Children are usually fascinated with the way their body and through the episodes get a glimpse of this in the context of their environment. episodes format is switched between the external world (families with children 2) and the inner body part. For example, in the episode, which covers an infection, the boy cut himself accidentally and early infected and episode covers how the body reacts to it. Similarly, the scenes on the sense organs, e.g., hearing, sight, to connect what happens in the context of the outside world and the episode on respiration and circulation of oxygen in the blood within the body covers the entire life cycle, including (briefly), wherein oxygen is supplied from ( plants). <br /> <br /> This is one of the best ever for children's programs - I would say that is a must see for every family with children!
