I saw that when I was little, and it was great. Kelso Lisa White and Meecy, where cute mouse. Susan Bond, like Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke in Snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate, both Profster was interesting. Burl Ross as little Bunny Foo Foo's was funny. Gregory Donavon, as the Kaiso was brilliant. What Hilarius that Snoodle Doodle and eating too many sweets. What's sad that the little Bunny Foo Foo's, which BOPS Meecy in mice on the head and then give a little fairy Bunny Foo Foo's multiple requests, then it turns into a redneck. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle Jump to Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is great kids enjoy the show, the new words, songs, and watch how they play.
