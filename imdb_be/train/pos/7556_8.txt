Well, that was a damn good episode. Much better than it gets credit. <br /> <br /> camera work is superb. Even better. I love that last shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are great and the guest cast (less helpless victims) strong. <br /> <br /> What I do not like about this episode that many things remain unexplained. Why is sex change? what is the purpose? and they aliens? what? Why were they never showed in the later mythology? <br /> <br /> I give this episode a high three star. One of my favorite yet, but the plot holes bother me. And yet ... I will not let it ruin my fun.
