"Spaced Invaders» is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand why this film did not get the best criticism, winked funny, harmless and sweet. I first saw it when I was 11, and I really fell in love with her ... 2 days later, I got it on VHS :-P Until today, I've showed it to many friends and they all loved it, but no one had ever known movies. I think, that's the problem, almost no one knows, so that almost no one likes ... This film never got a real chance, that's boring, «SI» is really the potential of comedy as «Monsters Inc". or "Spaceballs". Okay, enough displeasure - What I really wanted to say that if you want to laugh your head off, look! Even if you do not get angry about it, winked worth watching! -> Prepare to laugh, earth scum!
