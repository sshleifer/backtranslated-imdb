I saw this movie with my father. I must have been quite young, about 15. It was a Star afternoon.The the movie started a little hazy, but you could say the robbers were going to score. He really caught the pace after the first half. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great, especially the Blades and Lou Diamond. I think it's an ensemble, they just play well together. I can watch this movie anytime.I thinks it is the relative dullness of the plot and characters who are trying to cope with a very strange number. Jokes are not trivial, but they are subtle and extreme at the same time, which makes them so much fun. <br /> <br /> The ideal comedy for a lazy afternoon.
