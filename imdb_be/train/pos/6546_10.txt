I'm probably one of the biggest fans of Nancy Drew there. I read every book, three times as much, and I played a lot in the Nancy Drew games. I loved this movie. He kept you entertained constantly, you watched it. I went with about 10 of my friends, and everyone loved it. There were three women sitting behind us who are in their late 30's to early 40's, and I asked them how they liked it, they said that they loved it! So you can see that it will be fun for all ages. You just have to give him a chance. And it teaches a lesson, too, just be yourself, even if everything around you is so. Thus, on the whole, this was a big step. I'll see it a second time now! So stop beating him, please. Its really a good movie!
