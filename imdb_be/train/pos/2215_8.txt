I bought, "Feast of All Saints", and it's actually not a terrible film, but a lot of things could be better. It was of great historical significance, played a very talented actress / actors, and it is not a common phenomenon, that actors may play such a role, and it will be more believable. There were some parts that were a bit mediocre and confused, but I would not say that the entire movie was terrible. Once you think about that, capturing the 1800 New Orleans, and make something out of it, it is quite difficult, and much more difficult to get an actor who can strongly means those parts. But the big problem I had with the film was the fact that most of the actors who made the play-free people of color, it was mostly fair-skinned Africans are not very versatile in the cast of others who were not white-skinned; one of the old Creole stereotypes that still exist. Whoever did the casting could have chosen a wider, when it came to color tone, despite numerous Creoles are the color picking conscious.Rather actors who looked close to white, in a sense, it could be more thought out.The the actors did a great job, the script could have been better written, and in general, I found that the performances were very believable.
