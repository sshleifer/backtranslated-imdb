Insomnia is a nightmare story to overthrow the human madness. The presence of chronic insomnia, Jack suffers from hallucinations; forcing it to try to determine what is real and what is not. <br /> <br /> We will learn many interesting things about Jack closer to the end, and I think that by the time the film is over, we will have a "happily ever after" Hollywood ending. Wrong. This is New York, a place where no one sleeps. <br /> <br /> Tess Nanavati (writer and director) is currently a good movie in the "insomnia nightmare." A talented director and writer (she made this film immediately after graduating from high school), she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming future. <br /> <br /> When I watched this short film, I was always uncomfortable; between music, harsh scenery and realistic portrayal of insomnia Dominic Monaghan (as Jack), I desperately wanted to turn it from time to time just to get away from him.
