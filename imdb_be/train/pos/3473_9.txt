I admit that there was some concern when I first saw the previews for this film. VH-1 has been treading on hollow ground here? I mean, Harris and Quinn did not really look or sound like John or Paul. But I must admit that this movie really surprised me. This is far from the exploitation of the film I was expecting. Instead, the nature of the study, low-key, moody, and ultimately bitter look at friendship, and eventually a lesson we all learn, it is difficult, if not impossible, to capture what we once were, and the that passed by.
