Wow, that episode! After last week that sees Mellisa constantly doing cameos on friendship and Annie brand I almost puked. But it was not anything until seeing Mellisa tirade after his dismissal. Seeing her limp around in her cast mate and regurgitate someone shouted to get her purse was absolutely the most fun that ever on a reality show. She continued to yell at people outside the set to get her clothes, "all of them" as someone would wear one of his hideous outfits. Mellisa you're like 40 years old and you're still throwing tantrums? Then Joan starts a call Annie and Brandie every name in the book and gets up and leaves the show! Both rivers are spoiled, which remained only on the show is long enough to keep the ratings up. Mellisa cries and refuses to do exit interviews, just proves that America all thought, you spoiled child. WAH WAH I can not get my way! I love Annie told the chamber she could manipulate Mellisa think your way, and then did just that. Mellisa, certainly clever opponent and obviously deserved to win the game.
