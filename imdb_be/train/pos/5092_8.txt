I thought King Solomon's Mines was done beautifully. Only my reservation Alison Doody. Her acting was beautiful, but her makeup and hair were not period and always seemed to make it a place alongside other actors. I thought that Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. Well, that hardened, cut looking actor in this role after sitting through the movie after movie with hairy fair, fair-skinned actors as Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. He was an excellent choice, and I enjoyed every minute of this film. This version can not be compared with the version 1950 with Stewart Granger. It was a big movie screen and is not made for TV movie. I thought how Quatermains were plausible, but both Medias should be kept separate. I'm looking forward to see it again, and I hope that Patrick Swayze revert to this type of role.
