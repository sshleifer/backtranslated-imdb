Possible spoilers ************** ********** There is only one reason why I saw this movie, and that's because I have a massive crush on Richard Belzer. (I do not know that much about humor) There were some parts that were funny, like Barbie and Ken Spoof and dealers, and the president of the hermitage. Keep in mind it is sometimes negligent (Dare, I'm talking about the oil?) It was sometimes funny, but it could be better. Perhaps if they spent more time in humor and less time getting women to undress, the film would have been funnier. Some scenes just make you want to gag, and crawl, other sketches make you laugh and think strangely. Unfortunately, this movie is dated. If you have a mad crush on Richard Belzer (as necessary), you should check it out and see Chevy Chase.
