I have just returned from viewing the previous version of this wonderful science fiction noir. This style is completely unique and very well done. He filmed with real actors, but turns into a black-and-white comic style you've never seen before. He goes one step further than Sin City, and does it well. It is a good combination of French movie and comic cultures. History and mood reminiscent of the blade, and if you liked that one that you will definitely like this one, too. Storyline wise, never boring and have some interesting little twist. This film is a must see for any film fan, except, perhaps, those who do not like science fiction or b & w.
