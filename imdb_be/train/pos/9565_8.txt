Dog Bite Dog is not for everyone, but I really liked it. Full slapping, stabbing and shotguns (but do not worry ?? terrible lead shot), it can best be described as strong to travel via Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Chen plays Pang, Cambodian assassin in town to kill the lawyer. Although unclean with his journey, he almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle is clearly an expensive restaurant. If it sounds wildly implausible to you, you probably should avoid this movie. He acted as my ki to suspend disbelief, and I had a lot more fun for him. <br /> <br /> The chase down Pang Wai (Sam Lee), a young, edgy cop who likes to beat people around almost as he likes to smoke. White is a fine line that has the internal affairs to investigate it, and his father, the legendary Good Cop, is in a coma following drug deal that went south (meaning that Vai released his father to take the rap for his own corrupt transactions). <br /> <br /> There are car accidents, many murders and strange and awkward love story on offer here, all played in almost comic book style. I suspect that the humor was intentional (no one uses a giant concrete batons without an eye for an extravagantly absurd), although over-the-top nature of the audience has lost a number of my colleagues. There are at least three points, where the film could have ended, and 109 minutes, he may have benefited from more ruthless editing or deleting of a narrative thread (light-hearted material worked well, so I would leave from the interaction of three parents) . <br /> <br /> I'm inclined to give it (high) are, however, if only because of the ending ?? I have seldom heard so many people laugh so loudly that has been a bittersweet moment. This is one to be seen with a group of friends who love funny
