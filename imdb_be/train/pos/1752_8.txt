SPOILERS Sex yes? This is one of the most basic parts of human life. However, we ever take it too seriously? People always want more, even those who receive it on a daily basis, and if you are unlucky, there is a potential life changes (creating) effects. Oddly enough people would argue that we all begin to have sex at a younger and younger age (although the Victorians get married and have children in their early teens), so it should be more difficult for those who get to the point as virgins . In the first big-screen lead Steve Carell, he plays a man who received 40 no control over it. Treating us countless Lude and extreme incidents of sex, not to mention more than a profanation of the episode «Eurotrash», the general plot of the film, and this principle does not sound ridiculous. This is a pleasant surprise, therefore, that for all unusable, failed jokes, there is an incredibly large number of those who have fallen into the sign and leave the audience in hysterics. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer (Karel) is a good guy with a good job and a nice character. At the same time, though, he obviously takes life too seriously, and after an invitation to the game of poker as a necessary fifth member, friend Andy discover his secret. At the age of 40 years, Andy is still a virgin. Now, for various reasons, but mainly it is a pity, the three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) all offer advice Andy with one goal. To put it on the suffering and get him laid. <br /> <br /> One of the few good things about the "Anchorman", it is only a matter of time before Steve Carell received the lead role in his own. Clearly, in the "40 Year Old Virgin", he did not disappoint. This is hopeless, shy virgin to perfection, Karel is a discovery, it is gradually becoming more and more confident as the board begins to help. <br /> <br /> Karel is not alone, but in its execution. The Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Catherine Keener as a love interest in all great. Rudd personal favorite is the patient love of David, which is scattered in several times and shared the best scenes from Rogen, the two argue homosexuality. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of this film is not that so many of the jokes hit the mark, but actually a clever way he flips a message on his head. Obviously intended for conservative America, the whole tone of the film evolves from the simple stories of sexual conquest in one of the safer sex and abstinence. Virgins do not need sex to make your life complete, he just needs to trust and true love. Worthy to preach the message, and significant improvements to the one that you expect to see at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see the crude comedy that are constantly funny and well acted, but low and behold, "40 Year Old Virgin" just. Throw in a well-meaning message, too, and you're on the way to the top-class comedy. Joyland.
