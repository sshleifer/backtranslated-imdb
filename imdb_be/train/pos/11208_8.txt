Oh, where are you, my little baby ... <br /> <br /> wrap and you two, and you wrap four ... <br /> <br /> I remember the show when they were first broadcast at Disneyland. I remember sitting there, electrified explanation Werner Van Braun in rocket science. I watched as history, science and humor were woven into a fascinating story possibilities. <br /> <br /> It was fifty years ago. And the show returned in a series of Disney treasures, and what a treasure it. I watched them last night and today with my 8-year-old daughter, who at first did not even come in the room, but then thought better of it when she saw that they were partly animated. She looked, I looked at her, and in the end it was almost as impressed as I am. <br /> <br /> wrap and you're a young wife with the babies of your own ... <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the predictions about reaching the month were wrong. But there is a lot of information, which is still pretty accurate, and overall presentation is still impressive. I thought my daughter's teacher might want to show them to the class, not just the 50-year-old artifact, but as a fun and easy to understand the lessons of history. <br /> <br /> Wrap, wrap, turn around and again ... you wonder how much has really changed in the last 50 years.
