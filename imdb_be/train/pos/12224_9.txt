I have to see the whole movie last night and I found it very exciting.it, at least not as a teenager Tesakov films that are popping up in every now and then.t search for the killer, and "partner" relationship between the hero and the so-called bad guy part I liked about movie.also, I remember once being on the edge of my seat during certain scenes in movie.i means it exciting.maybe after a while, I could watch the movie again. ..
