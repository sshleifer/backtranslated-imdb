«Capitães de Abril" is very good. History is not a documentary about the revolution in Portugal in 1974. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it was. Fiction stories are not of great interest, but it does not spoil the film. Heroic actions of Captain Salgueiro Maia is not an exaggeration, and the film is also a tribute for their actions. Captain Salgueiro Maia is one of the greatest heroes of the April 25 revolution. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very good, and even the smallest roles are played perfectly. Lisbon looks beautiful as ever. Do not miss it! I liked this movie a lot.
