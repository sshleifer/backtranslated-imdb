Cliffhanger decent action crime adventure with some drawbacks from director Renny Harlin, whose delight in making this film about the expert climber, who considers himself a hostage with a friend of another gang of dangerous criminals to find a suit cases full of stolen cash in the rocky mountains. Sylvester Stallone impressive as Gabe Walker expert climber particularly in action / fight sequence, but some of them certainly bordering on the line is not realistic. For the sake of the film, though I am willing to suspend its disbelief. The rest of the cast, including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall, and Leon are representative as minor characters in the film. In / battle action sequences are well made, but, as mentioned earlier, some of them are not very realistic, no matter how tough you are. Lifting sequence, but very well done, because instead of having to do the entire movie in a studio somewhere in the place they have chosen felt very real and Ariel views of mountain ranges strange, adding a touch of reality to the film. Deadly creative while others are kind of predictable. Villains are tough, but it would be better if they were more focused on central, rather than many of them. Going to the movies was a little slow, but the good outweighs the bad in this. If you are a big fan of Harlins or Stallone, than chances are you will enjoy it too. Overall Cliffhanger has character development with enough action, drama, some unknown, excitement, thrill, and good performances of gypsum, which makes this movie worth the time to watch.
