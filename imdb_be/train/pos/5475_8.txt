Finally, uncut version of surfaces «Baby Face» and from what source? Library of Congress. Recovered four minutes, the fragments here and there to make a much better film. Now we know that Baby Face was pimped her old she was from time to time, at least fourteen years. Another reason for d'TAT for their behavior and the cold, calculating look. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck really strange as Lily states (note the nickname), the part that called for just the right amount of sexuality coating with force, cunning and revenge, but with a touch of virgin pretense, when called, very it is difficult to image that convincing. Barbara Stanwyck transmits the necessary nuances, to show that, while she was sleeping her way to the top (literally), it is still well in her heart - look at how it relates to those few who have been kind to her such as Chico (wonderful actress Theresa Harris) and an old philosopher. And though she uses her sexuality to make a paste of people who are rich and powerful, the same people who are trying to use it to their carnal desires, with no intention of permanent links, as long as they do not fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Lily Powers does not understand, firstly, that the emotions are hard to drive, it's easy to lose control. One possible result is death. Hitch the wagon to the star of materialism course can take from one to the destination, where nothing exists, but ephemeral, and this cold lonely place. <br /> <br /> The word must be said about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, whose will to power is emphasized in «Baby Face» by an elderly philosopher who befriends Lily when she was still spinning tricks her old man. «Baby Face» was released in the same year Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Although it is very unlikely that illiterate Hitler knew a lot about Nietzsche, he considered himself a Nietzschean to the nth degree, and advertised it along side its other conversations. «Baby Face» is accusing the popular interpretation of the freedom of Nietzsche to the power of the concept, especially in the final scenes. <br /> <br /> Although the "Do you have a cute little baby face." This is appropriate as the theme for "Baby Face", is even more eloquent and applicable hand melody in "St. Louis Blues" played throughout the film, especially in times when the camera should move away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes, "St. Louis Blues" is also used wisely to the end, Lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values. Chico sings crude, obscene version of "St. Louis blues ", when Lily, now is not agreeing with the text, tells her to stop. <br / > <br /> restored version of «Baby Face» makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude towards sex as power, than the numerous new version of Hollywood. All means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy.
