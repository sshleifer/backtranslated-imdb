His choice of films, the main "vanity" production (which puts it in sets or simulacrum films he comments) and his brilliant delivery! But if you want to Freud, be aware that you get a version of Zizek varnish, which should not be confused with the varnish itself. As usual, Zizka deliver complex ideas with pleasure and in a convincing manner. The catch is that it is also very unstable, and therefore may be in its appetite more than the actual content. Kinematic is a gem. Psychologically, this will be people of all faiths (Freudians, Lacanians and Jungian) scratching their heads, but reaching for popcorn yet. Zizek is a phenomenon and pop icon yourself.
