This film was very instructive. I've seen this movie several times. Firstly, when I was four, and I actually remembered it and then when I was 12. In general, a message that transmission director for everyone to wake up and do not make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday lives or simply moving the extra mile to offend him. <br /> <br /> A great movie for non-believers and believers, yes!
