I want to add to the praise for the production of the film, especially the luminous cinematography. Firelight glittered with smooth skin and muscular creates stunningly beautiful pictures. The film was nominated for (and won) one Oscar - the first given for editing. Small performance is capricious, penetrating and powerful.
