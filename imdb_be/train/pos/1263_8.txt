I enjoyed this film, it was mainly because I love to see Sean Connery act, and this one has the added bonus of having Ed Harris and Laurence Fishburne in it too. History has a grandmother searching for help Connery, because her grandson in prison, and she said that he was wrongly convicted. At first it seems that perhaps there were some racist aspects of the case, but then it turns out, the chief officer in the case of a black itself, and it seems that he has done some pretty bad things in order to make the recognition of the boy. Well, the boy tries to show another killer locked up in the same prison, the one who is going to be put to death. He especially disliked the man, too, because it takes a lot of joy in the fact that he did, writing the relatives of the victims and trying to get people to send them by mail. Many twists and turns in it, some of it was somewhat unexpected. Me I just enjoyed the character of Sean Connery, trying to understand the whole ordeal. The film is also with me crazy in the fields, especially when you find out what eventually happened. You get a very good interaction between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne as they shine, as well as in this. In the end, it makes for a pretty good suspense / thriller.
