As it has been well documented by previous posters, the real stars of Rockstar: INXS - and, in fact, a continuation, Rockstar: Supernova - this is Paul Mirkavich, Rafael Moreira, Jim Mc Gorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. I do not know who they are? They are amazing, tight, lights House Group, whose music intelligence and talent made the show something more than a boring American Idol clone. <br /> <br /> Remember, "string" night? It was the musical precision and perfection, if I ever saw him. Suzie McNeil epic rendition of the Queen «Bohemian Rhapsody», memorable cover Ty Taylor Stones' "You can not always get ...", JD Fortune song "Suspicious Minds". The common denominator here is awesome house band. <br /> <br /> As well as INXS were in their prime, they are, unfortunately, a shadow of themselves, but live performance JD has several breathed new life into your music, this show is all about GW <br /> < br /> Memo producers :. Season Three (if we are blessed enough to make it happen), must be Rockstar: House Band. Get these guys a good singer, and they are going to place.
