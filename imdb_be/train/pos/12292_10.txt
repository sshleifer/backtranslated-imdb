I love this movie, Jouve, Arletty, Blier, roots ... almost everything has already been said about the film, but there is one detail, I would like to shed some light on: nety frames real, still standing, HÃ´tel du Nord (? is still, I heard that it had to be destroyed ...) was used for the film - the whole scene was reconstructed on the set, the main reason is that they can not stop the traffic on the St Martin canal in a few weeks.
