I saw this movie a few times now, and there is always someone complains about "the obvious construction" section after. But then - it's part of the game Petzold: he plays with the genre rules <br /> <br /> It is very good as a very incredible story about how two girls (Timóteo / Hummer) meet again. It reflected in the other, even more incredible story that girls make up for casting. This film is a journey between fact and fiction, it's more about the potentials of what might have happened in the past or may occur in the future than about the habit. This dreamy, grade - so inclined enough to have a lot of motivation, Freud might find interesting to analyze his dreams, like all the "double» -constellations <br /> <br /> In addition, I think, «Gespenster» can be. interesting to watch over the current Asian cinema supernatural: daily urban architecture Petzold also feels the ghosts in an unobtrusive, strangely familiar way, this film is not about the obvious to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become members.. and lovers, or as history I bereaved mother who is looking for his lost daughter Europe, obviously, it does not say anything about the nature of «Gespenster» at all,
