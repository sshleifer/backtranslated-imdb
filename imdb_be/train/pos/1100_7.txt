- What grew tired of the rat race and compressed conditions of life in New York, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) is the property of the country for his wife and children. He hopes to find a simple life. But to build a house is not easy. As headaches and bills begin to pile up, so the laughs. Will Mr. Blanding ever get a house of his dreams? <br /> <br /> - What makes this film so special three main actors - Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. Any of the three can carry a film on his own, so if you combine their talents, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role. He plays well brought her husband. Loy is always a joy to watch. Thin Man films she made with William Powell is almost perfect. And Douglas has become a favorite of mine for the past two to three years. Douglas has also appeared in The Old Dark House, a particular favorite of mine <br /> <br /> -. The film is certainly a product of its time. I enjoy imagining the time when you could build a two-storey, three bedrooms, four bathrooms, the house on $ 15,000 of income per year. Throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live in maid, and it becomes almost fantastic <br /> <br /> -. However, for those who bought or built a house, many of the situations and heavy Blanding find yourself easily Relatable today. And that's where the comedy comes from. How many people do some of the silly things a couple does in this film only end up costing more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the whole "woman in love with best friend" scene. It really is not worth the story and feels out of place and very uncomfortable, as shown.
