I remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old, but what is surprising is that I never looked at it afterwards. The other day I was babysitting my cousin never seen, all Dogs Go To Heaven so we rented both movies and watching them together today and he really loved these films. So many memories came back to watch this film again, and I must admit that I even cried a little bit. I am 22 years old, and made still gets to me. All dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films, and I'm shocked, honestly this 5.8 rating, I thought that this film will bring back good memories for others. I admit, the animation was a bit typical, but the story is just so sweet and fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie Gamble dog who gets killed by another dog gambling, Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge, he returns to Earth with a clock that can not stop ticking, or that the end of his life again. When he and his best friend, itch, look Carface and spy on it, they will learn how Carface gets all his money, he has a little orphan who talks to animals and figures out who is going to win the race. Charlie takes the girl, Anne-Marie, and making false promises in order to get money. But he ends up learning that perhaps he should put Ann-Marie first in front of him when Carface back to him with a vengeance. <br /> <br /> All dogs go to heaven the perfect family film, it's not Disney, but it's a great family movie to watch. Not to mention the fact that it is just so cute and touching. I know that ridicule and some people call me crazy, but this film for me when I was a child, made me believe that dogs have souls. How could they not? They are just so fond of, and I think I'm going to cry again. But in any case, I would just recommend this movie to everyone, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
