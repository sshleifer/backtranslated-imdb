I enjoyed this film. In contrast, some of the evacuated, steroid garbage that passes for militants, Playing God is simple and realistic, with characters who are believable, the action of which is not over the top and enough twists and turns to keep you interested until the end. <br /> <br /> Well directed, well acted, and a good story.
