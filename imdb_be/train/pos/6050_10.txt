Finally! Decent British comedy that is not centered around a certain mockney bank robber or separated from the series. John Ivay film is the story of the discovery of psychoactive dressed in biker gear. Three main protagonist gentle fools prone to failure, and each at a turning point in their lives, giving a sensitive, emotional trio of sub-plots make wild comedy together. The chemistry between the three amigos sensitive and makes for a touching dialogue with hilarious dialogue and some classic comedy moments. He feels part of Withnail and I, part of An American Werewolf in London, and part Quadraphenia (but only because of the bike gang, and Phil Daniels). In fact, the attractive villain Phil Daniels' recalls Danny dealer in Withnail and I, with its scientific approach and scientific drug addiction. This is a great movie, especially for those who have already dabbled in psychoactive substances in the past, which will apply to many moments in the film. Personal favorite brilliant scene in the Welsh coal store, buying sandwiches at the descent on Â«Shrooms. This gentle comedy will warm your heart and mussel you laugh. And you do not ride a bike or even how they like it. But it will add to that, if you do. Brilliant.
