May nanny was a fan, so I've seen many of the old episodes while growing. I'm not a fan of Scooby-Doo, so I do not know why I left the TV on when the show premiered. To my surprise, I found that it was nice. For me, Shaggy and Scooby were only interesting characters * dodges tomatoes from other fans * so I like that they focus only on these two. However, this can lead to fans of the original show to hate him. I like the voice acting, particularly Dr. Phinius Phibes. I loved to listen to him before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimno Robbie sounds to me as if he really enjoyed his work as an actor. I also get a kick out of techies are slightly autistic individuals and their desire to play Dungeons & Dragons, or act out scenes from Star Wars (do not call these names in the show, of course).
