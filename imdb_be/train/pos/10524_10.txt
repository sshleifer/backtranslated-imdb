Jane Austen, of course, approve of this! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow does an amazing job, exciting relationship Emma. She's funny without being too silly, but elegant. She puts on a very convincing British accent (not being British myself, maybe I'm not the best judge, but it fooled me ... she was beautiful in "Sliding Doors" ... I sometimes forget that it is an American ~!) , <br /> <br /> In addition, brilliant are Norte and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Lee (the sister and mother of Emma Thompson) as women Bates. They almost steal the show ... and Ms. Law does not even have any lines! <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended.
