I could not find someone to watch Dig! with me, because no one knew I was a supporter of any of the bands. Naturally, everyone thought that you can only enjoy this film, if you like the music or the Dandy Warhols and Brian Jonestown Massacre, but it is so far from the truth. The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way in which pit the two groups compared is the perfect representation of the ways the group can take and watch the audience eat and spit out the Dandy Warhols mesmerizing. I agree with other reviews that said it would be nice to get the final word from the Anton, since it clearly shows how his worst enemy and bulwarks on the group's ability to just stay. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing for me to respect Dandys' to BJM (in spite of their absence or reciprocating) and Anton (in spite of his strange behavior). The Dandy Warhols respected art group produces, even if the group hates all Dandy Warhols now stand for (although this is debatable). The best line when Dandy drummer says, "I will not have them again somewhere new I" and guitarist unknowingly burn "I still buy their record, though." It just shows to me how powerful music can be good. <br /> <br /> Definitely see this movie, even if you know nothing or group. It's more about the themes of rock music, and how they develop, what makes this film so interesting. It is rarely stick to the group so close for so long.
