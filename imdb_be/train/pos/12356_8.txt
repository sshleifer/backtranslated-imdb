Contrary to resume some people, the women depicted in the film is not a geisha. They Ojra (prostitutes) who live outside of the most well-known recreational areas, and their lives and experiences of life are a large number of women of the Tokugawa period. I can not say that the stories were particularly instructive, but their charm lies in how they are typical. Topics are universal and every day :. Love, friendship and sacrifice <br /> <br /> I really like the art direction and action. I felt that I was getting an idea of ​​the time and place I can never another glimpse. The actors, especially of 4 women who have played a major Ojra been a thrill to watch. I would only recommend this movie for people who want to try the Japanese culture, or for those who love the quiet and emotional stories. This is an excellent example of how.
