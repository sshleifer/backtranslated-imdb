What if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe DiMaggio and Senator McCarthy had come together in the evening hallucinogenic relativity? <br /> <br /> This beautiful novel with a key never uses the actual names of the characters so thinly veils and bitingly exposes not only for the people they were supposed to, but for the fact that they have come to represent for long time. If you are puzzled by allegories, or if you want your films serves cooked-to-drink and soft, you will not like this film. This demanding opus that rewards the viewer on many levels with the intelligence to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> dropping for some time, a strict refusal to use the real names of the characters, we see Einstein, how to put a pacifist speech, the United Nations possessed a nuclear weapon, visited by Marylin Monroe, after filming the notorious seven year itch scene that some say led to the end of her marriage to Joe DiMaggio. They have excellent interaction in which Einstein bumps with a suitable professor awkwardness around innocence, perhaps the greatest sex symbol present. <br /> <br /> Enter Senator McCarthy, who thinks that Einstein is red. He is determined to get the confidence of Einstein that he will support the activities of the Committee of the House of Unamerican activities, while providing the ultimate weapon for peace. Add Joe ~ d, a surprisingly gentle and vulnerable, perhaps not quite quit, Gary Busey, who hates exhibitionism Marylin and believes Einstein became her lover, even though, Marylin only wants to show the Einstein that she understands the special theory of relativity . <br /> <br /> But there's more. <br /> <br /> Just as each of us, these characters have their deepest fears, that they show one another in pursuing retrospection. It is these drawbacks, ultimately, humanity that lends to the figures, we can not help seeing almost exclusively in the abstract today. Finally, we see a shocking horror of Einstein, and approval of the film becomes clear. It is a powerful and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> insignificance of one of my top five movies of all time. It is absolutely amazing.
