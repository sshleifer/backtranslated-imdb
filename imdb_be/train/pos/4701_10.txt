"Roman Troy MoronieÂ» my comment on the film. What else to say? <br /> <br /> This character really brings a moron in Moronie. Tough mobster with the inability to utter impious words, well, it seems to me that it would be unpleasant to be tough, but has not yet been able to express himself intelligently. <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie go down in the annals of film history as one of the greatest of all the idiots. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, a great comedy, among other characters. Michael Keaton F.A.H. so Joe Piscipo. <br /> <br /> I just like the fact that Moronie holding film rated "R", because he could not utter a profanity.
