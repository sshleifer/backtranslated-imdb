........... I was when I saw that movie) I'll never watch this movie again, not because it's a bad film, but because so much scared me! As I said, I was 14 when my English teacher decided to show us; The reason for this is that we read a passage from the book. <br /> <br /> All the girls in my class were frightened when a woman in black comes in through the window and floats above the bed Kidd, though, just before that, there is something that is also frightened us, which was when Kidd is a toy soldiers under his pillow, and he hears a child's voice say, "this is for you." The scene still haunts me to this day, nearly 7 years after I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are shy, AVOID THIS FILM !!!!!!!!
