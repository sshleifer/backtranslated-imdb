Mardi Gras: Made in China provides an excellent, complex relationship between popular culture, nudity and globalization through manufacturing and throwing of beads. I saw this film at the International Film Festival in Boston, and I wait for the dry introduction to globalization, but what I got riveting visual display shocking images of China and the United States. Instructive movie humor, depth, serious and entirely indulgent, and it leaves you wanting more, the role of credit. It is worth comparing with Murderball - it's just that well done. Young workers in China have different points of view, and the owner of the strange secret discipline. Revelers during the Carnival is the highlight, but only because it's a great film provides a deeper context inside the factory in China without the story. Bravo director for ingestion and ending movie! I never would have thought about the connection between the beads, China and New Orleans; Now I'm thinking about the human connection between almost every object, but also the role of globalization, inequality and pleasure. More importantly, I can make these connections without experiencing feelings of guilt after watching this film, unlike other films about globalization that I have seen.
