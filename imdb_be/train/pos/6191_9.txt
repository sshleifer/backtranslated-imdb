It seems that Hal Hartley films are kind of hit or miss with the majority of viewers. This film is no exception to this rule. Fay Grim acts as a continuation of Hartley's "Henry FooleÂ» with 1998 focus this time on the ex-wife of Henry (played to perfection always polite Parker Posey), which is currently bugged thugs CIA unpublished book Henry all his shady deals. In between all this time, of Fay odyssey ends in dealing with international spies, etc .. The film does get a bit bogged down in the second half. If you were a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, it is not to be missed. For a beginner Hartley first timer, who had just heard about it a film manufacturing technique, you can check your previous films before taking it (especially if you have not seen "Henry yet). I admired the camera work, which reminded me of some early photos of Man Ray.
