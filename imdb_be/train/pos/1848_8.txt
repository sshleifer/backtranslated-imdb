Several years ago, the fleet kept studied distance from the production of "men of honor", a film based on the experience of the struggle of the first black Starshinov diver service to overcome the virulence of racism. We are always ready to support the movies that show our best side Navy USS Nimitz and two helicopter assault media, with the support of onshore facilities were provided in the annex to this exciting story of the battle of the young sailor with uncontrolled anger. Some of the movie was filmed on board the USS Belleau Wood. <br /> <br /> Antwo ne Fisher wrote the screenplay for his debut directorial Denzel Washington, in which he stars as a psychiatrist naval attending Fischer played effectively and deep Derek Luke. <br /> <br /> Fisher deliberately striking the military assigned to the USS Belleau Wood (LHA- 3), the front line of attack helicopter platform. Fisher can not seem to avoid launching their attacks on minimal provocation with his fellow enlisted men. Sent to the MD as part of a possible pre-separation, Fischer opened slowly to black psychiatrist, exposing the terrible children GUSTs great neglect and shuddering ferocity. <br /> <br /> The story develops as Fisher cautiously, but more and more confidence in your doctor and get the courage to pursue a love interest, an ordinary seaman named Cheryl played stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fisher reluctantly comes into contact with a doctor, asking questions long smoldering, but soon realizes that he must seek answers, however painful to grow up and move away from the conflict, who are looking for disruptive behavior. <br /> <br /> while all the main characters are black, the story goes beyond the race while showing steadfast evil rich religious and accompanying hypocrisy in foster family units. Viola Davis, a versatile actress in a whole series of recent films, the picture is grim immorality, but nothing compared to the foster mother, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), who in a short but searing scene would make - if it existed - Oscar gut churning brutality. <br /> <br /> Movies about the interaction of therapist-patient follow a certain predictability (all that transference and countertransference thing), but the severity of Fisher and his doctor / teacher really exciting. It's a good story, well told. Period. <br /> <br /> While set on the navy, "Antwone Fisher" is not a real sense of service history, as it was "men of honor" a great film, which dealt a crushing racism directed against a real person, not from ' is it really a film about blacks. This is about the survival of terrible childhood experiences and how Fischer says, being able to announce in adulthood, that the victim is still "stand tall". Persecutors to shrink in size and importance as a brave and strong young man claims that his right to a dignified life with a caring doctor. <br /> <br /> My only quibble is that Washington is a lieutenant commander, but is addressed as commander. With all the support of Navy people listed in the credits, someone should have told the director of Washington, that his character, like all naval officers below the rank of commander, is regarded as "Mr.". Not a big criticism is that? :) <br /> <br /> I do not know why this movie is played in so few theaters. It deserves wide distribution. Derek Luke may also receive an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
