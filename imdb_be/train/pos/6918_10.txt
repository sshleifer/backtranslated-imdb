Very enjoyable film, which shows the characters that do bad things, and that allow emotions like anger and desire for revenge on the bubble. Acting is very good, there is a lot of action, and Stewart gets the girl and revenge (with a twist) in the end. I saw this movie a few times and always watch when he is on the AMC or cable. It is highly recommended ...
