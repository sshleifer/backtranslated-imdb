What can I say?, Ms Eleniak my favorite blonde ever, and, as an Italian American, the fan number one of feminine beauty, I can not forget this film. <br /> <br /> You know, I really do not "remember much about the plot, or the situation, or other entities. I can only recall the drop dead gorgeous Erika and that in this film, she looks better than ever, I really do not care if it was a bad movie or a good movie, I only care about the good moments I was a teenager in Brooklyn just contemplating the beauty Erica. <br /> <br /> Well, just to conclude, if you are a fan Beauty Eleniak, as I do, of course, this film is for you.
