«Jake Speed» is a great movie with a wonderful message. It has its drawbacks, of course. Sometimes it's a little slow. He introduces his villain is too far back in history. This action is distorted at a snail heartbeat. It has a Z-class actor (although I have always admired the work Kopinsa having puritanical good looks Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But all this is happening against him, "Jake Speed» is really inspiring, thanks to the magic scenario Wayne Crawford (who plays the title role) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> Why I find it so inspiring because he said to me: "Hey, why not try to be a good person» <br /> <br /> history essentially "stranger in a strange land," the premise that it is good. and and heroic Jake speed is located in the real world where bad things happen to good people. Jake more than Boy Scout. He is more than a knight in shining armor. zastupni Jake speed optimism in the dirt, therefore evil in the world. <br /> <br /> It is because of this that «Jake Speed» actually need to be a hit. It has a great message, which was to get to Hollywood, then the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine a film industry that really pushed himself to portray good and decent people. I'm not saying that we should look at the Waltons in every theater Cineplex, but it would be nice if more films such as «Jake Speed» will get a chance. ( «Due South," a TV show about a Canadian Mountie, it's a good comparison of what can be done to improve the American entertainment.) <br /> <br /> Of course, "Jake Speed» is violence, blood and weapons, but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person, you will beat the forces of evil every time. 10/14/99
