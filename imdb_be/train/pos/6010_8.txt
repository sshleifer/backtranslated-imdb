"Zabriskie Point" (1970): This was especially interesting for me on a personal level, as it does under the same conditions with the same peers in my own life ?? movement counter culture of the late 60s / early 70s, on the and off campus. We go for two unrelated young people in individual stories, which are slowly woven together. One young man in Los Angeles, tired of endless, pseudo-chatter in the classrooms and canteens its campus, and, on the other hand, young woman at the wheel in Phoenix to see vaygo father & the employer, as well as take on the "creation" of the work. full film (Michelangelo Antonioni) our Italian director of visual symbols of America, and, embarrassed, psychedelicrazies of self-righteous of that era, "we know all this, we will change things for the better" youth. Just who is "revolutionary"? What does that mean? Do you dress like one and go around singing, whether there is "flying under the radar," but to give advance notice of arrival? Do you support your plans to yourself and go about the business changes, without the need for approval of the group? "Zabriskie Point" definitely "period piece" - full of slang, uniforms, more surreal moments of the film (in the end, this film is the man who gave us this amazing «Blow Up» 1966), and artifacts of the era in, but it is more . It presents options for the Cultural Revolution, and there Antonioni (who seems to support it), young people are too self-involved to see what is needed for enormous success. Because of this, it becomes a powerful, frightening film, which applies to anyone at any time, anywhere.
