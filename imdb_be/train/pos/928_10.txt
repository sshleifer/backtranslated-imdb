I watched most of the series, how could I manage to watch on TV, but, unfortunately, started to work, that made me work in the evening. I managed to catch a few records of it, at least ... and, of course, bought a newly released DVD in a complete series. Watching the DVD, you can see that the animation was a little rougher on the ground, but they smoothed a significant number of shortcomings, after the pilot was made. Voices are well suited for the characters, and the writing is remarkable. It's pretty good to see the animation back to its roots by the reintroduction of adult themes. The fact is, with the way society has come in the last century, you have to be a little more blatant about it by today's standards, to be recognized as an adult-oriented show. Symbols have a very realistic person and placed in situations that are parallel to that we often encounter in real life. This is a typical sitcom in this area, but the humor is more like what you would expect from a late-night television talk show as a parody or Saturday Night Live ... so when SNL was actually funny. Good work, Dreamworks. Maybe you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going ... and improve the distribution of goods to the series, to help cover the high cost of this. It is a challenge to do it for permanent cartoon character, though. Hmm ...
