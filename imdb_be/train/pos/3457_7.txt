This Columbo, received the director Steven Spielberg at an early stage of his career. This is not sensational, but a little hint at great things to come to Spielberg can be seen in this film. The film is basically the same style as most of Spierlberg to "70 film and television work. So that does not mean that some of the characters tend to show a certain pretentiousness, and no I'm not just talking about the character of Columbo alone. Quirkiness of the character, which may best be seen in 1975, Spielberg's "Jaws". But apart from some small hints of the typical elements of early Spielberg, you can not call this film a work Of- and an excellent example of a rising star director. Not that it is bad, of course, but it's not, as I said earlier, this is not something too sensational. <br /> <br /> This film started very good and very promising, but after this discovery well, which as it was always murder, the film became a kind of a slow and boring to watch. Boring, because it's basically a movie Columbo on a book that has no real memorable moments in it, not boring, because it's sad to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The killing itself was very inventive and the concept of having a crime story writer murder of his partner letters showed some great and interesting potential. History, however, is not really explored all the possibilities. At least, the feeling of the film left me. <br /> <br /> The film was still a good one to watch however, owing to the character of Jack Cassidy, who thinks he's smarter than Columbo, because of its mystery / crime writing experience and trying to give him all kinds of possible clues that led by himself. But, of course, Columbo knows better, and it is his number one suspect from the first moment, but he usually plays the game together. <br /> <br /> The film does have a good overall style and uses some clear position camera and editing. It's funny to see that most of it was basically in line with the follow-up of Spielberg, especially some of the camera angles. <br /> <br /> penalty altogether watchable Columbo movie, but do not let them Spielberg attached to it up to your expectations too high for him. <br /> <br /> 7/10
