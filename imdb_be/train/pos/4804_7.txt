I watched this movie on DVD a couple of times now, the first time I watched the second half after an hour, and then returned in the first hour. exciting an interesting film, thank God, is not it Kier Knightley, refreshing, and it gives us an idea of ​​all the present hard life Queen Victoria and hard choices she had to make. Nothing bad about the movie at all, no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature that would offend for family viewing. It can encourage children to explore a bit of the Queen Victoria, and perhaps less well-known characters such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne
