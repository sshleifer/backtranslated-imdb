I'm a huge fan of John Denver. I have a large collection of his music on vinyl. I've seen this Christmas special, when it was originally on TV and loved it. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I have the original disks and later. A later version missing a few songs, though. I see that he has been released this year with all original songs. To my surprise, I found the original CD for sale at a price of $ 75.00. WOW - I think Christmas Cd should be so much. For me, the sum should not sell this treasure. This is my favorite Christmas CD. I've never been able to find it on VHS or DVD. I would like to have any version. If anyone has one available, please let me know. thanks
