I can understand why this film was nominated for an Oscar for the best short, as it was built elaborate. Even if you do not particularly like the blues (although for me it sounded much more like a jazz), you can easily evaluate this film. It's just a very well done, although for the life of me, I can not understand why the director Gzhon Mile received only send one film - is one thing. In other words, the film is nominated director and still have not received any career momentum. As for black performers, I could understand that it does not cause their career go into high gear, because, unfortunately, the majority of white society are indifferent (or worse) for black or "this kind of music." <br /> <br /> When you watch this film, if you do not particularly enjoy the earlier part, to skip ahead to about 5:50 mark - where he raises considerably. If a woman stopped singing and singers began to improvise, the pace has improved quite a bit.
