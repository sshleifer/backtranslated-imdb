It is quite a strange film. She comes across as a film operation with over-the-top violence and unrealistic situation, but unusual for rural built around characters in a state of war with each other, as opposed to the invasion of the "other." <br /> <br /> film is excessive stereotyping of veterans of the Vietnam War, in a series of films that reflect the veterinarian of the war as a dangerous psycopaths. The last line of Kris Kristofferson is "I have not lost the war yet," as he meets his demise after sowing a long trail of death and destruction, including the chief of the city police and a friend of his brother in a very frightening scene. However Kristofferson is a good enough actor and charismatic enough to carry this villain with amazing depth. Vincent clearly the golden boy, but with sufficient intensity layered over with a clean sharp kindness. The movie has some similarities to the plot of Winchester 73 where Jimmy Stewart is trying to prevent criminal brother, until forced to act against it. <br /> <br /> film has action Grade B-movie, although the presence of Kristofferson, Vincent, a magnificent main Victoria and Bernadette Peters to give him A-Class model range. <br /> <br /> I give it a 7 for that long lost species in the American psyche after the Vietnam / Reagan to introspection, paranoia and confusion, and the film industry, which was ready to solve these issues at the time. <br /> <br /> I saw on the channel, a large network, which continues to play a lot of old movies 70s for 90 years, regardless of political bent.
