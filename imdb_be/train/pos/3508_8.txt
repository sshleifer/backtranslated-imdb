Incredibly intriguing and fun, I found it impossible to look away, as soon as I started watching. I'm usually one of the harshest critics, but for me this film was just brilliant, strange as it may seem, I could almost feel the air smell and feel the texture of seats. <br /> <br /> With the cinema I thought that most of the use of light and texture. With the orange glow of summer light, down to all plastic wrapped couch we had a clear air of realism to me. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the character, I thought that the concept of Victor Vargas, almost the glue that connects the story was really excited, each of the other members of the family, which has a more complete background just caused great intrigue of the main hero. <br /> <br /> In addition, having known someone just like my grandmother, and having been on the receiving end of just such a situation, I can say that the situation is particularly realistic. Awkward accent, cooking and even down to the comments felt so authentic to me. <br /> <br /> I think that this film worked for me because I started watching it without expectations and found it totally immersing and brings back memories of teenage emotions, worth watching.
