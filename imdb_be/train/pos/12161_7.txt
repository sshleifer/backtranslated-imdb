Micheal Macliamm√≥ir makes Victor Buono type a bit, but all too often in the movie wobbles dangerously close to a bad musical ... has a particularly awful children's story about halfway. Debbie cranes, tango and tricks in Los Angeles Harlow, while religious fanatic winters lesbian has an edge to it. Agnes Moorehead checks as an evangelist. Weaver has nothing to do - and even have to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie.
