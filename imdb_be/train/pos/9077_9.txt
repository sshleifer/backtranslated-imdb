I really enjoyed the pilot, it was so strange, as I had hoped it would be, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a riot, though at first I thought I could not stand his character. He Megyn Price a little chemistry in general, but hopefully as the season goes on, they will get more comfortable around each other. It was amazing to Megyn, to go from [ "grounded For LifeÂ»] star on his last show before the co-star. <br /> <br /> Kaylich and Oliver Hudson, it seems really new to the whole scene sitcoms, but I think that with time they will get better. Recession character David, to my surprise, not the entire focus of this pilot. The way he delivers his lines so different from anyone I've ever seen on TV, but I think it's just his style. He works for him. <br /> <br /> I think that couples or singles, will be able to treat all the doubts and fights, and be confident in their decisions, it is a show about. All the situations the characters got to feel just like real life, instead of sugar, like most of the show. <br /> <br /> I hope that for the good of all the actors that CBS gives them a chance. This show has the potential to be one of the best series, only to give a chance and time.
