It has long lost precious stone horror starring Sydney Lassik ( "Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. Sometimes it's hard to find a copy of this film, but it's worth it. This movie is terrible even cheese at the same time. It seems that 3 young newswomen (Karen, Vicky, and Jennifer) trip to the small town of Solvang, California, to cover the festival, when the confusion occurs with the participation of their number, and they sought refuge in the house of Earnest of Keller (Lassick) and his weird wife Virginia . Vicki left behind, feeling bad, like the other two off to take down his story. She was soon killed in a house in a very cheesy way some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (it beheaded closing the lid vent as it comes crashing down on her when she was being pulled through and basement). Soon Karen is back, and she was killed in a more brutal way, having her face rammed through the ventilation cover. Jennifer struggles with her (ex?) Lover in a rather sad sub-plot, and when she returned home, her owners (whom we now found a brother and sister, and whatever it was that in the basement of their son) develop the plot to try to kill her as well. Virgina do not entirely agree with the plan convincing to the murder of Jennifer, but she was deceived into going to the basement, where she meets less. Here, the film becomes almost comical, as a junior (portrayed hysterically Stephen Furst) is deformed, moronic, Manchild, whose actions and movement causes few chuckles, though it should be scary. This is where the film's pace picks up and the ending is well done. Actors / Actresses doing an amazing job with the material, especially Lassick, Furst, and Bach, and though it is not the worst film ever made it very interesting!
