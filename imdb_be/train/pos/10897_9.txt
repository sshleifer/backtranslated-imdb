What can you expect from a movie called "Survival Christmas'and presented as a" festive spree, "something like Ghandi or The English Patient? There are many things that I love about this movie is funny, it is very well chosen, and it is well written. I came to the film as a fan Kaplan / Elfort but it is doubtful when I read the story, it sounds ridiculous. But the film does not come across that way because Affleck (as Drew Latham) plays its role perfectly, one minute a child as an adult following mature person who realizes that he has received everything in life, but what he really wants. In fact, we see a growing armor in this film, as he faces the problems of those he envies, and realizes that their life is not so good that he sees that his lot is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This film has fewer weaknesses or a dud scenes than in many other comedies that I've seen. Comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama, it either works or it does not and very few comedy writers get it right every time.I was particularly fond of the theater stage, where the family take to read parts written Latham. Fun in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). This dilemma greedy Togo Valco, which must bite his tongue, wearing silly hats or sing on the Christmas tree in order to earn prize money, which keep the film moving along well. <br /> <br /> In addition daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) in history brings a beautiful romantic angle, and why not a Christmas movie? Of course, it corny and contrived; it is rich and beautiful, she is beautiful and single, and therefore it is inevitable and Afflect eventually fall together in the snow, and found himself face-to-face. Excellent! One thing that I would have been more useful holiday music to enhance the atmosphere, but I can not complain. I got what I wanted.
