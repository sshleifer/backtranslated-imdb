I do not think this movie like just another children's film - the whole family can enjoy. Its strange mixture of the film as it seems, there is a movie in it, but at least it makes sense, after all (as opposed to contemporary films!) It gives you all the elements of the film (a decent plot, good character - well, this is not the star of the Muppets, the list of celebrities less * which movies will require) that is surprising is that it can be slides of emotions, some boring, some friendly, funny and some serious - it all makes a nice family film, that everyone can watch together. <br /> <br /> * celebrities in the film is actually the top stars of the day, but there is only one real star of the film, and no one dares to overshadow Miss Piggy !!!!
