Sometimes tired to read reviews of some of the lesser-known Hitchcock film, because almost every one starts with someone saying the film grossly ignored or a hidden rock or a true Hitchcock Hitchcock large or any other generic when - Only - People - b - watch - it - it - to - see - what - is - it - - big - Hitchcock - film - just - like - a lot - in - dizziness - North - to - North West - Psycho - rear - window - and etc. so that being said, I would just like to say that if - Only - People - - will be watching - it - it - to - see - what - is - it - - big - Hitchcock - film - just - as - many - to - dizziness - North - to - North West - Psycho - rear - window - etc. <br /> <br /> now, that may be overstating a bit, does not ring any stretch of the imagination, even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice as high, but compared to the other films, Hitchcock, made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, I really think that TNA t Ring is one of the best photographed and made films mostly all of them. Almost new director, there are some amazing sequences of dreams and brilliant editing segments, that show why Hitchcock generated so much attention at the beginning of his career. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film really starts with, among other things, a very disturbing sight of black circus idiot (and I use the idiot in the final form, as Stephen King so often happens) that have eggs and fruit thrown it crowd Sun smotryut class white people. I suppose that just shows how incredibly different circuses and such people were then, but I think this is one of the most scare sequences in any Hitchcock film I've seen. <br /> <br /> The main attractions in the circus fighter who claims to be able to knock down any man in one round, but when he meets his match, that against a man who challenges his authority not only in the ring but also ring around his finger wife, So begins a fascinating if not very hard task for the love of a woman who seems to swing from one person to another easily and thoughtlessly. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) There is, for example, a scene in which her husband looking down at her as she landed at home late at night, just before the entrance to the building, she coaxed back to the car for a kiss. This kiss is never explained, and there is also the fact that even at the end when she is faithful to her husband, or at least, in the end it chooses, they look into each other's eyes, but do not actually kiss. <br /> <br /> the film, of course, beautifully photographed, even more than a few films that Hitch released in subsequent years. There is also a performance of Gordon Harker as a coach of one of Jack Round that a stone at him before Expressionism, reminds me quite often brilliant Buster Keaton. Hitch leaves a bit ambiguous, but it is an excellent example of his early work.
