I saw this first in 1975 some German TV channel and hooked immediately, and then I saw this movie about 12 times in the movie, and now I have a videotape that I watch at least once a year - this film is excellent in every aspect (direction of action, cut, music ...). Sets outstanding and very impressive, the idea of ​​a devastating World War II, beginning in the late thirties, it seems like a prophecy for one thousand nine hundred thirty-six film dictator «Everytown» purely Mussolini and Raymond Massey charming, plausible and perfectly cast as. "Hero" positive tone against to technology and progress is quite refreshing for today's generally pessimistic standards -. especially the final scene, which always brings a tear or two of my eyes, even after seeing the film so many times <br /> <br /> this movie is well on TV, but it was done for big screen, so if you have the opportunity to see him in some movies. Please, it's staggering.
