Let's keep it simple: My two children were glued to this film. It has its drawbacks with an adult point of view, but to buy the jelly-worm and simply enjoy. <br /> <br /> And Pepsi girl was excellent! <br /> <br /> And Kimberly Williams was pretty gosh-darn hot, although it is not in the movie very much, so do not get too excited there. <br /> <br /> Not that this is actually a bad thing, but it's the kind of movie you watch only once. Do not buy the DVD. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br /> I have already said Kimberly Williams? (It was for Dad.)
