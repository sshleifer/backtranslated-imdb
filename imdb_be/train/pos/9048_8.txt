I struggled to see this movie, and I understand why it was not a big hit in theaters. "October Sky» feels and looks oh so familiar. And it is. All narrative tricks and emotions have been studied before in other films - and perhaps even better. But in spite of this knowledge, and the resistance of all the formulas of Hollywood, the movie wins and cute at every step. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart, mind and soul. Just as the characters from the musical by Stephen Sondheim's Merrily we roll stood gaping at the top of his flat roof in the hope that the launch of its new generation ( "What do you call it? You call it a miracle.»), Sputnik has a similar effect on the young rocket boys this true story. While the city's coal exhausted their inhabitants in 1950 to dissolve the event, Homer satellite Hikey see his ticket out of the life in the mines. <br /> <br /> the power and direction of the cast make the journey rocket boy Homer and his pals seem fresh and new. Especially affected are podagovory relatively young patient teacher Homer school. Characteristic restraint shown in the image of their loving relationship. Also noteworthy, the father / son supblot, that anchors the film. Great game all around. Even Homer mom gets her point without a stencil or invasion. Her husband an ultimatum at the same time majestic and heatbreaking. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> <br /> A major video chains I despise has a sign next to the movie that you will love this movie, and they will return your money. At this time, I agree with them. You'll never look at the sky October quite the same again. <br /> <br />
