I do not know if I'm just a country, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. <br /> <br /> Returning to the cabin on the lake, of course, the continuation of one of my favorite movies cabins on the lake. In fact, I think I liked this movie even more than the first. I also thought that in this film the actors was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the story as a whole. I liked the fact that this second film focuses on the film screenplay Stanley Cabin in the lake was not completely redundant film Stanley capture other girls and drown them. - If you are looking for some deeper meaning, then this movie is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, and then go ahead and watch it. I've probably killed at least ten o'clock to watch this movie. :)
