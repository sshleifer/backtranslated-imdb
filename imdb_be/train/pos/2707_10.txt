Cor Blimey. This movie really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece. Billy Zane is stunning as the central character, and manages to play all straight enough for comedy, to be natural and easy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is very good and set pieces are a joy to behold. I recommend you see this movie with a bunch of mates, a few bottles of liquor of your choice and get ready to be surprised and very entertained. <br /> <br /> It is so different from kitsch masterpieces as Plan 9 from Outer Space, that it is in this «B» cinema tradition. But what makes it more than the caliber of the people who took part in the film. Ron Perlman, for example. I still find yourself a giggle at the scene where Zane rack down a set of steps for no apparent reason in almost ballet style. All little intelligence, and all the better for it.
