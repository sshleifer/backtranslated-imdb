The denser the drama, the better the movie sister competition! This little gem was largely positioned as a comedy after its release in Sweden, so I'm glad to find that not all business. Funny bits small town of controversy out there to enjoy, of course, but the drama takes center stage as the story progresses. And not just a family drama, it also raises thorny questions about saving people's way of life the differences <br /> <br /> A large ensemble of character with many magnificent and moving dramatic scenes that gain credibility points. and they not only Scattershot, but keep everything in place. It just makes me assume that if it did Ingmar Bergman (drama suit him!), International attention, probably would have been immediately. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 Ozjeppe.
