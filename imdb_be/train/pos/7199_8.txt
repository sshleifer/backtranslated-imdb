Playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) has been a series of flop game after a huge hit. He gets a play written by his student, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), which is fantastic. It's so good Sidney said that he would kill him. Will he? <br /> <br /> thinking man's thriller. Initially, it was a game ... and it shows. It's basically on a single set, and everyone is talking, but I was never boring. It is very well written with a lot of twists and a good working cast in full force. Caine is just fine as Bruhl - another of his great performances. Reeve, surprisingly, very good. I never thought much about it, as an actor, but he's really good in this role. Dyan Cannon makes a miracle with a guaranteed role Br√ºhls wife. Irene should also be good (and quite funny) as Helga ten drops psychic. However, its emphasis is on my nerves. Directed by Sidney Lumet is doing very well with it in one piece. The camera is constantly moving and keeps your attention is going. <br /> <br /> EXTREME SPOILER DEAD AHEAD !!!!! My only complaint is that two gay characters in this film are raging psychopath, but also contains one I've ever seen the most unromantic kiss - but it's mild complaints <br /> <br /> Very. a good thriller. Critics hate this film (for some reason), and it seems to have completely disappeared, as it happened in 1982, it is very bad - he deserves better.
