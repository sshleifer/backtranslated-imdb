After ran across this film on Fox movie on a lazy Friday afternoon, I can not think of a better way to spend a lazy Friday evening and then put in my two cents worth. Especially when you consider the lack of users' comments on it. Not every film, good or bad, deserve more than four comments? And this movie is not bad. <br /> <br /> The first thing to keep in mind when watching a movie on April Love remember the era from which he came, in this case, in the late fifties. Films were largely happy medium then. Cinemas have been deprived of a tragedy, and the screens were filled with a wide-screen Technicolor films to snatch the man from the gray shine evil environment in the box called television. I do not know how many people are pulled from the image on the tube to see this, but he was able to capture my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> Teen Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teenager sent to live with his Aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and Uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell) in the country, after a trial period of a carjacking. It seems that his aunt and uncle lost his own son (Jed Jr.), so that Uncle Jed seems to have lost interest in life. Aunt Henrietta hopes that Nick being on a farm will somehow lead the Jedi from his doldrums. Storylines like it to be what they are, Jed and Nick do not really care about each other too much, of course. Jed then goes to meet with neighbors, FRAN (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Jed immediately develops a crush on Fran, and, of course, I do not have to tell you that Liz develops a crush on the Jedi. Then there is the question of horse Uncle Jedi strokes that turned wild and do not let anyone treat him after the death of the Jedi Jr. You could fill in everything that goes on with this point alone, seeing as there are no real surprises. It does not matter, though, you'll enjoy anyway. <br /> <br /> After you get the image of a squeaky clean Pat Boone, like a bad boy, you will not have any problems with the rest of the film. Given that the groins retreat in a surprisingly good performance as Nick. Of course, the role does not require a lot of depth, but it's still a job well done, when you least expect it. Jed, Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for the role. In the early going, it is not available and the cold, but he was slowly warmed up to Nick, we can see that he's actually a very nice guy. Jeanette Nolan much fun as Henrietta, who always plays the role of mediator between the Jedi and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from the Rodgers and Hammerstein and receives several opportunities to beautify us with their singing talents. Liz, elegant to look at, great to listen to, and quite funny at times. Dolores Michaels, like Fran, which is a little more on the wild side, it is equally interesting. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the April Love, there is no true mean condoning the nature of any kind on the screen, not the one true villain in the whole thing. Everything is so damn cute, you can not help but enjoy the film. I truly find it very refreshing, like how to put their problems behind and enjoy a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as the old Andy Griffith show with musical numbers, a bit more plot, and wide screen Technicolor. Songs are heterogeneous, with the title track April Love is the best of them. Another thing I really liked that they do not fall back on the use of blue screen backgrounds during the racing sequences, horses, and they are quite a bit more interesting and exciting because of it. In fact, you will find all the beautifully photographed film, and it was nice to see that they do not skimp in this department. The chemistry between Jones and Bun well. Best of all, as the dislike between Nick and Jed portrayed as every attempt in some way to get in the other respect. <br /> <br /> This movie will never be confused with a great movie. However, sometimes instead of having to go to Disneyland, once it needs a good picnic in the park, and it's something that April Love <br /> <br /> My class :. B + <br /> <br />
