PaperHOUSE is the most exciting and poignant film that I have ever seen. Often classified as a "horror movie" is, I believe, is a serious mistake. Some journo once called him a "thinking man's Nightmare on Elm Street" and while I accept its logic conclusion, I can not help but think that this is a tag that is ill-deserved and misleading. Those who can see only the horror really missing here and only serves to demonstrate that they do not really thinking at all. <br /> <br /> In fact, just trying to classify this wonderful job, probably a bad idea. Simply put, PaperHOUSE is perfect in every minute detail, and will always have a special place in my heart. As someone smarter than me once said, "the movie strikes you on quite an emotional level", which may in some way to explain why my comments so relentlessly whips. Frankly, I do not apologize for it, so if you feel that my words are too sugary to the taste, not to read, because there is more. <br /> <br /> It's so rare to find a movie that has at its heart the pain and suffering of childhood and the struggle to overcome the terrible feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely break us in this delicate time in our lives. Even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their role with sensitivity and intelligence needed to make it all work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott steeple we had an inspiring part of the casting and the continuing impact PaperHOUSE owes much of its ability to reflect the melancholy and alienation childhood (often overlooked) in a seamless and compelling way. <br /> <br /> and yet both these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the understanding of the studio, and somehow disappeared. <br /> <br /> Add it all incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), creative cinematography, the most beautiful and memorable soundtrack you ever likely to hear, and you can start to get a hint about why I such love and intimacy to this film that no amount of words can not express. <br /> <br />
