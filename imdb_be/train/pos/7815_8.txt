«Cry Freedom» is a film about how far people will go to find the truth. <br /> <br /> The first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between an activist and editor of Biko Don Woods (played by fanatical Dezel Washington and Kevin Kline). While the other half is devoted to Woods seeks answers on Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that most people are in favor of the first half of the film, which focuses on the unlikely friendship between Biko and Woods'. I have found that the second half of the Don forests to fight to have a history of Biko be heard around the world is much more interesting.
