This film struck me as a project that has many of the right ingredients, but somewhere along the way, they do not quite come together. I do not know who did it, but he has several Disney-esque feel. While part of it is unlikely (for example, if pre-adolescents work in the public service) and, as a rule, to prevent this story from serious, have a healthy dose of normality (whatever that is) to keep things balanced and in term. Acting in the order. Ironically, between Frankie and her grandmother convincing relationship, but the relationship between Hazel and Frank a little ... off. It is interesting to see how it should work to maintain a balance between her best friend, her grandmother, and her two passions: baseball and ballet. As a baseball player myself, it was quite painful to watch Frankie try to hold its own in the boys team, but he does a good job showing the struggle she faced. I read somewhere that it is not really a dancer, but editing done a very good job in this film, making it look like dancing is not only natural, but it is beautiful. Overall, it was a good movie about honesty and ambition, but his star Mischa Barton does not quite reach the level of realism we have seen during her performance in «Lawn Dogs», «Lost and Delirious», and its small but shocking performance in front Osment in " The 6th Sense ».
