I saw this movie Sunday afternoon. I absolutely loved this film. I loved everything about it, from the juicy moments mother and daughters in scenes where MAMI Homer (Lila) was crying because of the weak solution of marrying a man of her parents, and not because she is really in love. I loved these moments, because they were so real. At first I was seriously scared, because I was hoping that this will not end up like Bobby, who was a big shot, but poorly written film with no real meat to it. But in the middle of the movie, I felt quite differently. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but in the end you want to see the evening again. Believe me when I say go see!
