It reminded me of Spinal Tap, on a more serious level. This is a story about the band makes a tour, but not harmonious between them. I was particularly impressed by Bill Nighy as Ray. You felt sorry for him, but he had a certain horror of it. This is a great movie to see if you ever see your favorite band get wrinkly, old and pathetic.Bittersweet, highly recommended ..
