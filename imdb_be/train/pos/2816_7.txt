This is above the average Jackie Chan film, due to the fantastic finale and a great sense of humor, but more that there is nothing special. All the characters are pretty cool, and the film is entertaining throughout, as well as Jackie Chan's amazing in it!. Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had a fantastic chemistry together, and both are very funny! And I thought that the chief opponent looked very threatening!, However, it overwriting was just terrible!. Character development is above average for this kind of thing! And the main battle is fantastic!, Plus some of the punches Jackie takes the stern!. There are a lot of really stupid and goofy humor in it, but it amused me, and the ending is hilarious!, Plus all the characters are quite nice. It's pretty cheap looking, but overall very well done, and while it does not have the amount of struggle you would expect from a wave of Jackie Chan, he does enough to keep you watching, plus one of my favorite moments in the film, when Jack (dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger), playing around with a rifle and go!. This is above the average Jackie Chan film, due to the fantastic finale, and great sense of humor, but other then that it's nothing big, still well worth a look!. Direction good. Jackie Chan does a good job here with a solid camera work fantastic angles and keeping the film at a fast pace, for the most part. Duties very well!. Jackie Chan amazing as always, and it is strange here, it's very pleasant, cheerful as usual doing some crazy stunts, it was a fantastic chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, pushed that ass, and played this beautiful provocative, it was amazing ! I just wanted them to stop dubbing it!. (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan funny as the best friend of Jackie, I'm very fond of him, he is also a very good martial artist. The rest of the cast do OK I think. On the whole hours!. *** 5
