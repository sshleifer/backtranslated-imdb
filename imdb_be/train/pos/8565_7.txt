If you love animals movies, this film will please. My wife loves animals and movies on animals, it is especially like the parrot in the film. It is aimed at children, but I was laughing most of the humor. French fashion character made me laugh, and adds balance to the script. This Disney movie, with its lush, fortunately, APEAL family, but I like coming out of the theater with a positive fealing.
