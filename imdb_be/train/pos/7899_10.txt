It was a great movie. I do not understand why so many people do not like. There was so much in it to connect with so many beautiful pictures, and so much sympathy in the things that have not been told. I thoroughly entertained, and was left with a feeling of joyful euphoria, as well as I do, when I'm done most any Tom Robbins story. Now I have not read this particular book Robbin, so I do not now how it fits, but I can not imagine that this film could be a very bad translation. The film left a lot to you to determine yourself what is the best part of any Tom Robbins novel, inventing details. <br /> <br /> For all of you who said that it was the worst movie ever, I'm sorry, that should be enough left of the dimming light in your hearts. Far from the worst the movie was great. Long live the crane.
