This movie was wonderful, a little scary, but great in it. For those of you who have heard of the catchment area and to know the history, it gives you an idea of ​​what and why these children did what they did. In the back of your mind you know that people think that these things, but you never realize how bad it is, and this film makes you understand. It is seriously that good. It also makes you think twice before you make fun of someone for sure. I read a book about the Columbine massacre, and it made me think that this film makes me anxious and scared me to death. On the other hand, it's kind of like killing someone guide for serial killers. I recently received threats, and I blew it without thinking anything about it, but I think after this film, you have to take everything seriously. Some people go crazy, and you never really know what they are, so take it seriously and not under someone scores.
