Street Fight brilliant piece of satire tough. This is not a movie you just watch the fun. It's not comfortable, but it does have some laugh out loud moments. This is a movie that you are watching when you need food for thought. <br /> <br /> In order to reject this film as a racist, to miss the point entirely. This is not only a satire of the song of the South, it is also biting commentary on prejudice that Americans still have in society. Each ethnic group portrayed in the movie gets shown as a grotesque caricature of their stereotypes, which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people. Due to this wild exaggeration, the director shows how absurd these tightly beliefs really are. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of person who is willing to recognize the ugliness of prejudice common American culture is still kept, and if you are not afraid to see their own biases into the eyes, this film may be for you.
