Nya at the same level as that of the ring (or ring 2), but still a good Japanese horror film nonetheless. I want North American manufacturers of horror would take a page from the template of the Japanese horror and put more «spookiness» and less cheap shocks in his films. Many good examples in this one scene where a person is a whitewashed scene looked after young actresses, pictures on the wall suddenly flashed smiling, just for a second, and much more. Worth checking out if you like this genre.
