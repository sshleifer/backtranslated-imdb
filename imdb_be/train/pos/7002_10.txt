Will Smith once again delivers in the film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders, and his crusade to remedy their grievances in a way that will touch even the most hardened hearts !!! Writer Grant Niport and Italian director Muccino got together and created a masterpiece, which I highly recommend to buy and keep in your collection of movies, you never get tired of looking / feeling of this movie !!! I have a Higher Respect for Will Smith, because he is not only a brilliant actor, but we can say that he has a genuine love for people and life, which, of course, made it ideal for the character (IRS agent Ben Thomas), he played in this film. You feel his pain and anger, frustration over his love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who, by the way, was fantastic as usual. I found myself falling in love with the fact their characters are falling in love. Woody Harrelson also stars in the film Top Notch. I think it's very difficult to write the examination, without giving away key plot points ... All I can say is look, and if you make sure that you do not have anything to interrupt you, take the phone off the hook, sit back and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past IRS agent Ben Thomas ... I thank you, Will Smith is still a great movie !!!
