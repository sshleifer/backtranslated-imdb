A few years ago, the satellite channel UK Gold contributed to repeated "Men misbehaving" with deceit, "Here it is, the original flat sitcom exchange!". It was in fact not true. "The man of the house" was also flat sharing and sitcom ran from 1973-76. <br /> <br /> It was the creation of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creators of the popular sitcom "Father Dear Father". When it was over, they decided that they wanted to do something more in tune with the times. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, Chris (Paula Wilcox) and Joe (Sally Tomsett) are cast in order of Myddleton terrace apartment after a wild party when they find a man in his bath. He Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), cooking Southampton student with no fixed abode. While his clothes were dry, he puts on a lady's gown and prepare them food. They were so impressed with his culinary skills, they invited him to stay. But there should be no naughty business. So Robin has to pretend to be gay ... <br /> <br /> On B.B.C.-2 «I Love 1973", shown in 2000, Julie Burchill argued that "the house" showed her lifestyle, she envied. She was not alone. One of the most significant (to me, anyway) of the image "70 British television was Sally Tomsett out of the London Underground, carrying an umbrella from the sun," blind "people do a double take as it is daring the bottom swing last. <br /> <br /> A man lives with two girls was a risky subject for a time, but Mrs.Mary Whitehouse was no need to get hot under the collar, he was innocent, good-natured fun. Mortimer and Cooke script went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan has played «Bingham» in I.T.V. in "doctor" when it started. In fact, the second run «In Charge» overlaps with the first of the "House". He was born to play sex-crazed Robin. Paula Wilcox "Chris" was more than a "Streetwise Beryl", her character, she played «The Lovers», while Sally Tomsett in "Joe" was pretty dizzy blonde. As time went on, he became almost like an older brother to him. <br /> <br /> For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Joyce Yauta eclipsed as the opposite Ropers. George has lost interest in sex, but Mildred was not. They went on their own show - aptly named "George and Mildred. The late Doug Fisher was a good value, both as a wideboy Robin Larry. He has worked so well he was made to normal. <br /> <br /> During the year of his debut, it was inevitable spin-off film. I'm not a big fan of "People of the House" movie, because I think that it was a stretch to fit the big screen. Most of her characters never appeared in the series. <br /> <br /> The format has been sold to America, where he became a long-running "Three in the company," starring the late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was much more than suggestive of the British original, with Somers often seen in sexy clothes. <br /> <br /> After six seasons, "House" ended Chris married his older brother Robin Norman (Norman Ashley). Supporters were devastated to see Robin is unable to get the girl he loved, but there was some consolation in the fact that he also put his own show - "Robin's Nest".
