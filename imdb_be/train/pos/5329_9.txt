This movie was great. <br /> <br /> The plot was inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The action sequences unnatural. <br /> <br /> But if you can light enough to laugh, it was exciting to travel carefully combining Keystone Cops and the Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> in the villains were more stupid than bad. The good guys were not too good. Black actors have played a normal character and not black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of the child added a nice touch. Sympathy may have been a bit difficult otherwise. <br /> <br /> I do not agree on the action. It was, on the whole, very good. I really wanted to hit Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> And in the end, is not that a sign of a really good movie, wanting to hit the referee Reinhold?
