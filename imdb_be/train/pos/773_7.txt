I was expecting something else: more passion, drama ... Again another failed attempt originality.i'm sorry to say that the film falls into the old cliche Â«cheesiness'.15 year old teens can assess its though.The action was not very convincing and line general, lacks any wit.Still, the soundtrack was good and well adapted.I can not say that this film is a complete failure, because people do watch it, but it did not live up to public expectations and retreated to mediocrity.So, conclude production keeps you in front of a TV for almost one and a half hours, which is a notable th thing.Thus, I think it's worth a look if you do not get irritated
