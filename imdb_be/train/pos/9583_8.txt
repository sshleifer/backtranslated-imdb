I waited for some time to post a review of this documentary, because when I first saw it 10 years ago, I would have thought that I would write. <br /> <br /> I found a documentary point of view, it's a damn good documentary. He did what he set out to do, to show me that I had no idea about and held my interest to investigate in this world. I do not know anything about Drago world and learn more about them and the "ball" was just exciting for me. These people were just so talented that they do and how they do it for the competition. In CATTY people, prosecutors (even I was angry when someone told the judge that coat Drag Queen was dressed entirely coat male!), Jealous, it's all there, as in all other competitions. Like any other competitions like. I felt there was a moment, <br /> <br /> You have the old transvestite talk about how the balls "used" to be compared to the new transvestite who changed the eggs and made more categories of competition -. And even those who watched, knowing that the future of the balls will change even more when they were ready to go on the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the participants living in the street for two minutes for the ball, but it came to compete, it was that important to them! Then there was the sad stories, stories about who is the "home" and "house mother" brought out the best and the brightest in the competition. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now, to add to see this movie after 10 years, I lived through the so-called insanity "Madonna." I noticed a few familiar faces from this documentary, which will end up with Madonna during her «Vogue» phase and rightly so. If not for those people, Madonna would not have had a phase of «Vogue», I know that now. We must pay tribute deserved. It makes me wonder if anyone would watch this movie from the American mainstream, they learn that they are not as "mainstream" as they think.
