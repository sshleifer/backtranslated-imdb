I enjoyed Pune in "Nemesis" for his actions cheese and half a complex script. Many people complain about the "confusing" storyline in the first film, which is probably why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" is dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through <br /> <br /. > This one gives the name of the hero of the first film, Alex, a swollen super-woman is sent to the past to save the future. It rises to a tribe in Africa. Much of the film is only dialogue in the African language without subtitles, which I like, because it made it seem more authentic (how often do movies in this genre are really trying to do this?). It did not take long for the evil cyborg on a journey back in time to find her and try to kill her. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, it's a piece of shit (is not that the first was nothing more). There podagovory involving political unrest in Africa, treasure hunts and tribal fighting. The picture is very little brains, so none of these things does not get very good treatment. Painting mostly drawn battle with some chases, what amounts to the muscle-baby against Cyborg. It has its entertainment value, just do not expect quality, or anything from the first film.
