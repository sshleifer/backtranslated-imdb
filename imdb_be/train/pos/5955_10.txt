As a manufacturer of "Darkness" I admit we have neglected the 3 very important confirmation of our credits. These shortcomings were more attraction that can not be adjusted once committed, and not parties involved --- --- who have seen the film refers to it at the time. On behalf of a great crew of the film, I'm expanding their forgiveness. It is obvious that some of the criticisms are located here in the harsh light of their credit accidental. Our production values ​​were not significant, and our "special effects" were very special, of course, but the plot is very strong and the cinematography of John McLeod is excellent. We hope that you, the reader, to enjoy the "Darkness" and the efforts of those who worked them free examples. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
