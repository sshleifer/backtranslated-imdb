I have not laughed so much for a long time - even though the film has some sad moments too, especially if it varies from hyper-fun to the honest and serious. These characters are very realistic most of the time, mellow time, but it is plausible. I'm not a Jerry Springer show - I feel sorry for the people involved. This film instead of a satire, and it makes a great. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that all curses were * squeak * while the film aired on public television that takes a lot of pleasure from it. I'm going to rent this film to fully enjoy it. <br /> <br />
