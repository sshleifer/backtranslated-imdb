The most succinct way to describe Ride With The Devil is, with but one word: reality. I will not retell what has been said about this wonderous film, but I would like to say how much historical research and painstaking attention to the details of the team, no doubt, passed appreciated this filmgoer. <br /> <br /> As a student of history, and familiar with the period setting of this film, I have to say that this production is one of the most accurate of fictional films about the "blood of Kansas." Yes liberty were adopted on a true story, as all fiction tend to do. But the overall feel of the film is real. These suits, a real relationship (PC does not look in the past here), even the actors look authentic.Even Jewel Kilcher (who has a small role in the film) looked like it came out forms in the middle of the photograph of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> a few spectators, I spoke with expressed a lack of confidence in the stylized dialogue. They can not believe that the farmers of the 19th century will be to "speak as poets." <br /> <br /> What they do not realize that in this age of verbal zhlobstva American public society of the 19th century was surprisingly literate and eloquent bouquet. These people were brought up on Shakespeare and the King James version of the Bible. Writers reconstructed most likely verbal style of these people, according to the documents of the time. Stylized dialogue simply adds to the magical atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> But in addition to historical documents, this film works on an intuitive level. Beautifully photographed and executed, it brings us back to the days of the big western epics. The raid on Lawrence, Kansas, has done so many times before in many other, smaller films are displayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer in the center of the action. <br /> <br /> Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict.This film has all the finicky moviegoer could want. <br /> <br /> In a year dominated by overhyped garbage as American Beauty, this is a great work of art was buried indifferent studio system. But I am sure that the ride with the devil will be given to it due in the coming years. Please make this film. You will not be disappointed.
