I saw it many years after the TV series and, initially, I did not take care of it. Then, as my memory of a series of waste over time, I looked again, and found it absolutely hilarious. Based on the stage play by Neil Simon, it was not "revealed" a lot for the big screen, and it's one of his strengths. Matthau and Jack Lemmon brilliant, Oscar and Felix, and the supporting cast are excellent, especially John Fielder's as "Vinnie." Even now, some things can reduce me to tears of laughter - Felix interrupted Oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request, Oscar cracking and chasing Felix around the apartment, giggling Â«Pigeon Sisters" understated stories cry Felix and, of course, the legendary cafeteria scene (later torn Nora Ephron: "When Harry met Sally"). Razor-sharp dialogue, too. When the boys think that Felix took an overdose, Oscar says, "They may be vitamins It can be healthy one in the room!". Fantastic!
