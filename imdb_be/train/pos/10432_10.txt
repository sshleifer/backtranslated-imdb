I must admit that in the beginning, I was kind of cautious about watching this movie. I thought it was this silly, little, romantic film about a French woman who meets an American on the train and decide to visit Vienna with him. I was not really fascinated by this kind of scenario, because it is still, to make me believe that this is just a movie. However, I watched it! And I was amazed ... "Before Sunrise" is one of the few films that dare to speak in a rather philosophical, wondering about that at the moment of our birth, we were sentenced to death, or the idea that this middling that the fact that the couple should rest together forever, or that we, humans, can sometimes afford to live in fairy tales. <br /> was surprisingly chosen <br /> ending (we do not know when they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock in the Vienna station) -in our optimism, we sincerely hope. The actors were in a very good way, so that I began to believe that I myself could live a love story as well as it is.
