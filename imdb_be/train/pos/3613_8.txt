If «Girlfight» came out, reviews praised, but I did not get around to see it. I finally saw it when it was released on video, and understand the glowing reviews. <br /> <br /> The film begins in high school in the middle of the ghetto. We quickly familiarize students Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). It is an expression of the teaser on her face, and no idea about Diana that we might learn from this expression soon gets confirmed when she gets into a fight. Diana gets into trouble because of this, we did meet with her father, an aggressive type in its own right; Clearly, we can not completely blame Diana for her relationship <br /> <br /> But the movie really picks up as a new idea germinates in the mind of Diana :. boxing as a way to avoid this grim existence. Her older brother was already in the box, but her father, probably not approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. <br /> <br /> Only the first few minutes alone have determined that I was in for a very rough, nya-a Hollywood movie, but also a brief appearance by John Sayles in a supporting role truly confirmed. Even before they get any in boxing scene, you feel like you are getting crushed in the face, seeing the ugly life that Diana lives. And when they finally arrived at the main plot of the film, there is no turning back. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would definitely recommend this film. I recognize that the use of boxing as a way to show someone is trying to do something he / she was a kind of a cliche in movies for years ( "Rocky», «Million Dollar Baby"), but I still think that they have done a great job with it here. In fact, it could have brought the genre to its top. Really good. Sorry that Michelle Rodriguez wasted himself in Hollywood films after that.
