Radio is not 24 hours a day, 7 days a week going on when I was growing up in the 1930s in England, as The Children's Hour was fun for me when we had to battery and battery to save on power. Therefore, some programs that I heard made a deep impression on my young mind, and 3, which I remember are still «Toytown», one of the all the animals in the zoo, and --- Gray Sawa, talk about animals, he knew that he called his "brothers." Only recently I learned that the great gray owl was not really "Indian", but a tribute to the Chief of the Sioux has a lot of sense to me, "Man becomes what he wants." Would that we could all dream like changing and rewarding as Archie Gray Owl Belaney world. Will the new Great Gray Owl can influence world leaders to clean up the environment.
