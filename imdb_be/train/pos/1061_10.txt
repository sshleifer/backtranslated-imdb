all actions done were truly amazing in the first season. first glance you get Max and Zack through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazarus, or as I like to call them Minis. Minis that do a better acting job I've ever seen kids do. the main actors and actresses, ie Jessica Alba Weatherley, etc., to make you forget you're watching a fictional tanker show they seem to make this show come to life. overall it's the best show I've ever watched
