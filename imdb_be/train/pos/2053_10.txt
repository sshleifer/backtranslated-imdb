First of all I would like to say that this film rawked more than any of the recent crap that Hollywood concocted from its bowels. McBain real thriller with more violence than the majority of the audience can handle. It has all the classic elements of late '80s / early' 90s action movie .... occasional gratuitous acts of violence (ie., When Walken and crew are going to confront the drug dealers to get the money, they just show up and kill them and not allowing them to live and simply take their money), then snap the neck of guys on fire, guys that get blown off buildings, and of course, the guys are on fire, getting blown off the building. Walken is at its best in this picture delivering memorable lines such as, "Let's sit .......... on the deck." And others that make this film a top pay off the clearance rack at the local video store. If you have bloodlust unnecessary random acts of violence in this movie rentals today and satisfy your thirst.
