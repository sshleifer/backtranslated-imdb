My observations: dominatrix outfit in the end, it is a great and excellent, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette wore it well, and even received a naive Nelson. The boat crashed into his balcony served him faithfully. Costume dress her female mafia have been developed remarkably well, especially by today's standards. 1942 costumes did a great job. . Main theme song just lovely <br /> <br /> The attention to negative poster: one thousand nine hundred forty-two was during the Second World War; Pearl Harbor took place a year ago. US only come out of the Great Depression; you need to go out and spend your hard-earned money on singing distraction, dance and let fi fantasy. Despotic dictators have tried to rule there in RL, a deposit from the will. Thank God, the audience had these fantastic films storyline to participate. The film was going to treat the privileged, in the days of the afflicted. If you are negative signs, to become actors or movie stars, then there is a place to talk and criticize. Janet's and Nelson's films have stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Angel wings are excellent, a real angel. RL wings on a costume party is not so hot, but great for seeing Janet SL. <br /> <br /> Beautiful singing and Janet Nelson, as always. Janet dance was pure delight. <br /> <br /> 15-10
