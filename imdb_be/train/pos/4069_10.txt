Listening to the soundtrack at the moment, drawings back with alacrity, that makes my longing dry eye is very strong (in order to be able to print it). I've seen it twice so far, and I will be ashamed of what he had seen * only twice. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the films of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and they are not always less than masterpieces (except, perhaps, for Nausicaa, who was even entirely cut version prematurely compared to NVK- plus-ultra mango). However, sometimes their strength becomes their weakness, because they tend to be too naive / positive (Chihiro), or with a lot of nuances, too obvious / moralist (Mononoke). At least compared to, for example, another master Ghibli Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies / Just yesterday / raccoon Wars). But this is not one. <br /> <br /> In Laputa Miyazaki pours all brilliant narrative that tellers of fairy tales collected and perfected over centuries, combined with a small amount of fighting spirit, but beautifully intertwined with not only completely transcendental atmosphere, but also with humor and entertainment For example, TOTORO. Each main character is perfectly painted with their doubts and fears and their qualities, which help them to overcome difficulties. Go so perfectly that I do not know anything other than a black hole, which would have been able to provide such gravity to the whole being. History is taught as a action flick with the secrets hinted at, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with a stone, and the main theme is dying, you get an idea of ​​the great mystery, you are going to uncover, but the story and then settles gradually, a few carefully selected scenes action and serene beauty, creates an unforgettable culmination melancholy, hope, beauty - as after a few days of gloomy despondency, finally seeing a clear horizon in the morning, knowing the way was seeing the distance n aperade but smile at the fact possible to catch him. <br /> <br /> it as white light exploded in his skull that if during the credits start rolling, you have kept your eyes dry and your mind is numb, you should see a doctor. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that, technically, image wise, some later Miyazakis may be more preferable, that to me is his undisputed masterpiece. If you take a split second to realize that it was made in 1986, you can only come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius, like a star, which is only once in 200 years. This, of course, been asked before, but I was his only film, which may in itself, fully illustrate the simple fact. If you miss it during your lifetime, you die by a wide margin - that would be a pity, as the coffin costs the same.
