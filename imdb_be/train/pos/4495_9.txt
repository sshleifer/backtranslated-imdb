Outside the family of another world and the fight against family walks the line between the pope and the authority of their hopes and dreams <br /> <br /> Period captured. Bakelite light swithes, Georgian, bottom picture rails, wall paper, short skirts, arrogant guys, mini van, a brilliant modern Mangles .... <br /> <br /> Location captured; The wind whipped the glacier-hewn rocky terrain, local stone walls, community, freedom <br /> <br /> But there's much, much more. Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, power, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense of the word), love, fight, puberty, innocence, morality, trust, faith, deception, courage, manners, maturity, loss , poverty, victim, horror, ACCEPTENCE, revelation, comedy and fatherhood is all there. (And not in order!). <br /> <br /> This film is a richly woven expression family tensions that are Relevent today as ever. The fact that some of them are not solved immediately is a testament in itself to the relationship of the day, but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the acting, story and direction. <br /> <br /> If there is something bad about this film is that all this is deeply rooted and well taken too lightly voltage safely to the end. Maybe I missunderstand - doom and gloom, according to many teenagers actually disappear when they have to deal with it (**) - maybe even a movie tries to send this message, too. - to do <br /> <br /> What this film is trying to say? Children: Parents, too, were young, parents are struggling, too, everyone makes mistakes, everyone will know, things change, the fight can end well. Parents: Do not try too hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well-being. <br /> <br /> It sounds simplistic, is not it? Sometimes the film feels too, but that's what you'll notice how much is being challenged and uncovered <br /> <br /> The film is a classic <br /> <br /> (**) - .. AEs that themsleves problems.
