Thanks to an exciting performance, Will Smith and story tugs at your heartstrings harder than rock guitarist mid-solo, "Seven Pounds" race in the past, the previous co director actor (pursuit of happiness), easy movement, which I loved, Remember Muccino name because some of his films may miss unnoticed, when the actor is attached to the project is not quite so loud. <br /> <br /> I wish I knew the Smith chart at an early stage, I put two and two together when he calls in his suicide in the first scene, and the scene where the character Rosario Dawson presented as having an incurable heart -disease. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I still believe that the writer / director has made the right choice by putting bookend (flyleaf is the first and the last scene) in the sense of urgency and a source of tension in the film, showing gradually, how a person can be brought to this ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between Smith and Dawson nature to thrive and grow, knowing in the back of your mind always what was in store for these two unlucky. <br /> <br /> One of my friends, with whom I saw the movie thought Smith's character can have a magical gift, and I can see why: his performance is almost English, if in the presence of the seven elected from them, but in other cases it can be sudden and terrible, and when he is alone so he full weight of his situation became too much for him, and he breaks down completely. It's a pretty versatile performance. <br /> <br /> And finally, I can not forget to mention the accident re-enactment of the scene, which was really pretty amazing do in terms of cinematography paired with the music. Put it on your list.
