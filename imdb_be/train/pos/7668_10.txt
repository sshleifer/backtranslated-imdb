I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs absolutely wonderful in it. He plays the role of the modern masters to handle. (And it's absolutely adorable.) 2) The movie helped inspire the role-playing game, I thoroughly enjoy, Mage: The Awakening. I showed it to a different PVZPE after parties, and it is always a great success. <br /> <br /> D & D Love and Jeff-squeeing side, this is not a masterpiece, but it is well done and thoroughly enjoyable. The plot is rapid and participate in its simplicity, the special effects are quite good for such a low budget, and the script, while nothing stellar, was not so poorly made, and cheese in all the right places. A good way to spend an evening.
