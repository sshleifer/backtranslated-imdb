I watch most of the films that Nick Mancuso are in because, frankly, I love this guy, even though he is getting older, it is usually cast as the villain (a long time the fans should be noted that for some because the blonde in the film). It is quite familiar with the movie plot point of view (but then most films these days are really not the original), but Rick Roberts is attractive as an imperfect husband Makayzek as attractive as the daughter and Miaya Kapture does a good job when it was its purpose to be angry and sometimes quite difficult to love. Nick still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate, like a charm, and psychosis. However, too much of the story takes place behind the scenes - as motivation, previous behavior, good times and bad times - and things that seem obvious to the characters never make it to the audience (ie me). The final scene leaves everything to be desired in the "but what about ..." category, and in general, I can not say I cared much about any of the characters. That being said, it was what it was - just a fun way to spend the day - and I still do, Nick.
