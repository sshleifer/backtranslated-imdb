This film is one of my favorite foreign films, some others are Amilee and my life as a dog. The similarity of these films, like so many big foreign films, in that it takes a bit of secular life, and turns it into a deep heart a lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a person who is bored with his life on earth and track their family life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman looking out the window a dance studio. At the time that it takes your train to pass, he is in awe of her. But this is only her beauty, her gaze distant, or compounds that they both discover that they share? <br /> <br /> Dance has a great memorable characters who have to deal with the painful realities, surpassing them in the world of dance. Breaking the traditional forms and types of stereo Japanese society, they risk all to be happy and find joy not too far away. This is one of those films that is so magical and meaning in and of itself, goes beyond the ordinary, showing real magic and wonder what life can be.
