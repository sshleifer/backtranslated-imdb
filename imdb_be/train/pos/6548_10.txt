This is one great movie! I played all the Nancy Drew games and read books, and I did not expect that the film will be so exciting and fun! If you've never heard of Nancy Drew, I read the first book (The Secret of the old clock), so you kind of can "get used to Nancy, you can watch a movie, because in the film, they do not actually enter the characters names quickly. ;) May the whole family enjoyed it, and the story was very interesting. This is the ultimate come-back of previous films Nancy Drew Nancy Drew that the actor does not seem the same. This film is very similar to Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. This is so cool! Fans of Nancy Drew, you should look at it!
