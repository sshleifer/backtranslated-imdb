I do not really like both movie Shrek. (Since these as "the PG" is the word, which I never would have said myself, so that I did not like them.) <br /> <br /> But when it comes to the "Spirit of the prairie," I just watched for the first time last month, I became a fan of animated films, except for Pixar. *** Spoilers *** forth in "The Spirit of the prairie" horse foal born and eventually becomes its leader heard. One night, he saw a strange light in the distance, and he goes to him. This action ultimately leads to his capture, and a few other things. Throughout the film we hear a story. It is through the idea of ​​the Spirit, even though the horse has never spoken. This is what makes the film so goo. They (film producers) recored real horses to do the horse make a sound; none of these sounds has not been done by people. <br /> <br /> The spirit meets rain, a beautiful mare, and Little Creek, a native American, who possesses Rain. Little Creek later frees the spirit and rain, they go home after work. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Bryan Adams, but I intend to buy the soundtrack to this film in the near future. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you will not regret it. My rating: 10/10
