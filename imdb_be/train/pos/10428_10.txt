Amazing film that, in theory, should be boring, but it comes with an incredible subtlety and acting that I have long lost hope to ever find. Instead of relying on cliches and overly dramatized moments of the story unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The leading characters are not perfect, and therefore treat them as people, you know, you can easily. The film does not try to pull the laughs, or press the ideal audience, but simply by showing us the possibility of true love in all circumstances. <br /> <br /> I'm restless waiting for the weekend, so I can see the continuation. Moving, thoughtful, funny look at love, I think there should be an absolute classic romantic there with Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's. Soften even the toughest heart.
