the first film in Witherspooon Reese. I liked very much. The story and the action was at the highest level. Are you emotionally involved with the characters. In my opinion, a must see. <br /> <br /> After watching this film, you will see why the acting career of Reese Witherspoon was so successful. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors do a great job too. <br /> <br /> The film is going very well. There is not a dull moment in the whole picture. Man in the Moon long time. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, I think that this film was excellent. I've seen it many times, and use each of the display.
