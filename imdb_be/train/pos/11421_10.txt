I do not know what the previous reviewer was looking, but I guess that is what reviews, personal taste. Missing in this film was the depth, very deep film, many layers of emotion that affects. Undercurrents withheld love due representation in society beliefs, taboos times and classes, race relations not being in very good condition of equality, guilt, sadness, hatred, confusion, very dark emotionally I thought, under the skin, you have to imagine Aire this , fluttering of the film rather than slow, as mentioned above, to release themselves in the film flow, emotions show themselves, the characters reveal their weaknesses, their unpleasant insides, well, in fact very hard!
