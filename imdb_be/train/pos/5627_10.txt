This step actually made me jump out of my seat in anticipation of what the actors are going to do! The action was the best, Tara should get an Oscar for it, she was incredible. James Rousseau was so good, I hated him, he was a villain and played well. There are not many films that rivet me like this. The cast was great Alfie looking shocked with these big eyes Tara, looking like a victim, and you are now living her horror when she passed through it. Containers made you feel like you were there and feel the same rage she felt that you wanted it to hurt him, but you also know that it was the wrong thing to do. The film had you on a roller coaster, and you go up and down with each scene.
