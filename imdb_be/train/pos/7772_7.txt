There are at least two big films with characters with a drinking problem: «The Lost Weekend» (1945) with stunning performance, Ray Milland and "Days of Wine and Roses" (1962) with Jack Lemmon stunning performance. Robert Stack has reasonable performance and motivation of the character drinking crayons and clichés. In the end, forgotten "is written with the Wind" is entertaining and not only stood out in particular for an Oscar .. My vote is seven <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ( "The Word in the Wind")
