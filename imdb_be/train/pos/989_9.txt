And my friend, and I thought that this movie was well done. We expected a light hearted comedy, but got a full-blown thriller with comic shocks. We both thought that this film may not be so well at the box office as previews lead us to believe that it's a comedy. I was impressed with fellow actors and, of course, Dave Morse always puts in a stunning actor's work. Most of the supporting cast veterans are not first timers, and they were hard. We both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and comment on each one purchase this film. If you do not buy rent it for a good time.
