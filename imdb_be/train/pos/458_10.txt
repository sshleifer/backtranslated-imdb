My wife, Kate, and I absolutely loved the series and can not wait for the next (hopefully have a sequel!). I would like to know that catchy song called and who wrote it, maybe because I was "old and gray," and still interested in life :-). If anyone has the full text, please send them to. <br /> <br /> Of course one big reason why my wife and I love this series so much was the fact that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually. It's great to see a show that emphasizes the contribution to society that still can be done by older people with special skills and experience. Aspect of a person's interest, which shows the interaction of the characters and the young people around them is an important part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is very interesting and very complex, on a par with some of our other favorites, "Ghosts" and "Hustle".
