10/10 for this film. <br /> <br /> I am a British physician in India, currently in India. word Beckham pushed me, "because I am a die hard fan of Liverpool, and personally think that Owen really cool. Since Liverpool and Manchester United are rivals, I was sure that DEAD I would not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet with friends, and I had an early morning flight, so I thought: "What the hell, let's wait time watching this movie", "because it was late night show. <br /> <br /> What a moron I was. I had to see this movie on the day it was released. I think using the name Beckham was to attract to attract the audience (which is inversely Firing in my case !!!) but I really can not think of a better title for the film. <br /> <br /> Nagra and Keira Knightley (drop dead gorgeous) and Rhys-Meyers has done an excellent job. <br /> <br /> If you hate tse football, not like Manchester United (England or for that matter), then this is definitely the film for you. In fact, I'm only 29 yrs old, a psychiatrist by profession, but a kid at heart. This film hit "Star Wars" from my position NO.1. <br /> <br /> it's amazing, but not a lot of comments on this film by Indian-British, as I am. I wonder why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie .
