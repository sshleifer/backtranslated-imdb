Joan loved. High performance. That it is not good. I watched this movie, then Jane Eyre immediately after ... it's getting better. My heart was pounding. Big old drama film. Just what I want from the classic film. Mimicry is worth the entire film. I am glad that I have it on video. I do not know what else you need in the film. Beautiful woman .... wealth ..... ..... greed murder trial .... detectives ...... ..... <br /> <br /> costumes are very nice, it makes I wonder what the budget was for this film? Wish they still made films like this. Every time they try, they just seem to make cheesy movies. Movies in black and white still hold some secrets.
