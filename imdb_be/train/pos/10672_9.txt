Anyone who has seen this film and considered it bad, I would refer them to the review by Roger Ebert of the film. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry, and he gave it 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It may not be perfect, or spectacular, but I liked it. The corps de ballet is not so much history as a group of stories about the life of Broadway hopefuls. I've read reviews where people believe that too much time was spent on the romance between Cassie and Zach. This is a misconception. This is another story, along with all the other stories that are told about each of the candidates on Broadway. What people do not realize that those who are dancers on Broadway shows are going through the same things that the average person goes through. And I think that's actually the point of the show. This is to demonstrate not only the talent of these special dancers, but to give us some sharp things to think about in relation to life in general. This study life as a Broadway star. Anyone who wanted to become a Broadway star hour of this film with a great sense of relationships, because they have gone through what the characters are going through. <br /> <br /> This is a great musical. It has its slow points, but sometimes it becomes a little confused with the stimulation of certain storylines, but on the whole, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Take a closer look in the movie, and then, perhaps, you will understand what I mean.
