<br /> <br /> Â«After dark, my sweet," an amazing combination of sensuality and gray. The film is slow, very slow, but it takes the rhythm, to tell a story of murder and passion. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (man gives a true performance), and Rachel Ward, but it's sexy. <br /> <br /> The sexual tension, pshycological heat moves ... last retrospective scene, the strangeness of Patric's character, everything becomes sexually mystery. I recommend this reason is more sexually dull film that I have ever seen. Check love making scene winked sexually partial.
