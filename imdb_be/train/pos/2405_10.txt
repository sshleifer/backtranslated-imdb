Wow, I can not believe I am the first and the only one to add a comment to this great film. <br /> <br /> While the film itself seemed interesting enough to the real thing that attracted me to this Matthew Lillard, provided the majority of people would probably either think he's too happy or caffeine just sucks, but we're both the same age, and from the same generation, and I watched this guy so many times that now he is one of my favorites. This is one of the few films where he is a big shot, and the main star of the sort in SLC Punk, another great film Lillard. <br /> <br /> Baiscally is storywise your usual Heist movie, but with more twists than nothing starting to make madness. It is also very typical in this film is another great actor named DOnofrio very under appreciated people in the film industry. The woman in the film is a newcomer, and it is not so bad, even though you know that they had hired her primarily for her accent and nude scenes =) <br /> <br /> This is a game against the jack Jill vs. Bob like everyone wants to reap the benefits, but share it with anyone. All of them are trying to get each other to kill another, and it is a time bomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true skill as an intriguer Jack, who was initially triggers the whole scheme. Vincent and women play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to lack of business. character Vince a little crazy and Skitz throughout the film, but it only added to the intensity of the film. <br /> <br /> The surprises left and right well welcomed and the end of a very sun clich√© and makes you feel happy, well, maybe, depends on the type of ending you like. This film made me very interested in addition, Matt was in it, it's a great movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Critic, probably will not like this film, but they do not watch movies because they like movies, anyway.
