Vivah is not in any way a classic. However, in the days of hardcore action, special effects & break through difficult sections (none of which Bollywood mastered yet), it is quite nice to see a simple film like Vivah. History, as we all know, is the way of the first meeting of a married couple in their wedding eventually, after some moments of Coy and testing time. Nothing more, nothing less. The music is not quite in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but do not shake your feelings too. Two songs stood out for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. While Milan abhi aadha & Hamaari Shaadi were hummable. Shahid perform honestly and shows great potential. Its nice to see him play something else, but the "cool dude", he usually does. Amrita is very sweet, and plays the role of an obedient small town girl to perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher and Seema Biswas terrible support and rest of the cast does a reasonable job. Direction Suraj is a simple, but effective. the main drawback of the film is slow-paced, which can try the patience of many young viewers. But overall a good, clean, decent family film.
