It's nice to see a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is so absolutely convincing as a simple but good, the daughter of Robert Farnsworth <br /> <br /> which, finally, in his latest role, gets to show that he is an outstanding actor. Hard to believe that this is a film by David Lynch. It's slow and even, sweet and moving. One of the best, if you do not like the chase, sex scenes and violence.
