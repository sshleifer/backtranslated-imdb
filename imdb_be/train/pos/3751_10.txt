I know that you are already logged in these festivals (or, at least, I think that you have, I can only do so), but I think it is to get "the best animated short film" in each. Bravo. I can not wait for the full film. I understand that you can not hear it quite often because of the quirky nature of the animation, but to hear it now and take it as the truth. Kudos, my friend. Okay, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... Although I still mean it. And here comes another -SHOE - and I can not stop here again. This is very annoying, and at the same time I do not have anything better. In fact, I would probably watch all your movies in a further stepwise "Jason Steele Marathon." I have a lot of them. <br /> <br /> -R
