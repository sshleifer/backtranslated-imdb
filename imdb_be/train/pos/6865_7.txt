With the current trend of gross-out humor, this film is the grandfather of all. While some of the humor is dated, each skit or shock, repel, or make you laugh out loud. Most memorable is a sex game and comment, of course, the VD commercial. It does not always work, but it pays off when he does. I give it 7.
