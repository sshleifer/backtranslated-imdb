The most satisfying element of "Dan in Real Life," is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) is meaningful and beautiful realistic. Casting Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as the love interest Dan was the perfect solution; she is exceptionally talented, clever, of course, attractive, and, thank God, duly kept apart! If this film was made with Jessica Alba and Scarlett Johansson, it would be a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another great aspect about "Dan in Real Life" is that it is a perfect movie for adults who are interested in mature comedy that comes out of the three pillars of the "brotherhood" package formula: stupid chickens, chauvinistic guys and raunchy jokes. "Dan in Real Life" is witty and funny, smart laughing everywhere. While other comedy on or almost entirely based on the jokes, which shocked the audience in laughing, jokes on "Dan in Real Life" more natural and reasonable, and include some thinking from the audience. <br /> <br /> My only problem with the "Dan in Real Life," it is that the rebellious middle daughter playing too defiant actress Brittany Robertson. It is difficult to say whether it was a personal choice on its part or selecting the director. In any case, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But this is only a small flaw in the film, and not take away from the story as a whole. <br /> <br /> In general, "Dan in Real Life" is a great movie, a fantastic escape from redundancy offensive and dumbed down comedies. Quality of writing, directing, acting, and (especially) the cinematography is excellent. This is just a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.
