Yes, this chick flick, and it's moving kind of slow, but it is actually very good - and I consider myself a courageous person. You have to love Judy Davis, no matter what it is, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural, convincing performance. <br /> <br /> The scenery of a small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the main theme of the film. Unknown (at least to me unknown) actors and actresses lend realism to the film that attracted you and keeps your attention. Overall, I give it a 8/10. Go it.
