There are some spoilers in the comments !! <br /> <br /> In contrast to the comments that I have just read nativetex4u and a few others, I really liked the movie and would like to see it as a weekly series. <, Br /> <br /> I'm a fan Jadson Mills, but also a big fan of Chuck Norris and while I recognize that some of the scenes can be stretched a bit line, the story fits right in with the other weekly series currently on the air . <br /> <br /> in the opening fifteen minutes with Deke runs from the bad guys undermining its missiles was very action packed. I do not see how many "experts" could not hit the moving target, but the effect is definitely there and Deke, being a hero was supposed to survive. <br /> <br /> As for the comment about the need to "get the movie in the bank to fill in the time interval after the playoffs." The film was not originally planned for January on CBS airing and shooting was completed in May 2001 year, a good 4 months prior to the terrorist attacks against the United States <br /> <br /> If the author of the commentary was to draw attention to the movies instead of trying to avoid it, maybe they would understand the plot of the story: Rashid bin Laden, as the nature of it is planned to set off a nuclear device in the United States. The man president was intended to find and fix the problem. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the writer should really watch the movie before you try to comment on it. <br /> <br />
