James Dickey is surprisingly descriptive writer. If one reads «Deliverance», one is instantly transferred into the lush hinterland of the Deep South. If one o'clock in the film version of John Boorman books, realizes how accurately it reflects the essence of the book. Camera as narrative as a story. Characters fully realized, and the images are fantastic. I first saw this film in 1992, after my first year of college. I was in that phase when I watched movies that have been released in a few years I was born in 1973. Among them were the "Patton", "Papillon", and "All the President's Men"; thin films, all of them. This one was easily the class of the group. That says a lot.
