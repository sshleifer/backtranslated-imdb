Indeed: the use of drugs, storage box poslematchevyeem «Matrix'-esque bullet lighting, futuristic city with a mix of Asian races and the lone vampire --all in the same movie-- seems that the story, which could only be provided by the Japanese pop / rock -zorkay. And that's exactly what «Moon Child» that and much more. While all of these elements in combination may sound like the perfect thing for mannerisms B-Film Week «Moon Child» pulling him, but few expected bumps and hitches along the way. <br /> <br /> The film is rough, of course, independent feel to it, jumping from one scene to another is not a smooth transition, and sporadic yeast, giving glimpses into the lives of the characters and barely scraping the true story. But the film does not make any excuses, rather than turning the story into one of friendship, love, trust and betrayal all sugar-coated in the aforementioned elements futuristic society, fighting gangster, and a vampire. <br /> <br /> HYDE how gloomy vampire "Kei" well, that gives depth of character and balance-is overly zealous perform duties Gackt as "Sho", an orphan who befriends Kei. Or-Hom Wang, too bright as vindictive "Son" who becomes friends with an adult Sho. The story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods in their lives, and how friendship can just as easily turn into sorrow and betrayal. <br /> <br /> While the action is sometimes too unrealistic and special effects are just for show, is one thing, the film never makes afford to be an extremely popular Asian singers she has. Superstars like the actors have their drawbacks, and so do their characters. The film rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after the jump quite a bit. «Moon Child» quite nice, with a sense of humor at times, and very touching: it is definitely worth your time!
