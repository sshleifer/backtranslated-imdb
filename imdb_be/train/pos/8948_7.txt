This kind of film that, if it were done today, it's probably zvedoobraznoy Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; in fact, now that I think about it, this is one to be fully rebuilt one day. It's nice, but no depth at all. She suffers from a near-fatal miscasting James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for this, and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs, in a small supporting role of aspiring writer, is the only actor in the film, which is approaching the performance of what you might call "wit". (** 1/2)
