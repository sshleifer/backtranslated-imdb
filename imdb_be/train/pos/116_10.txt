Man on man ... I foolishly wires (not the correct term, there is a long list!) To see this movie, and finally had the opportunity to do so. And is a "news": Excellent labyrinthine sight <br /> <br /> For a "follower" of any von Trier: Both Rigets, criminal elements, Dogville, Dancer in the Dark, The Five Obstructions, etc. ... Europa is likely differential for his greatness in visual terms. All beautifully dark and claustrophobic! You really get the feeling of being inside this "imaginary" nightmarish time warp. Taking the masters of surrealist cinema as Bu√±uel, Bergman, a noir 40s films with sour drops vanguard von Trier is the stage art of cinema as "a well-designed totalitarian" film producer at the moment. His authoritarian way to deal with very complex issues, without being irrational, to get to the viewer a nerve with the aim to cure some of the deepest wounds we eat in our hypocritical world. <br /> <br /> As utopian as it sounds, I believe that people like von Trier can help society in many ways, in a broader aspect. Nha Day films and filmmakers that carry such power no longer needed as a tool for reflection, perhaps this could be the beginning of a new era: "The Age of emotional control over our fears." This is what he offers us constantly through his work again and again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
