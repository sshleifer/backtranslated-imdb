I bought this movie a few days ago, and thought it would be quite a dirty movie. But when I put it in DVD-player, he surprised me in a good way. James Belushi plays very well, like Bill «The Mouth» Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good shot, sheriff. "End" of the scene, in the house of Bill's very cool, good camera-work, good dialogue and very good acting. Bill "Roth» Manuccie stole 12 million dollars from the mafia. Together with his wife he lives in South Carolina, in the witness protection program. But the mafia track him down, and wants $ 12 million. Bill can only trust the one person he knows inside himself.
