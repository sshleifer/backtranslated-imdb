the design of the film seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the main problems in this country (USA). We see the relationship around at the university for the film. Worthily, student obvious VS the teacher is present. But the fact that the film adds to his value, his other relationships: male veterinarian woman veterinarian white black, and individual veterinarian society. But most importantly, and in direct relation to all the other relations is an individual veterinarian himself. <br /> <br /> I was amazed, as a bilateral point of view of the director gave featuring interracial relationships on campus. Most films tend to show the injustice of the one hand, showing the suffering of another. This film shows the injustice and suffering on both sides. He tried not to show how either was right, although I would say that the heads of the skin showed a significantly more severe and vindictive (obviously, to the end). The film also discusses sex and rape. It is ironic this injustice, that in a sense, brings the two races together over time. Fishburne makes over-the-top performance as astute Profesor Phipps. He shatters the idea favortism race and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down trodden with hard-working and positive. Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapoport gives excellent image confusing youth with inappropriate anger, who is seeking recognition. Tyra Banks to make her film debut proves supermodel can act. <br /> <br /> Higher education got its name in the college show as more than go to class and get a piece of paper. In fact, I would say that the film is almost a satire show student interaction with each other, and not some dry books as a real education in the university. This is the life, the learning process rather than a text one. I think you'll find the "higher education" is whether appropriate important issues in many universities and even life in general. 8/10
