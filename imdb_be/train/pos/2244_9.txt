The only explanation that I can gather, this is why the film is not so prevalent because it hits too close to home for some. This film was a real happy surprise, satire genius. This film turns the world in darkness, that organized religion and big media, as well as cockroaches run for cover. Take a DVD and watch it for yourself if you have not, this film is a success, which suffered many setbacks (Dogma comes to mind), to poke his nose under the tent, how to use humor and very clever analogies in conjunction with telling backgrounds and locations can not comment in depth, without revealing some significant spoilers, there are some surprises in this film that even a seasoned lover of the film will be caught off guard.
