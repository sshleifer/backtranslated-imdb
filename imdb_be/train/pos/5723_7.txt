therefore, being rather a deep fan of horror movies, it's been a while since I've seen that really made me jump (or rotates nervously.) <br /> <br /> determined to get it on DVD, when it comes to ... a hell of a lot better than the ring. thing I do not understand there are so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought it was awful, well, if that's what you think, then so be it ... I know I am loved, and it takes a fair amount, so I really feel terrible, so I have to say that it's one worth watching. <br /> <br /> Now, you may be disappointed in the history when you need everything in the well-groomed line because the story goes back to a little bit forward, to help build the story (I think that if it was given in chronological order, it would ruin it all.) <br /> <br /> I'm actually glad that this film was a very small bloody riots in ... maybe the rest of the studio and whathaveyous writers understand that you should not throw the red material all set to make people afraid.
