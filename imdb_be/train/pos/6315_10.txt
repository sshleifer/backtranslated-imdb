That's why. <br /> <br /> There is not a bad performance in the film. Funny funny part. On the sharp parts are strained. The script contains the dialogue entirely miss the cinematography and fresh and beautiful. And it's not correct Hollywood (you'll see what I mean when you watch a movie) <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I remember seeing a movie advertisement.
