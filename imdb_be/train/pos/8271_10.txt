One of the biggest hits of 1926, that Brown of Harvard is an exciting comedy / drama featuring regattas and soccer scene, which gave William Haines role, he was to become a major star. This patented Haines all the way: cocky lout who does not take anything serious until he rejected all wises and becomes a person / character and wins the girl. No one worked this formula as Haynes. Stunning comedian (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, to show people with Marion Davies), Haines can swing from comedy to tragedy, with the change in facial expression. He's a total joy in this film, as he was in the Marines tell it (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian well as the girl, Jack Pickford very well how painful roommate, Ralph Bushmen is the competitor. Edward Connell, Mary Alden, David Torrens, Guinn Williams, Grady Sutton, and role. This film is now celebrated his homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford and what a debut film of John Wayne as a footballer Yale (but I never saw it). Haynes was the top-five star cash, starting with this picture through 1932. It's a shame that he has been largely forgotten and that the majority of his films seem to have lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
