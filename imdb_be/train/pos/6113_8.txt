After seeing "Marrying the Mafia", I almost lost my faith in the Korean film industry. But this one has brought my faith back. <br /> <br /> The leading female character who is a university student is forced to teach a spoiled, rich, but charistmatic high school student, boy. He really is the age of the female character. A few fun quarrells, the two end up to be great friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that a beginner Kwang sung in did their job benefits. He was such a discovery !! Actress Kim Ha NUL was also lovely, as usual. <br /> <br /> This film is at pains to avoid any clich√©s that can be seen in the typical romantic comedies. And it did not show us any unnecessary naked sex scenes. It was a brilliant, beautiful, fresh, I wanted to see him again. <br /> <br />
