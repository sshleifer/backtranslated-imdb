I do not know why people always want a deeper meaning to the movies, or consider them useless. <br /> <br /> How about just being entertained? Something which stands out Morgan Freeman. He gets a chance to show a little bit. Paz Vega, his co-star gets a career boost and Brad Silberling is given the name to attract people to see his film. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. A bit of humor, some pathos, some bittersweetness but nothing on top. I got a special kick out of Jim Parsons as a registrar for a construction company. If he looks at love and Freeman says, "You want me to be a woman" He's just hilarious.. The fight between Ms. Vega her ex-husband and his girlfriend is excellent too. <br /> <br /> In short, it's cute, charming film that will make you smile. You could do a lot worse.
