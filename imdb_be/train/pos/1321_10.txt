Beat the way for this important documentary film that looks like an attractive feature. Forbidden $ Lie (2007) simply the best (cinematic) version of the book of forbidden love Norms Khor, and it was a bestseller. Onion-peeling literary fraud and beautiful woman, Lie $ is the best in editorialised reality show. <br /> <br /> Skillfully edited and colorful, speaking Broinowski is chaptered moving silhouettes Norma Khor meaningful blowing smoke, I do not agree (with Variety), this is a long time; instead of my one little problem was with the episodic nature of their key players commenting on other reviews just recorded. On one view the meaning of the story becomes involved ..... so I watched it twice. <br /> <br /> This is an Oscar worthy effort just really funny, exciting, and very exciting, as the documents one lie after another. The apparent con unfolded in the Australian state of Queensland with a very personal scams friends and supporters in Khuri (!). It is obvious that these friends are now "were" ridiculous line on the camera belonging to Q neighbor Khoury Rachel Richardson, who tells her disappointment in flat, no-nonsense spoken: "I think it's a load of sh t personally" <brie. /> <br /> We have to learn from their experience, so my belief spoilers. Any long-term lie spinner caught in a lie is just to say something, to gain time, to tell another lie. <br /> <br /> There's some exciting footage Khoury cackling derisively in articulating this very documentary, which instead holds her (CON) «Artist» several times to confirm. <br /> <br /> Since the bursting of the Sydney Morning Herald journalists Caroline Overington and David Knox, a year after publication, Khoury was on the move, but were tempted to go back to the director to allegedly clear her name. She allegedly disappeared, because a) it is either afraid of her sly, more Italian-sounding than-Greek husband, or b) because she needed her passport / visa to clear his name. . <br /> <br /> It is unlikely <br /> <br /> A more likely reason was that the FBI resumed its footprint in Queensland before she again skipped abroad (one guess: no, Jordan). In accordance with the card closes, Khoury was "still under investigation by the FBI" in 2007. <br /> <br /> I guess the audience could just give Khoury in the benefit of the doubt, as soon as it is caused by the need for secrecy and tricks. Instead, the audience, I was sitting with a slowly become as frustrated as the cheated people on the screen. Once they caught on, there was a lot of counter taunts and whistling; earlier he stressed sighs proceeded from audiencemembers, who simply does not know how to accept the contradictions are evolving in Hurte. <br /> <br /> The director gets props so beautiful cover this complicated story from beginning to end, leaving nothing for the street-on even her own sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Anna opens the movie with a nice book of stories most Khoury. Putated reason for authoring is retold very believable in the first - the key to how throughout the life of a liar works: in the half-truth. Khoury is still very beautiful and intelligent 35yr old from a rather disarming charm, and surprisingly, developed biceps. <br /> <br /> Gradually we introduced smaller and less-adulating Aussie journos, publishers and fans who have bought in the first degree of pride-killing accusations hook, line and sinker in Khuri. Later we see them more sad reaction, fully restrained and prosaic, when someone, perhaps a little bitter. <br /> <br /> It was a Jordanian (anti) honor killings of activists who took offense at the deepest errors Khoury, because it made them stirring the pot to reduce the pace of change. Honor-killing happen in Jordan; it's just their prevalence that is at odds with the book in Khuri - plus 72 other "facts". In 2003, these activists by fax (Australian) Random House 73 painstakingly scanned objections. <br /> <br /> In publishing on 4 continents, who would jump at the opportunity to publish a first time author Khoury never tried to verify any facts. Leaving any corroborration to a denial of the authors of the contract, they were also fair game. So massive fraud hot topic was so easy to make light on how to enter it in the internet cafe. <br /> <br /> Later still we are shocked to learn that the "factual errors" extends to the bio-Khoury as well. On the one hand, it is not only 35yr-virgin (her defense is that she just not to disappoint the people of their assumptions), but it has slickster husband and 2 teenagers! Sometimes it's just too soon to speak in her American accent. she also seems to be very comfortable with the telephone technology and western clothes. I understand that observation as this may seem very infringes Jordanian women who are not in need of a western pattern me-Realism, but even if it does not fit the cultural signals in addition to the "facts" Khoury, you should start asking your source. <br /> <br /> at some point, the director came to the same conclusion. It makes a great effort to contain Khoury to an account in person, in Jordan. The last third is consumed with the study trip back to Amman, where one "fact" after the others fall. eventually Broinowski makes her (CON) «Artist» admit Ten inconsistency in its history and it is after this that Khouri writes her mocking secret recognize of in a digital camera. Secret because it "American security guard" Khoury Jeremy heard to have an Australian accent: he's an actor! (We'll never know as Anna opened it.) <br /> <br /> So, it becomes a triumph for director, because it never flags in her tone or obligation. Her on-camera testimony to bring her audience to learn from the mistakes of other data, such a litany of reasonable doubt, the FBI documents. - and most shocking Hurte original crime <br /> <br /> Anna Broynouski (watch-list it now) even smart enough to use the same artistic technique (key players in cross-commenting shots) to kill two birds with one stone. - making it once again the audience want to drink from the same well <br /> <br /> In fact, despite its deceptively demure approach, it made me reaffirm that Overington and Knox did win their 2004 Walkleys in journalism to investigate their «Norma Khouri investigation." <br /> <br /> Broinowski MADE ME LOOK.
