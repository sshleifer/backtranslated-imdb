Exaggerated romance typical of its period (mid 1950's) and corresponding matinee food. Rock Hudson, extinguishing everything always falls in love, playing its usual role stereotype, but while in the Giant, made the same year, when his material and co-stars (Taylor & Dean) were above average, in this film he just not good enough to raise the caliber outside mushy story about how hard to be rich and happy. Self-destruction of a brother and sister (Robert Stack, winding its way through the film in a drunken stupor, and Dorothy Malone, playing vampish poor rich girl is completely over the top) end up losers and Hudson gets Bacall - who is faster in this wood part, does not have enough character or mind, to get it moving. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, a good end happily and the bad miserable, then there is a sense of fantasy. Nevertheless, it was interesting to read that the film is based on a true story that dream come storyline. As in other films of the period, disguised homosexuality in heterosexual terms. Maybe the film could be altered: the nature of the stack will sound truthful when he was hiding homosexual feelings Mitch married. Far From Heaven Todd Haynes has improved significantly in the All That Heaven Allows, also directed by Cirque. Perhaps, Haynes could remake written on the wind, and give us a truly memorable film.
