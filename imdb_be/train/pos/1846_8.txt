When I first read the story of the drama I assumed that it had to be like Sex and the City, but this drama is entirely nothing of the sort. Tales characters seem more real, and you empathize with the situation anymore. The concept of the drama seems to have four 30-something women out there guide us through friendships and relationships with the challenges and struggles along the way. Kathy GP dark and brooding character, which you will find difficult to relate too and best friends with Trudi's widow. The nature of work is heart warming how you can relate to the difficulties it is having in addition to the fact that she is the only mother of four. Jessica party girl is very single-minded and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a cute character and is closest to the young Siobhan that while loving her husband does not help her eyes wandering over her colleague. For all the drama surprisingly addictive and if the BBC continues to produce the series, he can do well. This is in contrast to the other female cast dramas such as Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives. This is when the right can be played following cold feet. Plus male cast is not bad on the eyes either.
