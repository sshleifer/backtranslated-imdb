I just throw my two cents. Relax, it's a comedy. So, most of the characters well-written and acted. I can not think of many comedies, where they do not exist. This is not a new version, it's on video and broadcast on cable almost every week. Will I see it in the theater? Of course, I did when it first came out. Funny ... that should be enough. <br /> <br /> Even if I do not like it at all, I'd still watch the cable for Michael Keaton. It is undervalued and underestimated actor. I can not think of another that is so capable in every genre. I can not think who it is equally successful. Comedian, is also the star of action (not for long, but still), which is also a romantic lead, which is also a dramatic actor; villain and hero. I can not think of any, at least not in Hollywood. Of course, no one has been successful in all these genres. I mean, there's Tom Cruise, but for me it is better to be than Tom Cruise became the character. However, this is not about Michael Keaton vs. Tom Cruise, so I'll move on. <br /> <br /> Gung Ho is the rent, the bolt is worth buying, as you can probably find it for $ 10.00 or less at stores like Wal-Mart. It's worth looking at the cable (if you have cable or satellite). This is one of those who are interested in watching movies. You can put your brain on pause, and just relax, and laugh away. <br /> <br /> In order to ask for more, in my honest opinion, asking for too much.
