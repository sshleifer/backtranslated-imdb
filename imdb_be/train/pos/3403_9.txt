Magnificent products Techicolor tells the unusual story of a romance between a woman of strong religious faith and Trappist monk who left his monastery, breaking their promises. The film opens in monasteries in Europe, where the former student prays - lonely beauty in black Domini name (Marlene Dietrich). She consults the abbess to go to the desert and to "find themselves" and to lose her grief over her father, who recently died. In the train on the way to the Sahara, she sits in front of a very, very troubled man (Charles Boyer) - our former monk. She quickly in a hotel near the palm treed oasis, where she again sees our restless unknown man as he stumped what to do when faced with a very seductive girls dancing. Domini becomes friends with him, although he knows nothing about her past -. Romance soon follow <br /> <br /> This film is a sentimental, melodramatic, and different (in a sense, almost surreal and even a little mannerisms) - I found it to be very fun and interesting. Pictures in this is really interesting - it is full of an extreme closeup of the face and beautiful color images of caravans of horses that crosses the desert, looming figure against the western sky. Marlene Dietrich gives nicely done, though restrained, performance here, and looks great. Charles Boyer - usually not one of my favorite - really very good at this, I think that part of the kind of costumes, and he looks quite young and beautiful, too. Basil Rathbone fine here but produced very little in common. Another big orchestral score of Max Steiner helps keep rolling theater - all in all, a very enjoyable film.
