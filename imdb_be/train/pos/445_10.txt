The first time I saw Enchanted April about five years ago. I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy of the following Christmas. It is about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy in the month of April, as a result of their everyday lives for them. They are very sad woman at the beginning of the movie, and you can not help but root them out as they planned this get-away with two other women, they are invited together to split the cost. This is perhaps the most feel good movie I've ever seen. It's clean and simple, no car chases, Sun hostility and no deaths. This was done with care and in a very good taste. You can not help but smile through it all - except when you're crying happy tears!
