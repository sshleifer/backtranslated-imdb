Kerching I read reviews on IMDb, and frankly, I have never seen a positive response so far. I actually like Kerching. Kerching about a teenager named Taj Lewis to make £ 1 million for his mother, he establishes a Web site called RudeBoy. The site offers a lot of interesting, if only the Taj and two of his friends - Denis and Seymour can stop the Taj from gaining exposure. I think that this show is very funny, and I like to watch. Valid approach, but it can definitely be better, the characters are funny, especially Denis Spooner, a friend of the Taj, his stupidity, which makes it fun. Taj and the other one in Seymour. Also Carlton, owner café'e called "cold." We never see him, we only hear it. Taj younger brother Omar and his older sister, Miss funny too. And the best friend of Miss Kareesha. So many Taj Does not opened, almost time. As well as comedy, drama Kerching, such as love of life and the loss of loved ones make this program great.
