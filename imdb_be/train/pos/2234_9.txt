While the "special effects" and the technical attributes of this movie can actually be ridiculous by some, I've never been able to erase the image of the film are engraved on my young and impressionable mind when I first saw it about 8 years. The history of the survival of this girl and she endured the test has stayed with me all these years, and I thought back to more than once about how she did it out of the situation far beyond anything I've seen. <br /> <br /> the fact that it is a true story, and the fact that I was a child, when I first saw this could be the reason for my high rating of this film. Every time the film was shown on television in the 70's and 80's I would have riveted to the TV, drink in every scene with interest, I can not explain. I suggest watching it for the first time as an adult (and with haggard eyes in the world) can not be pleasant for some. I actually went out of his way to get a copy so that I could show this film to my son. <br /> <br /> This, like many other films, is not for everyone. If you are impressed by the remarkable stories of human survival, indifferent to Peru / Machu Picchu and / or Amazon, then I suppose you might enjoy this film as much as I have enjoyed over the past 30 years.
