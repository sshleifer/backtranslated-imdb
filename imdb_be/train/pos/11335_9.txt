Jake's Closet has an emotional effect Kramer vs. Kramer, combined with imagination Pan's Labyrinth. Even novice special effect, seems to give the nod to Pan's Labyrinth. But this is a story that takes place in our time, and not in the war sixty years ago, and thus it has even greater resonance today. Jake's Closet about the boy, an only child, almost single-handedly for the summer holidays, when dealing with his family falling apart. This is a horror film, like the others, and The Sixth Sense, a horror film for the thinking man. If you are looking for Chopper movie, it will not be your cup of tea, but if you're looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with a good cast, this film is for you. At the screening I saw, I swear, there was a moment when the whole audience shouted. I highly recommend this movie to catch.
