For me it was a wake-up call, and the realization that almost all we see, hear, read, and think about most anything, depends on what the media feeds us. This is a classic example of a high level of spin doctors who are trying to control the mass with a controlled information. He is also an excellent example of how people who have a constitution, they are free to buy and will not be under the influence of this control over the media or any attempt at misinformation. Once again this shows that in fact outweigh the needs of the few at the end of the day needs a lot of freedom. It is also instructive to see what is happening, that democracy is not very difficult in a country where there is a religious civil war that needs to be implemented.
