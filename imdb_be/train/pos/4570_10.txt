Even if you absolutely know nothing about Ireland, you have to love "My Left Foot" (and especially the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis in it). He plays a cerebral palsy sufferer Christy Brown. In this regard, he spent most of his life ostracized. Even when trying to warn people about something, they just laugh at him. Light in the darkness for him is that he has control of one part of the body, his left leg. He uses this appendage to draw and write poetry, with the result that his fame <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan has done very well in this co-operation, as well as at a later cooperation :. "In the name of the father" (but "Boxer" was not necessary). "My Left Foot" can make you feel a lot of ways: sad, hopeful, or something else. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis gave life performance here. Great movie in every sense.
