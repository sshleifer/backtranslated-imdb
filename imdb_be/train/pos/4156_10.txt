I watched a bunch of Co Ca episodes since its premiere (especially now, when it immediately follows The Amazing Race, but it was one of the best copies of the letter and the actions that I have seen from the Bruckheimer home. The casting, especially the junior officers, was place, and the script and editing, sound, and acting made this episode a tour d'force. If I were the manufacturer, I would imagine this episode for consideration by Amy. It is amazing how complete the portrait was made with Coop and Jimmy within s 48 minute episode, which takes a lot of talented people, making them better, I hope, NY for this is a timely warning of when the episode is repeated, because I'm sure that I see. a lot that I did not notice the first time.
