It was always one of my favorite movies, and always will be. Over the past few years I have become / 60 Sci-freak 50s, trying to gather all the best of them that were made then. I love many things about them on how they can be both banal technically correct some of them. Large flowers and sets make me go too. It is a pity if they again do some of those good old movies; they almost always fill it - just look at last again make the day the earth stood still, it's complete garbage !! Forbidden Planet is one of the reference space films of all time, and now they are trying to re-do it, too, and I shudder to think that the new one will be like! In my opinion, some things, such as fi classic movies should just be left alone, to be what they are classic examples of the great attempts to tell simple stories, and give people the thrill of the process. Once they add all the techno-crap that we have at the moment, the film seems just a dog from Hollywood sausage factory - nothing special at all. By the way, I noticed that the shape of the astronauts in the Forbidden Planet have also been used for the "Queen of Outer Space"! It just goes to show that the budgets have been slightly lower, then, is not it? Hey, less money, and the best movies, hmmm .... <br /> <br /> Great performances in this film by Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Dude (which has always been one of my favorite actors ), Earl Holliman, and, of course, Robbie the robot! <br /> <br /> special effects are fantastic, and the plot is not too far-fetched. This is a great experience science fiction!
