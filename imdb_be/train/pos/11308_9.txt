TCM holds me awakens all the time ... they keep coming up with movies Ive never heard ... Senso .... Now Ossessione ... very early Visconti film !! ... wow ... the Italian version of The Postman Always Rings Twice ... brilliant !! beautifully acted and directed ... I've never heard of any findings, which were fine, Clara Calamai like Giovanna, and especially Zhirotti as Gina ... that sensual man !! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 !!! His gaze was ahead of his time ... a lot of male stars of the 1950s are likely to have been inspired by him ... he was supposed to be a major worldwide star !! The film is much better than the version of the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange and less glossy than the MGM version (which I like) with John Garfield and Lana Turner, remember that white outfit? who could forget .... This Italian version is different ..more realistic and with a very different ending ... to see that look ... I'm going to buy it !!
