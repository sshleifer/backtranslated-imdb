exciting children's classic Seyker about the same as Disney, Freddy Krueger. This is murder, racism, facial disfigurement and killer lizard. <br /> <br /> Tight depicted a multi-layered story, interconnected covers the history of the Stanley uncover own heritage and secret holes. This race of lush greenery in Latvia slaves Camp Green Lake (hint: there is a lake and not green). <br /> <br /> the first success of the Disney re-creation of the novel conditions so convincingly - set design is gorgeous and without gloss. Another plus in the casting. Rising star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Greenlight) can not be Podge books, but his attitude is right, and he is far from the usual designated hero. The rest of the cast is filled equally well by Patricia Arquette as the Frontier School MARM turned bank robber Henry Winkler as the father of Stanley. The downside is pop soundtrack - a pure marketing department - and has a sense turned up to full volume at the end.
