This film is very cool! It works perfectly, with excellent casting Bernsna perfektsionny as a dentist who worry and torment their patient. In the beginning he sees his wife with PoolMan, and then he was going mad. He also takes revenge on his wife and PoolMan, patients, it hurts. Most special effects and beautiful, although some of them are actually fake (both drilled with the language, which lies outside the 1 night, and still red in the morning). But the torture scene is absolutely well done. Although this film has a weak point, which is very slow; between the hard part sometimes extremiously sad part. But the real horror / thriller fan is sure to watch!
