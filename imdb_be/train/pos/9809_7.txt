Randolph Scott sent to Albuquerque to take on a job with his uncle. However, on the way there, the scene is kept - despite the fact that they do not carry a safe. However, the nice lady on board hides $ 10,000 for the business she and her brother ... and the robbers seem to know it. <br /> <br /> Once in the city, Scott goes to this uncle about work. However, he soon finds out that this uncle jerk - a typical bad guy westerns. You know, the rich guy who just wants to be richer by deception and theft, and threats until he owns everything. And it so happened that this moron was for robbery. Scott needs to Uncle return the money, and then Scott goes into business with a nice lady and her brother. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, that is not the end of problems --- just the beginning. Again and again, there are different types of intrigue to try to suppress the opposition uncle. One trick is to bring in a nice lady friends Scott and his partners. It shooter, and it looks bad for Scott - until he finds out why she came to town <br /> <br /> Unlike most subsequent Randolph Scott movie, this one shows Scott, as a bit of a stubborn man .. Too often in his films he is the last to offer violence, but in this film he is quick to offer a lynching (the law of the screw, let's Hangin '), and then he quickly threaten uncle. What a surprise to see it as such a hot head - although in most other ways, it is the same old Scott you would expect <br /> <br /> As far as the movie goes, there is nothing particularly unusual. it. Gabby Hayes plays a regular character, Scott hero, the villain can not be justified to, and ultimately will be destroyed, and Scott gets the girl. In spite of this very typical story, all handled very well, and as a result is well worth your time. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are two amazing scenes in the film. Firstly, at the end of the movie, there is a fist fight between Scott and uncle # 1 puppet, Lon Chaney, Jr .. In it, Chaney smoke as he fights - that I have never seen before, and I admire the way he I could inflate away as he got his feet example. Second, get a load of this runaway cart scene with a whip - now that was a feat impossible!
