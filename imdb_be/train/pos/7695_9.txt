Good Times was groundbreaking comedy about the first nuclear black family, which lives in the Chicago projects. Regardless of whether or not you live in the inner cities and ghettos, suburbs, or rural countryside, this show is a treasure to look at and watch the family be a family, not a show about a poor black family. But they did not stop there. They find a sense of humor and have strong family values ​​and morals. Despite the story behind the scenes, the show is worth to keep in the air, except I did not want to kill their father, which I agree with Esther Rolle, who fought hard to keep the family together. But, despite all the fighting behind the scenes, Good Times was a show about a family. We all loved the dynamite JJ and his antics. We watched Penny Janet Jackson grow up a little. This show was groundbreaking to show the desperation in drugs, gangs, and alcoholism. Not being instructive, Evans was always trying to do the right thing than to do something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
