I began to lose my faith in movies lately inundated with typical Hollywood film genre. Story line is out of order, and the camera work is simply copied from the last movie looks like taste. But then I saw Zentropa (Europe) and my faith has been restored. This is not only a metaphorical story fascinating, but the use of color and black-and-white visual stimulation. Narrator (Max von Sydow) will guide you through a fascinating journey every step of the way and takes hold of you in Europa 1945. We have all seen death put on the screen in a hundred thousand ways, but the beauty of the film as it passes through each low-speed time, which leads to death . Unlike many films he does not cut through a second display (for example) a knife, but it makes you look more destructive sensual beauty of the last moments of a person. I think we can all do something different from what the film is trying to say, but it is definitely worth the time to find out what it all really means. I would like to talk in more detail about the film for anyone who wants to send me an email. Rejoice!
