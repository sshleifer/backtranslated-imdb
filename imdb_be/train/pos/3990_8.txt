Mai and her husband to visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is inconvenient, because the grandchildren and "children" do not really seem to know each other, as one would expect. Heat that needs to be there is missing. After dinner, my husband Mei said he was not feeling well, accuses him of his daughter's cooking, and irritation says he wants to go home. He died that night. <br /> <br /> May is now a widow, lost. She was clearly not hot or marriage is very interesting, but it was a goal. She was someone who needs it, and even its own needs have gone unmet for many years, it had something to do with her days. <br /> <br /> She is depressed and unmotivated. She goes to stay with her daughter, Paula, who soon after the arrival of her mother lets her mother know that she never felt that her mother gave much of himself at all. She lets loose with anger over the lack of education of its mother. May seems to be disarmed and surprised, but it also seems to have no energy or desire to really do it right. "I'm your mother and I love you." What is really saying? (I heard it from my mother, too many times, and even to find out what it means.) Paula a bit (well, more than a little) neurotic. Both women need, although they show it in very different ways. <br /> <br /> Paula was connected with one of her son, Darren, who is a master work on the house, which belonged to her son. While Paula is working during the day, May begins to talk and lunch with Darren. Darren married man who left his wife because of their autistic son, Nicky, but allegedly did not live in the house with his wife. <br /> <br /> May attracted to Darren, because it is courageous and it has a relationship, they seem to have. Darren attracted to May, because it offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from other women in his life. (It also becomes too interested in money, which in May said that she could give him "get away from it all", even though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on this journey. They end up sleeping together in the spare room on during the day, and in May, has performance as a woman, it is not known in years, or ever will again know. her daughter often told her Paula that she will leave the married Darren, it becomes part of the rationalization of May that she does it well. <br /> <br /> when writing group, leading Paula, t Aries is introduced and forced to come together with a widower, to which it is not attractive. There is one scene where she has sex with an older man, who can obviously only be carried out, and it's really painful and disturbing, as we have seen, the general disgust on his face May, when she was going through a disposable disgusting relationship. <br /> <br /> in the end, Paul discovers through some very graphic drawings made by her mother, that in fact her mother and Darren were having sex. <br /> <br /> This film will undoubtedly perceived by many in countless ways. Sympathy will be divided. At some point during the writing group Paula May shows a short essay that she used to feel like she hated her child to the end of the day, and leave for pubs after they slept, making sure to go home to her husband. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that a good mother does not think to leave children alone while she goes to the local pub. May, however, it was also found earlier in the film that her husband did not want her having friends that she has not. She did what he wanted her to do. She was unhappy, but she put up with it, because, in her words, "it was easier." Thus, while May was not the best mother, for those who are inclined to have a liking for it, we could see May's actions as an act of a woman just wants to be sexy and be live on "a few minutes" in her life, a woman who just wanted someone to listen to her, to know her as a human being to have one and the lover. <br /> <br /> Polo, though neurotic and unhappy, might have become so due to distant parents who raised her. Of course, it is not difficult to understand why Paul feels completely changed her mother. <br /> <br /> This is a well-made film with a lot of difficulties, which I have already mentioned, and, of course, one that will leave the viewer many, perhaps conflicting, reaction. This film should be discussed and debated, and, above all, is worth a look. <br /> <br /> One film leaves us in the horror and fear of living alone. Regardless of who is considered a "right" or who are considered "wrong" every spectator that the theme of old age and loneliness, causing a feeling of fear in most of us, it is inevitable.
