I work in the library, and is expected to like this movie when it came out 5 years ago. Well, I liked it a lot Posey (she is a good actress) and Omar Townsend was very cute, like her boyfriend (he can not act, but when you look like someone who cares?), But the movie was bad. It was not funny or cute if almost nothing. Posey was holding the film afloat with their energy. But she had learned Dewey Decimal OVERNIGHT system, and then tons of books in the shelves of music beat ?? !!!! ??? Come on! Also, I had a problem with the way she looked when she became a full-fledged librarian at the end - in the hair bundle, sunglasses, no sense of humor - can not let this stereotype to please? Worth seeing for Posey and Townshend, but that's about it. The series was much better.
