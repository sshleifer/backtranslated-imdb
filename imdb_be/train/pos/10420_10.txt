Large Caruso shows the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He shows great acting potential and is in great shape, as a lyrical singer, paired with Dorothy Kirsten, soprano Metropolitan Opera. In fact, I dare say that it performs some songs are better than Caruso (check A'Vuchella by Tosti and La Danza by Rossini). MGM art and music departments also did a good job. This film would be perfect if not for the awkward presence of Ann Blyth; we see that it is trying hard, dressed in the style of the fifties in the scenes just before 1920 - is unforgivable. Lanza deserves a better leading lady, and must adhere to Blyth less complex productions. Also note that Ms. Kirsten sings most operatic duets with Lanza film, giving the wrong impression that Caruso had the appearance of permanent lead soprano.
