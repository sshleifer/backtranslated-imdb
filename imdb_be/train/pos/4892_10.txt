It was surprisingly smart and entertaining film that I never tire of watching many, many times. The casting was perfect in young coinciding with the old characters. There are those of us who are here really appreciate good actors and intelligent narrative format. As for Judi Dench, she's beautiful and a gift to any type of product in which it plays. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is an excellent actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation her character comes to life. I can only be grateful, when I see such an outstanding picture of most movies made are not enough good characters in recent times, good scripts and good action. public film needs heroes, not deviant dummies who lack the ingenuity and talent. How nice to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like this film to win the award he deserves. Thanks again for a great night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer, director, producer, and all those who have done such a wonderful job.
