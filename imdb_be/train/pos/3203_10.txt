I think that this film was one of Kurt Russels good films. Kurt Russell is my favorite actor, so I think he's a good actor in every role he plays. But this film was a lot of action in it, and I know that it must have a 5.6 to 10 per meter, but many people do not like this movie. Well, I thought it was good, so I think everyone should see this film. If you see this film and how I think you should see Back Project as Kurt Russell. I give soldiers *** 1/2 out of *****
