Holly solves the problem of child sexploitation, which is rampant in the world (about 2 million children are trafficked every year) and does so delicately and without manipulation - higher order, in which the team Priority Films makes a great success. American star actor Ron Livington in the film along with newcomer Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress, who plays Holly, and together they bring to the screen, it is commonplace for people in the notorious district k11 RedLight in Cambodia. While it solves the difficult subject, the film keeps minutes of laughter and hope as we come to know the nature of close, holding two o'clock movie on one that is too hard to watch. I am glad that a film like this brings the world's attention to this problem. Child prostitution has to be stopped, and this is a very good first step. This is a great and each movie must see.
