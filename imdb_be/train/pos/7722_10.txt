This is a film that has it all, a dashing hero, a beautiful damsel in distress, the noble figure with a tragic flaw, and a really great robot. Forbidden Planet claimed that special magic for many years and does not lose its flavor after repeated viewings (though sexy youthful Anne Francis greatly helps in this account). <br /> <br /> film fans will recognize youthful Leslie Nielsen drawing beautiful and heroic Commander Adams, although those of us who loved him in comedic roles, it may be a little taken aback by his appearance in a minor role. Outstanding and noble view Dandy also showed player, a scientist with the secret (Id). Other supporting cast deserve a nod, especially Warren Stevens as a brainy and resourceful "Doc", and of course the charm of Miss Francis, as noted above. <br /> <br /> This film was an early pioneer in the use of electronic music in the 1950s, no less. Loans to call them "tones", but those of us who have tried to tinker with the early version of the device "terms" recognizes the terrible and frightening whine and squeal sometimes used in the sound track. Nevertheless, it gives an image of exotic and alien landscape mysterious and forbidding world of Krell. <br /> <br /> The special effects are also very surprising. I remember her fear as the boy waits for the next manifestation of «Id» invisible monster, and when he finally visualized in a single battle scene literally shook me to my toes in disbelief and fear. Magic matte art in full use in the dizzying scenes Krell science complex as the characters make their way through various labyrinths and passages, guided by the mysterious Dr. Morbius. <br /> <br /> I remember feeling some measure of hard, Dr. Morbius would be so cool toy in the form of Robby the robot. Robby person quite charming and in a certain sense, he seems more human than some of the other characters. Spectators at the following exhibitions like Twilight Zone and Lost In Space recognizes recycled Robby support in some of these episodes, but I remember that he never had the "face" of the original Robby. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, do not fully understand the complexity of the story, until I was old enough to understand the various references to Freudian psychology and the danger of a hidden and usually contain fear and anger we carry within, but taught themselves, through willpower, load and control by joining the social codes. While the key to history seems obvious, once he revealed that is unknown (or perhaps deliberately forgotten) Dr. Morbius while pointing to clear thinking Adams commander who makes Dr. Morbius confront the evil within themselves. It still gives me Murashko, when the commander pushes Adams Dr. Morbius down to the machine Krell, which endowed him with great intelligence which opened the gates to a flood of his subconscious power Krell machine :. "Here, where your mind has been artificially increased. Consciously she still did not have enough power to operate more machines. But your subconscious mind has been made strong enough. »Zowee! <br /> <br /> Forbidden Planet is probably my favorite science fiction movie ever, and remains a timeless and classic to his elaborate history and excellent visualization and realization on the screen.
