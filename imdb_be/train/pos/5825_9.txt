Most Stoogephiles considers it not be better Stooges jumper is not, and they are right. Curly is screeching dressed in clothes like "Senorita Cucaracha" and UIA, and Larry's in great shape, as "Señor Mucho" and "Señor Gusto", respectively. beautiful operatic voice of Christine McIntyre will be given a full course - she was an opera singer trained in fact - and that's fine. Big Gina Corrado hilarious as pompous Italian singer terrorized the Stooges in the party society. Some really funny jokes, good direction and very tight installation makes this climb to the very top of the prolific output the puppets. What is even more surprising is that Curly had serious health problems at the time, and some of the shorts he made during this period, you can see that he is clearly ill; his timing is off, he speaks very slowly and hesitantly, and problems getting around. Fortunately, his health has been in the rise, when he made this film, and it shows. Classic Stooge comedies, and even the fans are not a puppet (I had a friend who could not stand the Stooges, but even she laughed at this). A must-see.
