Only after some contemplation did I decide I liked this movie. After reading the comments from all the other posters here and think about it some more, I decided that I liked it enormously. I love American films - probably because they're so descriptive. They usually have well-defined beginning, middle and end. "Almost nothing," on the other hand, does not make such an attempt. I do not agree with the other posters who say it is "too pretentious. In all respects, this film is designed to evoke the feeling of your memories. So many times throughout the film you feel like you're there ... you feel like summer sun, wind, heat, winter cold, sociable, loneliness, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> in all respects, the director pulls you into the lives of the characters - that's why so many people feel so strongly that the film has disappointed them. after I finished playing, I felt the same way. But after some thought, I realized that I the film had to be :. "History" is not a story, it is the emotions you (the audience) feel <br /> <br /> Lighting, sets, and perspectives will immerse you in scenes - they are rich, elegant, and rich details and nuances though. I usually can not approve of movies without a developed plot (after all, this is not a film "has to" tell a story), this film is definitely one of my new favorites.
