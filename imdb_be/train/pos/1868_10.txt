This film describes the life of someone who grew up in the worst circumstances, but unlike many people, in fact, it has grown to be a respected person. What's more is that it is a true story. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher is so innocent and yet he was offended by such only because he was not white. Antwone Fisher was married to the same woman for ten years, and he never played with women, coke, cigar, weed, alcohol, or any of those things, which are very popular in places he grew up. <br /> <br /> There is not much more to say about this movie is beautiful. The only rating I can give it 10/10.
