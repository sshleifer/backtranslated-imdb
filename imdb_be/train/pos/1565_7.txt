I just saw Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it very good. It was the first appearance of George Sanders as a saint, where he will replace Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> In this, the saint went to San Francisco to investigate a shooting at a nightclub. With the help of his friend Inspector Fernack, who came from New York, they help the daughter of crime boss. <br /> <br /> Joining Sanders in the cast are Wendy Barry and Jonathan Hale. <br /> <br /> Not bad film St. . Worth seeing <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
