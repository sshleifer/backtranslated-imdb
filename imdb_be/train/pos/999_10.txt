I am amazed at how this film (and most of the others have an average 5 star and below, if there are bad movies an average of 7 to 10 stars on IMDb. Fanboy mentality strikes again. When this film came out just about all closed. Even my ex friend said that this film is questionable. Many years later, I sat down to watch this movie, and I found myself enjoying. Even laugh quite a bit. this is the replacement Killers are films that have people designated Director Fukui as a black Michael Bay. I do not understand how as most movies are smarter Fukui s than anything Michael Bay invented Anyway ... <br /> <br /> The history :. Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is a former convict who used a no-frills Edgar Treasury agent (David Morse) as walk to catch a killer by the name of Bristol (Hutchison). Alvin steps every track bugs implanted in his jaw after the accident. while these agents after Bristol, Bristol, after gold bricks, which were taken in a robbery gone awry. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx funny, as well as great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin fast talker, much smarter than he lets on. Hutchison in order as Bristol. It can be a top-John while he Malkovitchesque manners. It was better here than he was Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse well as hard-edged Treasury agent. Even Mike Epps funny as his brother Alvin Stevie. Both he and Jamie had some funny moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of the film is a thriller several attempts fall flat. The script on the racetrack is way over-the-top, but I could not look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that. Plus bomb scene with Treasury agent tied to a chair, and a detonator rests on the door was quite elegant. <br /> <br /> In general, the device is not a bad film a long shot. He was never boring, it's always funny, and I did not check my watch every minute. That should count for something. Adaptation is one of the most underrated films 2000 period <br /> <br /> PS :. The reviewer who claimed the film is too strong .... How long have you been living under a rock? I'm sure you've seen hardy series and each film by Quentin Tarantino. But these films are not violent right? Weirdo.
