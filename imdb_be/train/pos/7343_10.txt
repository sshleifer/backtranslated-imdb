Why this film did not disappear in the dark is an absolute crime. "Conan" is probably the only sword and sorcery movie better. Brutal violence, the cool character designs, and goes well, make it one of the best fantasy around. This is definitely the biggest animated film aimed at a more adult audience, that I have ever seen. It's not like a regular obsessive style in Bakshi. It is quite a departure for Bakshi, and, in my opinion, his best work. I hope this film gets the recognition he deserves.
