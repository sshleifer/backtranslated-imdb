This movie has an all-star cast, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybil Shepard, and Belushi, to name a few, is rampant in Monte Carlo, as well as some other beautiful European locations, and very funny. The trouble is that everyone gets when they lie to protect themselves perfectly, and I strongly recommend you see this movie, it's well worth it! John Candy in the best shape of Once Upon A Crime, like all the others! If you and your family are looking for a great family film, this is your ticket. Each gives stellar performances, great acting, great comedy and great timing, which is rare in a movie these days. Large plot, big secret (which I love anyway) and, in general, it is worth the money you spend on it. So that children take a little popcorn, juice or tea, or soda, and enjoy the show !!!!
