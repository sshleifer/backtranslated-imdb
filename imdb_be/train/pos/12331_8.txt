Being a man who lists Night of the Living Dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time, and at the same time, who loves this student film parody, I feel like I have to protect the film against the corrosive previously wrote reviews. This short but sweet opus has always been a crowd pleaser at the horror and science fiction movie marathons, where those who attend have a love of the genre do not know, take a zombie movie too seriously. This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult. It is designed to be fun, and many others, I heard music and applause for it will agree with me that this happens. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50+ times. Watch for a cameo as news director reporter Jeff Drexel, and if you have the opportunity to catch his alien parody, Loaf.
