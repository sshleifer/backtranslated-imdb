I liked this movie, I remember, there was one very well done scene in this movie where Riff Randall (played by PJ Soles) lies in her bed smokes pot, and then it starts to visualize that the Ramones in the room with her to sing the song " I Want You Around "... very very interesting material. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, quirky and cool. Yes, I admit that the end of the path, the path from the top and contrived ... but it does not matter, because it's fun, it's a very funny movie. It's sex, pot and rock-n-Rocll forever <br /> <br /> I read that Cheap Trick was a group that was originally shot in this ..but I do not know if this is true or not
