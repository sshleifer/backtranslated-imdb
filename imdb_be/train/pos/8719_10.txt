I was amazed at the improvements made in the cartoon. If you sit close to the screen, you will see the details in the grass and surface structures. Details, colors and shading, at least an order of magnitude better than Toy Story. How they were able to remove the shadowing, I'll never know. I hope PIXAR provide documentary about how the film was made, so I can find out how it was done. On the basis of this film, I think the future of animated films will be judged on the basis of this film.
