This is a movie I decided to go and see, because I'm a big fan of adult animation. I quite often that if the film does not develop around the famous actor or actress, but rather a story or style, it allows the film can be seen as a work of art, rather than showcase the ability of the actors to vary his style. <br /> <br /> This film is, of course, more about style than a story. While I found the story interesting (thriller that borrows the plot and the atmosphere of the films, such as Blade Runner and many anime films), it was a bit hard to follow at times, and did not feel like everything turned out as he may have. It certainly had a mixed feeling of the French animation and Japanese anime come together. of a good thing or not a viewer. Visually, this film is a treat for the eyes, and in this sense, a work of art. <br /> <br /> If you like animation for adults, or would like to see the film, which is different from most films at the moment, I would recommend it. All I can say is that I enjoyed the experience but come out of the film a little disappointed because it could have been better
