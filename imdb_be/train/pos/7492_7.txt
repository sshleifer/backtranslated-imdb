Although it is not a horror film in the traditional sense of the word, this is a terrible little film delivers the goods. It seems a vampire loose in the small German town of draining their victims of their blood. Police inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his earliest roles was skeptical considering insane killer sun vampire running amok. Only one said it was Ruth Bertha (Faye Wray) girlfriend and assistant inspector Dr. Otto Von Nieman (Etuilly), which, although apparently outstanding scientist comes with the vampire theory. The townspeople suspect Herman pervert Gleib, played with his usual passion Dwight Frye, who seems to be having a lot of fun with his role. The film contains quite a bit of humor, which helps to relieve some of the intensity involved in all murders are committed. One funny part is Gussie Schnappmann (Abern Fashion), Aunt Ruth Bert, thinking strange Herman turned not into a bat, but in the dog. Maud Abern and Dwight Frye to make a good comedy team. <br /> <br /> This amazing film brings the elements of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" with a doctor or by using the power of suggestion to make a somnambulist to perform his orders from "Frankenstein" using human blood to help create life in a laboratory, and "Dracula" as the murder is believed by all except the inspector and his girlfriend to be the work of a leech. Thses elements stir director Frank R. Strayer with a bit of comedy thrown in for good measure. Broth runs. The restored version I watched shading used to increase the atmosphere of a ghost. So try to see this version, if possible.
