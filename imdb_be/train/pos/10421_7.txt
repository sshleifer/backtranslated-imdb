It is the most beautiful film. Color photography is beautiful, as it shows the Metropolitan Opera Bounty in bright colors. Other indoor scenes in different places etc. equally brilliant. As for the music, what else can I say except that Lanza's voice was at its peak, he sang so many of the worlds most famous and favorite arias. Wonderful Dorothy Kirsten and joy, her soprano voice combined with that from the Lanza in a wonderful harmony. Of course, Hollywood took their usual liberties with the history of the life of Caruso. There is very little in the storyline, which is related to real events. For example, the facts relating to his death, completely fabricated and have no relation to the truth. There are some very good sites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain a few pictures of it. These websites can be placed with any good search engine. There are also several books available in respect of its life history. But the fictional story does nothing to spoil this wonderful film. Voices Lanza, Kirsten, and members of the choir are the real stars of this film. Enjoy, I know that I sure did.
