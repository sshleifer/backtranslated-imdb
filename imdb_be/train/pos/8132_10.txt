I do not remember when I first heard about this movie, but I shot him six years ago, and it still remains one of my favorite comedies. I admit, you probably would despise this film, if you do not know anything about rap music. But if you're a rap fan, even a casual one, you'll love inside jokes and references. One of the best lines in the film would be about the difference between **** and h **; I still use this line today and get a lot of laughs with him. One of the best performances come from Larry Scott, who played the nerd Lamar in `Revenge of the Nerds. Unfortunately, this movie will likely not receive a release DVD.
