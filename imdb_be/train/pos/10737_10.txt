If I do not know better, it almost seems like it was staged, but it was not. It was created in perfection, and how they got all these pictures are amazing! The sad events of September 11, 2001 together well in this documentary and classic frames that are received from this unfortunate classics. Just the history alone cadres should make it a must see for any American or a person touched the September 11 tragedy.
