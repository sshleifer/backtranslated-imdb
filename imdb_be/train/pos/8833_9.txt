I was intrigued by the title, so that for a short bout of insomnia (fueled my curiosity ...), I stayed and watched it. Then I checked my TV and watch it again! There is one very obvious understanding of what happened to me when I saw this film, despite the policy, tradition, culture, etc., teens everywhere are practically identical. Characters children from Belgrade could be transported to, say, somewhere in the American Midwest during the same period of time and language differences aside, it would be impossible to distinguish from any of the local teenagers of that era. They, of course, reflect the same growing pains and care, politics aside: music, sex, idols of movies, music, drink, sports, music ... In fact, almost the same things that occupied my time grows 1970 Southern California. <br /> <br /> It was a bitter story, but the joy of youth, made it very nice. Symbols, especially the young actors were completely true. I will not say that it is the Yugoslav "American Graffiti," but I will say that it fits perfectly in other 50's-themed movies.
