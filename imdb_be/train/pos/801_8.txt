I believe, JEDI is now chronologically should be considered "final" record is very popular in the saga, and it is very good, as are some of them. I liked how directly a continuation removed after The Empire Strikes Back, and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (and Mark Hamill, as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks, they were not so bad. I enjoyed an exciting chase in the woods, and I felt I had a lot of good emotions implemented in this section. End (with some new additions, I assume?) Successfully weaves all 6 leaders in the remarkable story of fantasy. I know a lot of these fans Star Wars hated George Lucas for the changes he made in the original film, but, being a relative newcomer to these films, and at the end of life and not enough of what I do not know, I think he did 6 these films work perfectly as a single unit. Oh, and, uh - Carrie Fisher looked quite delicious in her poor dress.
