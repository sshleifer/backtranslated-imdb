Tears Kalita is original yet spoiled horror film that delves into the reality of the cult groups in India, consisting of German psychologists, who have learned to control their desires and their bodies to such an extent that they may cause others to be "cured" through radical methods (which can cause nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture) to release pent-up demon inside them <br /> <br /> film is shown in the form of vignettes series of Taylor-Eriksson group -. the aforementioned cult group. The first segment is a little slower than the rest, but it is fine to create the precondition for the rest of the film. For the rest, it plays like a mindf @ ck a movie with some of the key staples thrown in the mix (full nudity, some gore) to keep you happy. <br /> <br /> I say check it out. Maybe not spectacular, but this concept is quite Neato and provides the right places. 8/10.
