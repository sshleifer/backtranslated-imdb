Russell, my favorite, beautiful in this film. But more than that, the film covers a huge range of human passions and sorrows. Everything from a marriage with homosexuality is addressed and respected. The film makes the viewer aware that tolerance of others provides a path to salvation of mankind. Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Liv. I replay their scenes again and again. Anyone who has ever been in love will sympathize with these people. All the characters are cast and portrayed perfectly.
