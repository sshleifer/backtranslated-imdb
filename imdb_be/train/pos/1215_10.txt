This is my favorite of the three bears care films. Once again, I liked all the songs. The big problem, however, since most people have shown that this story contradicts the original. For those who have seen the first film to recall Medvedev met his "cousin", which, apparently, they never knew about. It was not, of course, to the end that the cousins ​​got their characters tummy proving how much they care. In this story, however, cousins ​​grow with bears care and have a tummy symbols together. That being said, it's not a bad movie, how long you keep it separate from the first. I thought the character Darkheart much more evil, Nicholas first. But at the same time I felt that I added a kind of balance of sweetness care bears. I also liked the part we take care of in the end, although I know that other people have mixed feelings about this scene. And, of course, I loved the song. My favorites to be growing and Forever Young. Bears Care films have always been such a good song. Ten stars for a very good film.
