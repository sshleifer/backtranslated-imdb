This is not a movie that you are looking for fun, at least, most people I know do not. <br /> <br /> portraits on the cruelty to the body and mind, which occur during the war quite well, the characters seem plausible, especially because you "read their minds", something more often found in books and rare in the movies, but done very well in this regard. I would place it next to "All quiet on the Western Front" and «Die Brücke» in terms of leaving a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> I would like to escape it at the school, along with two other films - but to find a copy of this showed that it was difficult - which is a shame.
