is a visual adaptation of the manga with very little dialogue. what dialogue there is in the word balloons, as it would be in the manga. the story of this exist, but only vaguely accounted for. there is a problem of the manga on which it is based is available in English in the "underground Japan" books blowing collection, comics, and he has an actual target dialog that explains the story a little bit more than here. I recommend checking that the amount, if you liked it, as he explains some of the "plot" of the film, which is otherwise inexplicable. Animation wise it's pretty decent, good unobtrusive use of computers and the images are mostly well understood. he jumps in and out of scenes, such as characters, the cat and his brain-dead elder sister cats roam in and out of a number of odd images: boat, a circus, a desert. in just half an hour they go through a series of semi-sections and installation, which leads me to believe that the director has chosen a number of issues of long Mang adapt randomly, but primarilly selected visually. knowing what is happening, perhaps somewhat increase the score. it reminds me mostly of the type of material that they used to play on MTVAH show, cartoon land, in particular, the short that shows the man chasing the cat cut example of the cheeks around the house. Only in this case the cat resemble HELLO KITTY more and their adventure is expanded to include death and rebirth, as well as a number of other topics [but not all that easy to tell what's going on]. DVD-it has a director's commentary and "manufacturing" functions, but I can not comment on those, because I do not go around them. I give it 8/10 now, there will be a lot to compare it to the anime, and I hope that more like it.
