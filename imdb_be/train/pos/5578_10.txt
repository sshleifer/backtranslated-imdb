Funny and insightful perspective introduction of the world portrayed in the Off Beat comedy first time writer / director Peter M. Cohen. The story unfolds in the four main characters of male meet weekly at a local diner to consult about the troubles of dating. We meet with Brad: beautiful, wall street tramp with a quick wit and a sharp tongue; Zeek: cynical, sensitive writer; Jonathan: sexy perplexed nice guy with an affinity of hand creams and masturbation; Eric: married guy who cherishes his weekly meetings with their single friends in the hope of some enlightenment to him boring and banal marriage. The trials and tribulations of a single man's life in New York appear amusing, mirror, sex in the city and on HBO's new comedy Uma married man, and bring insightful light on the fraudulent. The story takes a twist three singles to meet Mia - wittily plays Amanda Peet, and all fall for her. She seduces them each with his uncanny ability to match individuals they show. When they come to understand that they met and fell in love with the same woman, they chose it for their friendship. Whipped is a realistic portrayal of the world love, one that does not accept criticism. In plain language, they missed the point. The main character is a caricature of real people. Hype, hysteria, mixing satire and humility, and should not be taken as seriously as it implies belittling criticism. Watch this movie, you'll be laughing from beginning to end.
