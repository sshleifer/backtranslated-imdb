This film is SOOOO funny !!! Works perfectly, the Ramones sexy jokes are subtle, and the plot is just something that every high school student wants to do his / her school. I absolutely loved the soundtrack, as well as carefully placed cynicism. If you would like Monty Python, you'll love this movie. This film is a little bit of "GreaseÂ» ESK (without all the annoying songs). The songs that are sung by cute; You may even find yourself singing these songs as soon as the movie until the end. This musical takes the second place in musicals before me (the second near Blues Brothers). But please do not think of it as music per say; seeing how these songs is so nice that it's hard to say, there is an elaborate scene. I think this film as a comedy with a touch of romance. You will be notified about what it was like to be a rebellious teenager; Needless to say, you'll remember your old school days after watching this movie. Especially recommended for families (as it is very young, but also for adults, as there are a lot of jokes that are funnier with age and experience.
