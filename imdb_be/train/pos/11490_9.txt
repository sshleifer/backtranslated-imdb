I watched this movie many years ago, and were looking for him ever since, in my opinion, although it is very crude is very informative as to what the future may hold, I enjoyed the film and to this day is very high rate of pity all those who I disagree but the film should always judge each to their own and, in my opinion, its great the giving it a go with all babies tube cloning and testing that are taking place, who are we to judge this film, it may be a theatrical event that become but there you go. All the horrors of today is so far-fetched, even I laugh, but this one makes me think, and it scares me, as a mother, when I was desperate, I thought I would be twice excuse after watching this movie, but I love this movie to make your own mind whether to watch a movie making- just aknowledge the story and ask yourself how far you are to the child?
