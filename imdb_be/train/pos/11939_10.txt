I always like this great baseball movie! It has a good cast, including two huge actors and two of my favorite Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in the film, Ben Johnson, Fricker Brand, Big Tony Long, Tony Danza, and Matthew McConaughey! Also, Jay O. Sanders, and Dermot Mulroney! The movie has great special effects and acting by all the actors of the film! In baseball scenes are realistic! Music composer Randy Edelman very well, and it fits the film is very good! Some of the actors, which reminded me of the actual baseball person. Ray Mitchell Jackson Stone character reminded me of Royce Clayton, McConaughey character reminded me of Steve Finley, and commentator Jay O. Sanders in My sight reminded how Al Hraboski looks today. This is a fantastic film and not for baseball fans, and I highly recommend this movie!
