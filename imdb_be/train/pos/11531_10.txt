I remember that I was a child, when I first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (perhaps this is the reason why I still remember some of its parts). I do not remember much about the action, nude scenes or other things, but I can remember, the male has his head blown up with a grenade, man divided over a tree and a man run down by a truck and shot in the head :) (Todd Schaefer Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene, when Jennifer McAllister RIPed killer stomach to get the keys to the truck. This is a film that gives you crawl, and it's worth a look. But where do I find it? How can I download?
