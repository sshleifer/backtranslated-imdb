Great movie. Actions - from the doctor to the pavement of the artist to the head hooker, with very few exceptions, it was fine; I thought Soni Razdan (mrs.noble) and Vrazhesh Hirzhi (Saurab) was the best of the lesser-known actors. . Even kurush Desbois (Tehmul), which can be charged with replays, presented quite plausible and familiar character <br /> <br /> Another great thing was the camera work - and how it captures the energy of the Bombay streets ,. gustad calm say his prayers and living in small apartments <br /> <br /> I loved the history of the wall, which becomes a shrine, and then broken down - and artists philosophical take on it. <br /> <br /> It's great to see good films on Indian themes.
