"Hatred per minute" is a hauntingly beautiful film. A psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer, Eric Seaver. Strong performances and great movies make this film, "must see" for any student or horror movie fan. Realism of history and the human side of Eric separate this movie from other psycho-killer movie. Some shout outs film's producer, Bruce Campbell, as well as in the movie «The Evil Dead» to add a little humor for those who know the genre.
