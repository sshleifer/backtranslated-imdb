I'm a big fan of faerie Tale Theater, and I've seen them all, and this is one of the best! It's funny, romantic and classic. I recommend it for all ages. This is great for young children, because it is good, Cinderella and is perfect for adults and adolescents, because it's funny and not overly. I watched it when I was a kid, and I still watch it now. It has great lines, that my family and I quote all the time. The acting is great, and it never gets old. If you love fairy tales and songs you will love it. I watched a lot of film Cinderella at the time, and this is the best of them. (Unfortunately Disney) I highly recommend this movie and all shows Faerie Tale Theater. They all appeal to all ages and are unique and very interesting.
