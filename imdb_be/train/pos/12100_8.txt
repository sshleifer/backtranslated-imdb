For «DVD-Danaza Macabra» (Blood Castle) is very strange. This is because part of the film in French with subtitles, and the others dubbed into English from French. Sometimes the characters switch between them in the middle of the scene! When I tried to get the film to be JUST subtitled or dubbed simply, it does not matter! Surprisingly, but still watchable. <br /> <br /> The story purports to be based on the history of Poe, although I can not remember which one. In fact, the character of Poe appears at the beginning and end of the film. - although it did not look particularly like him <br /> <br /> The rich man makes a bet with the guy down on his success, he can not stay up all night in the style of the house. It looks like a bet to win - even if the house is very terrible. However, this may not be as simple as a rich guy says that all those who had died took the bet - until this fool still wants to make a bet! While in the house, he meets the beautiful Barbara Steele in and falls madly for her. Later, however, he learns that she died more than ten years ago! How can this be? I could tell you more about the story, but I do not want to spoil any of the unknown. Look at yourself, to see the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This film gets very high marks for creating a horrible atmosphere. House, black-and-white cinematography and music work together to make for a scary look of the film. As for the plot, it's interesting - especially because there are a lot of twists and turns - so much that you are wondering who is and who is not one of the undead before the end of the film <br /> <br /. > The only negative is that I was sorry for the poor snake, who was killed in vain. Crazy as it may seem, I'm sorry about it, and it is hardly necessary. <br /> <br /> In addition, parents can know that the end is a bit of nudity. Surprisingly beautiful woman is topless, but it is hardly necessary for the story.
