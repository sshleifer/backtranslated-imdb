With so taboo about love? People seem to have serious problems with transgenered. <br /> <br /> The title of the film does not catch my eye. It was a grainy shot about 4 minutes in the film is what made me stop surfing channel. I could not believe how freaking awesome this movie was. It affects so many levels of human emotions, that it never fails to move me in some way. This is definitely one of the best independent films I've ever seen. I did not consider these characters as both sexes, just a man. I would recommend it for anyone who loves cinema. Especially independent films. Praise all intrepid filmmakers!
