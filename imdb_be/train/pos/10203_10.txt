I love movies and my own comics, comic books are different, the film, but all the same I would give it 10 out of 10. It was awesome. When movies got more bizarre. I would have her children. And I'm a woman. Read the comics you will not regret it. Yes, in this film, as Brian P. artist for her death, we do not get nearly as good work of art. I mean seriously do not get me wrong, these people have done great, but different versions to different people. Different Strokes for different folks, as they say. Any person who does not go bonkers over it crazy, do not like women, or you know, just plan crazy. If I could count on the fingers, as in love, and how many times I read comics, I ran out of fingers for sure, but hey there is always the fingers.
