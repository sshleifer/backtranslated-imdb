The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Overview: After an exciting set of two, we get the final installment. Here's my take: <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum is all. We have a Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the coattails of those who know it all. He is already working for too long. At this time, it ends. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has a great story, a strange handwriting, fantastic direction, suspense, and some of the best performances of the summer. Matt Damon delivers perhaps his best performance to date. He has belief and desire swelling troubled killer. <br /> <br /> There are some clever humor here and some great suspense. Reactions to certain events will have you or laugh (in a good way), or cheering. (Or both), I heard a lot of intellectual laughter in the theater and a lot of applause. The crowd was loving it. <br /> <br /> Bourne Ultimatum delivers all beautifully gift wrapped package. All the goods and then some. This, in my opinion, the best film of the summer <br /> <br /> The last word :. Excellent output. The best of the trilogy. It's like a summer thriller movie should be made. I love the Bourne trilogy.
