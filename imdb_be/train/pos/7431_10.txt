I was very entertaining movie. It was my favorite movie is constantly 1976. Being raised in the 70s, I was so in love with Kris Kristoffersons appearance and behavior, of course, I'm not a film critic, but during the time period, I think it was very good. I very much like a combo Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well together. I've seen in movies many times and still love the two of them, as Esther and John Norman. I'm a big fan of Chris and see him in concert, whenever I can. Which is a talented singer-songwriter, not to mention actor. I saw him in many movies, but still remember the star is born.
