This film is an absolute classic for the camp. That's why it was Elvira and MST3000 classic. Everyone knows the story. Scientist holds his girlfriend's head alive in a pan of lasagna in the basement of his home when he is traveling the city and tries to find her body, checking the local chicken. Finally, he finds a real body hourglass head scarred face chicken on top. Severed head on friendly terms with a failed experiment in the closet and Conehead comes out of the toilet and rest breaks "good" helper hand (his other not with the early failure of the scientist), and the whole place burns down. <br /> <br /> in the film scared us so much as children, that my friend would not go into the basement of his home for a year after seeing it. As a child, we were rating the scary movies of all time, and this one was number four. Only one of those scary movies was really no good (original "PhantomÂ».) <br /> <br /> I had to give this film a huge number seven ranking entertainment value it offers. His terrible effect because of poor production and strange sexual angle, when a scientist looks at the body (complete with a porn soundtrack) throw themselves with innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make it a superior material for viewing talking and laughing. I could watch this movie today and enjoy it while I would go to the dentist than watch "Chicago" again. <br /> <br /> The seven most I can give because its fun value just luck. The film, like the movie, it's a disaster.
