I am pleased to be able to say almost only positive things about the film with Carp and sisters Tasuiev, Renaissance <br /> <br /> And in the first place, that it looks as it should look. adventure for boys, the Renaissance is a story about a police investigation in search of a missing young scientist ?? Ilona Tasuiev, geneticist and researcher of Avalon. <br /> <br /> The Tale Karas, Ilona and Bislane it, though much less well known than the SIN-City, the best film, and one more appreciated by connoisseurs. it will be even more important for the supporters of French comics (I have made my French collection comic last week, although I'm not so ?? to date ??). The atmosphere, the music, the characters and their lines, the plot is all nice and wins. Paris top cop Karas, appears to find a young woman who was a rising star in the medical ?? genetic studies, Ilona Tasuiev ?? mildly hot blonde whose rebellious sister Bislane was erotic preferable, I think. <br /> <br /> For me oldie fan of comic books and TV series, The Renaissance, an amazingly beautiful cartoon, looked like a replay of the episode WILD WILD WEST ?? Here, the mythological past is replaced by the same mythological future ?? more exhausted and jaded, but, in a sense, as well as exciting. Renaissance is not in suspense; and do not look particularly good ?? pace; but this deception and sleeping pills. In addition, it reaches the drawing, albeit briefly, the world, the real world ?? and we think of Avalon, Nakata, by Jonas Muller, sister Tasuiev and Goran, Farfella, and Karas spoke of his early childhood in the Kasbah ?? I liked the feel of the hotel The Renaissance, a certain softness and friendliness and adventurous, as well as professional, kind guaranteed; Among these new cartoons, this Dick adaptation Linklater (--the only and the first adaptation of Dick ever--) stood out for me as a work of beauty and genuine excitement. <br /> <br /> I thought that was a futuristic device is appropriate and, if not normal, bright terrible (like invisibility suits). <br /> <br /> both desirable characters have exotic names like Bislane and Farfella, mainly collected from the art world and the entertainment (Goran and Ilona. and Naghib ??) <br /> <br /> Nobody It does not seem to have noticed that the poster features a Renaissance Rourke Double ?? that guy Marv; that does not make him SIN CITY rip - off, but does not sample any originality, but in fact there are similarities with Miller's story ?? namely grim futuristic look rotten society, the liveliness of the hero (actually cross the nature and person of Willis Rourke in the previous film ??) ?? On the other hand, the animation breathes more public air, straight up to the top adventurous, and, in a word, it is like SIN CITY for children ?? Well, naughty children, I mean, because there is little obnazhenok display. For what I said, it could be argued that the features mentioned are characterized as clich√©s and platitudes futuristic look more adult comics; the truth, and it was a little old Miller brought that thing on the screen and rebirth are some similarities here and there. Now it is also true that each should have its RING ERAGORN, because every sin city, its revival. I admit, at that time I was not indifferent to these grim futuristic tales, rather unassuming specialty.
