This is a great movie for a female body builder and action fans! I think Sue Price did a great job in this film series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. It has a very bright appearance and iron will to withstand powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). Although the film is not a big value and acting C Price's not the best thing that ever met in my life, the film itself was something amazing, priceless boon for the female fans of action bodybuilder! Well, some of the Nemesis 2 have been copied by other well-known science fiction films such as Terminator and Predator, but it is not important. The fact that A.Puyn cast in this movie very talented bodybuilder, who put all his energy and talent of the body to show us the best that it can do. I really enjoyed the film and watched with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (rather dull continued) and Nemesis 4 (much more interesting than a sequel to 3). It is a pity that it is not indicated on the DVD :-(
