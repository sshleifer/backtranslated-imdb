The film is like a bushing for the "immoral study." Most of all, I have never been strongly linked with a burning need for a female artist to immortalize a man naked and, therefore, all that fuss, "Now, who drew this term?" I sounded a bit gratuitous. The dialogues in this film is quite scary, but visually the film got its moments. I dig about it when Tassi was painting a mental picture, but then the film weered back on the penis. Especially recommended for those who have not seen in a while.
