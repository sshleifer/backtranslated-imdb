Well, I saw it in the theaters when it came out, and I do not know why. I have not seen him since, but I ended up on this page, because I was thinking about this film - again, I do not know why. . But the fact that I can remember, it says a lot <br /> <br /> Comedy is hard - much harder than any drama. Doing it right does it seem easy, but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin note, you fall into this category again for some reason. <br /> <br /> Elvira Mistress of the Dark, to be done right for me to remember this movie fondly. Done at a rapid pace, with tongue in cheek, and knowing that it is not Philedelphia story, she entertains from start to finish. . Dukes is another who fits into this category (without most gratuitous tits jokes) <br /> <br /> One point of contention - ending. It seems that the writers / director did not have the slightest idea on how to complete the comedy. The ending is trying to be a love story, somewhat undermines nimble rapidly developing dialogue up to this point. Then there is the «Tassle» scene. While this should be seen (man's opinion), so the top and ridiculous it as a shock. needed another rewritten for endings. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy genius like Spinal Tap or manufacturer, or the Holy Grail. But if you do not try to split it up and just let puns and juicy fun come to you, you will laugh, I guarantee it.
