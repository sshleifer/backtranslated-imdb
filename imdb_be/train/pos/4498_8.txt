Francesco Ennis, Michael Kitchen and Robson Green !! Wow, what a trio of ... OK, so it's not Anna Karenina, but it's a good love story is very well written and well acted all. Even a few "laugh out loud" moments mixed with some pretty serious reservations on the accuracy, age bias and aging / problems of Alzheimer's parents. <br /> <br /> unusual guitar music added to the story as well. <, Br /> <br /> while I was a fan of Ms. Ennis as "Lily" (in the 70s) and Mr. kitchen as "Pirates" and "the Enchanted April," I have only recently discovered, Mr. green ( "I and Mrs. Jones", "Touch of evil", etc.), causing me to ask the question - why only I have not seen "Reckless" until recently ?? !! The truth is more "chick flick" than a man will sit until the end, it is ideal for a lazy viewing rainy afternoon.
