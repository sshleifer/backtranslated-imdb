In the seemingly endless quest to find a well-made, well acted horror movies, it's all too rare to find one that even comes remotely close to the impact assessment. Itself to say, I was very pleasantly surprised when I came across the "burned at the stake," the US cable network while I was flipping channels. The room is quite simple. In 1692, the young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the most active witness against alleged witches, leveling baseless accusations against those who earn their displeasure. Manipulate it for their own purposes is Reverend Parris (Peters), who also serves as a court guidance on issues related to witchcraft and Satanism. Things get complicated when Anne start blaming family member Goode witchcraft. Salem (1980 or so), Loreen Graham (also plays Swift) begins to have unusual vision shortly before she visits Salem Witch Museum. Amazing man in the clothes of the seventeenth century, trying to stick it out there and building. He continues to haunt her when strange things begin to attract it more and more. Soon it becomes clear that she becomes obsessed with the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, no further description is sufficiently complex and would give too much. Although the film is not action-oriented, and is likely to be of little interest to many audiences, performances are good and the seventeenth century, the dialogue is used in many memories of the film sounds very convincing. Production values ​​are solid with the possible exception of some special effects. As a side note, the technical consultant of the film was Laurie Cabot, the official witch of Salem. The audience, who appreciate well made, atmospheric but understated horror can appreciate it. Writer / director Bert I. Gordon, had a long career in the horror and science fiction movie and is best known for his work on a number of "big mistake" films and other similar works years earlier.
