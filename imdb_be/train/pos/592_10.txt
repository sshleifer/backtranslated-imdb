In Arlington Heights, IL, we have never had the cafeteria or in one of the primary schools (1961), so I was riding my bike home from school for lunch and have always watched this game. However, I was 11, but I thought it was the biggest thing on! I would make the hidden pictures on my board and see if my family or friends could find him. I also remember winning other than cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile), if the participant has received the final game hidden image. I even had a homemade version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game lasted so long. I enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures - the only one I could ever have been a lemon hidden as part of a bridge over the stream garden <br /> <br /> Really good memories associated with Camouflage ..
