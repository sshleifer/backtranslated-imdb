40-year-old VIRGO (2005) ****, Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Hysterical funny high concept comedy about the title Andy Stitzer (superbly played by perennial second banana Karel in a really very comical performance breakthrough assured stratosphere it to the A-list), Rep of technical services for the electronics store in Southern California, who learned of his trio of well-intentioned yet secretive identity completely ignorant corruption naparnitsy shortstop (Rudd, Malco & Roguin each one degree ridiculous than the other) is determined to get them one virginity regardless of cost. Below is hardly still very responsive lively affair with the mother (Keener wonderful having a lot of fun here) leading, to add more fuel to the fire inside Andy. Surprisingly good and courageous inexcusable bawdy romantic comedy; the funny thing, since "There Something About Mary" with live shrewdly scripted director Judd Apatow and Carell, which features some amazing gut busting sequences, including bitingly accurate David Caruso joke, homophobic debunking fins, sending up "data and -paloozas' and demystifying the battle of the sexes with brazen arrogance. The true winner and classic; the funniest movie of the year.
