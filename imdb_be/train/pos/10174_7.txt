It was another message of the Second World War soldiers and allies to be careful about spreading rumors. They were called "instructional" cartoons, because it was a mix of serious posts with funny-looking main character named "Pvt. Snafu ». <br /> <br /> We all have representation, along with fears and what-have-you, and this is what is happening here as Pvt. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two, so that he hears and comes with "five". You can start to panic and all kinds of natural disasters, if you distribute enough rumors and enough people believe them. This includes the loss of trust in your home and your business, as shown here, in this cartoon. A good way to lose the war to demoralize the enemy. This is still done today. <br /> <br /> «We lost the war," says one big folly near the end of this cartoon. It's amazing how some Americans still have not learned. This cartoon can be 65 years old, but it sure is important today. As I write this, there were two terrorist bombings in Europe today, and some people still think that the "war on terror" is just a bumper sticker slogan. Strange. <br /> <br /> The author, a well-known "Dr. Suess' uses the analogy of« Hot Air Balloon Juice »here to present the above message. With Theodor Geisel (his real name), you know the rhyme is reasonable. HN <br /> <br /> Nothing funny here, but it was not to be. You have to understand the climate in 1943 and justified paranoia that was there during the Second World War. People forget that the war could have easily wound up on the other side wins. It was a busy time
