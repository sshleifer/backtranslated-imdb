Series 2 has got off to a great start! I do not think that you need to watch a series of 1 to get an understanding of what is happening, but as any of his series of nice to feel some sense of the characters and care about what happens to them. And it makes you think a show like this! This April 30-something women, it seems, are glamorous and exciting life is still room believable and realistic. Thus, the twists and turns that come from their love and sexual life are fun to watch, but you know that these are problems that happen to real women, too. Its about the decisions we make as a woman and as sometimes we are led down the concrete ways in our lives, not consciously make that choice!
