Matthau and George Burns just work well together. Acidity Willy surprised amnesia Al is a mixture made in heaven. The scene when they meet again in the apartment villa is a gem, and the final scene of the film rounds off to perfection. Matthau gives excellent performance as a hot-tempered semi-retired comic as soon as it can, and intonation in the voice exaggerated dramatic coupled with its general misunderstanding of what is happening on a large shape characteristic. George Burns was hampered time legendary and was nowhere better than in this film, his calm self-assurance with desert dry responses are stored. Watch for the scene near the end, when Al and his daughter something to ask the Spanish overseer, and the reaction of Allah - is priceless.
