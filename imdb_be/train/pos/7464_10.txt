He made me think about it for a few days after seeing it. For me this is a sign of great cinema. Squint had the same effect on me. I'm tired of these people who are in need of these cookie-cutter Hollywood happy endings. I plan to go to see him again tonight, to understand the story a little better - but no matter, the emotional message of the film was fully felt.
