Mario Lanza, of course, «The Great Caruso» in this film one thousand nine hundred fifty-one also starring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz Ludwig Donath. This is a very fictionalized biography of the legendary, world-famous tenor, whose name is known even today. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully made and the music is beautiful and beautifully sung Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotny, Blanche Teba and other opera stars who appeared in the film. If you purists, seeing people on the stage, smiling during a sextet from "Lucia" will strike you odd - even if his wife Dorothy Caruso's just a girl. In addition, it is very unlikely that Caruso never sang Edgardo in Lucia; the role of lay too high for him. <br /> <br /> When taking dramatic license, the script leaves some very dramatic part of the life of Caruso. What was so wonderful about him is that he actually created roles in operas, which are now in the standard repertoire, but it is never mentioned in the film. These include the role of Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in "Girl of the Golden West," There is a famous photo of him posing with a letter wrapped around him like a toga. The reason for this photo? His shirt was only in underwear. He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long-standing partnership with the Victor Talking-Machine Company (later RCA Victor). He sang Jose in Carmen at the San Francisco earthquake in the night. <br /> <br /> Instead, the story MGM has basically he dies on stage during a performance of Martha, which never happened. He was bleeding during the «L'Elisir d'Amore» MET could not finish the job; He only had time to three more times in the MET, his last role of Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentine - peritonitis. His first role in the MET Sun Radames in Aida, as shown in the film, but the Duke in Rigoletto. So when he says that on the screen, "suggested Dorothy Caruso biography of her husband," that's what it was - suggested. What is true is that Dorothy's father disowned her after her marriage and left her $ 1, with its massive property. In addition, they had a daughter together Gloria (who died at age 79 on 2007/07/10). Nevertheless, Caruso had four other children, his mistress before he married Dorothy <br /> <br /> Some people say that Lanza's voice is amazing how Caruso, but just listen to Caruso in the film "Match Point "-. Caruso's voice strangely unlike Lanza-x. In fact, from its sound, if he wanted to, Caruso could sing as a baritone. He is believed to have had some trouble with the high notes, further evidence of the propensity baritone; and the role that he was preparing when he died, was Othello, dramatic tenor role that Lanza was not determined. Voice Lanza deserved can not be compared with another. He made a unique contribution to film history by popularizing opera music. He sings the music in «The Great Caruso» with reliable energy; it really is at the peak of what would be a short career. Its effect is natural and real. Ann Blyth beautiful as Dorothy and gets to sing a little himself. <br /> <br /> In fact the film to opera lovers and Lanza fans who are probably one and the same.
