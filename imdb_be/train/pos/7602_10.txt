The first season was strange, the whole idea of ​​adjusting them to the island, while the secrets have been studied (and saw) was phenomenal; filled with the unknown, that climaxes and an amazing story. I mean, I love the whole idea just to see them get used to the island. And then the first they saw the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention. Since then I was hooked the second season was right on par with the 1st season, just a little bit better. I absolutely loved the idea hatches and Dharma. The whole plot and sequence of Season 2 were mysterious, horrific and fascinating. I loved all the uncertainty surround the others on the island, but the story really did DHARMA season 2 countries. <br /> <br /> Season 3 was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but, nevertheless, high. I loved to see the back stories of others, seeing their camp, and seeing the secrets of further study. ( "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, though not so good, is still breathtaking and fun, but most of all fun! Now, the fourth season. I had hopes for this season, and 1 pair of episodes we're good, but then it really started to get boring and monotonous. I mean, I really despise the new "rescuer", such as Miles and Daniel. The site is outdated after the first two episodes ... and most of all .... Season 4 has been stripped away from something, made a series of half-received perfect: mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (Charlie left) and general excitement. In addition, some of my favorite characters were.
