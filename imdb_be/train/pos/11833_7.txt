White people + progress + industrialization = BAD. First Nations + nature + animals = GOOD. A simple formula. In fact, in the last days is the same propaganda was used to protect the status quo; Now it is used for an attack on him. However, that being said, I think the film really succeeds in overcoming the beaten politicization, because he plays on the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone. You can not be foolish players revisionism film about how the West was won, I lost eras. But anyone can feel a sense of nostalgia for the days when horses can run free on the western plains. (The film is also conveniently avoids the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there). Anyway, I liked it. Quality animation - especially the first shot - it's incredible.
