I did not have too much interest in watching Lau Flock.Andrew co-directed a masterpiece trilogy Infernal Affairs, but he was dismissed from the herd, and he was replaced at an extraordinary director named Niels Mueller.I had the feeling that Lau made a good movie, but he did not meet the study so they fired him and hired another director.This usually does not work (let us remember the invasion) .A flock resulted to be better than what I expected.It is not a great movie, but it's an interesting and entertainment thriller.The character development is very well done, and I could know x araktary very well.Also, the relationship between the two protagonists is a natural and credible.Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring competent performances.Now, let's move on to the negative points.One element that really bothered me (there was a moment in which he irritated me) was a surplus edition gimmicks to give the film more "attitude" and style.That tricks to feel ridiculous an d their presence arbitrary.Plus, I think the film should have been more ambitious.In in spite of everything, I recommend the herd as a good thriller.It not remember at all, but it's interesting.
