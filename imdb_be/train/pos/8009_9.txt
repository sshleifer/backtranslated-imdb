Oh, these memories. I lived in the Netherlands, at the time, and eagerly forward to it every Sunday evening and later on Tuesday. I saw it during my 14-16s. Very good for my (at the school) English and Dutch TV provides subtitles in other languages, for children show these days but. Thus, you would hear the original voice and language. - Best Series were the first three of them, and then after the third series, the great hero, a Nazi background Zhelb that was so terrible enemy, disappeared from the series (I do not think they ever really caught him, he always escaped, leaving place to again appear in the next story), because, obviously, the series was also distributed in Germany, and the Nazi enemy will not go on very well! Too bad, because Geoffrey Thun did such a wonderful job convincing drawing clever Nazi aristocrat, I had this constant obsession to avenge England. It was a true pleasure to see this kind of high-quality work in the youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt has been a good colleague and young people as normal. They were very plausible to me at the time and as a child I could only imagine to be a part of these young people who were at that time about four years older than me. It was a very exciting series for me, standing out in my memory that time as a special show with "Prisoner" as well. I hope that they will publish good quality DVD series, it would be very good. Even bad copies around still nice to look at. Later series were not so good, watered down and just not as much fun as the first three. We hope that they will also find other series with Von Gelb put on DVD. Greetings from Canada.
