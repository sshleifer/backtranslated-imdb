Hole, novel, was forced on me in the course of study. I do not think I would like a children's story; plus another couple of books that I had to read in class was very bad. But to my surprise, I absolutely loved the opening. This is truly one of the most well-written novels I've ever read. I think this is a rare quality that makes it attractive for pre-teens, teens and adults. Everyone who reads this, I think it will take more people. While I can not quite say that for the film, I am pleased to say that they got it mostly right. I do not think the audience will leave the film as enriched, but they will certainly be fun, no side effect to be more stupid than when they sat down. This intellectual history, and it is very well said. I think that moves a little too fast. The novel takes more time to develop the characters. And memories come and so quickly that they are not too long to register. Interracial romance in the past feels more clich√©s and banal than it does in the novel. And the ending, which binds together all the loose threads, it seems very funny. This is exactly the same in the novel, but there is a sense of the absurd, that it was not there in the film. It works much better. I also do not like a lot of pop songs. I wish Disney did not feel such a need to sell the soundtrack. Throw embracing board excellent, from small children to old pros. Jon Voight is particularly high. Not quite sure why we should Catwoman and Fonze, though. 9/10.
