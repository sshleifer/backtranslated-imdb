This is one of my favorite Govinda movies of all time and the best film of 1994 by David Dhawan does a great job in directing this film, he makes it fun and add a family drama. Govinda Excellent Baba Raj and gives a great performance. Karishma Kapoor actress I hate this movie it's a little less annoying, but still annoying in some scenes. Kader Khan is the maestro in action, yet provides excellent performance. Aroona Iran is terrific as the mother and gives high performance. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant as Nandu sidekick. This film is a comedy, action, family drama and the novel entirely on the entertainer.
