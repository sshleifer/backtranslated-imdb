I saw this film on several different occasions. I think one of the most fun things to do this is to simply observe the reaction of different types of people who go to see it <br /> <br /> Type 1 :. Old. Many older Japanese men and women to go to this movie, because they think that it will be an honest-to-goodness samurai film with a lot of fencing and medieval Japanese dialogue. As soon as the two main characters begin to discuss horror, almost accidentally inserting abuse throughout their offers, old people leave, usually hideous <br /> <br /> Type 2 :. FILM snobs. These people think that just because the film is a label «Independent», it will automatically load of hard-to-follow, overemotional shit that may or may not be in English. However, they see it anyway just sing about it later, so that people will think that they are intelligent and cultured. They are really a surprise when they see this film. As soon as the blood begins to inject exaggerated anime-inspired sword battles or over-the-top villain carefree tie the dog with his crossbow during a call, these people would be very concerned about, they will leave. A few will only see "how bad it will get", and then they will rave about that terrible movie that your friends <br /> <br /> Type 3 :. PEOPLE WAITING TO SEE LIVE-ACTION anime or matrix-LIKE effects. Sorry people, martial arts is quite hard in the film, but the director Yamasato does not have a budget for this kind of thing <br /> <br /> Type 4 :. People with no expectations. These are the people who really enjoy the film. If they had only heard about the blood of the Samurai, picked it randomly, or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze, these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the film for what it ultimately is: ENTERTAINMENT . This film was made to enlighten and provoke a deep spiritual thought it was meant (if I may borrow a line of dialogue from the film), "to really kick ass." And that's what he's doing <br /> <br /> Therefore, depending on what kind of person you are, you may or may not enjoy this film. However, if you appreciate the movie for what it is, and can enjoy an excess of blood and action, and then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friend.
