Use of Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting selection. Perhaps he was the most talented comedian silent age. This gives him an opportunity to show those talents in a little story of time travel. He hooked a guy living in our time, and it becomes obvious that we are best left Keaton now able to do his gags very well. I have not heard his voice. I think he did some of the Beach Party movies, playing some blank characters to earn a few dollars. Serling, it seemed respect to it and it thus depicted. This is not a bad story. It shows how one reacts, if we want something we do not get it, and desire.
