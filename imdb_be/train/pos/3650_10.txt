Sometimes Lady Luck smiles at me. I originally did - and copied - a videotape of this remarkable television presentation. I was heartbroken when I realized that I did, because I could not get a copy of it elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Recently, I signed up for digital cable, and when looking through the upcoming films, there my surprise was scheduled to broadcast the film. This time, however, I made a copy of this DVD, so there's no chance to repeat my mistakes. <br /> <br /> I finally see him again after eight years, and it was just as exciting and tense when I first saw it. There is a bit of a prelude to this story is that my first contact with the "Watches Pandora" came with a live reading of the book on public radio. I just went to tune to a radio station on my way home for lunch, and with the first installment, I was hooked. Every day I looked forward to the next chapter to read. <br /> <br /> When I found out a few months later, the book will be broadcast on television, in the movies, I made sure to clear my schedule for this event. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the film has been very faithful to the book, contrary to what another reviewer said. This in itself is a rare achievement for-TV movies. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about the casting. I could not imagine a better choice for the captain of Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the film could have crashed and burned without proper gypsum this key role. Anderson has never been better, and it's a shame that we did not see him anymore. . In fact, all members of the cast did an excellent job <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the movie - and books - was the interjection "terrorist plot" to equip the private business jet with air-to-air missiles, and have your pilot stalk and shoot down the stricken plane. Basically, we are talking about less than 36 hours to organize and execute a plan like this, and people who are just not realistic at all considering all the players who participate. Furthermore, it was not realistic as small airplane problems are associated with the first, then two of its engines blown. <br /> <br /> This is a side of beef, I enjoyed building suspense and found very believable as a reaction to foreign governments were depicted in the film, as well as our own. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see this movie, do it by all means.
