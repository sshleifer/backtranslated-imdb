Strange role, Eddie Murphy to take the peak of his career. While there are a lot of "Eddie Murphy's character," he plays a really decent man. The rest of the cast is good, especially the lovely Charlotte Lewis. beauty and serenity of her character kept the tone of the film from getting too much Murphy.
