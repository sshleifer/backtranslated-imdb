Anyone who thinks that anime is not other than the sex and violence will be silent forever after watching this movie. This is a great film that tells the story of the search for Tetsuro to avenge the death of his mother, but also grows in the process. Traveling by train is a kind of journey Tetsuro from adolescence to maturity. Music and visual style of the film a little dated (you can say that this 70-film), and the animation is only slightly better than the average episode of "Star Blazers". But the story and the characters are so strong that it does not really matter. A must-see for any fan of animation!
