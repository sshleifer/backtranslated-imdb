I love cartoons. They can show that films with a "real" actors and the scenery can not - even though the computer effects change that more and more. They can extend the boundaries of satire ( «The Simpsons»), good taste ( 'South Park'), spectacle ( "Aladdin"), or reality ( 'Toy Story'). There are some good examples in «Ice Age», for example, when we see a motley herd is now extinct mammals migrate through the countryside, chatting like old friends. Such scenes are nice to look at how we get a sense of both familiar and strange at the same time, as a rule, in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the top animated films of all time, this is a very funny film. Relax, enjoy the deliberate anachronisms different backgrounds and belly laughs. <br /> <br /> The story follows a grumpy mammoth Manfred, Sid, and Diego stupid sloth, and saber-toothed tigers, because they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. Along the way, of course, they have a whole lot of problems. Also appearing for the trip is Scrat, the hapless rodent stories, which is desperately trying to bury an acorn in the winter: in the glaciers on top of dead trees in the ice caves. Its opening scene is a classic. <br /> <br /> This is a simple story with a very predictable end and the middle, it's just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments of the bargain, but some scenes, such as swaddling or The Dodos, funny, animals, cute, and it looks good . There is a very touching moment and when the rock carvings of mammoths come to life before the eyes of Manfred. <br /> <br /> You do not have to see, but it's good fun for an hour or so. <br /> <br /> 7/10
