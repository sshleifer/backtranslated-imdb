One of the all time great works of science fiction, as a visionary and thought-provoking as Blade Runner or even Brazil's own Gilliam. Willis gives his best performance here, but he surpassed all incredibly hectic Pete did not look like he did before or since. Even Stowe is not out of his league here, though. The story is very layered and offers a lot to think about. A highlight scene beautifully gorgeous, and the last lines fit perfectly. Scenes in a psychiatric hospital, are terrible and yet so funny in his own way. A lot of black humor on display here. Fantastic design and manufacture accordingly strange cinematography. In my top ten.
