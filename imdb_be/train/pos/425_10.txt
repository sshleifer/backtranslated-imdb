I would like to comment on the movie April Love. This is one of my favorite, because my father, Nelson Malone plays a horse trainer. I distinctly remember when Hollywood came to Lexington, Kentucky, where we lived at that time, to make April Love. My dad was in many plays and was a talented man. I talked about to try for one of the bit parts offered, and lo and behold he came home w / script. How great is that! In addition, a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes - especially those that are displayed in the amusement park. This is a very nostalgic every April, when I see a movie being shown once again, and the song April Love Pat Boone is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of times long gone, when you see the movies they make today w / all over the floor, swearing and violence. It would be nice to see more films, on April Love back in the spotlight ...
