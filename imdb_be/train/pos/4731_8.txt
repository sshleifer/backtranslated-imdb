This is definitely one of the best efforts of the jet. Few actors can play a stoic like Jet Li can. Hasty action and special effects are immunized intensity targets. As a result, it may take a little surprise Americans. Suspension of disbelief a little goes a long way in the movie Jet Li. I feel that this is an excellent introduction to Jet work and looks forward to further masterpieces (especially Fist of Legend), making it to the US market. A good mixture of shooting and physical conflict satisfy most enthusiasts action flick.
