Wow. What a surprise. Although the flaws, it is much better than I expected. <br /> <br /> The new space ship Arcturus with some 3,000 passengers in the last days of his sixteen days of the trip to Jupiter. Without warning, the ship's cerebral (central computer) emergency alarm sounds and all orders to evacuate. <br /> <br /> In the near future, only a handful of people who were left, including one of astrogators ship (of Penny), captain (the Cary), and the director of a shipping line (Kenyon). <br /> <br /> it turns out that the alarm was false, and that the basic cerebral functions <br /> <br /> chaotic. The rest of the passengers and crew members have to run the ship and <br /> <br /> avoid personal conflicts in order to survive. <br /> <br /> The film starts very well. Opening of a commercial very nice touch. There are obvious parallels with 2001: A Space Odyssey and the historical <br /> <br /> sinking of the Titanic. The film makes the slow and sometimes stepping <br /> <br /> problems, but, as a rule, well done and well acted.
