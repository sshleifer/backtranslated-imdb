Weird, witty, and an excellent image of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall wrote something that is funny, sometimes foreboding and scary! Yes, do not be fooled on 2point4 children's fun and bubbly tune characters; the show has a dark side, and sometimes can be quite intimidating. And it's something that is so good about the show is not just a simplification of Sitko, where every character is a 2D-comic device (the case with my family). Instead of characters fully rounded individuals who show a complete roller coaster ride of human emotions. At the time of dark moments, such as the future Bill supposedly haunts the curse and Ben wakes up in a strange village two examples show, taking a surreal, dark twist that will add a bit of depth. Of course, the show is also incredibly funny, and it's guaranteed to make you smile. It's a real shame Eureka Video has stopped releasing this funny Gold on DVD.
