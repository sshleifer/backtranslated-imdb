This neat crime drama that packs a lot in his 65 minutes of work time. It has all the right ingredients - a detective corpse tired old cop Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his debut sidekick Tobin (John Miles), shadow killer to liberty and even the love interest in the Tobin in the form of a woman botanist Mary (Patricia Wright), which helps to solve crime. There's also a terrific shootout final, which takes place in the courtyard of stonecutter. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the stunning Loch at the beginning of the film, where Lieutenant Corrigan refers to the dead woman as Â«Tatooed Tilly" before the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo (confusing right?). In addition, later, when Tobin pursues the killer's back yard, he suddenly mentioned going in the wrong direction, at some point - it is not surprising that he did not catch it!
