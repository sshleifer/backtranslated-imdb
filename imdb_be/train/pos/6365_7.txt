It is very derivative film will be interesting to many people who have not seen some of the more obscure films anima. I enjoyed most of them, especially after the first few minutes of fairly flat in the museum (though the sequence of pre-name is very interesting and includes some of the best animation of bits). James Garner as commander and Leonard Nimoy as the king give impressive performances.
