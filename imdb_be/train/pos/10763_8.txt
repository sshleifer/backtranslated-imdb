I must admit I was very skeptical about this documentary. I expected it to be a kind of All American propaganda, that we here in Europe do not like so much. I was wrong. This is not propaganda, in fact it is hardly a political general. <br /> <br /> It reflects the events of 9/11 eyes of firefighters called to the scene only after the planes crashed. This is an amazing coinsidence, that this film was made at all! This film was originally shot as a rookie documnetary NY Fire becomes a "person." We can only thank the filmmakers that they continued their work during the terrible trials that face them. <br /> <br /> great piece of work. Absolutely stunning stuff. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Best regards,
