Well the main reason, I tuned in to watch this movie, because it was made by Trey Parker and Matt Stone from South Park fame. However, as soon as the film started laughter erupted from my belly. From subtle gestures aside jokes to whoever is calling toilet humor in all, along with the constant support to some very clever insinuations. This film can ruin event he mans the stern impenetrable face, not to mention his poker underwear. Some of the most ridiculous blink and you miss him joke never portrayed in Hollywood, along with the constant criticism of ourselves thrown into the bargain. <br /> <br /> I just go to show that not only the Trey Parker proficient in writing it is not too shabby in the old acting either. I was surprised with the amount that I was captured in this film. However, I am very concerned that he is not available for purchase over the Internet, here in the UK. Understand the boys! <br /> <br /> I am, and will continue to show it to all your friends pointing annoyingly funny bits, and occasionally snorted in my lounger. Overall, a great movie, if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. However, if you do not have a sense of humor about stupid or rude things, stay away! Nevertheless, I believe that the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Blyth Would you gurgle past these prejudices.
