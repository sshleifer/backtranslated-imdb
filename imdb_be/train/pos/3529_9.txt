Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) unjustly accused of the murder of his unfaithful wife. At night she was killed, he was with the mystery woman who refused to give him his name. Once accused of murdering police to visit all the places that he was with her, but people only remember him alone. . He was sentenced to death and his secretary (Ella Raines) sets out to find the killer himself, because she loves him <br /> <br /> This was done as a B film from Universal (look at the actors - all the actors and the nature of one star - Franchot Tone - a downturn). The budget was small and the cast mostly unknown, but what happened is one of the best film noir of the 1940s. This beautifully directed Siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from the excellent book by William Irish (pseudonym for Woolrich). It moves quickly and simply looks fantastic. And there's the infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr., who just comes to the screen with an incredible sexual energy (I'm surprised that the censors do not cut). <br /> <br /> There are only a few drawbacks that prevent it from being perfect. Tonnes gives a terrible performance. He looks awful and it is awful. Curtis also tough and fresh as Henderson. Do you really wonder why Raines love him - he is objective. But Raines pretty well in the leading role. She is beautiful and full of life. In addition, the last scene, when the killer after she never rings true. He was almost a threat physically and her reaction just seems too high <br /> <br /> However, I give it 9 A really great movie. - flaws in the side.
