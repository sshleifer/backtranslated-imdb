I saw this film in the worst circumstances. I've already missed the 15 minutes, when I woke up to it on international flights between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was watching, I might have thought that it was a movie of the week, but quickly became focused on the performance of the lead role played by the young woman, the child was abducted. A prerequisite for the start to take a turn and turns I did not see coming and the final credits I scramble through the guide in flight, to figure out what I just watched. It turns out that I was late opening Jeon Do It, which would have won Best Actress at Cannes for her role. I do not know when Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema, but I go to the DVD store to learn more.
