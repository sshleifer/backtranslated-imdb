Among the elements that make it the best at the moment, I have to say, # 1 is Christine McIntyre. Scene Shemp, when poisoned, and her reaction is really great. I believe that, as one poster suggested, Christina tries not to laugh during this scene, but it actually made her seem even more evil magic to be smiling, perhaps dying. <br /> <br Shemp /> in another character, which helps it stand out is Goon. His eyes were big and horrible cross between comedy lohom-ball. Hardly a character, I would choose to meet in a dark alley or, for that matter, anywhere. I would like a bit of a detective mystery novel in this, but hey, if the short is good, who is going to complain. Nya I.
