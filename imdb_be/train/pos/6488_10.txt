War is hell. But this documentary about the Second World War the heavens. <br /> <br /> Not only is this series of dizzying, almost exhaustive look at the World War II, it is a poetic masterpiece clearly and beautifully told Laurence Olivier. <, Br /> <br /> This documentary series defines the genre. This is generally a long time, no doubt, but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back more and more. (I have a series on DVD, and I'll probably watch the series three times a year). <br /> <br /> In fact, it's perfect little movie. In addition, Olivier, the best part of a series of listening to a veteran tell their stories; whether it's about a real fight or kill a pig searching, so they can have something tasty for dinner. <br /> <br /> I'm going to go watch it right now (again, my ... 11 times).
