A great film that shows how people related to the taken for granted, the usual exchange beads during Mardi Gras. The film is much more than a commentary on globalization. In fact, it humanizes working in China, the owner of the plant, ball distributor in New Orleans, and even a playboy in New Orleans. What stands out most is the director's ability to tell a clever story with complex parts in a simple and seductive way. His amazing access to the plant is another aspect that is intrigued, and I just wish I knew how he got inside. It's a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and the output gives hope, entirely leaving people feeling alienated.
