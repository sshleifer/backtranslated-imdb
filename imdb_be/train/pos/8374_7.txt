Well, this movie was cool. I do not think it was the best movie ever made, but it sure was fun. My brother and I still walk around the stage once in a while, and from time to time to pull the film out of the closet, dust off and pop it. Pleasant all the way through, but it is a great concept. This is a film that you just need to forget the criticism all together and just enjoy. Opinion victory Robot Jox.
