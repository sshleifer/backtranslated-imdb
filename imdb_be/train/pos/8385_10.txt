This movie seems to get a bad critiscism for some reason. Probably just the mass of the population. In any case, it's actually a very interesting film. The film is under budget sci-fi film that actually works, in connection with an interesting plot and well-made scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for everyone, though. If you have any supporters Sci-Fi are reading this, I really recommend this movie if you like good ole science fiction. There's a crazy idea. The installation includes the country into war with giant machines, entire countries are investing money in! The world was divied up in the territories. Anyone can challenge the war to someone, or more precisely, "the robot duel." Method of warfare cleaner than nuclear war, because now all wear the breathing mask. Definitely a film that makes you think. Intelligent, well-written, and good effects for paltry budget. <br /> <br /> I usually like movies that have a small budget and actually work.
