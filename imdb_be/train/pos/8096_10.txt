First of all, the only reason why people continue to whine about this film because they can not stand a few pieces of true stories to be "changed." Well I guess what? The film Peter Jackson was not a perfect color reproduction. Well, enough talk. This is a very beautiful film. Backgrounds lush and taken from well-known artists Tolkien. The film covers about half trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and the battle Helms Deep in two towers) and moves at a good pace. Voice cast is top notch and most of the characters look like I imagined they would be. Samwise bit too ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks strange. The film has a great price, which fully supports the film. If you love a good fantasy story, but hate reading (books, even better) to give this film a try, having in mind that this is more than 20 years ago was made <br /> <br /> In addition, it should be emphasized :. adaptation of Peter Jackson's Fellowship is worth almost exactly the same as the strand Bakshi (in Jackson said many times, as he captured in efforts Bakshi).
