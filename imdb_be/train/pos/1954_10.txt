I thought that this film did a good job down the right. It was not as creative and original as the first, but who expected it to be. It was a whole lotta fun. The more I think about it, the more I love it, and when it comes out on DVD I have to pay money for this very proudly, to the last cent. Sharon Stone is large, it is always there, even if it is a terrible film (Catwoman), but this film is not the case, this is one of those movies that are undervalued their lives, and it is likely to become a classic, like in '20. Do not expect that it will be a classic, watch it now and enjoy it. Do not expect a masterpiece, or something that capture and touching the soul, just let yourself get out of your life and get themselves involved in them. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is interesting and I recommend that people who have not seen it to be, because the critics and box office say do not always expect to see it for yourself, you never know, you may just enjoy from it. I take my hat off to this movie <br /> <br /> 8/10
