I've been meaning to see this film in the past few months. I was actually surprised at how good it was. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a group of high school teens who abuse a boy named Marty. They constantly harass him until one of them makes a terrible mistake that leaves Marty badly burned. <br /> <br /> A few years later, a group of reckless teens are invited back to their school, which is now abandoned for the party. Although not one of reckless teenagers have organized this party. <br /> <br /> In the future, through the film, teens begin to die in the most disgusting way possible. Of course, I can tell you that they are the mountains as well. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film you will know it was a dream, and none of what happened. But Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Despite the fact that the murder did not happen, burns and pranks, apparently occurred. <br /> <br /> Effective terrible, but this is normal. <br /> <br /> I love this story. I really feel sorry for Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). Bullies get what's coming to them in the end, and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim to get his sweet revenge. <br /> <br /> I would strongly recommend anyone to take it if you are looking for 80s slashers. <, Br /> <br /> I give this movie 8 stars out of 10 Good cheesy slasher!
