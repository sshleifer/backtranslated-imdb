Large and overlooked Marion Davies shows its stuff at this end (1928) silent comedy, which also demonstrates the excellent William Haines. Davis plays the Loch of Georgia, with the help of Hollywood's failure Haynes. They come in cheap comedies, while Marion has not "discovered" and becomes a big star of the drama. Big lampoon of Hollywood and its claims. Davies & Haines are a great team (too bad they never did right together) and guest shots from like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) a whistle. A must for any serious film naked, or for those interested in further defamation Marion Davies!
