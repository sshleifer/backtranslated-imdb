As a collector movie library, I had to buy movie poster for the film, which, now that I finally saw it, should be the best thing about it. There's nothing more attractive to hang on the wall than 27x41 inches melting image of a man. However, there is nothing more frustrating to put in the VCR than a half hour long image fusion of man. At first I thought that this film was pure rubbish, but then I realized that he had some of the qualities that made me laugh. The character of Dr. Ted Nelson should be the most vague character ever brought to the big screen. His dialogue is so corny it's incredible! ( "This is unbelievable! It seems to be getting stronger as it melts!) <br /> <br /> And can someone please tell me how the hell do they know exactly how much time Steve left before it is completely melted, and exactly what their plan is to "help" him? If this film had to scare the audience, I think it missed his calling.
