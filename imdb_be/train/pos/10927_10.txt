This is one of my favorite kung fu films and is considered one of the most popular Shaw Brothers at the end of the 70s. The plot is interesting and winding, cool characters, each with its own style - frogs, snakes, lizards, etc. Action is limited compared to other / Chang Cheh films poisons, but there is interesting with different styles of Kung Fu at the reflection of the different characters. I recommend this film to anyone who thinks that all the Shaw Brothers movies especially Chang Che are the same, the majority of his films, tend to focus on the 10 tigers and Shaolin vs. Manchu conflict. This film is a breath of fresh air in comparison.
