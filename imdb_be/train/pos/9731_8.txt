Sidney Young (Pegg) moved from England to New York to work for a popular magazine Sharpay hoping to live the lifestyle of their dreams, but has struggled to make a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Based on the book Toby Young's survival in American business, this comedy drama received mixed views from criticism. Designated as consistently funny, but with the charm of the actors, how to lose one, it seemed like an ordinary fish from the pond to ridicule in another culture comedy, but it's not. <br /> <br /> In this 2008 painting works by his actors and a simple but harsh history. We begin in the past, the present, and work our way forward, to see how Young has made his mark in one of America's top magazines. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too cute for words. Be hit zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick character of the law of the English actor brings charm and warmth to light each scene. Here, if the script is good, but far from their own standards, he brings a lot of energy and image he alone is worth looking at. His trick with Â«Babe 3" inexcusable, simply breathtaking stuff as his over exuberant dance, but he pulls it off magnificently. <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson good sketch stereotypical magazine boss where Dunst fits in beautifully intricate love interest. Megan Fox, who stole transformers, reminds everyone that it can act here with amusing hyperbole stars stereotype film. The fact that her character Sophia Myles plays a major role in the film about Mother Teresa as funny as the antics of his character in the pool. To emphasize this is a dog, and Pegg rounds that of comedy in true Brit style, with great little twist. <br /> <br /> While there is a British film adaptation of the American way of life for the young, as he tries to fit, and we can see the different approaches to the story. Young want down right dirty contrasted with American professionalism. The inclusion of the modern tabloid star of the day will quickly make this film dated, but the concept of operation of movie stars gives it an edge. <br /> <br /> The first picture Weyden is not perfect. There are lapses in concentration, as the plot becomes too uncomfortable with soap obvious twist and there are too many characters to be necessary. Physical comedy can also be exaggerated. As a note, you bloopers on DVD, are among the best you will ever see, almost half an hour long. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy drama has Simon Pegg again shiny and with a collective approach to the story and sharp comedy, it's worth a look.
