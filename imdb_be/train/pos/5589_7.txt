Drenched in symbolism and filled with beautiful cinema, Extase is much more than an erotic drama we've come to expect. It is almost a silent film, so that the dialogue is, in the German language and German is very simple in this. Perhaps the filmmakers assigned the film to reach the widest possible European audience as anyone, even a small high school in the Deutsche level can easily do without subtitles. History does not matter in any case, with the success of the film on the cinematic level, not a descriptive one. Symbols of fertility and natural forces to crush the human characters - there's even a scene where the flowers cover the face of an imaginary star Hedy Lamarr - and there are moments that are here will remind viewers of Dreyer works Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to convey, I think it's a political one: the bourgeois man timid and powerless; working class people are happy, productive creatures; and a woman is the creator, who was destined to be unfulfilled, until she gave birth to a child. This mixture of Soviet socialist realism and the National Socialist dogma entirely overwhelm the film any means - it is the beauty of watching from start to finish - but it put him in a very expressive artistic era. And, oh yes, Hedi I get her kit off.
