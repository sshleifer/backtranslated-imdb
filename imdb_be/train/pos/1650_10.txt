Excellent series, brilliantly acted and directed, but hated (I said), Mr. Dayton and revoked them after one presentation. Now you can see only in private collections, as well as through the British Film Institute on request. It is very sad, because the nuances of the picture Ian Holm from weary, but a certain Bernard Samson beautiful; one of his best performances. The supporting cast, including young Amanda Donahoe and Hugh Fraser, wonderful. With Mel Martin plays the conflicted and treacherous wife, and Michael Degen as the mercury Werner, history positively buzzing with the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the big game.
