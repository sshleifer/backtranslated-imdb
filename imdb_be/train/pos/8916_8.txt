Absolutely the very first movie that scared me to death. I happened to catch it, when my older brother (r.i.p.) Watched it. It was a black-and-white TV and not very good picture, but it interests me. Soon after my folks bought a set of colors, and as luck would have it, The Million Dollar Movie showing this one on Sunday. <br /> <br /> I have forgotten most of the plot, but it does not take long to catch up ... and I was so scared, I had a hard time sleeping that night! I mean, it was just a movie, but it involved a being who not only came from outer space, but you could not hear or see him ... and when he got hold of you, it was too late. Even now, after all this time it still sends chills up my spine. A true classic, and even better, a classic that I have seen scare the pants of the new generation! <br /> <br /> Long live the Blob!
