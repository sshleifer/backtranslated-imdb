This is one movie that will take some time to get out of your head as soon as you saw it. Dialogues are close to ideal, that was to be expected as it was taken out of the game. Actors just give their best, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure happiness! <br /> <br /> Attalia is absolutely secure in his role, Sandrine Kiberleyn still beautiful blonde (but not stupid enough) to ensure as much pleasure for the eyes, the ears, Jean Paul Rouve provides an excellent approximation total jerk (and proud of the fact that such), and Marina Fois is dumb friend who is always malfunctioning, if you wait longer. <br /> <br /> Not bad Bernard Rapp and associates for the adaptation of this great game, and all the best for future productions! <br /> <br /> I wish there were more of them at the present time of production. If you liked it, then you probably also enjoy: "Un Air de Famille» and «Kitchen and others dependances». Both were written and played pair Bacri / Jaoui.
