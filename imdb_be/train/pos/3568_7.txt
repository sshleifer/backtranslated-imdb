This film moves the Cinderella story forward to the beginning of the 1950s, and was doing well, when the eccentric, the use of the Isle of Man as a background. Ugly Sisters became wildly glamorous upper-class English girls, and with Kathleen Turner as the stepmother, they throw in a variety of outstanding historical costumes. History changes a little bit from the traditional version of the wound it surprisingly combined with the plot of "King Lear", and in the later stages of Cinderella more assertive than usual. It looks great and works as a whole is pretty good, but go over the top at times.
