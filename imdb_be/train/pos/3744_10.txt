This is possibly the best short drama crime I've ever seen. The acting is wonderful especially Amanda Burton, who is the hero goes from scary sweet anxious bored, and then some ... It does a terrific job of balancing Rachels / Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who has lost a child, it is so true that it feels more real life story of the drama. The rest of the actors, of course, too big, they usually are in the British TV / movies. The ending is that I'm not going to give away, is fantastic, mainly because you do not actually get one ... (you get what I mean after you've seen it) It is well worth buying and see again and if you are not moved by this you are one cold hearted person.
