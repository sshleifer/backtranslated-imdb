That's right. The film is better than the book. Do not get me wrong, I love this book. But the film is just so much better. This movie has Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall is at his best. (I have not seen Scatman Crothers and obviously Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this film is better than the ones used in the book. But I have already talked about those in my comments on the mini-series. But, I missed a few. The film was shot in a better place than where the mini-series was filmed. And the scene Redrum is worse than in the book. So if you are looking for a great movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But count on nightmares every night for 3 weeks
