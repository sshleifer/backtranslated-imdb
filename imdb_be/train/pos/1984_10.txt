One of the best musicals made, one that is worth the time and over and over again to see. Delicious! Actions, especially Ron Moody as Fezhiny is excellent. Exquisite costumes .... even the old ones. <br /> <br /> The two young guys who play Oliver and smartest amazingly talented. Oliver Reed does a great job, which shows Bill Sikes, where you can not help but hope that he will come to a terrible end .... he does. <br /> <br /> masterfully choreographed dance and mesmerizing. Oliver can hold its own with the likes of My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. The film for the whole family.
