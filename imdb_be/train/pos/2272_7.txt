Nick Nolte provides excellent performance in the dark tale of Kurt Vonnegut. Notle plays Howard W. Campbell, who was a double agent, working in the propaganda during the Second World War. After the war, he does not live anonymously as rival factions would like to dig up the past. As with most of the work Vonnegut, a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own purposes. Nolte is fantastic - cocky and confident as the younger Campbell, and then broken and pursued as an elderly man, who is forced to atone for sins of the past. (7 of 10)
