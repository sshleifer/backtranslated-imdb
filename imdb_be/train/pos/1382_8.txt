Not everything that is said in this beautiful first function of Celine Shiammy. Friendship, Â«wanting to fit in," the first sexual feelings ... All this and much more sublimated through underwater scene synchro diving. <br /> <br /> All three girls in the film are trying to find and express their individuality in a completely different way. This is considerably less violent approach to understanding adolescence compared to, say, "Thirteen", but very worthwhile trip nonetheless. <br /> <br /> A must see, and please leave all American cinematic prejudices he door. Soundtrack A +, incidentally. <br /> <br /> Enjoy cinema!
