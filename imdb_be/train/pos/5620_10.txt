Roman Polanski is one of the most important directors of our time, as the mind behind classics such as "Rosemary's Baby" and "Chinatown." Probably what makes the movie Polanski very interesting one by the fact that while he is able to create commercially attractive films, such as the aforementioned masterpieces, he also loves to do low-key movies that are more personal. «Le Locataire», or "Lessee", is one of those movies; horror / suspense story of paranoia and obsession, which is one of his best works, and probably one of the best horror films ever made. <br /> <br /> Sam Polanski plays Telkovsky, young people looking for an apartment in France. When he finally finds, he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant, Simone Choule, tried to kill himself by jumping from a window. After Simone dies from injuries, Trelkovsky starts to become obsessed with it, to the point of believing that her death was caused by other residents in the building. <br /> <br /> While sharing the same claustrophobic sense of his other "flat-themed" films ( "repulsion and" Rosemary's Baby "), the film centers on a bizarre plot that may or may not be fully in Trelkovsky head, catastrophic paranoia has consequences on his head, and a bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky descent into darkness is portrayed in quite Polanski. whereas in its first execution, it seems strange and wood, slowly one learns that Polanski acts so because Trelkovsky meant to be acted in such a way. as a simpleton with almost no life that catches herself in this crazy south of the world, which happens to be populated by a collection of amazing people support the actors really gave life to people in the building, creating memorable characters when I was very important to success of the film. <br /> <br /> in addition, the beautiful cinematography Polanski worked in the film helps to increase the sense of isolation, and gives life to a beautiful building, which serves as a cage for Trelkovsky, memorable images Polanski uses to convey a sense of zbyante Anas and madness have a supernatural beauty that makes them as a terrible and attractive. <br /> <br /> If the defect can be found in the film, it is that it is definitely a bit slowly at first. This may sound like an exception, but in fact the slow pace of the beginning of works fine, it simulates his own boring life Trelkovsky and it gradually turns into another realm. In addition, the intricate plot, of course, is not easy to understand, because of the many complex layers it has. Nevertheless, more than a drawback, it is a joy to the face of food for thought the story like this. <br /> <br /> While the "Lessee" may not be for everyone who is interested in the psychological horror and surreal subjects will be pleased with the experience. «Le Locataire», one of the masterpieces of Roman Polanksi in. 10/10
