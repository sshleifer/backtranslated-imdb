When I first saw the title I have vyuyusya theme of the film - this is clearly not a reference to the British currency, so it was supposed to be Shakespeare and pounds of flesh - taking them, or giving them. Will Smith is an actor Feelgood, so that serial killers were not. This can only be the person giving it, so it should be about blame somehow. I messed up everything for themselves, seeing it and knowing the story before I watched the beauty of the building is the way the main character background drip fed slowly illuminates the audience who he. Why is he doing what he's doing <br /> < br /> The feeling of guilt is very difficult subject to do simply because it is deeply uncomfortable and boring, which is not encouraging location, if you are looking for a ride roller coaster - you know that it will be unpleasant. I would not say that the film glorifies suicide; it delves into the extreme form of self-sacrifice -. martyrdom <br /> <br /> It is also filled with symbolism everywhere, an unmistakable signal indication that literacy intelligently thought out in detail and management of ambiguity and reflect a deep character. The most prominent theme that struck me was that he not only gives his heart to the girl he loves, emotionally and literally, but to give it to her physically as the greatest gift that he could. Determined to die, but his plan is foiled fall in love - that the second act of a complication. Absolutely masterful. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is slow, but I am if it was not decided it would be better cuts in less time. I did not feel the tension and his terrible inner turmoil as much as I could, but maybe that's just me ruin it for yourself in advance. Saying all this, though, it is very touching, and the original film, which is an incredibly powerful and thinking of the tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get.
