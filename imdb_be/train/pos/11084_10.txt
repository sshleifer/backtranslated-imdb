<br /> <br /> I saw the Fox Glacier in the theater when I was nine - I listened to my parents to pick me up three times. I started to look for him in the video about five years ago, finally reveal the copy on the internet auction site, but I'd like to see him or to pick up a new distributor and re-released (I understand, the original video run was small), or has the right acquired The Family Channel, Disney and so on, and shown on a regular basis. It's a fun movie that draws you into the life story of the struggle of the family of foxes in the north of Japan, told by a wise old tree. Great soundtrack to praise the film well. It would be a good seller today, better than many of the weaknesses of the proposals in children's films today.
