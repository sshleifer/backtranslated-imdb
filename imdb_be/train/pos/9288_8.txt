I found it surprisingly deftly touch in 1950 in the cultural conflicts of the film. John Wayne is unlikely to be one's first choice as a cultural attache, being as diplomatic with their good intentions, as the bull run in Harrods. But this time he was to play a role that was far more passive than usual streamlined person, and he carried out his task with style. The Duke was a guy who really could work well. His facial expressions and body language can be very thin. <br /> <br /> Despite the significant presence as an actor, and in terms of screen time, he could not dominate in this film. Many of his good intentions have come a cropper. He had power over anyone, and the intermittent narrative was granted the title geisha, as he was a barbarian. <br /> <br /> The history of American attempts to curry favor isolationist Japan was one of political intrigue, and not delete or hell for leather-battle. I can not comment on the accuracy of their research, but the strangeness of Eastern culture in western sensitivity was demonstrated well. It was a lot of instant-choreographed ceremony which leads hoped that this observer as an authentic costumes and props. Mounting parts are complex and detailed. A lot of money and thought has been applied to it. <br /> <br /> break romance between Wayne and his geisha added a little extra element, and stopped the film becomes just a political or flag-waving effort. The script was good, without being too wordy. There were a lot of Japanese dialogue, but long transfer periods do not interfere in the narrative. Well, that many genuine Orientals on the set. Regardless of whether or not they were Japanese, I could not tell. But in any case they look part. At the very least, the findings have not been played transvestism Caucasians, in contrast to other methods, such as the "Walk of blood" (yes, I know that they were Chinese) Â«The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness" or even "The King and I". <, Br /> <br /> To be honest, I enjoyed it more than any of the other films. The script was better to start with. I never liked the songs in "The King and I", and was not impressed laden anti subtext "Walk of blood." I confess that I have never seen this work before, and found it to be very beneficial as compared to many of the most popular excursions of the Duke. <br /> <br /> recommended.
