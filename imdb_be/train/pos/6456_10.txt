My expectations were pretty high for this film. Everyone I know who has seen this movie in the theater told me that everything remains through loans, because they were so touched. My expectations could not be higher, I do not have enough beautiful to me disappointed. <br /> <br /> I do, but disappointed with this film. I loved how he comes to complex issues without going through the usual steps of the Hollywood film seeks to include. In this film, the characters worked through the problems that they have had for decades, they worked through prejudicm, they learned to open. But it does not come easily, and not just sing a song or two. It was painful, he accepted the arguments, he took the confrontation. He felt, as in real life. <br /> <br /> In one of the scenes that really stuck out to me was the scene in which Gabriella sings his song. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is beautiful, and you could tell that it was not just lip syncing to the previous track during filming (that I often find in other films), she really sang all my body and soul. You may feel that Gabriela felt in this scene. If this movie was made in Hollywood, her song, most likely, was sung to the end, and it would have made her husband open his eyes and see his mistakes, as well as other people in the village to understand a thing or two. Instead, he came to the middle, and it has not brought any decisions. Her husband does not become overloaded, and understand what he put her through, and it does not appear that anyone else in the country more open. It was beautiful, it was clean, and it was moving, but it does not magically solve all their problems. It felt real to me, this is probably what would have happened in real life. The whole movie felt real life I do not neatly wrapped up, but with a sense of joy and happiness. You will rarely find a movie that feels so realistic. <br /> <br /> There were a few things that bothered me, but hey, not a movie is not perfect. If you have not you should go see "How in heaven," and full of joy in life, a sense of hope and a feeling that you touched on the level films rarely reach. You will be bored, sick, happy and a dozen other emotions. <br /> <br /> Someone once said that if everyone in the world, sang in the choir there would be no more wars. After seeing this movie, I might have to agree.
