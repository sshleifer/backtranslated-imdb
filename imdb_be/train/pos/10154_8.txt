This is the first film I saw Vartan, I have not seen Alias- and I was curious to see if the guy can act.He sure can and cute in this movie.Natasha Henstridge, of course, great, but it is usually more physical and actions roles, so I found it very nice and cute in these other "sweet" the role of the school teacher. Some of the negative comments I read are true, the film is full of cliches and the story does not ring true in all.Also, even if every character in the film says, how well they look together, I do not think there is a chemistry screen there. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this locale screening of the film is good, the characters are cute, and Saito and supporting actors are very good. If you are expecting to see a great novel, it's not it.But, if you want to see a nice innocent Saito movie with cute characters it very well.
