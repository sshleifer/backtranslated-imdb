Just saw ICE AGE, very funny and looks particularly good movie. The story is simple, but effective, the characters are cute and well-fleshed, but what really shines digital scenography. <br /> <br /> More than inspired by traditional animation movies than reality, projects give you a very, very nice looking at the world in a strange use of color. Sometimes it touches reality shine through (especially the water is impressive), but, nevertheless, it is the world of fantasy based on reality. Including loads of wide landscapes especially on the provision of help to minimize costs. <br /> <br /> Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this one shines efficient use of the technical know-how. <br /> <br /> Enough technical talk, movie entertainment, family fun and sometimes funny.
