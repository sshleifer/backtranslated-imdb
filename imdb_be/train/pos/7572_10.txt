I just can not believe that these games can get a lot better, but they do. Unfortunately, I had to take the Dreamcast to play, but even when I beat him, I can not wait to buy it for the PS2. This is the only series of games, which I should have all of them, even if I beat them many times. I hope they never stop making this type of game, even if the series should come to the end. <br /> <br />
