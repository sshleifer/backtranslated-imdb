Caught this film at the International Film Festival Festival in Arizona. I was not expecting much (although the festival director told me that it was one of the best submitted films). Five minutes later it was sold to me. Shot in B & W on a shoestring budget, this film is hilarious. Response is rigid, writing is solid and appearance Solid film. Action is probably the greatest discovery since most films made on low budgets, usually amateur or unnatural action. Not this one. It has one of the most compelling, funny and cute character drawings with Tourette's syndrome, I have ever seen. The plot is minimized, without being confusing and untidy, without being gratuitous. If you get a chance to see this film. Filmmakers like Vladimir Mayakovsky (hope I got that right) deserves a chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience.
