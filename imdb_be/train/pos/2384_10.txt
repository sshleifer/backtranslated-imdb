It is a well known fact that when Gene Roddenberry first pitched Star Trek on NBC, the original pilot episode, Cage, was rejected for being "too cerebral". If the series has been given another chance, Roddenberry thought it would be interesting to establish the event rejected the episode as a canon, and did so by writing a menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being a continuation of what has been until now, at the time, stuffy episode. <br /> <br /> This time, rather than to explore a new planet, Kirk and his team is on Starbase 11, paying a visit to the former commander of the company, Christopher Pike (Shaun Kenny) now horribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident. Pike joins his successor on a spaceship, where a nasty surprise waiting for: Spock, who used to serve under Pike, actually captured the ship and set a course to IV of comparison, the planet that is beyond (the death penalty), as Pike Spock's last visit there 13 years ago. Naturally, being a logical creature, Spock turns himself in and meet a court-martial, so that it can justify its actions. <br /> <br /> There's no need to say more about the plot, as all the rest will play part 2. That is really impressive how Roddenberry creates a connection between the cell and the rest of the universe of Star Trek, coming up with some kind of flashback (not to say more would be too much) that allows everyone on-screen and off, to see what could be a Trek, NBC has not ruled out the original project. In particular, it is interesting to see Jeffrey Hunter (who was unable to return to the zoo) play Pike as a more serious captain than Kirk usually the first days of Nimoy as Spock, whose identity was not fully installed: this is the only time in the entire series that everyone's favorite Vulcan smile spontaneously. <br /> <br /> In short, not only the big "secret" episode, but also fun for those who can not be bothered to find the cells in its original form (it is available as part of a box set Season 3).
