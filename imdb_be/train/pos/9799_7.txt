Pleasant Batman animated film. Not on par with the "Return of the Joker" or "fantasy mask", but nevertheless solid. I liked how the film made you wonder who was Batwoman. There was a good turn. Good action sequences. I have always been of the opinion that the cartoons Batman better then any of the helpless Batman live-action sequel. This trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7,5 10
