This is one of the best music concerts, who has ever seen and heard. I grew up when All My Lovin 'was completely new and hear it again today an original artist today is a measure of Sir P MC power to captivate any crowd of any age. DOCO This goes far beyond the scenes to show us the life on the road, not only for the group, but all the way up Road. I saw that this guy lives in the 1975 Aussie and can not guarantee its performance here, on this DVD at least he has given almost 30 years ago. I have a great 5.1 surround system that really makes this justice, and would recommend it to anyone especially a fan Beatles. This is the closest you'll get to the concert Beatles today. Singer, songwriter, lead / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just brilliant. There are a few artists who can stand alone with one device and hold the crowd in his hand. If you want to mark the perfect music to buy a studio recorded CD. If you want to hear the music raw, as it is spontaneous and the crowd, with all the excitement and emotion of the crowd is the DVD for you.
