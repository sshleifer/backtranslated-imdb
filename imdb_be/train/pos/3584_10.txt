My name is Heather and I'm a girl, whose story the film was based on. I want to thank all of you who have seen the film and enjoyed it. and oil and sharp as some of the things that have been portrayed in the film were, it is not very close to the description of how bad things really were. not to mention the affect it was my mother and younger sister. thanks again for the great comments, which were all, I really appreciate them <br /> <br /> Hello everyone! <br /> <br /> This is my mother, Heather. Hard to believe that so many years have passed since the film was made. Stronger even believe that people still watched it a year ago. For any of you out there who have been through the same or a similar kind of situation, please know that there are people here in cyberspace, who fully understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers go out to each and every one of you.
