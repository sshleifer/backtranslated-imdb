This is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget film. Act beautiful considering the scenario & the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding. Gore is well done and is used sparingly (note the great death of barbed wire) and penetrative action during use. It is true that there is a quirky line in the script from time to time, but compared to the other films on the same (or more!) Of the budget, it is hardly noticeable at all. In general, it is recommended. Believe me, it's better than it sounds! 8/10
