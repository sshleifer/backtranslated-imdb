I thoroughly enjoyed this exact form to take the person Dick Tracy. It is a well made product, which is used modern technologies to process imagery filled comical story of the era. If you are a fan or recently watched some of the old Dick Tracy and would co movies, then you will definitely enjoy this rendition. Pastel colors and larger than life characters, rendered in painstakingly authentic take on the era has passed entertainment as it should be. I personally think the musical element of Madonna will be the main part of the disc of the film featuring her music from this film is one I listened to often for many years, it's just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era. In my opinion, the best time of the Madonna on the screen, but especially musically. This is sure to bring a "child" you.
