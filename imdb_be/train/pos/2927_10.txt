This video is so funny funny, it makes everything else <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy seems to be very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, which just goes to show you how good it really is). Frankly, I do not think I've ever <br /> <br /> laughing over something as much as it is, including the Naked Gun and rarely seen Bargearse. This show is awesome, although I must say that it is, of course, filled with a word beginning with the F, which is the length of the four letters (plus its enhanced version, starting with M), but it does not bother me. Look, the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen and probably the funniest you ever too.
