With the amount of actors they are working on a project, they have a wide range of actors. Good ship CGI in places, but their green screen needs some work. Who ever heard of Adobe After Effects 7, they have to buy it to get them better manipulation. <br /> <br /> Stories are well thought out, a lot of Trek elements in it to keep it in the right context. BUT BUT the idea of ​​two guys kissing makes me wind forward episode. I'm not homophobic, but I can not help that I do not find people kiss entertaining (not referring to women). Anyway ... For fans of the series is good stuff. With a slight improvement in their green screen refresh action and some senior ratings of this series it is stunning. Anyway, I recommend this series to those who have ever used the TNG and DS9.
