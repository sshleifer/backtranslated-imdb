Excellent film version of the bestselling book and smash Broadway play about the life of Ghanaian and Beth Delaney, two African-American sisters who lived in the age of more than 100 and told their story witnesses century American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll give very good performances as Bess and Ghana, respectively. Madigan as well as Amy Hill Hearth, white New York Times article about the sisters who started the book, etc. Many of the historical scenes, and even many of the modern ones are very powerful, if not quite as inspired as in the book. It's the only real drawback, coupled with the fact that some aspects of this story is not presented clearly, such as racial background mother and sisters why their father was so harsh. But other than that, very well done, well performed, powerful film.
