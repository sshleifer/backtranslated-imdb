I enjoyed it. In general, I am not a supporter of comedies and comedians, but I like Whoopi. I'm also partial to Sci / Fi Fantasy. And a dinosaur mania. I read for pleasure, but if I feel too stressed or dead mind, I watch TV and movies to avoid. Theodore Rex let me do it. This makes it a success in my eyes! I did not even leave to do something else while it is running. Whether or not was evaluated as "good" or not, no matter to me. And no, I do not juvenile. And I'm not a moron.
