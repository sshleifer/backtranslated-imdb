We taped it, when it was shown on TV in 1995, and have been waiting all these years for his release, as he quickly became one of our family favorites. Children are now teenagers and had to see it ba-zillion times, but they still have to watch his religious friends. This timeless appeal reaches all ages groups - similar to «Grease» <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander lovely and surprisingly light on his feet. I noticed the other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him, but our family gives him the highest score. (We loved it Room «Giant Step».) Mark Kudish (Conrad) gives us a comic relief and excellent musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (as Ursula) just flat dwarfs. Probably our favorite character in the whole film. <br /> <br /> One disappointment was the performance of Chynna Phillip Kim. Part of that has to do with writing. The role of Kim completely one-dimensional. Complication that Philip delivery flat, prosaic, and incredibly terrible. The director had to see that and fix it. Or never left her, to begin with. <br /> <br /> In general, however, the picture is beautiful and I highly recommend it for families of all ages.
