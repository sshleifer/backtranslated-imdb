This film hit home for me. Being 29, I remember the '80s, and my father worked in a factory. I realized if I worked hard too, if I had the honor and never thought I could, too, the American dream, a house, a few children, the car all to call their own. I noted, however, without a degree in something (as opposed to my father, that to quit in the ninth grade) and a keen sense of greed and laziness, you can not get anywhere. <br /> <br /> I would like to know if anyone has the movie on DVD or VHS. it's made for television, and I just saw him an hour ago. Ic an't find it anywhere! I would like to show it to your friends, have a pseudo friends, family members and other relatives, to find out what they think, and to remind them that once upon a time, Americans are working for the sake of pride, and that we were proud that we done !! I think this feeling is still there, but in severe downward spiral with so many things that are made abroad ...
