This is one of the first independent films I've ever seen. For such a very low budget, it was done well; insomnia myself, I can empathize with the main character, but has trouble sleeping has never been so intense or disturbing. <br /> <br /> Well directed, well acted, a subject that I have not seen a lot of theaters, lighting and set as the ideal setting for a film. There are some notable discrepancies, but they may be assigned; You will see after you watch a movie. The film is very personal, and worth watching twice. A lot of the film is not perfect, but the Hollywood version can not make a better story. in general 8/10.
