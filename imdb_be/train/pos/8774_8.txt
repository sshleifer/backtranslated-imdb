At the end of the 1800s in San Francisco, a poor well-dressed Errol Flynn (as James J. Corbett) works in a bank and enjoyed visiting the local "battles" (box) with his partner and companion, Jack Carson (as Walter Lowry). One day, quite Alexis Smith (Victoria Ware) is included in "Comstock Bank", where he works, Mr. Flynn. Flynn so taken with the elegant beauty of Miss Smith, he offers to carry her purse removal. Smith secretly taken with a beautiful Flynn, but discourages its audacity. <br /> <br /> good deed Flynn (actually, pickup attempts) gets it for free membership combativeness "Olympic Club", which conveniently includes a gym (with a boxing equipment). However, the arrogant manner of Flynn and practical joke (he tickles men on the bars) annoying members of the "club". If English boxing champion visits the club, members tend to get Flynn to fight with a man. They hope Flynn resigns, humiliated by his defeat - but Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> The first time producer Robert Buckner collects good package for Warner Brothers and directed by Raoul Walsh. Mr. Buckner was, of course, basking in the success of their contribution (scenario) in the studio brilliant "Yankee Doodle Dandy." Unfortunately, this story is a positive misplaced. It was "Gentleman Jim" - a story allegedly filming a real autobiography of James J. Corbett "roar of the crowd" - but this film should be substantially fictionalized <br /> <br /> Flynn is. very attractive leading man; He maneuvered the script is easy, and should have been recognized in the early 1940s, as a wonderful actor. Many of the characteristics of Flynn were (are?) Forget how great performances, and this is one of them. Smith also makes it feminine interest, deftly conveying their emotions for the viewer. Director Walsh makes nonsense look smooth and extravagant. The supporting cast is a treasure trove of noisy Alan Hale (as Pat Corbett) to walk on the Lon McCallister ( "Mr. Corbett paging"). <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (one thousand nine hundred forty-two) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
