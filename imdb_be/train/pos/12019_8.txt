I saw this movie on Sky movie not so long ago .. I have to admit that it was really a good Western, which shows two of the great names .. On the one hand, there are Charlton Heston playing a shameful and a retired lawyer Samuel Burgade, on the other hand .. The late James Coburn plays a villain Zack wires .. not looking for revenge Burgade no matter what the price ..! <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie was had some really good characters. . Most of the actors played really well .. Especially James Coburn, I believe that he was really mean in this movie .. But as it was .. <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitch, I have seen throughout the other movies .. Play Hal Brickman .. I felt that his character was left in the cold, but he managed to get himself back into teaming up with Burgade, to knock down! <br Posse in wires /> <br /> in general, it was a great movie .. very good looking .. big bill at the end of Jerry Goldsmith .. <br /> <br /> A great piece of the western person ..! 8 of 10.
