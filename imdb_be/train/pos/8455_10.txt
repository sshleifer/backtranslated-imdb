As an impressionable young man, when the first experience of a series of Gundam Wing, after re-watching the series, I reaffirmed my confidence in the fact that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, the Gundam design, character design and character depth are powerfully punished. While being in the first group of varieties as a boy, stylish appeal of the characters can be partly attributed to the only great art, with individuals, creating a clear and which to conquer the difference between the characters. Thus, it is extremely easy to become drawn to any particular character. Personally, I liked HeERO because of his thoughts of the individual. While I may be biased with the sentimental attachment of the show in my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing discusses deep questions of war and life in general (how do we find peace?), While ensuring that action combat in large robotic suits that, at least, perfectly.
