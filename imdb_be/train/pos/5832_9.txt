Since seeing this film as a child more than 30 years ago, I never get tired of watching it. From the opening scenes of the factory horn, to car engine running from the back of the car seat to Ollie to answer the phone and accidentally pushed out the window, Stan, I think it was possibly their best film last day. After that, they moved to 20th Century Fox, and while these movies were not terrible, they lacked the comic timing of this film. Jimmy Finnlayson, their long foil, in his last appearance with the boys showing up as a super doctor! quote:! "I said, goat's milk," his response status to ask him how you milk the ghost of Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin show I would say that all in all one of my favorite comedies of L & H.
