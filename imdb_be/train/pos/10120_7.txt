The film begins something like less hyper-kinetic, more stylized living or dead: strange underground activities carried out while the body is found by police. But if the police killed one Tatsuhito linked ... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito also involved, things get bloody fairly quickly. <br /> <br /> An earlier work of Miike's, of Shinjuku Triad Society is still filled with his typically ole Â»ultraviolence and sadistic sexual acts, even though it is not one of his more eclectic and colorful details. Most likely, it's pretty well worked out a little fiction and Tatsuhito drips its way through the underground maze that leads him to a gay leader of the Triads, who sells illegally acquired organs of the body from Taiwan and holds almost a brothel young boys (one in specifically, the character who kills a police officer at the beginning). Tatsuhito brother is involved with this society, so Tatsuhito himself forced to become a dirty cop and use the same harsh and sadistic tactics to break into this dirty scope. <br /> <br /> What is mostly interesting about this little work is the relationship Tatsuhito has with his archenemy, Van. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, and then returned to Japan, and alienated for him. Wang Chinese who feel alienated in China, so that he killed his father and developed wing crime in Japan. Wang also amazing Shakespearean character, which is quite strange as it is, much less than you actually start to feel sorry for him at the time of his final showdown with Tatsuhito comes to be. And he Tatsuhito it as a tragic figure when he is forced to deal with his lack of ability to control his brother. While it would be rude to say that Miike films are successful mainly in shock them, it is true that sometimes it is easy to lose as well Miike can create bitter dis-hot characters <br /> <br /> . - -PolarisDiB
