Anne Brontes epic novel resident Wildfell HALL should study and read for schools and libraries, and the peoples living rooms. Its a fantastic story and says the "real" truth about alcoholism and a broken marriage and a mother struggling to keep her son from her abusive husband. Its just like today's story, we see and hear, and I believe that people can learn a lot from reading this book. Based on the potential of these experiences that the author even in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> How to watch this movie, his great version of the book, and very moving, really. I'm sure Anne he would have been happy with the way it was produced. <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and great places.
