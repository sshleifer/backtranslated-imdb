Very good movie. Classic sci-fi film with humor, action and all. This film offers a large number of foreigners. We see that the leaders of the Alliance Rebel and many of the imperial forces. Emperor somewhat peculiar character. I liked Ewoks posing as something indigenous savages and Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke, who is the best of the saga. In Return of the Jedi epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire finally falls. I also appreciated the victory celebration, where he performs a ransom Vader and returns a greeting in the spirit of Anakin Skywalker, along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. This gives the sadness and tears. The greatest scene in Star Wars among the film: When Vader turns on the Emperor. Luke looks up and finds solace in the fact that Obi-Wan, iodine and ... his father (1997 version is not Hayden Christenssen). Next best scene when Luke rushes to strike back Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side of the film, even though a good ending. I felt that it was much more than it seems at first glance. And as always the music of John William will classicism in the Star Wars universe.
