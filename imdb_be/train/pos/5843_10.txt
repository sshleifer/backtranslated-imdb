Recently Lubitsch production, but not the least interesting film. Once largely ignored by critics, since he could not finish it himself, and the film was not co-signed by Preminger, he did most of the performances ... Very strange mix of music (the memory of the Merry Widow?) And classical Lubitsch touch sentimentalism (impossible love story, like Cluny Brown) has a very smart and intelligent is another not to be understood as a kind of nostalgia for some lost world, but rather the testimony of the eternal feelings that were in effect at the stupidity of mankind, and especially for men the war with the "moral" lesson is still true today as it was in the 1948 Billy Wilder as a response to Preminger, who grieved to Lubitsch's funeral in a loss of a great man said that we still had their films, and sums it all about that houses in ermine ...
