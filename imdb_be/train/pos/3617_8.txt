«Girlfight» is a project of residential New York City high school girl with a sense of hopelessness in the world of amateur boxing, where she finds a sense of self-esteem, goals and much more. Although the film is not about boxing, boxing is all about the movie. So much so that you can almost smell the sweat. Technically and artistically shoot well with a sense of honesty and reality of it, «Girlfight» no chick flick, and there is no "Rocky." Rather, it is a very human drama, even viewers who do not know boxing will be able to connect.
