I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of the mental problems that he experienced after his return. So when I saw a part of this film for one night on pay-per-view channel, I was intrigued. I would like to know that my uncle was, and felt that he was ready for Vietnam. I went out and made this film, and I must say that this is the most heart-wrenching film that I have ever seen. I immediately bought the DVD after its lease. As it pulls you in many different directions emotionally that I had never experienced with any other film. As far as Vietnam themed movies go, I think this is the best, although the platoon held second place. Besides all this, I think it's also the best performance of Colin Farrell as an actor. I love him in most of his films, but in this case, it was incredible. I gave it a 10 rating, because it is one of my top five favorite movies.
