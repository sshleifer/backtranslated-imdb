a masterpiece! <br /> <br Another In /> This is the best wuxie movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except for some of Hollywood moments ...). John Woo. - more, the director of the century <br /> <br /> Maybe, hello no more intelligent than a lot of great directors ... But he was a lyrical and spiritual idol of all free people crazy! <br /> <br /> His films like great poetry! Woo is a film Sheakspeare! Woo is a film Biron! Woo is Mozart Bloodshet !!!! <br /> <br /> IMHO violent in Woo film directors not bloodlust, but a tool of art. Topics Woo movies are more humane, that most new movies.
