This film is fun to watch. If you like "Dave" with Kevin Kline, you will get a kick out of it. Think "Dave" went to South America, as the Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, actor between jobs, which is selected manually the head of the secret police of the island nation the Parador, replacement drunk drunk dictator, Alphonse Simms, after he had a heart attack and died . Noah Bumbles together to help in his role as mistress of the former dictator, as they attempt to thwart Raul Julia. Jonathan Winters also makes an appearance as a rich American immigrant who is the CIA. Also starring Polly Holliday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are some absurd moments, such as the old dictator's body be kept frozen for a year, and the final scene, where Sonia Braga, which has bee holding a bloody, bullet riddled body Dreyfus seen later all in pristine white or drop smudge on it. But in general, this is a big fuss.
