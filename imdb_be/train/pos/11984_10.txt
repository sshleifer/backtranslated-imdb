I've never seen a show as good as Full House. Full House puts all the new shows to shame, a great time! Those who have never seen that I do not understand how this is possible, should see it. This is a great show for anyone at any age. Full House will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will amaze you. However, some people believe that there are some "cheese" aspects of the show, but the positive aspects outweigh the "cheese" aspects. Full House ran the first episode on September 22, 1987 under the title "Our very first Show" and ran this latest episode of 23, my 1995 under the name "Michelle Rides Again Part IIÂ». <br /> <br /> The plot of the show is very plausible. Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) the loss of his wife, Pam, in an accident involving a drunk driver. Denis in-law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos) who is the younger brother of Pam and Danny also brings to his best friend Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier), to help him raise his three daughters. Denis daughter of DJ specified (Candace Cameron Bure), Stephanie (Suitin) and Michelle (Olsen) .Joey and Jesse plan to move in with Denis and his three girls for a few months only to help and ended up living with them for eight years; . That the number of years the show ran <br /> <br /> The following is a brief description of some of the characters and actors / actresses who play his / her: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a wonderful actor. He plays Jesse. Jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break. The Full House, John Stamos does a great job, which shows his character. He looked and played music, like his idol, Elvis Presley <br /> <br /> Bob Saget (Danny) :. Bob Saget is also a great actor. He loses his wife in a car accident involving a drunk driver. He must raise three girls without having the girl's mother. Bob Saget does a great job, which shows one of the parents who work full time and still have time to raise his three girls <br /> <br /> Dave Coulier (Joey) :. One word can describe Dave Coulier, funny. He's big. Drawing character Joe was perfect for him. He does a great job playing the comedian waiting for his big break <br /> <br /> Candace Cameron Bure (DJ) :. She's a terrific actress. She plays the older sister, DJ, which is short for Donna Jo. She is one of the best actresses I've ever seen. Her acting ability in a sold-out was very believable <br /> <br /> Suitin (Stephanie) :. Two simple words can describe Suitin incredibly amazing! I would like to say what I wanted to say about Jody, but I would use only a maximum of 1000 words on it. She got her start in the children show called Mother Goose Story and when she came to a full house, it undermined the consciousness of the audience and the creator. Its attractive appearance and is absolutely amazing acting skills helped make the show a success that it was. According to Dave Coulier, Jodie was supposed to be the star of the show. He was supposed to be where it is going to get her big break. Jody, in five years, when the show first aired, could hit every line perfectly. She showed a lot of enthusiasm. Most small children can not do it. As you can guess, Suitin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in the Full House <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michel). Great actress. Full house, where they got their start. They received a part of Michel, because they were the only ones that kids are not crying and the camera. <br /> <br /> There are many other actors who should be recognized. This original characters when the show first aired in 1987. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I can say is Full House Show Michelle became closer to the end. I think it has been focused on it until the end. Especially when I think Jody and Candice were much better effect. <br /> <br /> Full House a great show for everyone. He can teach you a lot. One of the biggest things he can teach you that everyone can live a long life, even if it is a tragedy, such as the loss of a family member, takes place. Full House continues to attract new fans. With all this said, there are only a few things to say; Full House will never die, and the glory, throwing full house, because all shows that they can enjoy.
