I loved this movie when I was little. Today at 17 is one of my favorite animated films. Beautiful animation and attractive characters are only two things, how about this film. Although many people can not enjoy some of the songs, most of them well done and go along with the story. It focuses on Charlie fraudulently beautiful German Shepard that may seem unpleasant for some of the first ... but in the end you will win. <br /> <br /> I do not kiddies film any means. Often very dark and scary at times. Fun for Don Bluth animation fans and supporters. But no need to keep the fabric. ADGTH can never make me cry, and will do the same for those who felt the movie. Perhaps one of the biggest, Sun Disney cartoons of all time. Along with Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro <br /> <br /> The result :. Celestial masterpiece.
