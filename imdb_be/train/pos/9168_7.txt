this is a fantastic adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only problem I had with it is that I did not want ZIL Clark. I thought she was too old and did Jane seems to be a lot of timid. in the book Jane seemed much stronger character. I was really annoyed by this image of her. the part where this morning after Rochester asks her to marry him, and she runs to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. I think they made a bad choice in casting it. but Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eyre is worth a look. Another thing that made this version is not quite 100% it was the quality of the film. I know that it was done in the eighties for television. if it were a feature film, and of better quality, it would be ideal. My main complaint, however, is that the ZIL Clark was definitely too old.
