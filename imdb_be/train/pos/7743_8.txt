I went to see it 2 times this film, my friend went to see him in the party of liberation, and he told me that it was so great that I was expecting a lot of the movie, in the cap, I could not I enjoy it, because I have not watched it in nuteral position. The second time I knew what to expect, and I enjoyed it more than the first time. After the second time I felt so in the mood to throw a party. I loved the music, it's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> When Tom Barman improves his directorial talent he is a director, where everyone will be talking about. If you can delivere this film as your first, you have to be talented. <br /> <br /> Act makes some great Belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of talents as upcoming Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
