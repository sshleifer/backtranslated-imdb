Fire and Ice animated film set in a fantasy world. A film about a village that destroyed the giant glacier, which is the home of the evil lord named Nekron ice. The only survivor from the village is a young man named Lan, who sets out to avenge those who were killed by a glacier. Ice glacier moves along the ground fire and earth princess named Teegra kidnapped by evil creatures. Larn sets out to find her, and sets out to find and kill Nekron. Fire and Ice directed by Ralph Bakshi, who is one of my favorite adult entertainers. He brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of Fritz The Cat and some movies he wrote himself as a great film Heavy Traffic. I did not like fire and ice almost as much as I have another job Bakshi, but I still found the film to be enjoyable. It was a very good animation in parts and the story was interesting enough. Only major complaint I have is that I wish there were more stories to the film because the story uses a very thin and not much to it. I would also like the film was a little bit more, because it is in 80 minutes of work time. However, this entertaining action-adventure movie, which, unlike Fritz The Cat and Heavy Traffic suitable for children 8 years and older. I just want to be more developed story, and it lasted a little longer than it did.
