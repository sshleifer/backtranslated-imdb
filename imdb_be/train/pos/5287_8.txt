This is one of the very few cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian - and the dog space titled K-9 is also included. This episode of Looney Tunes very funny, has a pretty good cartoon animation (animation Marvin very well done) and the plot is well done. End strangely enough, so be ready for it, it's a little sad. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin the Martian was sent to earth to capture the essence of the earth and bring it back to Mars. With his trusty dog ​​K-9, Marvin set and soon find no other traces of the rabbit, but Bugs Bunny! He greets them treated, thinking that they are trick-or-treaters in their costumes. Little did he realize that they are prepared to accept this rabbit on Mars ... <br /> <br /> I would recommend this episode for those who like Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian, and Looney Tunes in general. With regard to the bothers beginning and middle of the episode, you are likely to enjoy. Enjoy a "hasty hare!" :-)
