This is one of those films / pilots that if you knew Battlestar Galactica this helps, but is not necessary. What makes this even more plausible of the story than the BSG, which is not something that is so far in the future. It has a depth to it, which is very strange, it was never released theatrically. The conductors could not be better chosen in such an experienced and very talented actors. Eric Stoltz as a wonderful father who will do anything to be reunited w / his daughter, but she really did not, and he will not do it no matter the cost. Paula Malcomson glory "Deadwood" is terrific, as his wife, as well. You are not sure that all his motives, be it love or money, or both, but that's what makes this even more intriguing pilot. I star in creating Zoe plays a relatively unknown Alessandro Torresani and its performance. Esai Morales is terrific in his desire to again and just as bad to be even with the fact that he wants more than his moral objections to see his favorite. I do not think it would be a good idea when it was announced, but only a pilot I am very happy to see how we got to the stage of history of the BSG. It's great to see Adam as a child already affected and influenced by different kinds of robots are beginning to permeate life at this stage. I just hope they can keep up with the story, so that we can understand even more how they got humanoid robots recruited. It is an almost perfect pilot and I hope they can keep up with a fantastic story. Even the visual effects better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. If you do not get in the BSG, @ least try it and I'll bet you'll be a fan and want to see how the story began to BSG.
