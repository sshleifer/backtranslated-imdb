If you like Star Wars / Trek, come see where they got their ideas and cinematic device. This is my top 2 favorite movies of all time, otherworldly, futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare "Storm") are not marred sophisticated foci (a later-A Lucas). And just because it was done in 1956, it does not imply that you can "see" the string holding the flying saucer up. It was the first film where you could not. The miracle was done in the "A-Film" scale economy and flavors were then drawn tightly against him. And the director of the pre-Wilcox "hit" was «Lassie Come Home». While I have not watched it, I guess, "Fred Wilcox» was the pseudonym of the director, who was already known, or later become, but at the time did not want to be associated with science fiction, which was strictly «B» genre then. It was a very very visionary production, or very occasional "mistake" on the part of people who finance Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There are massive scale Stein with live action almost microscopically inserted that Lucas used widely. There are intelligent machines, which go beyond the stereotypical "user interface"; "Computers," because they had to draw a lot less packed in later works. Star Trek "transporter" is visually almost unchanged Roddenberry 10 years later. And if the path / War technobabble turns you, the scientific reference FP are not overdone, and all accurate, even today. "Ship" is a set of comprehensive, sparklingly realistic, as well as all that you have seen, and more persuasive than anything "Trek" made for TV or movies. We did not get to spend as much time there as I would like. <br /> <br /> If you ever wondered how movies got in space so competently, watch FP will explain it all. This is definitely not a "caravan of wagons to the stars."
