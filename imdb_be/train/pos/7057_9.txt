As an adult I really enjoy it. I watched it with my 2 granddaughters and 3 1/2 years old was fascinated and 15 months in mice chuckled. <br /> <br /> fun music and animation perfectly. This is a continuation of what makes a return to Neverland are not fulfilled. A good next Cinderella story; but it becomes Drusilla? Another sequel? I hope so!
