Keep in mind, any movie (not to mention the documentary), which claims to any kind of truth, produce adverse and proportionate amount of cynicism from those to whom a suggestion and or the search for truth is meaningless, those of you who have already psychology masters , cinema, and the captains of the soul, no doubt, will find this movie once, after all, you already know everything you need to know. Congrats. <br /> <br /> For those of us in the minority as I am, I found «The Guide To perverts Cinmea» .... mostly brilliant, and worth taking a look at those who are interested in film, psychology and modern philosophy . <br /> <br /> bit like Scott Mclouds' "Understanding Comics", directed by Sophie Fiennes, inter-lattice Slovenian philosopher, psychologist and social critic Zizka entitled to many of the films and specif scenes he discusses. The cover is an image with the "Bird" (Žižka take boat to re-create the picture). <br /> <br /> varnish psychoanalysis does not necessarily scream evening great fun ... but it is! If you love movies, that is .... Having some knowledge of psychoanalysis helps varnish (Symbolic, Real and Imaginary) terms that are thrown around a little loose on the ground, but the scenes are selected and analyzed Zizka do wonder what is clear is that it is always it was for me a very abstract question. In fact, it's probably better to have a familiarity with the films he discusses than with the terminology he uses, which becomes clearer as the film goes on. <br /> <br /> Why do I love this movie, not because it catches larger movies to analyze and reveals great truths about the varnish, but shows in a very practical and reasonable manner, where the film and psychology (and philosophy default) occurs. <br /> <br /> Why «The Sound Of Music» a kind of fascist, why "Short Cuts" about more than just class and alienation, why attack birds in "The Birds", that there is to know about the mind of the "Alien resurrection ", which makes the planet," the Solaris "want, what makes" Psycho "and" Marx brothers "have to do with each other, and what the hell is David Lynch gets through to the cinema after the film ... well, Zizek has some ideas. <br /> <br /> voice role in «The Excorcist» and «Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith", it may be the most powerful movies and informed when it gets to the feminine sexual subjectivity, I begin to wonder. .. at some point, Zizek admits his feeling that flowers are a type of decorative dentatta vagina, they are disgusting and should be hidden from the children (as a joke, it seems, but ...). <br /> <br /> In any case, this is an exciting documentary that everyone who has ever seen the movie, and I thought that it meant something more than it was literally said, should make an attempt to see. <br /> <br /> and who are interested in Slavoj Zizek, it is necessary, as well as much less dry than the "reality Virtual», and more direct than "Zizek!", the other two pseudo-documents, the "Elvis contemporary cultural criticism, "as it is dubbed in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> «Perverts Guide to Cinema" is not about the role of sex in movies. Zizek argues that cinema is the ultimate pervert art, because it teaches "as a desire, not that desire," and it is the only modern form of art, which may allow these desires to be formulated. This is not a film about the search for reality in the movie, it is about the search for a movie in reality, and how important and exciting that can be. It is hard to find, and a bit long, but there is a problem, one of the most "exciting" movie watching experiences I've ever had.
