This is one of the greatest films of the 80th !!! He sticks out like "excrement in Punchbowl» !! I can not believe that Mad Magazine condemned it or any other. Nevertheless, they proudly put his name on the show with "Stewart», «I-Speak-and-nya-Enlish Chinese Lady" and "The UPS guy on speed." What to do? And I love Ron Liebman-on fox !! I wonder why he his name from the credits? It was his ridiculous role I know. Of course, it is not as a fox, as he was in Norma Rae. But, in my opinion, this film is right up there with Vacation National Lampoon. If you like films like Fat Fast Times, Last American Virgin, or any of the other '80s teen-oriented movies, you'll love it !! Rent and you'll see what I mean !!
