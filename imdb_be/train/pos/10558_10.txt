<br /> <br /> Charlie Kaufman did an amazing metaphysical anguish popular, but this Canadian gem makes it fun. <br /> <br /> As with most science fiction films less talk about the story, the better, but let's set the scene, two friends, Anthony and Dave was with the child, they can not cope with the world, and eventually this means that they no longer have to. But here begins even more problems. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, it made me smile long after the final credits, and this is a rare experience with so many pieces of mass production "is nothing" out there. <br /> <br /> do not miss it. <br /> <br />
