In the biopic "Lady with red hair" (the story of how the director / producer / playwright David Belasco transformed notorious society divorced Mrs. Leslie Carter in the international stage star), certainly not in league with the biographical, that other Warner with a similar vintage, «Yankee Doodle Dandy» (what?), but «Lady» is a nice film in its own right - and shares a lot of similarities with the classic Cagney. <br /> <br /> As well as "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "Lady with red hair" April on the old -time show business style. (Incidentally, both the film has a delicious theatrical sequences retirement, as well as the unavoidable background scenes and in the offices of the theater managers.) In addition, the "Lady", as in Cohen's biographical film, the supporting cast is made up of friends and favorite character actor period, all pretend first-class work, we remember them. <br /> <br /> Do I have to add that, once again, as "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "Lady with red hair" does not allow to get the truth in the way of telling a good story? But, as well as the "Dandy», «Lady» failed - nice - pass esssence greater than the life of a person of his show-business giant hero. Everyone knows that Cagney limned Kohan for all time in his brilliant and gentle figure in "Yankee Doodle Dandy ~ d» - but few viewers understand that Claude Rains made similar service David Belasco in "Lady with red hair" - and it's done in a big way, which is almost equal. <br /> <br /> Cagney rains-as-Belasco perfectly captures that galvanic facial legendary showman in all its glory oversized. Rains give a very pleasant, well-observed and surprisingly truthful life performance, as a man, all of Broadway was once called "the Master." To watch Claude Rains in action (which appears in each frame, as if he had a hell of a good time!) In "Lady with red hair" to see David Belasco jump to life on film, as if he could not wait to start on the main stem again. <br /> <br />
