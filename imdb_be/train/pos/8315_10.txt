Standard work lifting fame which has few high points. Number one, Lonett McKee, a sister, which gives stunning star does the job. The fact that it never became a huge sensation after it for me. Unfortunately, it is the nature of the support, and we have to concentrate on the soft nature of Irene Carter, Sparks, whose rise to fame is easy, sad, and unconvincing. However, when the girls come on stage and perform, the film comes to life. Original music Curis Mayfield has to be praised. Copy I saw was a very old VHS tapes. Image quality was very low, and production values, I guess. In general, it should be a goose.
