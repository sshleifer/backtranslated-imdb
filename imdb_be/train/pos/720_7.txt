Just imagine that the school would be, as in the world as it is: one big gang of children, who have very good taste in music and unite against the bad school principals and teachers. «Rock" N "Roll High School» takes place in this world. It's like a Ramones record coming to life. The characters are all as stupid, innocent and charming as the song The Ramones', and the music, of course, fiction. High school comedies really changed over the years, if you compare a film like "American Pie" with the late 70's classic, where there is no tasteless sex jokes are not produced at all. Since the remake is apparently in the works, it is probably safe to expect that the original charm is lost on the way and replaced by a vulgar, half-funny jokes Dick, Bill Hicks called them. However, the main problem is that the Ramones can not be replaced. They were the perfect team for this film, and no one else can even come close to take its place. Thus, the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone, as nimble and charming as it is. Gabba Gabba-hey!
