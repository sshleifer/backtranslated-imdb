Blob is a classic 1950s B-movie sci-fi film. You probably know the story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen & Aneta Korsan) see the meteorite hit the ground, and when they go to look for it, they run into the old with some strange ... clot attached to his arm. They take it to the doctor's office, and then to find out what happened. From there, the drop spreads, there is everything in its path. Special Effects cheese fun as the story. There are many nice touches, like the police, who plays a game of chess on the radio with the police in another region. This is not a masterpiece, but it holds a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
