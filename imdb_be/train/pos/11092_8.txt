52-Pick Up has never received the respect it should have. It works on many levels, and has a complex, but followable plot. Actors involved to give some of his best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider, John Glover and perfectly cast for deep images of the characters. Characteristic also vanity, which had turned it into a serious acting career of the unexpected ability she shows, and Kelly Preston, who is the hero will haunt you for days. Anyone who likes action, combined with the rough complex history will enjoy it.
