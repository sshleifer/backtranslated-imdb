It's a pretty good movie, but too Americanized in this predictability. Change kung fu football and Turkish family for the Pakistani one, and you get to watch Bend It Like Beckham (2002) almost scene for scene. A nice feature is the basis of the film in a progression of skirmishes with the mysterious ninja under the highway, starting with the unfortunate loss and progresses slowly until the last battle is not a victory over ourselves, as a master of kung fu stressed several times. On another level, the Danish life reveals a completely different image than it is foreign: non-proliferation of indigenous immigrants, who make up a significant part (in fact, most) of the Danish citizens, graffiti in the suburbs of Copenhagen, mocking with an immigrant woman begging in the film. All paint a different picture than we have in mind when one hears the word, Denmark.
