Was there ever a movie more charming than this? One of the reasons why it works so well that the group of actors really seem to interact and affect the lives of each other. The center of this is the "romance" of James Stewart and Sallavan that work together and can not get face-to-face, but that is completely connect with each other anonymously in correspondence. But there are also secondary characters, and unlike a lot of romantic comedies (including "You've Got Mail", a recent update "store") not only are they in a hurry, to support two wires, and their need. Everyone gets to be an integral part of a rich palette Ernst Lyubich a charm. One of the most touching scenes in cinema history takes place when almost a tragic accident, and Frank Morgan humbly looking for someone to have a Christmas dinner. You must see! **** to ****
