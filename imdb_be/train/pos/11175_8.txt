So often with Stephen King adaptation, you just get a set of characters recites dialogue from the books. It really captures the heart of the book. Maybe because they do not use large chunks of text directly from the book, but it's a little more with improvisation events in history. Much of its success is Miko Hughes as a child Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really act as his parents. There's a scene where Louis pressed Gage, and they are very natural together. Fred Guinea excellent. He nails Maine accent is not falling into a parody, and a wise and warm as well as Jude should be. (8 of 10)
