I sincerely believe that it was the best version of War of the worlds I have every seen. it was funny, but it's also educational film I learned a lot, and if I could I would have for this film. My favorite part was when the soldiers killed in the robot and another one came right out of him. the last film of the world war, I think it should have been more like the first, and it would have been better. But in any case I give this movie two thumbs up. <br /> <br /> and if they where to make another movie like this, I will definitely look at. <br /> <br /> Thanks
