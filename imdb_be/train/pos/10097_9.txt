One of the first OVA-x ( "original video animation") I bought, it still has to be one of my favorite anime titles. Cyberpunk sci-fi action comedy against the unlikely (for comedy, that is) background pollution near future in a gloomy society. <br /> <br /> The "heroes" are Dominion Tank Police, formed from the "if we can not beat crime, we get the big guns" philosophy, and which, as the name implies, patrolled the city in tanks instead of patrol machines, and who is actually much more dangerous than any criminals they're trying to catch. Most, if not all, of these cops are borderline (?) psychopaths and neurotics, giving new meaning to the phrase "free gunÂ». <br / > <br /> No less colorful and fun are their opponents, terrorist Buaku and Hench (Wo) men double yaty Cat sister, the existence of which always seems to involve giving the police a hard time tank <br /> <br /> animation is not state of the art, but it is very nice otherwise. colorful palette and cartoon look of the characters and mechanical fit nicely with comedy atmosphere Dominion. < br /> <br /> English dubbing is, again, a lot of fun. English version of the soundtrack is also very good. I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album that ... <br /> <br /> anyway, Dominion Tank Police high. This Japanese Cyberpunk SF with a lot of comedy, filled with completely over-the-top characters and situations, making sure that it never takes itself seriously. Highly recommended.
