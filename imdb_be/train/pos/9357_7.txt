In New York, a family man dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend, Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) accident on the street. Charlie became lonely and furious man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11 while Alan has problems to discuss their innermost feelings with his wife. Alana reties his friendship with Charlie, and they become close to each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life by sending him to a psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie's aggressive response to treatment and sent to the court. <br /> <br /> «Reign Over Me» is a good drama about loss, friendship, family and alone. September 11 has nothing to do with the plot; it could be in a car accident, fire or any other tragedy, as well as sexual harassment Donna Remar plays beautiful Saffron Burrows, Alan. But family dramas work, with the support of the large productions Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is quite impossible to admit, I do not know what it uses or excessive makeup to look older, but her face is strange. My vote is seven <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "Reine Sobre MIM" ( "Reign Over Me")
