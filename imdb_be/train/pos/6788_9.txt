Story and characters were among the best I have ever seen. Graphics were good for PS and cut scenes and voice-overs were amazing. I beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it. I felt the problems that were faced by the hero believable and realistic, and I believe that it deserves to continue. or at least remake. If they remade it for the ps3, I would like to buy a system just for this game, and perhaps, as MGS4 his amazing idea and execution system Dragoon enough to guarantee the rent and on top of this listing of the present invention, although sometimes deception (stupid buster coli) combat system drawing and plot make this game a certain purchase.
