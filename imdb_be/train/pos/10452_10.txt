I want Celine and Jesse to go on in their relationship, I want to tell them that they were made for each other, that in a lot of time in the film, we want them to die for each other. Their story is that we have ever wanted, and probably most of us have never reached. It's about love, but not stupid things, as in "Notting hill" or those kind of movies. That's life, and I believe in them, I think they fall ... it was such a clever and touching. I just finished watching it a minute ago, and I m still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them again as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I have now become a misanthrope, and felt as if love was just a fake, this concept, but with this film, I realized that maybe, somewhere, somehow, and some, if anything can really happen <br /> <br /> I am French, and not very well know in July Delpy, in spite of Kieslowski. "Three Colors: White" ... Now I have to see her other works, because she looks like an angel and received her perfect work. <br /> <br /> I've seen "before sunset" (continued in Paris) for a few days before I had seen "before sunrise" and it does not matter. They are both masterpieces. proof that you do not need, to impress the eye with the help of technology to get clean feeling. I'm sorry for my english, I'm trying to Best. <br /> <br /> Frank in France
