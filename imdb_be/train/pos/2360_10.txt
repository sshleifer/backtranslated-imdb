I felt it was very balanced, showing that Jehovah's Witnesses have made in defense of American liberties. He also showed a strong faith of two families who witnessed the first generation. I also appreciated, as it was shown how to become a Jehovah's Witness affects the family member, not seen, and it is difficult for them to accept the fact that they do not celebrate holidays, the sad part is that without witness family did not think of having evidence of their family during family dinners / visits or give them gifts at any other time, but for the holidays or birthdays. When it comes to health care witness want and expect a high level of care that people forget that a blood transfusion allow negligent medical treatment and surgical operations, while the bloodless treatment is a team of doctors to be highly qualified and trained, you I would prefer to treat your loved ones? I would highly recommend this video!
