"Twelve Monkeys» 's has all the elements to become a masterpiece of Terry Gilliam. Outstanding script, steady rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogues. In addition, he had a good nose for the cast. "Twelve Monkeys," is also the first film where Bruce Willis stands back from the kind of character he played in his previous films. Here, exhausted and hopeless character that you could nickname prisoner took a fearless and invincible hero (as it was in «Die Hard»). No matter how he tries, he is a prisoner of time. The film contains a very exciting end too. He got a real dramatic effect. But this is also a great movie about a man thinking about the danger he fears (in particular, those that could lead to the end of the world, and behold, a virus that may cause the disease). No matter how long it takes, "Twelve Monkeys" will not be appreciated, one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.
