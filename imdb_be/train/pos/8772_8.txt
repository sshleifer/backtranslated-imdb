Directed by Raoul Walsh looked like a Michael Bay with the "40-and the years before. And I mean that in a positive way, because I do not'm not a hater Bay. His films have only a high-quality entertainment, as well as films of Raoul Walsh were in his day. <br /> <br /> Â«Gentleman Jim" excellent quality entertainment. In addition to first-class director, he is also the first full toss, regular leading man Raoul Walsh Errol Flynn in the main part. <br /> <br /> What I was surprised how good boxing bouts were brought to the screen. They used some very dynamic camera-work, which also made a boxing match really uplifting and fun to watch the end of the championship bout against John L. Sullivan as the ultimate highlight. <br /> <br /> biopic about '40s and earlier were obviously still very different from the biographies is done today. Contemporary biographies often glorify his main theme and show his / her life from birth to death, basically, and all, mostly emotional aspects, among them. biopics "old" just did the same thing, as the films that were not based on actual real people that also means that filmmakers often use the amount of use of creative freedom with the personality of the main character and the events that occurred in his / her life. This film, too, not just a biography of the boxing legend, but also creates a beautiful image with the period when the illegal bare fist fights included in the modern era of boxing. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn does a great job, which shows the real life of the famous boxer James J. Corbett aka Gentleman Jim. Not too many people knew about it, but Flynn did some real good jobs that are in the "40s, of which this film is one. Fysicaly it also looks in top form. It also looks quite appropriate without his trademark tendrils in this film. The film also features some fine supporting cast and a fine, which is valid throughout the territory. <br /> <br /> A big and interesting film, which is also still really accommodating up real good today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
