Bettie Page was an icon of the repressed in 1950, when it represented sexual freedom, which has been ten years away, but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults. Gretchen Mol does an excellent job drawing a scandalous Betty, which was a small town girl with big ambitions and acting body. Her acting career did not go anywhere, but her body led her to stardom in the generally acknowledged fringe field. Photogrsphed in black and white with color interlude, when she comes out of the world operating in New York, it's made for television (HBO) film has good production and very believable supporting cast. The problem is that it is emotionally quite flat. It is difficult to form a commitment to the character, as Bettie portrayed as someone quite shallow and naive, given the business it was. Self-serving government studies provide a lot of screen time, which slows the film to the end. But it is certainly worth a look at the history of that time, and see the heavy-handed government repression that characterized the fifties. 7/10
