After watching a few movies Villaronga, I had a pretty clear view of it - it concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting about the rhythm of the film. That's why, despite the good critics, his films never caught the attention of a wider audience. The ARO it on the same line, but actually improved in the rhythm, especially at the end of the film. Frankly, I slept through the first part, cause even though the first part gives the necessary information, it is very slow. However, the second part of the absolutely amazing and makes the entire film is the best film ever made Villaronga. <br /> <br /> recommended.
