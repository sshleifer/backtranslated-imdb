] I have not seen this movie? I not even heard about this movie? It would not surprise me. One of the few truly "independent" films produced in the last ten years, no studio has not had faith in the film, and it was never picked for the main distribution. Independent company Kino Films, gave BOESMAN and Lena very limited edition with virtually no advertising, and most of the major film critics do not even bother to consider it. I think a movie based on one act, one set play about apartheid and its effects on two people never had a chance on the market today - and this loss of intellectual film-lover <br /> <br /> For the. recording, Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserve nomination Ocsar (as a filmmaker), but the film got such a small pump that I can not even blame the academy at that. This is a film that is a challenge that makes you think, and good, and it really requires the audience to meet him on his own terms. Taking this into account, it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment. Director John Berry wisely does not try to dress-up in Athol Fugard. Of course, we gave a few broken flashbacks and some spectacular scenic shots, but the film version BOESMAN and Lena is, in general, the story of two people who live in inhuman conditions. <br /> <br /> Deprived of their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) has no one left to attack, but with each other. The third character joins them for a while (Willie Jonah amazing mostly silent role), but the film's focus never strays from the title characters and what they have become. Bassett and Glover gives a bold performance as a broken pair performance that simply can not be improved. Vigorously and severely challenging both intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN and Lena deserves to be back home video. Hands down, the best film of 2000.
