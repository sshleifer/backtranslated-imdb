Spoilers ..... <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV some time ago, and recalled these products as less exciting than most Beeb costume drama. I rewatched on DVD this week, and still have the same impression of him. It's a good story at first, but weakened when the heroine becomes oh so terribly brave and noble, and returns to it quite disgusting to her husband when he was sick, and I'm so completely annoyed with her holiness. I believe it was the "right thing to do" when the story was written, and also contributes a lot of loneliness, and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband, as the marriage has not made it any more than his own, let alone carry on defiantly with her lover, as I expect, many modern audience would like to see. But it's hard to take santimoniousness these days, especially if the character was strong, courageous supporter willing to defend it against everyone. So new story, as in the movie, I'm controversial. It's good levels county, as in the novel, but slightly annoying, in today's view of life. <br /> <br /> Sustainable hero Gilbert was, of course, sacred tolerate varying his favorite and often enigmatic behavior and constant self-denial, and to be so consistently supported. so I feel it is a great shame that, when Helen was finally free to be with him, the script did not allow him a little more than about one minute to file one by one for a quick hug to come up with the name. It was just ridiculous, if we waited all this time, after all, that drips feelings unworthy husband at decent bit of dialogue and good hugs between the hero and heroine. Instead, the ending seems the filmmakers ran out of time or finances, or simply could not be bothered. "Here you are - one minute, do what you can to it, and then cut, as the director wants to go home ....." I left feeling completely dissasatisfied <br /> <br /> However, the very high . praise to the current Toby Stephens perfect and very handsome hero, and Rupert Graves great reverse and self-pitying villain. Tara Fitzgerald was satisfactory under the scenario that caused it to be depressing and quite hypocritical sacrifice so much time. <br /> <br /> However, I love the classic drama and almost all of them are a sight better than most of the "modern" dramas on television these days. So 7 stars because, despite the irritation, it is still a good watch.
