OK - you want to test someone, how comfortable they are with their youth and uncomfortable and manic changes Therin - then get their immediate reaction, watching the document about the noisy children are doing socially relevant horror suburban 80s. More than any movie I've never seen the film deals with the weights of sexuality and the ego in a way that is fully human, never boring, and purging as an integral goodness of young people, in fear of discolored mad adult world, where any strangeness in his youth accredited to anything from the madness to distortions. Mini-mogul Darren Stien, seems to reach a deeper understanding of his triumph and anticipation, as the patriarch of the world Strict child. What he finds in himself and others, is not always enough - but it shows how we can improve and harmonize with age. What does it mean to change without reflection. I love this movie.
