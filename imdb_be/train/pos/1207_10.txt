Still love it 17 years or so after I first saw it, I actually found that I lost my copy of it and was very upset. Despite this, no association with the original (that as a child I never noticed, and as an adult, I do not care about) is that cartoons * should * be. Just dark enough to be interesting and sufficiently light to be accessible to everyone. I am more than happy that my parents raised me to this kind of thing, rather than cartoons that we see today is that they do not teach our children anything. Music is great and gets stuck in my head forever ... I downloaded the whole soundtrack in one time or another.
