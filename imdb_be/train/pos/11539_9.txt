The odd couple is a screen adaptation of the best-known play by Neil Simon about TV reporter by the name of Felix Unger, who is a compulsive neat freak who moves with her divorced best friend, Oscar Madison, in a sports reporter and full of slush, after his wife Frances throws him out of her apartment. Already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and regrets from the time when he does it. classic comedy by Neil Simon first came to Broadway with Art Carney plays Felix and Oscar Matthau plays. Jack Lemmon takes Carney in the film version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only very funny in the roles, but so vividly real that it brings melancholy element in a pathetic figure, Felix Unger. Matthau, fortunately, was allowed to resume his role as Oscar, one of a kind gem of comic performance that provides a consistent laughs throughout. It Teaming with Lemmon and Matthau appeared comic gold, again visited nine other films. In both of these actors is no longer with us, watching this classic is more touching, but no less fun. Simon game was well extended to the screen with a soft prelude chronicle depressed attempt suicide Felix, who is the winner. the supporting cast includes Herbie Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haynes and David Sheiner like poker playing buddies Oscar and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as Piedgon sister, blind dates Oscar and Felix. Of course, later it became a great TV series with Tony Randall and Klagmen, but there's nothing like the original. Joy from start to finish.
