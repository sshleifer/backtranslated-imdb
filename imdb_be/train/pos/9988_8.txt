What I liked about the screen adaptation stone angel is that he remained faithful to the novel so! Great movie! As an avid reader, I think the worst film adaptations is that the book is somehow lost in translation. You can say that Stone Angel team was careful not to let that happen with this film. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn was perfect casting choice for the role of Hagar, and she, of course, the movie superstar. Nevertheless, I think that the Canadian actress (Christine Horne) Hagar chose to play in her younger years and has done an incredible job that requires a great deal of praise. I have not seen any of the previous works Horn, but I will definitely look for her after seeing her performance Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> I've heard, the Canadian theatrical release of The Stone Angel is going to happen in the spring or summer of 2008. I can not wait to see it on the big screen again!
