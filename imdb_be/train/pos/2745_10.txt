I've seen a lot of movies, but «In Cold Blood» stands in a class by itself. It differs in each department. The fact is that it helps some big stars to push it to the top, you have to pay closer attention to the characters and their stories, not the name on the marquee. Blake and Wilson to turn in stellar performances killer duo. The fact that most of the film was shot in real locations where the crimes took place, even in the house, add an extra shiver. Black / white picture darkens mood and great pictures. There are many great cinematic works there, but if I could vote for only one to add to the list, it is likely to be «In Cold Blood».
