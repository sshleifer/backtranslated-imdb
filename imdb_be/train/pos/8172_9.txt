I remember being horrified by the blood of the film, when I was younger, and gradually become less and less, so until exhausted enough, as I'm sure many other viewers have become so barrage gory films produced in the last few years has fueled me, but it did not scare me or make me squirm. "Dentist" was that around <br /> <br /> setup seems simple :. Mentally unstable dentist damages the inside of the mouth, and perhaps organs as well. Clever twist, however, is that the dentist hero of the film, so that instead of being some kind of one-dimensional bad guy without a clear motivation, its development is the widest of any kind, and he was a man and believable. The viewer thus feels sympathy for him, and his sacrifice, and instead rely on justice, to come to him, I have found, hoping that he would somehow find a way to cover their tracks and return to normal life . <br /> <br /> What is really "makes" a horror film is violent. And the "Dentist" does it better than any other movie I can think of. First, the film has a ton of tension that is that modern films of Gore, as a rule, lacking. In one scene, (), upset emotionally dentist and the patient needs to see a young child for the first time. When he reaches into the child's mouth, you hope for the sake of the child and the dentist, the meeting ended without injuries. I will not spoil what happens. Secondly, if the blood comes, it hits all the worse squirmy nerves. Once again, I will not give anything away. <br /> <br /> Of course, the next movie you've never heard of, it has drawbacks. Most importantly, it is solely for horror fans. In addition, as already mentioned another reviewer, taking place over a period of just a few days, we did not get any background on the characters. A voltage drops slightly during the end. But in reality, the fact that we even want to know about the background of the characters show as well that, and much of the film is strong enough that any small dips in voltage can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> strange, accustomed to gore movie after many years, suddenly want to cover my eyes from the sight of blood. "Dentist" made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable, and for this he gets his full approval.
