Well ... Vivah pretty good, but a typical movie Soorazh Barzhatya in. It shows different aspects of Indian families, weddings, etc. The film is more than good, but not very well. <br /> <br /> The big plus point is the direction of the film, music and Shahid and Amrita acting (especially the last scene). The film begins with the common factor of Indian cinema --- She did not like her stepmother. The history of this little film overall, but it's good, good enough to make the film a blockbuster. Point <br /> <br /> Less bad history of Bollywood film. Overall, I would say that half should see the film if you want to see the typical Indian family values ​​and of course love!
