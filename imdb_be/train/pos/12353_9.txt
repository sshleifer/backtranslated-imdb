Tragically beautiful film ... leads us to Japan, which does not exist anymore. Despite the technical expertise of Hollywood, I can still see the (Hollywood) film, which may correspond to the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town on the banks of the river, close to the sea ... Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai looked like the latest installment of the Lord of the ring in an attempt to capture rural old Japan. <br /> <br /> If you like a calm but tense storyline, it is a must see film. This is only a respite from the hollow grandstanding films as well as recent blockbuster movie you've seen a thousand. I think this is one of the best stories of Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a film about a geisha and brothels and complex rules governing life in such circumstances, it is not turned into a skin flap of. Symbols full depth and act with high intensity.
