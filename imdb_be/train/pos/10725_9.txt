Space camp is pretty decent film. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, as well as special effects are decent for a while. <br /> <br /> This film was originally released about the time the shuttle disaster, and that really put the basket on how popular it was. <br /> <br /> scene where doors open shuttle in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen, that is ... on TV ... it just looks average. I remember the scene in the theater. It made you feel like you were really there. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to see at the IMAX, but I'm sure that would never happen.
