William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) buy an old house, where the brutal murder happened years ago in a very poor condition, with the aim of restoring it. They move with her daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley), and become friends, their neighbors, Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However, the sinister events occur in the home, including the death of Sophie the cat. On the day of the birth of Sophie, the blood tube can be traced, and they leave the place, revealing the mystery later. <br /> <br /> Â«House that Bled Death" terrible and one of the best episodes of the series "Hammer house of horrors." Fantastic turn by revealing the mystery, and the tragic conclusion is truly awesome. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "A Casa Que Sangrou ATE Morrer" ( "house which bled to death")
