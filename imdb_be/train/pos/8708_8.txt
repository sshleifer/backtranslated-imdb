I watched it subtitled, as it was in Russian, but really enjoyed it. The protagonist is Sasha was born cursed with a deadly weapon, as an extension of his body. He lived all his life miserable because he was different, because the anger caused him to make the death. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found the love of a young woman named Kate was trying to take her away from it ends in a deadly battle. There was a fair amount of gore, but not too much for the weak stomached. <br /> <br /> Not for people who like a regular old Hollywood film, but also for those who love independent films. Interesting was the feeling of Asian fantasy film.
