Arthur after watching on TV many times I laughed so hard role Dudley Moore as Arthur Carefree drunken millionaire was hysterical, but John Gielgud as his servant / Hobson's father was equally charming. I bought a DVD a few weeks ago and watched it, despite the passage of nearly 27 years, he is still as enjoyable as ever was the role of Liza Minnelli as the love interest fascinated chemistry between the two was the magic. <br /> <br /> Arthur Bach (Moore) is a spoiled drunk millionaire who has a bar bill that reads like the national debt, it has no desire to grow and likes to behave like a child. Its activity is controlled by his dry English butler Hobson (Gielgud), it seems that no one really cares about Arthur, but him, Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum, if he did not marry a dreadful blonde secular Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) in four week it will cut off the legacy of his son in the amount of $ 750 million. <br /> <br /> However, Arthur meets and falls in love with Linda Marolla (Minnelli), a young working class waitress and tie a thief, he is now faced with the difficult decision of marriage for love or money. If Arthur dies Hobson finally grows and breaks it with Susan before the wedding, leaving it to save money and your true love. <br /> <br /> Arthur really Incredible romantic comedy for all
