This is my first comment on the IMDb website, and so I am writing this is what we are talking about one of the best movies ever! "Ne goryuy! Will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if you're not a fan yet!) With a Georgian choir singing traditions, and perhaps you will take the burdens of its own existence and just feel good after watching it :) I like a lot about this film that the actors are non-leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and as interesting and important as the central character. film starring Kikabidze (which is great), but you remember, film every person around him. you will find yourself referring and their lines, which have become well known to many Russian-speaking people. The film live. Simple, but deep, you'll want to watch it again and again.
