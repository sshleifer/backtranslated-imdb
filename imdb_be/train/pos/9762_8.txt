This is a very strange film director / animator Richard Williams. Everyone who knows about the work of William knows that it's a bit faulty (if not brilliant), but this one takes the cake. <br /> <br /> It consists of two hapless toy that should keep the new French doll by its owner lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of a few strange characters along the way. Force in this film lies primarily in its aesthetic qualities; its amazing character design, its powerful animation, and its sharp contrast of sweet and scary. brilliant animation Williams drew Raggedy Ann and Andy, as the real doll, floppy disks, and repaired rather than simple version of the cartoon dolls, which made it more plausible (at least in visual terms). Animation is shining on us to bring a camel-with wrinkled-tribes, whose body has two different persons controlling each end, the silent-movie chase with Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, greedy. <br /> <br /> eagerly animation itself, perhaps the most exquisite psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There's something about the animation that just makes your jaw drop - and every moment is something new. Life in what was considered "butterscotch Pit," Greedy massive clot of people living in and mercilessly eating sweets. He sings a song that I can not help but feel some sexy shades to keep, and then tries to kill Raggedy Ann for her candy hearts. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have about this film, there are too many songs. She constantly bog down the pace of the film, because there are sixteen of them. There are six good songs (which were to be the only ones), including Â«I Look, and what I see?" "Toy no girl", "the Blue" (although they do not need to get him to sing twice) "I never get enough", "Because I love you" and maybe "I'm home." Others simply seem unnecessary and frankly, not too surprising to hear. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing film with wonderful undertones, but if this is what you are looking for, you will not find better.
