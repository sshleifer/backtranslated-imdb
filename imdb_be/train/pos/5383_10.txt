I thought this movie was great, except that Corrine and Sean are new to business.It was packed with action and a bit of romance, but there are some moments when Corrine does not speak very clearly (if it is threatened with Sean gun), and she clenched her teeth ... Maybe she should have? I think that the role of Joseph and Sonny were portrayed very well, and it was obvious contrast.Also, because I watched the next action star, I'm sure Corrine and Sean made his own stunts that were performed very well.I look forward another film for the pair, as they make a great team, or possibly continued to put your life, perhaps, is called "making it big in the big apple", it may be this time of your life Carmen..Bet Excellent!
