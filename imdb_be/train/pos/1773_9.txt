Barriers seems to be one of those series that have been lost in the mists of time. After this transfer to the early 80s and one repeated, so no recessed track. It is a crying shame. <br /> <br /> Initially, I watched it when it was transferred to the southern region of the TV on a Sunday afternoon and had a classic photo Tea time. Although I do not remember much about the program, a few things that stuck in my head. The most typical were the unforgettable title. Sad flute music that accompanies trying to escape through the Eastern border and following a car accident (and this scene left me with an abiding love for the model «fintail» Mercedes, they used Merc 200). Although it was not obvious from the beginning, solution to the mystery of the series in these names. <br /> <br /> The story about a young music student trying to figure out what really happened, when he discovers that he was adopted was a lot of twists and turns, but the barrier was surprisingly "adult" children's drama. Benedict Taylor was very rich as Billy and it was a shame that he did not do much more. <br /> <br /> This is the quality of drama, well overdue for a DVD release, and I hope I get a chance to re-acquaint himself with it in the future. <br /> <br /> The bright memory of my childhood
