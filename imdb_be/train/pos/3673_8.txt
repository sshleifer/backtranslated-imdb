Back in 2004, I saw "The Truth", the contribution Tykwer Paris Je t'aime. When I saw him, I loved him, and became excited. He became my favorite short films and made me evaluate the format so much. Of course, I would like to see the whole movie, and I would even check who was tied, etc. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I finally saw him, affectionately Internet. <br /> <br /> First of all I must say that it looks weird. The photography is beautiful in every short and arrows, in the worst case, there is nothing special - but still brilliant and clear. Later I read a little thing here, and maybe it is like scanning the Kach gives more justice to all the work of DPA. Has particular favorites are the "Quais Sen" the first stage (that sunlight!), That Sin City-squire (but it is better for me) "the Quartier-de-la-Madeleine" and "fourteenth arrondissement" - but you know, what the hell, I like all of them: «True» or «Faubourg Saint-Denis» still makes me nervous with these bright colors (my eyes, they tremble!) and «Quartier Latin» gold signed on silver. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> So, here are some interesting short films. <br /> <br /> Now let's get to the content. I have a lot (and I mean A LOT) as the eclecticism that is so well felt. You should never have the same theme or treatment between the two shorts, and I think that the formula is restrictive to all these artists explore the beautiful and deepening the things in his underpants. I liked to come with a simple story of love in a crazy-Sino-music-in-paris-with-dogs-Schroeder in social commentary in terrorist comedy in a modest monologue. I love surprises! And this movie has them! It's great that they have a chance to flesh all the directors on the things that are not usually in the main movie (which I have come to despise much). It is not very experimental, but I can breath breathing space in these people. <br /> <br /> I like a little time, and I love action. I like simplicity and I love love. I like the simple feelings and the beauty and eclectic, and in general it is a film that is very very very nice to see, alone or with someone. To just feel. This left me feeling very well. <br /> <br /> There is something about the seriousness of it ... it's so honest ... <br /> <br /> What I did not like? Well, there are two shorts that are not exactly the best for me - "Quais Sena" (What a good-natured, of course, and perhaps even necessary, but it feels too much like a commercial) and the "Pere Lachaise", although I I love to act, I felt that this theme had been forced. But this, of course, only for me. «Tour Eiffel» I do not like, but I think it's probably because of my very different sensitivity of Sylvain Chomet? I do not know if this film has a special interest for people who already know and director of the actor, and so they can enjoy their interaction, surprises (note the Alexander Payne in a funny role) and basically "that will this director to do? "The big question. I enjoyed it very much in the way <br /> <br /> Now repeat :. Most of the shorts that I loved, and all of them together to form a beautiful and energetic mix. I would definitely recommend. Definitely !!! Thus, look, if you want Eclectic Beautiful Love!
