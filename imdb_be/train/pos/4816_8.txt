I enjoyed the movie very much. Certainly leave the audience wanting to know more, and there's really much more historically, to find out! <br /> <br /> Or the production team fall to the temptation of dramatization, especially in the case of the shooting? There will be a ton of cool stuff accurate hint? Prince Albert's contribution to the UK and the monarchy ensures the movie on its own, but it proved that, apparently, was not the intent here. <br /> <br /> costumes and sets are particularly good, but I alone in thinking that this production (which, judging by the length of the name at the end, of course, is not cheap) like bad etiquette expert for historical British court for Duchess York? ie Princess Victoria really push all the truffle / patty (?) in her mouth during a conversation with the Prime Minister in the company of His Majesty with his mouth full? <br /> <br /> "could never really felt sympathetic to Victoriain this movie, or even in her place at all. However, he loved casting a principal whose action was compelling, the same scenario will really allow us to exactly know them well? I always felt completely unbiased, uninformed outside observer, much more than with "Mrs. Brown" or even "The Queen." But to be honest, I still could not take his eyes off the screen, except that for some of the more avant-garde techniques of the camera, which is pulled from time h Wed.
