Classic series, which should be at least repeated or released DVD.Billy Toth, after realizing that it will be adopted after the death of his parents, embarks on a journey to find his real parents.After various rites, his search ends in the discovery that his parents identity was stolen and used by man to dealers in Europe! If I remember correctly, a series ends in the Austrian (?] The ski slopes and the top of the pursuit of rock that leads to the death of a traitor Billys parents. This series was all shot on location in various areas of Europe and appeared polished and very well done with some episodes, penetrating into the realm of film noir and crime thriller.The main arc often obscure slice of life of Billy went through his years working to find his mother and father secrets.A a class act, but underrated and forgotten.
