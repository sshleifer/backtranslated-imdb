When I first saw this film in 1980, I was in my teens and middle somewhat reluctant to see it, because I thought I was an adult and "Sesame Street / Muppets» age. I honestly do not remember, I liked it at the time or not. However, somewhere in college again I watched this movie, and it wound up going (and stay) in my personal Best Movies Ever collection. <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with humor, which goes far beyond what one would expect from the Muppets. I mean, obviously, the Muppets have always appealed to adults and children, because the humor is aimed at both generations. But come on ... Janice overheard to say to someone, "I do not take your clothes for any person, even if it is art" ... there is a joke from father to son, if the son is in love with Kermit the Frog when the father does not want to hear ... Gonzo saves chicken with mouth to mouth resuscitation (sp?), and then says: "I think we are doing now" ... these and many other moments in the film had me rolling Add to this a very intelligent dialogue is very clever New. York / Broadway «wink wink" humor, the usual large number of celebrity cameos, and some sap audit pleasant songs that do not border on the "kid-level cheese" in general ... this film is a masterpiece! I do not throw "10" 's on a regular basis ... but this one deserves it. More than 20 years later, this film completely keeps perhaps even to a greater extent. the Muppets have never been and never will be again, how funny and smart and just great as this movie was and is. --- Q
