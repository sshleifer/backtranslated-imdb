The pilot is very well done. It establishes how the relationship of characters in future episodes. I do not think that someone could create a better pilot for this show. He shows great creativity on the part of the writers. Although not everything was straightened, because it was the first episode, a lot of events that take place in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot. An example is Ross and Rachels future relations. Even though, the nervousness of the first episode appeared, he was overcome by a strange story and the cast excellent choice. <br /> <br /> Bravo. <br /> <br /> A great start to consummate comedy!
