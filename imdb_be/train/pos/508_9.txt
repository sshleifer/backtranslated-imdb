T`Pol change sensors to track the Suliban enterprise spacecraft until it reaches the planet X.

I decided to buy a DVD box of the first season, and this is the first episode surprised me. Adventures of the first enterprise, Captain Jonathan Archer, beautiful T`Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip perfectly, at least in the pilot. I noticed in IMDb, this episode is actually divided into two parts, but they have only one DVD, so my review is valid for both. I did not want a musical theme, which I found very annoying, but it was an exception in this big show. . My vote is nine <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
