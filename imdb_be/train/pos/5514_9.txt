I watched the first part of two days ago, and today I saw the second part. Of course, these two worlds apart, so I'm a little shocked everyone that I had just seen. I felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of the death of Che; for me, it clouded the whole movie. I believe that this is exactly what Soderbergh wanted to feel, slowly changing the inevitability of his death. Part two was so pessimistic compared, again inevitable, but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia it was so negative. Policy movements in Bolivia have been alluded only, but rarely faced instructive. For me, memorable scenes were at the end of the film: the confrontation with the jailer and softer conversation with Bolivian officials where that official Che issues about the inability of peasants to support his revolution. I do not consider national differences play much role in the conflict, Argentina against Bolivia. I thought that Soderbergh deal perfectly with the inevitable problems of security in the revolutionary struggle; how do you get food without the antagonism of farmers who do not have enough self. I was amazed at how difficult it would be to try something like trying to Che. I believe that it is all in terms of; there is enough anger against the government to start moving; It was not in Bolivia. Che understood the terrible corundum revolutionaries in his letter, Fidel read at the beginning of the film: If not now, when, 50 years later. Very thoughtful and well-made film; make every effort to see it.
