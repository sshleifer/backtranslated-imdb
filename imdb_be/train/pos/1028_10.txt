I must say that from the very beginning, when I watched the movie the movie Stargate I'm not blown away or whatever it was, the average science fiction movie, with great potential, although the film was not, um, strange as other science fiction movies such as star wars or foreigners who, if there Sci Fi fanatic and will recognize one of the two names of the countries, even if I do not like hardcore Sci Fi fan, like some people, I do not remember a single line from one of these films, I'm not a big fan of wearing a star wars T-shirt, in fact, if seen me, I would look like an ordinary man to you, ah becomes slightly from the point here, but my point is that you do not have to be a hard core Sci Fi fan like a big number, which unfortunately , ended after 10 amazing seasons, without a drop of its qualities as he got closer to the end, in 2006 <br /> <br /> though I do not like this film a lot, I was totally looking forward to the first season in 1997, and let me tell you, the special effects were just one of the br illiant things about the series, the chemistry between the characters simply blow away I have a special influence were just as good, if not better, than most of the Sci Fi show that work today. I must admit that I never would have gone to Sci Fi, if it were not the Gates, and my dad, who really got me into Sci Fi, when I was 6, and I'm glad he did, other wise I Wouldn Â«t seen a brilliant show as SG1, which is now, in my opinion sets the standard for almost all Sci Fi series and movies, mostly when a new Sci Fi series is not better or worse than SG1, it is not worth watching. basically it is the best Sci Fi show today, and if you do not watch it, you have no idea what you are missing!
