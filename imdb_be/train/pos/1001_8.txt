Several funny and well-developed fighter, having Jamie Foxx as the hapless, fast-talking bully, which is selected excessively demanding US Treasury agent (David Morse), which will be released on the streets of New York to find a picky computer thief / hacker (Hutchison) who stole forty two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot. <br /> <br /> «bait» notes feature for sophomore Antoine Fuqua ( "to replace Killers") and it solves the problem quite well, even if it is not the beginning of his first film. The fact that these two films have in common workflows that flat-out great. <br /> <br /> Foxx is pretty good here, although his character is annoying at the beginning, but throughout the film, I started to catch on. Hutchinson amazing as the mastermind, who can be ruthless, as John Malkovich and patient, as the late Laurence Olivier was «Marathon Man». Morse well as an agent that comes with a brilliant plan to get those who have done this at any price.
