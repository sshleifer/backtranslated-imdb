I remember as a promo for the show, before it appeared in 1993, I was 8 at the time, and now, at age 22, he feels strange to have seen this cult show the beginning and the end, and look at the it.The 90 all of a sudden, it seems, so far, that is more than a decade. Anyway, I looked MonsterVision all the time, as I'm a big fan of the movie monsters and horror movies. It was like a version of the 90-chiller theater. MST3K If you can get, why not show DVD Joe Bob, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. Many comments Joe Bob and information about the films were just paddles. Most of the films shown at the show was a B or C class, but he showed a lot of movies at home, as well as Hammer films from England, who top the expression, as well as many of the time-lapse greatness Harryhausen. Many of them were very nice click, you would not see anywhere else, like the Japanese Sci-Fi movies, except Godzilla course, familiar to almost everyone, and independent films like Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new decade film preservation and the more independent-minded directors, I think MonsterVision be a good show for the IOC to take, since they already have a hit with Grindhouse show the IOC. I'm sure the show will be picked up again nostalgia reasons, one day, I think, will have to wait and see. By the time "Thats Great Television"!
