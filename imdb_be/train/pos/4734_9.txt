I'm a big fan of Jet Li! He is the best action movie star HK alive ... and so - this movie rocked! I saw him in the video store and, as it was in the section of the main part of the main video store, I do not register their presence in the first place, and had to look twice. I knew immediately that I would lease. My only obstacle (I guess I expected) that it has been dubbed (Aaargh), not subtitled. Elsewise, original / weird / cool plot of the film, and fully to the actions made it one of the best films Jet Li ... even if they all fall into this category ....
