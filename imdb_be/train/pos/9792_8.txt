Once a year, "comes" movie, as it makes things easy for you. You do not need to make an effort to think that it's good, it's easy. You enjoy it while you watch, and you take it with you. I can not say that it is absolutely perfect, but it's close. Acting - big -interesting story with elements of suspense. This is a small family history, are largely predictable, but it is no secret that in itself questions. this is how it takes blind girl, to get to him. I was amazed at how the director depicted a deep connection (blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I do not like that much the actress who played the mother, she was too rigid and unnecessarily.
