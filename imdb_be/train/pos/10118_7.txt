I enjoy Miikes films about yakuza, this is one I saw about 2 years ago and it is really fu ** Edda my head. I've never seen such a sick and twisted thing. The story is well and the actors are doing their job very well. I have not seen in the UK or Japan version, but I have to say that I believe that the German DVD little censorship. If you have not seen the movie already and live in Germany, maybe you'd better look at the DVD of the Nederlands or Austria. I-ON DVD contains a lot of very tough and unpleasant scenes, but at the opening, I felt that something was missing one or two very short scenes. <br /> <br /> All in general good perverted movie with crazy characters and high levels of violence, that's what I like to Miike !!
