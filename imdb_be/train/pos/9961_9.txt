I have to give as it moves almost a perfect rating because the content is really great. As the previous reviewer noted, I have no idea how this film was in IMDBs Bottom 100 list! That's ridiculous! Other movies - especially those that share the theme of the dance - I can not hold a candle to it in terms of its combination of first-class, believable action and amazing dance <br /> <br /> Since the beginning. to finish the main story (it's not just about winning the competition) is very easy to penetrate, and surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters in it there is a 2-dimensional by any means and, at the end of the film, it's very easy to feel emotionally invested in them. (And even if you're not crying type, you can get a little sentimental eyes to the credits roll.) <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie for fans of dance and, even more so, for those who can appreciate a touching story and well acted. As it moves is not perfect, of course (the film?), But it is definitely a cut above the films that use beautiful faces to hide napavsyruyu story and / or characters that lack substance. Actors and settings in this film makes for a very realistic ride, it is equally captivating thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers!
