I really enjoyed this film. The acting was terrific as was the plot. Jeff Combs has more talent than he admits to. Only part of this flick, I would have changed was the end. Death creatures was too terrible for Sci Fi Channel. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting religious posts in this film. Jeff Combs apparently played the figure of the Messiah and the creature (or a shark, if you prefer) are an anti-Chirst. There were some very frightening scenes that had that "end of the world feel. I noticed it only after my third viewing of this classic creature features. I know that many people will not get the reference to Christianity, but if you look closely you will get it.
