I first saw this film when I was about 8 years on television in the UK (where it was called «Laupta: Flying island"). I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated after a while, and I missed it. I was fascinated by the story and characters, but most of all in the obsessive beautiful music. It would have been the original English dubbed version, which I have seen - sometimes erroneously called «Streamline Dub» (dub was actually on the Ghibli itself and only applies Streamline), which, unfortunately, is no other than as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box -set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that the release was partly spoiled by Disney. Voice acting is okay, but the dialogue does not have the same raw energy that "rationalize" dub or Japanese original was, and I think that James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play a leading role. They made some meaningless changes, such as changing the name of the protagonist with the "groove" to «Patzu», and added some dialogue. But worst of all, I feel that they have destroyed a lot of scenes with annoying music - the opening scene with airships, such as was originally silent, but was spoiled because of the idiotic request of Disney, that have music playing when someone does not say that I find annoying many Disney films. <br /> <br /> This film still blows away the last cartoon, and I can not recommend it highly enough. The plot is simple, but fun and the film shows the talent that is unfortunately lacking in most modern mass-market, homogenized animation.
