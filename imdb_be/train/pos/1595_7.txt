Although I would say I love the show, I was expecting something completely different from when I first saw "What I Like About You" I expected to find something along the lines of «All That» (I'm not sure if this is greater) but I must say I love the show, and while I do not classify it as a breakthrough show, it's really cute, and I love the chemistry between the characters, as well (including the supporting cast) <br /> <br /> I would definitely say that it's great to see Wesley Jonathan back to the screen, because I really loved him in the city of Ai. I also saw a woman who plays one Valeri in the popular and while I think it was fine show, I do not really like her character on the show, because it's just not my cup of tea, but it rounds it pretty well
