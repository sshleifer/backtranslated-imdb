I remember that in a movie theater Salem (where I used to visit "Kiddie Matinée» S almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio, when I was a little boy, and never forgot. He just hit me and my friends. I wish there was some way I could see it again! I tried to find some collection of shorts or something like that did not give any results. I just recently found out that it was a film Cousteau and blew my mind, even more. How the hell, he made it beyond my understanding. In fact, the fish MOUTH cat at one point, if I remember correctly! If someone can help me find a way to see it again, I would be very grateful!
