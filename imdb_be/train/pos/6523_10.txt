Of course, the story in this film was «Hollywoodized» - but it is not a single bit of history re-written for the masses. Lafitte joined the Americans, because he considered himself a Frenchman, so hated the English, not because of any feelings of patriotism of the people, which had over New Orleans, just a little while ago; he violated the contract and returned to smuggling, which led to his swimming in Galveston; He was a petty criminal and a villain than a hero * or * fencer. But who cares? This is one movie that's very fun - and his face, we all wanted to go to Jean brave girl, not prim governor's daughter. Brynner again rises above the mediocre writing, to give a fascinating insight.
