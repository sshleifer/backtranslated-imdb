Let me say, I have never considered the movie on IMDb earlier; However, I do in the video business itself. And coming from the insightful; I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this film is that it should be short. It has a very good story, and the other thing I love- (even better twist ending). The discovery was made very well, I loved the video chosen for him and how it was edited. <br /> <br /> I'm not a B & W, but this film uses the effect it works. And any film that is all that matters. movie stream works great and editing was done very well. On the technical side of things (that is, I usually work on) are all very well done. There is no core technology. things to show. Only a small one I have is that the end credits a bit brisk. This is probably due to errors in the mapping. Let me also say that I would prefer to see more of the love scene, but I'm a guy (so you can chalk that up to a factor man). <br /> <br /> So overall I rate it at 9/10 It is worth watching if you're a fan of India and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. sorry for bad grammar or spelling.
