"Stairway to Heaven" is a remarkable invention of film, probably never duplicated. I rank it with the "Wizard of Oz" and "The African Queen," although it is a very different kind of film than the "African Queen". "Stairway to Heaven" psycho-drama, which uses the concepts of productivity and technical effects, which, as far as I know, is quite unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a combination of B & W and color images - as in "Oz," but the contrast value goes far beyond a simple - but beautiful - the effect achieved in "Oz." In «Stairway» objectives and contrast effect can only be described as powerful. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant aspect of "Stairway" is the concept of "time" and how it is used here. How can anyone have conceived a better way to make time stand still ?? literally? And then there is the very Stairway! <br /> <br /> If you have any imagination at all, you will agree with me. "Stairway to Heaven" is a real gem.
