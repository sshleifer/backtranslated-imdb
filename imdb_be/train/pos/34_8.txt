What a funny movie! If you are a fan of Giallo, Red Queen Kills 7 times it is a real winner. To begin with, it's hard to go wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both well - particularly wide-eyed innocent Bush as a fault covered by women, fearing for their lives. Destruction scene in the Red Queen Kills 7 times especially good and has enough blood to make the most of the fans happy. One of the first killings came quite unexpectedly and really gets the film off to a good start. Killer, The Red Queen, is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking for the killers that I've seen in an Italian movie. In the 70th and fashion collections are excellent. In fact, all the visuals are interesting from laughing Red Queen running across the bridge at night is one of my favorite moments in the film. Intricate plot held my interest throughout. Finally, Bruno Nicolai score may be the best that I have heard from the composer. The main theme is so catchy, I could not get it out of my head for two days. <br /> <br /> Only two subjects with Red Queen Fraga 7 times coming in the final film. Firstly, the person responsible for killing too easy to spot. If you've seen more than a couple gialli, you will not have any problem to determine who is behind the killings. Second, the ending feels a little too quickly and, as a consequence, it is a bit confusing. I'm definitely not someone who needs to be spelled out each plot point to me, but I recognize that at a loss to explain it all. The second view may simply clean it up.
