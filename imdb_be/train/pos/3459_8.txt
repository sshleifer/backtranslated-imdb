Along with Makguen and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was an iconic villain Columbo. The first "proper" Columbo episode, after two autonomous pilots, "Murder by the Book" is not far off classic status. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, one half of a murder mystery writing partnership, his partner Jim talented one , while Ken has no talent, except the gift of eloquence and ability to promote the book. when Jim decided that he no longer requires marketing skills Ken Ken hatches a plot to kill Jim. Also it is not a new story on the fact is the realization in real life murder plot tnay line, originally intended for one of his books. <br /> <br /> It does not take much time to Columbo work that Ken is a killer, although, unfortunately, another murder should take place (Ken songs and then kill a key witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to obtain a conviction. <br /> <br /> There is nothing at all wrong with «Murder By The Book», but it is not quite top-notch. I would just give the "Publish or Perish "advantage on this: both episodes have Jack Cassidy and the world of publishing, but the" Publish or Perish "is fraction tighter and unpredictable. But it's still a great episode.
