This is a great, funny horror film that captures the essence of the mid to late 80th obsession with how evil was allegedly thrown. I remember the shocked teen from metal when I was a kid. It does not help that I found the desecrated graves at the cemetery in my hometown when I was ten. It turns out this amazing metal old child unearthed the body and use their bones in a strange sort of sacrifice to Satan. So, maybe things like deters me from the metal for some time, but I love it now, as a 24-year-old. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD is used for 6 bucks, and I expect that it sucks because of the lame cover, but to my surprise, it is excluded. It's all about at the demonic power of metal. And you have to love the scene where the guitar shoots lasers and evaporates Headbangers in the crowd. This film is amazing, if you love 80s metal and bad films, this one is for you. 9/10!
