The film was very sweet and touching! I cry almost every time I watch a movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone. The film was so inspiring to me. The actors did a great job of acting, and the film was played very well and did. The film was about a little girl who belonged to the parrot from whom she named Paulie. Paulie got separated from it by his parents, because they thought it would be better for her. <br /> <br /> After Paulie experienced so many people that he was in a cell in the basement of. Finally, the Russian people, get a job at a place like the janitor. If you found Paulie Paulie in the basement and began to talk to him to tell him the story of his life. After all, people helped Paulie reunited with Marie (little girl who raised Paulie). Love overcomes all obstacles.
