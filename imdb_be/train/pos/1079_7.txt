Although not seen too many movies to you, of course, we saw the main plot threads in too many films since then. <br /> <br /> None of the Grant or the best Loy films, they make outstanding efforts together. In the end, with this talent and a very good supporting cast, you know you will laugh. <br /> <br /> The film is easy to have some dramatic spotting, but keeps the story that is moving and gets you to smile all later. <br /> <br /> a great example of the classic American film fare that has stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Saturday afternoon Definite fare, heavy on the popcorn.
