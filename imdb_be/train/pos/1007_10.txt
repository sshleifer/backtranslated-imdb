Okay, let's get this clear. I really do not fiction, but for some reason, I love the Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neill takes his SG-1 team through the Stargate. Circular device that creates a wormhole. This gives you the opportunity to travel to distant worlds. This may sound like your typical sci-fi series, but it is not so! The site is now not in some distant millennium, as well as many other sci-fi series. I believe that great. This gives you the things that are happening, and you can touch, and you can go in the series at any time without having to learn a lot of new terms, and the names of all devices. They have some, of course, but thanks ONeyl who like to keep the terminology simple, there is not much. <br /> <br /> In the series there is a good mix of action, humor and drama. If you like a load of special effects you're not going to find it here. They do not use a lot of bad, but a limited number of well-made special effects.
