Lost is a very well-made television series about some people who have lost on the island. there are so many twists and turns, you can not decide which one is your favorite character, one minute with him, he is doing something, so it cool, then Shes going to do something like that SHE is the coolest is unknown is collected and also, how are you going to burst episode ends and yours as noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! so you have to wait a week and see the next episode, but worth the wait. Gripping, action, romance, humor, it got all this in addition to the half-naked girls, but that is good because it means that you can focus on the story and the story longer, it's all about. so if you like a good story, and how the unknown is a good one, but 24 I think that's probably better. (I have an opinion about that too, so you can check it.) I would have given a good lost 8 of 10, mainly because it is so unpredictable that you never know what will happen next.
