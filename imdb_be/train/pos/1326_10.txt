I saw this movie at the college film festival back in the 70s - I've been waiting forever for this movie to come out on video (after all, it is output). This was done in Brazil, so I guess that's why he did not make this video yet. I checked the video store for the past 15 years in anticipation of this wonderful movie to come out! This is one of my favorites - but keep in mind that it amazing how Werner Herzog strange - its strangeness stems from its super-realism <br /> <br /> The film is based on a true incident back on. a few centuries ago, in the previous colonial times, when Europeans first encountering tribes in the Amazon. The white man is mistaken for a wild tribe of cannibals, as an enemy, so they are going to kill him. Before you send it, though, they make it a part of his tribe (their custom). The entire film is like watching a documentary National Geographic, as it becomes recognized as a member of the tribe. That's all. Space story? No. Intensive penetration of a variety of human life? Defined <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... be warned ... this film has some nudity. - it is not some Hollywood trash movie about noble savages ... This film tells the story as it was (re-read the above: National Geographic, super-realism) <br /> <br />
