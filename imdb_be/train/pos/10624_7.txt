I thought that I should qualify my position after reading other reviews. The film is not large, but it has a lot of great items. Lighting and scenes together with the camera operation are great. The story is slow and weak, but it is interesting. Act is bad, but no worse than what you find on the SyFy Channel. Music is pretty good, and good blood. It has great skin face in the film and made Bruce Campbell. I watched the full movie and while generally predictable, it was even better. Women are quite attractive and lead actor doing a good job, to be a thoughtful and terrible. The film was surprisingly clean for the modern cinema and the corresponding violence for children 13 years and older. There was no sex scenes. I gave it a 7 out of 10, and I think that's fair. I would like to see it again, when I did not have anything better. Gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film, the devil is pretty awful.
