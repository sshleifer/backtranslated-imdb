I do not agree with one reviewer who compared the film with American International Pictures. Basil Deardon sent brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to reflect the increase in juvenile crime in post-war England (but without sentimentality "Blackboard Jungle"). The cinema was very rich as it really captures scariness and isolation of a huge housing estate. The estate looked like an old prison. Stanley Baker was very rich as a seasoned detective, reassigned to the division of minors - "urgent, urgent - Theft - five choc ice" !!!! he believes that he is the butt of many jokes David McCallum p. said that he was one of the best young talent in Britain fifties. (He was a very ambiguous role in another Stanley Baker film "Hell DriversÂ»). His portrayal of Johnny and fanatical following he inspired was very scary. Anne Heywood was also very good as Kathy cynical. I would not say that was a romantic podagovor it. <br /> <br /> Detective Jack Truman investigates a string of arsons someone named "Firefly." Just as he finds evidence that could lead to a breakthrough, it is intended to Division of minors - it's pretty disgusting to t ie, that he feels that he is not proper police work. Among all heckling he received his first call - to 6-year-old twins Murphy Report operating at local stores stick !!! <br /> <br /> Taking the twins home, he meets his brother, the charismatic Johnny, and their embittered sister Kathy. He begins to appreciate how life on the terrible neighborhoods can turn small child offender. If it receives more active participation of the family, he realizes that there is a close link between the fires, Johnny and frightened the Chinese young people who work for the laundry. The local priest (Cushing in the unusual role of Hammer horror) explains that, when Johnny was younger, he saved several people from the burning building and was declared a hero. He wanted to regain a sense of importance and be useful and felt that he could use the glowing lights. The school siege was lifted in a very real way and the audience felt the child's fear - the teacher (thinking only of their own safety) runs away and locked them in a room with a frightened shoot !!!! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a really great movie that tried to show some of the social problems of the UK discovered after the war. <br /> <br /> highly recommended.
