As much as I enjoyed the movie Hanzo razors, three quite clearly: "Who got the gold?" The ultimate adventure for Japanese Lawman with a large package is quite enjoyable piece Pink films, but offers little in terms of new ideas, while a big step backwards as far as it is concerned blatant. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the appearance of a female ghost, and it looks as if he is going to explore the supernatural territory, it might have taken a number of interesting in a new direction; Unfortunately, after a ghost, is not nothing but a ploy Scooby Doo style (devised by corrupt Treasury officials keen to keep people further away from the lake, where he was hiding stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue content rework familiar elements of the first two films, resulting in a rather callous business. <br /> <br /> Once again, Hanzo headed the investigation, which requires a woman to question him ways to use his powerful penis, cut his enemy, and the abuse of his superiors. Along the way, we get wild orgies, rape natured (Hanzo forcing himself on women, which is wound up appreciating its arbitrariness), and bloody sword fights. <br /> <br /> If you have seen and appreciated the first two films, you can also see the fee to complete the set, but keep in mind that this is probably the least satisfied with one of them. <br /> <br /> 6.5 10, rounded up to 7 IMDb,
