I must say that this mini-series was the best interpretation of "Jane Eyre" favorite novel. Both Dalton and Clark are very believable as Rochester and Jane. I have seen other versions, but none compare to this. The best for me. I could never imagine someone playing these characters ever. The last time I saw this was in 1984, when I was only 13. At the time I was a bookworm, and I had just read a novel by Charlotte Bronte. I was totally fascinated by this miniseries, and I remember, not missing a single episode. I would like to see it again, because it is so good. :-)
