Winter day, December 28, 1986, two bored 14-year-old movie rental. "Hmm, Police Story, looks interesting", "Who is Jackie Chan?" "Never heard of him." Two hours later, after watching the film, in a daze, we would like to know more. 16 years later (and severely out of pocket by JC collection of movies!) The film is still grabs me like no other. Okay, maybe I have a soft spot for him, as it was my "firstÂ» (Cannonball Run is not listed !!) JC movie, but it's a great movie. It has all the classic elements of the JC, Action, Comedy, Action, and the heart of the action! Some comments say it is dated, it was made in 1985, of course, it's from! But then should Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in the Rain and The Godfather !!!!!! Without such movies as the story of police, where a Hollywood action will be today? standards established by the PS, many scenes were stolen for use in other movies. To really fully appreciate it, you should see it in widescreen format, you miss so much of the film otherwise (yes, he really fall off bus that goes around the corner!). If you have not already, watch this film right now !!!! <br /> <br />
