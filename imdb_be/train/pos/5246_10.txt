This film deserves a 10 for his brilliant image of the world as experienced in the minds of Playboy. At that time I discovered that the world is morally repulsive, the film did the best that the story has to do and that is to take us through an experience that we would otherwise never experience. Tim Meadows so convincingly reflects Leon Phelps, and the story is so attracted me in the world of reckless Leon, I momentarily forgot that I was watching a parody of the world of Playboy and was forced to rebel against him. This is the ruin the film because of its big and bold achievement in the narrator comes at the price of its own success. Understanding that the vast majority of viewers will respond only to the history of the film, which is on the surface, and reject this story, I'm embarrassed to be misunderstood by them and admit that I loved him. I loved it not just their exciting insight into the mind of Playboy error, not only for its fun image idiocy sexual desire of man, but also for his courage to fearlessly examine what is in the shadow of heterosexuality. In addition, this is ridiculous.
