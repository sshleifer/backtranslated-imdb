It's not often a movie can literally make the entire audience laugh, and five minutes to fill your eyes with tears. Many films try to do it, but few can deliver the emotional impact that this film made. Adam Sandler almost pulls you with its heated and often violent outbursts, but also makes you laugh, when the shadow of his past does not pull it down. I will not spoil anything, but there is one scene in particular, should have their watery eyes and lips were trembling. Even the most macho of men to be heartless bastards not to feel something while watching this film. Don Cheadle gives another great performance, but because of the light Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid performances, but nothing in the line of the two leading roles. Sandler's humor is still present, which actually saved the film from the boundary line depressing. There are a few laughs to be had, but do not think that you will stay there for a long time, because it is getting serious again without much warning. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on about how good this movie was on just about every emotion a human body contains, but I cut this one short. I feel that there is no need to tell you anything else. Do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie. Even if you have to wait until it comes out on DVD, it is 100% worth the time. Deeply moving film sure to put the tears in his eyes and a smile on your face ... unless ... you do not heartless soul.
