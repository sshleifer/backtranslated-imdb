I always thought it would be a long and tedious Talking Heads-pour a full interior static takes, man, I was wrong. "Election" is a very entertaining and thoroughly magical thriller-drama, deep and realistic view of the origin of the triad rituals. Symbols are in constant motion, and although, as a viewer, you seem to always be an outsider, it is still possible to feel the intrigue coming from specific solutions and characters ambitions. In addition to successfully Johnny in creating a truly luxurious image of carefully composed atmospheric lighting and light-shadow contrasts. Although unlikely to have any action, the end is still shocking is showing ruthless cruelty. Cool film that deserves more attention, and I fell in love with minimalist acoustic guitar to kill quite a bit.
