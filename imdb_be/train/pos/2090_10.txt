Here, the term "classic film" comes. This is a wonderful story of a woman daring, courage and extreme loyalty. Poor Olan was sold to her indifferent husband, who over the years have learned to appreciate it. (Yes, for sure, gem !!) <br /> <br /> Louise Rainer was a beautiful star, who won an Oscar for Best Actress for the year before her a small role (and that waste with Oscar) in «The Great Zigfield». It really does not show that, if any, of the talent she had other than her exotic beauty. But in «Good Earth», she shows that she can really act! Her beauty has been erased, and she had great costumes, too. People say that she showed no real emotion in this film. Like hell. Her character Olan shy and timid woman with inner strength. It is quiet during the film with only her eyes and body to convey their emotions. Example: the scene at the time of the fall of the city and when looters were shot. If you people say that it does not work well in this film, you do not look! <br /> <br /> Paul Muni shows that it can act in the same way. His character is not a pretty one to me. He will never see it for what it is, until the end of the story. Sweet loving and devoted wife and mother, with its own special beauty. The greatest of them all, the beauty from within, like a pearl. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to see this film, watch it. You will see one of the best films made by the golden age of Hollywood.
