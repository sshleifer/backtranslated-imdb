As someone who lives near Buffalo, NY, the film scored points with me, before I even saw him as the story is based here. There are even some bits of the real news people with TV presenter Buffalo..and, this time, he does not knock region. Hallelujah! <br /> <br /> The theology-wise, PUH-leeze !!! God still made to look and think like humans ... and, of course, a bit on the liberal side. Being a light comedy is, there is nothing that needs to win any awards, but it is still an interesting and enjoyable way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some laugh out loud slapstick scenes and hopefully the audience - from Christians atheists.- got something out of it, except for a few laughs, for example, that prayer should really be all about, Kudos to the authors at least, that getting the right theology and give a good message. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good film that should offend the very few.
