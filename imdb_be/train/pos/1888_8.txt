"If I wanted to dig, I would call the nurse.» <br /> <br /> "Do not had enough?" ... "More than enough." <br /> <br /> «You got Choo-Choo me." <br /> <br /> "If I die, please, remove (cowboy hat) with my head. This is not the way I want to remember". <br /> <br /> Some of the surprisingly humorous, and often insightful quotes from this magical and often insightful film. Dudley Moore, charming, attractive and rich. Sir John Gielgud aristocratic, charming and loves ... and the poor. The two do not have a father / father and son relationship, which determines a person whom Arthur should be. whether he will follow his heart and soul, or just his wealth? for twenty-five years, I returned to this movie and with joy and entertainment and joy. It is a film to come back, again and again, and remember what is important in life, short as it is. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
