I have seen this hilarious short film at the age of 10-11 in 1979, when it was shown on CBS. I do not know what it was in the theater at all. In order to evaluate it in terms of the children, I would give it a 4 out of 5 stars because, as a young boy at the time, it seemed a bit "girlish." <br /> <br /> climactic scene where Gazooks tickles the daylights out of all was a little disturbing at the time, but you will outgrow this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When I again opened his Blockbuster video in 1995, I had to go back to him! I still enjoyed it, despite the fact that it looked a bit "old". I do not know where the other reviewer here had an idea that it is not on VHS. <br /> <br /> It's there. Maybe even on DVD now, at least, I hope so. I want to share with my children, ever! 10 stars on here, it's still a big children's film. (End) <br /> <br /> 2009/08/09: Finally found a VHS copy !! Woo-Hoo!
