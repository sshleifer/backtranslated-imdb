Call it a romantic comedy is accurate, but is now misleading. Genre unfortunately deteriorated in the cliché, too focused on the creation of the main couples come together and with very little room for the atmosphere and the other stories, which makes it too formulaic and predictable. <br /> <br /> The Shop Around the Corner wholly suffer from these diseases: it can not create a known average / Eastern European atmosphere and has a strong cast, except (as strong) nominal retraction; I did not use the words "supporting cast", as, for example, Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) played a central role in the film and its history is equally, if not more important, than the novel. <br /> <br /> In 1998, a movie you have borrowed the idea of ​​an "anonymous correspondence" from this film, and therefore, it was announced as a remake. This is not correct, and in fact unfair to the new film - a genre he shares and borrows elements of the plot, but that's all.
