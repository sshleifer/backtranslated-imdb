Richard Dix decided to retire and thus Dwayne Michael took his place, playing the role as Ted Nichols, who meets a young French girl named Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). The couple only knew each other for two days, and they decided to get married at the World Justice (judges), and rain poured down when they pull up to the judge's house and find out that he is not at home and not come back until the next day. As a couple inside the house you see someone lift the hood of his car and takes the car part of the engine. After you see this event occur you know, this pair is a great surprise and reveal the plot being very mysterious event that surrounds Alice Barclay and so poor Ted Nichols begins with a lot of problems and without marriage. A good mystery, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
