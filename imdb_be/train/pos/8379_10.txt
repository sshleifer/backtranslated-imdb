I remember this movie from when I was 12, it was weird .. I remember that the day is not like most of the things I saw then, I even tried to buy it, but it is horse sh * t! In any case, acting a little chewy, but the history of the country, considering it was a true B movie with a low budget and in the event of a combat scene was amazing to watch, I must have watched it about 20 times. It was a very well made film, and I loved the idea of ​​fighting giant robots controlled person, a pity that they had to ruin it by making a crappy spin 'Crash and Burn', not watch this movie, the way it's pants! If true Sci-Fi movie fan, then watch it when it was remade today, it will be the winner .. I really would like to see a remake or even to release this DVD.
