From what showed critics and audiences, the birthday girl was supposed to be a big fat clinker. However, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent it out last night. He was quite worthy to watch. Of course, this is not your basic American comedy, and does not need to be a genius to understand that this is a very British film, but that's why I liked it. This is a change from all the other movies around, a breath of fresh air. Of course, there were some plot holes, but overall it worked. Firstly, Kidman was incredible again in a completely different, not very glamorous, but still quite sexy role. It just continues to prove that it is one of the major talents in Hollywood. Not only that, her Russian accent when she speaks in English effectively, but there are times when it is long conversations in Russian, and if you do not know what it is Nicole Kidman, you would never doubt its authenticity. Harrison Ford had to be taken into account in the "K-19". In general, a slight little film that works in spite of the horrible noise.
