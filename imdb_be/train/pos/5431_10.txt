I've seen this movie many times, and every time I watch it I can not help but be amused by it. Gunga Din is one of those classic films made in Hollywoods Golden Age, when the actors themselves would have to draw the audience into the movie, rather than relying on special effects and fantastic person with "monsters" to carry a scene. On-screen charisma and comraderie demonstrated Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is Suberb and very interesting to watch. Tongue and cheek attitude, in which three actors play their roles and beutifully works flawlessly. Some may consider it a "corny", but I believe that the "classic" filmaking and act in their best. It should be borne in mind when viewing this film, that Europe was embroiled in a war with Germany, and the audience went to the movies to escape from the horrors of war and entertained and taken to a place where people were larger than life, and do heroic deeds and it would be good always triumphs over evil . Gunga Din solves this problem perfectly, allowing the audience laugh at and with the actors during their harrowing escapades. In short, his classic film, which does not take itself too seriously and do not want to make the audience too.
