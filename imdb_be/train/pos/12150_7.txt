This film is one of the many militant "Kung Fu" made in Asia in the late 70's - early 80's years old, full of cheap sound effects and dialogue dubbed lightning martial arts action. But unlike most films of this genre, he also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy. If the dye factory workers are forced to leave their jobs Manchurian bullies, they hire a crook (Gordon Liu), to try to scare them away. If his attempt fails miserably, he cons his way into the Shaolin Temple to learn to fight for real. But instead his student of kung fu master instead of orders to build the scaffolding for roofing of all 36 cameras. Well, it turns out that while it performs the menial tasks (stacking and tying bamboo sticks), he learns the skills to be an expert kung fu! It's like in the Karate Kid, when Mr. Miagi teach Daniel carat basis, having him do routine household chores- Â«wax on, wax," and so on. There are many great comedy from beginning to end, and a lot of action at the end, when Gordon Liu again facing his executioners Manchu. "This time it's not just tricks- is the real thing!" Liu said proudly pounding his chest. If you like classic kung fu movies you do not want to miss it!
