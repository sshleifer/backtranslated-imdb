With some exceptions, the majority of the plays of George Bernard Shaw has virtually disappeared from the theater these days. Too arched, Talky too, seems to be the general verdict. This version of the BBC one of the funniest plays of Shaw entirely refutes the verdict. This, of course, arches and Talky, but it's also fine. And because of the quality of British theater, he is perfectly cast with actors, which - with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter - most of us have probably never heard of. Carter magnificent as the Bulgarian girl who shelters professional "Chocolate Soldier" (Pip Torrens), and then falls in love with him. One could quarrel with the very funny interpretation of Sergius (Patrick Rayekart), the Bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge into the enemy line and turned out just because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for their guns. Nevertheless, the role of excessive action and offers Ryecart explicitly told overproduction act. The other players are perfect letter. Carter as a self-dramatization of the Bulgarian "aristocrat" and Torrence, the Swiss soldier-of-fortune in the center of the play, of course, and they are beautiful. Thus, the "Arms and the Man" comes across as a filmed play. But you hardly ever see a film show, do not bring to its origin. Plots are usually smart. However, the show is all about dialogue. Action is minimal (even in Jeanne) and a lot of immaterial. Enjoy it for what it is.
