The story of Ankush (Abhay Deol) - who is a professional witness the marriage, in short, he appears as a witness for the couple in the marriage registration office - and Megha (Saha Ali Khan), who disappeared from her home in Nainital to get married for her love interest Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi). The story begins with Megha expectations in the marriage registration office for Dhiraj, to show, but for some reason it can not be detected. So Ankush comes into the picture here MEGHA approached with the intention to earn Rs. 200 witnesses for his work, and he ends up helping her, giving her refuge. Ankush grows on its side, working in the bank as agent ... Ankush falls in MEGHA and it also falls into it (or type of love), both agree on the marriage and Dhiraj returns the figure. Unexpected circumstances occur, in fact I have to say, the circumstances of the expected with the unexpected reactions, and then .... <br /> <br /> In fact, the film's story is slightly different from the movies that we see, and I do not think so that it is taken weight, but if you are a movie freak like me and like to watch something else, then you will definitely like the movie. The film is just an innocent love story is made very good character Abhay Deol and Saha Ali Khan. Characters so natural that you feel as if something is going on with the guy next door. Background music in the film also plays a very good role, it's just too good. Delhi Way is shown very well and gives a feeling of freshness <br /> <br /> so let's cut it out and summarize <br /> <br /> History: .. Very often the story is done very well and turns into a great experience <br /> <br /> Music :. Well, as it was the creation of Himesh Reshammiya, so I was not expecting much, but still I liked a couple of the songs of the film, including qawwali <br /> <. br /> Responsibilities: Abhay Deol was the most impressive, very natural and innocent actions, but he must stay away from singing the songs. Saha Ali Khan, she is a doll, very cute doll, I must say. Again, very innocent and natural acting and both actors fits perfectly into their character. Apart from these two, Shayan Munshi needs acting lessons, and there may be several layers of fat to cover the bones. Other actors have done a good job <br /> <br /> Stars :. I would also like to give it 3.5 stars out of 5. You will enjoy the movie, when viewed in a theater, I would recommend watching it in the theater, if you are a movie freak and take unusual stories. Otherwise, wait for DVD, to come. The film, of course, will not like the masses and business can do it by word of mouth advertising.
