First of all I squirt straight white male. But even with this handicap, I love this movie. We are talking about real people. Real time and place. And, of course, New York in the 80s. I had many gay friends growing in New York in the eighties, and the one thing about which I had always admired their courage to live their lives the way they want to live it. No matter what the consequences. This courageous. You have to admire that. This is a great movie to watch it and take in what it was like to be bright African-American or Latino Gay people in New York of the eighties. This is real life. The result of this is real life.
