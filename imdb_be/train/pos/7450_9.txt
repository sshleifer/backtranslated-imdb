This is the best of high Shelley Duvall series Â«Faerie Tale Theater". Ugly stepsisters relief comedies of Broadway quality, and Eve Arden is the embodiment of evil stepmotherhood. Jennifer Beals is doing an excellent job as a direct Cinderella, especially in a garden scene with Matthew Broderick in Prince. Jean Stapleton plays the fairy well, although I'm not sure I liked it "Southern Lady" feature with some of the lines. Steve Martin comedy relief as the Royal Orchestra Conductor is the quintessence of Martin, but a little out of place in the flow of the show. <br /> <br /> As is customary in the series there are several curves comments added for older children (aged 15 years and older). With a couple of minor bumps, show flows well, and they live happily ever after. Children under 8 years old will continue to watch it after parents finally get tired - I found 3 times in one day to be a little too much.
