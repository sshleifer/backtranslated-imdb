I think it's a great movie. because you get to see how Diana's life at home. she got so much aggression, and she wants to prove that girls can fight too. I think she and Adrian were great actors. Because of this movie, I also boxing. It made an impression on me. the only negative part, I think. It is the end. because it is good between Diana and Adrian. But you can not see how it is at home. And I do not really like that you can not see how it makes her father and her brother. but I think it was a great movie, and I think I'll watch it much more :) I recommend it to everyone, even if you do not like boxing, you get to see a lot more than just boxing. I had a great time watching it.
