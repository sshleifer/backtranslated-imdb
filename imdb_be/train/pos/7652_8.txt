Acting- fantastic. Build the country. Script- is excellent. <br /> <br /> Just a few ways to describe this film. Yes, it is slow and most of the talking, but the whole story of their lives, and he said with a flashback thrown in and makes you want to listen to every little detail to find out more about this tragic story of obsessive. I'll read the book that the movie is based off of, and he showed me even more light in this history, and answer some questions left unanswered in the film. I also read a song Exectioner, which is the "other" half stories Gilmore. This film made me think so much about the phrase Â«piering in the opposite direction through the mirror." You hear a song in a movie called Harry Gilmore eyes that punk band who wrote a song about what it would be like to have eyes Harry Gilmore (which is one of the things Harry gave as a transplant when he died ) and as you listen to that, after the last time Mikal ever see Gary, you look at the whole situation a little differently, if you had been here just the song itself. This film opened my eyes that way, and many others. I recommend this film (and the book) is very, very much.
