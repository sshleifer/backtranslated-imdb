Very nice, very creative, and the film fabulous all rolled into one, Stardust tells the story of a young man who lives outside of the fantasy world is going on inside him, to get a little fallen star only to find the living star, young and beautiful, the kingdom which the king is going to die said, king unleash competition for several of his sons, to see who can get the ruby ​​is the first to be king while the trio of witches want stars to cut and use to keep their young. These three narrative strands intricately weave together throughout the picture, mixed with good acting, dazzling special effects, and some hard feelings and humor as well. Stardust is a funny film and has some fun performances from the likes of Claire Danes as the stars (I could look at it for some time), Michelle Pfeiffer (I could look at it in full magical powers even more) plays a terrible witch Robert Deniro plays a hijacker nancy-boy for perfection. Charlie Cox as Tristan leading friendly and trustworthy, and we have some very good work with a group of guys playing sons to be king, which is constantly and consistently trying to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett plays its part well in life and death (all loved this thread as well). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer dad and watch the funny man Ricky Gervais, who made me laugh more than anything in the whole movie in his short five minutes (beautiful feet). But the real power of the film on the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made of his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and his own world, and it works.
