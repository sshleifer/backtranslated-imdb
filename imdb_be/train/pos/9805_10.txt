fans "Capital City" Rejoice! This is the first season of this series, is now available from the DVD network and recently I got my copy! Although a lot of the key pieces of the ensemble of "dissident" "Capital" trading floors characters actually represent us different moments through both its first and second season, when each team member plays an important role in some of the central or peripheral storyline. The mixture of cultures (English, Irish, American, German, Polish) Head Trader Wendy Foley (played by Joanna Phillips-Lane), a group of employees is balanced with its own distinctive mannerisms, interests and individuals who help to make quite unfamiliar and, for most people, it would seem sterile object financial trading reasonably engaged through interactive performance of actors. In fact, it would seem, a dynamic young team of staff is in direct conflict with a fairly balanced and old-fashioned Shane Longman senior management in the face of Lee Wolfe (Richard Le Parmentier) and James Farrell (Denys Hawthorne). I suspect that such a non-traditional way to work as employed a team of Wendy would not be a reality, if it were not for the young hermit "free spirit" Peter Longman inheriting its thirty-percent stake in the company of his father and allowed more fashionable, relaxed modern way business gets reality. To some extent, Wendy (I led to believe) the immediate supervisor Leonard Ansen (John Bowe) to be set up in the traditional manner of management of the company, but his love for Wendy and sees it occupies a "middle ground" in most cases. Most interesting in this series, I believe, should be out of a seething romantic attraction between Declan Douglas Hodge and cool self-confident blonde hair German merchant Michel Hauptmann (played by McDowell, Trevino), which had the audience constantly wondering if the situation between the two peers will develop outside of a close friendship / love, which undoubtedly is. <br /> <br /> looking forward to looking at the title, and I hope the second season of thirteen will not be too far away!
