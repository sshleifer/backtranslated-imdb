Frankly, I think this film is almost too depressing for their own benefit. It is very upsetting to a lot of the end. There is no way I can justify to pass judgment on any character who did what I did not like (well, disgusting character played Forest Fredrick apart). But it is still so worried to see how people behave in this way, the construction of the walls around him, if just a word or so can break the ice and encourage healing. <br /> <br /> A terrible tragedy strikes a family of Montana. They believe that they have lost a son, but it turns out that they have lost 2 key if they just talk and face their grief together, they will not end up permanently lose his second son. <br /> <br /> But they just can not. Something is blocking the family to share their sorrows. Some family retreat in silence and resentment, and some of the other fingers of the Decree of guilt (and then go ahead and cheat their poor pregnant wife, seducing beautiful girlfriend of the deceased ... Andy character really snakes!) One member of the family, Arnold is not threatened in any way by his grandfather (Brimley). Grandfather, seems to be able to talk with the boy without judgment or even kid gloves. He seems to know what the child is thinking about even if Arnold does not mean much these days. It's really good for the poor child to have that one someone he can turn to. No one seems to understand the fact that Arnold may be shocked, in denial, or his way of grieving can not be in the same style, or at the same rate as you would expect. It's so easy to judge and be angry and feel someone "Stone" just because they do not worry as we believe that they should. <br /> <br /> The story is very quiet and the naturalistic. You're not going to get spoon-fed a story or some Hollywood feel good resolution. I was very concerned about the fact that this child was so burdened with guilt that he felt it necessary to hitchhike hundreds of miles, to apologize to the wife of a pig Andy, because he should not blame himself for. Arnold may have accidentally killed his brother, but no one is responsible for the end of the marriage, which apparently was a lousy one anyway, for two people in a marriage, except. It just dumb luck, Arnold did not get into a car with a pedophile or a murderer. <br /> <br /> Robert Duvall and Glenn Close is depressingly effective as parents who somehow can not find it in himself to communicate with his son to see that Arnold is going through. Jason Presson, whom I have not seen anywhere else in the childhood favorite, except called EXPLORERS and terrible ghost story called lady in Bele, did an incredible job, like Arnold, great performance by a child actor. <br /> <br /> In addition to being a bit slow at times, Stone BOY is excellent and very sad movie.
