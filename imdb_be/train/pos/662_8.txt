Axellent second installment, which manages to be as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Once again, casting just fine. I like the first and the second episode has nothing to do for the mind and intelligence. <br /> <br /> The second episode, in addition to just a very funny, very silly and very pleasant. This is the very first Christmas episode about a woman who suffers a serial killer dressed as Santa killing her husband. Just as the first episode; Karma. <br /> <br /> The most comic scene is a connection between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear, until it becomes real.
