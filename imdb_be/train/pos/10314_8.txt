It is one and "Her Pilgrim Soul» are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of the Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my comments to the new series, there is something lacking in this new series. Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that should be explored. It is little more than a sweet and sentimental than the version Serling. Nevertheless, the episode can be seen as a very sentimental too. I believe that the appeal is that no matter what they do, love can never be united. I remember, I was «Il Mare» Korean film was not surprised (later remade in «The Lake House». I think it's because I've seen the first episode, so that ruined the effect of the late movie.
