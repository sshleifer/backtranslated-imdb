With this cast, it's fine. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, that a great team in Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier devastatingly beautiful and does a great job with comedy, as it reflects the anxious, nervous lawyer. Oberon gives her role right light touch. She looks very young here, better in person, with Jean Harlow eyebrows and very different hairstyle for her. She wears a beautiful street clothes, although her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and one dress, she tries, with that hair, she is ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes beautiful, like a real lady Mere. <br /> <br /> The color in this mess, and, as already mentioned, it can actually use the recovery. Definitely worth a look.
