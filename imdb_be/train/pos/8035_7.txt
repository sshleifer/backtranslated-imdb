Sunday isnt Sunday without the militants, and if you want an intense battle, you turn Tom Berenger (Platoon). <br /> <br /> Here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after insurgents and drug lords. Life's a bitch, so he receives a green office type (Billy Zane), to assist in the mission. <br /> <br /> The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who stank to Anaconda. . He does not do much better here, but Berenger makes the film worthwhile <br /> <br /> Of course, it may be a bit long - who want to see a lot of walking through the jungle, but it's good, intense action when the time comes.
