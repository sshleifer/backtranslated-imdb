This is an early anime film was a pretty good movie, I caught one on the channel Fiction Science, if anime was really popular in America and did not crash rating, Adult Swim claims that the cartoon network. I quite frankly think that has less to do with it being less popular and more so, people would prefer to buy now watch DVDs will be directing episodes online. This film, although it probably was not all that many cuts and the voice work is good for the dubbed film, although I would like to see the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some very annoying voices of children something sounded. This film shows a young boy who gets on the train called the Galaxy Express, in the hope that he can do it on the planet that has the technology to turn it into a robot. He wants to be a robot, to avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot that hunts people for fun. During his adventures, he becomes friends with the various workers on board the train, as well as a woman who resembles the late mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who, like most of the women in the anime film has a secret that could either be very good for our young hero or very bad. He goes from planet to planet as well as the train makes various stops, and it works in the space pirate named Captain Harlock who apparently played a major role in his series of cartoons, so basically Galaxy Express is happening in this universe. Overall a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected finale. There will be a continuation of this, but it was not as good as this, but the end was a bit more definitive than it was here.
