I saw this movie on its release, and hid it since. What a wonderful group of actors (I always find the rejection of one of the most interesting aspects of the film). Very pleased to see the dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role, and Wallace Shawn always beep. clever script cunning and crafty, making fun of almost all the "Beverly Hills". Favorite "doctor" Paul Bartel and valet Ray Sharkey. It was a rough and raw, but, thank God! If you're not a prude, I heartily recommend this film. FYI for anyone who loves to play six degrees of Kevin Bacon, Mary and Paul Bartel Ravens were in "Rock-n-roll and high school." Mary Ravens and Robert Beltran was in the "Night of the Comet" together. They were all three in "Eating Raoul".
