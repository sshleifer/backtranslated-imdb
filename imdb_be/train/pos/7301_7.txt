When I heard about «Hammerhead» is released on DVD and finally found it in a local DVD shop, I thought, "Well, just another cheap monster movie from Nu Image». These guys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner production of cheap but very fascinating B - Photographing in the last few months, but also some very disappointing films. So I was not expecting a lot, especially after watching the rather disappointing «Shark Zone», in just a few days before. But «Hammerhead» was a great revival of the cinema of the 1950s monster. We have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and girls in trouble, -lyudoedov plants and, of course, we have a creature, a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark. All you need for an entertaining monster movie. The only thing lacking in the graphic sex scenes and nudity, which you would expect in this kind of movies, but since the film was made for television it is clear why these scenes are missing. And it does not matter in any case is «Hammerhead» action and horror entertainment at it's best. There are two reasons why I gave it a seven out of ten points, though: First of all, the monster did not see very often, and a showdown with the destruction of creatures too quickly and poorly made, and secondly, William Forsythe is simply not the right guy for "hero" of the fall, and with great Tile. Also, I highly recommend this film to any monster movie fan there. Yourselves Grab a cool drink and popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
