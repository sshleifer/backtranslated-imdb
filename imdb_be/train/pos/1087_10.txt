There is so much love in this beautiful little comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even just not enough room to find that there is more than just a grain of truth in a difficult position intricate Blanding.Melvyn Mr. Douglas, with great comedic flare as the story and acts as a attorney and voice reason.As in Blandings' well-Myrna Loy is at its best as a rather frivolous, but very patient wife. But the best performance of the Grant. He is an American Everyman, is particularly relevant at the time of the release of the film, when the country was in the grip of a housing shortage after the war. Topics universal, lack of money, the work of tension, fear infidelity.Yes, is wrapped very carefully, but you should keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war, and he wanted a happy ending. This is still relevant today, and I have to chalk the bad reviews, I can see now the superiority of the simplified down to the coarse comedies. The appearance of a smooth film, and there are some great comedy bits are good, especially to beginning.While it may lose some of its social importance, almost sixty years after its release, it is still a gem.
