When I was a little girl (and my dad owned a video store), it was among my favorite films. I have not heard much about it since then, but I do remember a thing about it, it is forgotten as a result of other, probably better than Don Bluth films. I was able to find him a few weeks ago, however, and was pleasantly surprised again. Set in New Orleans in the 1930s, the animation is beautiful and memorable songs. There are some inconsistencies in the continuity, if you look hard enough, but they usually do not detract from the storyline that leaves you smile (and maybe even a little misty-eyed, if you are a lover of animals). Believable characters (maybe even a bit too adult for young observers) as well. Two legs, and for those of you who have not seen it in a while, of course, should be re-watch.
