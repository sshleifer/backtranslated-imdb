Bruce Almighty Jim Carrey best work, as The Truman Show, and it was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent "Hey Hollywood - look how well I can act" Cash disappointment. It's great to see Jim recognizing and embracing his strengths. He did not receive an Academy Award, but the film itself will last longer than many of "the awarded films" of the Academy. It is located on the top of his form in the last film. - is the return of an old friend <br /> <br /> Carrey, Freeman, and Aniston all do a great job together - comfortable in his comedy roles, perfect comic timing, and obviously with pleasure, but without a "hey mom - see how funny I "type of comedy. The real surprise was Steve Carell as a nemesis Curry (Karel from The Daily Show fame), who came down with some of the best and funniest scenes of the film. I laughed more in Karelia than anyone else in the last three years. <br /> <br /> I can foresee the religious nuts in the US is up in arms over the treatment of God, but the bottom line of the film precisely for all the major theological beliefs - we are trying to get the mass of protoplasm through our short life, exercising our free will. Married without children and so on complaining, this is likely to become the target of people with misplaced priorities (who know the type - a man adorned in golden hours on Sunday morning and late in the neighbor TV selling prayer to God). And, again, about 0.5% of the country and will take care of 80% of the media to inform the <br /> <br /> The bottom line :. This is a purely entertaining film, each member of the audience laughing wondering what they will do, and the feeling of well-being at the end of the film. Walk through any major street in America should reaffirm that God has a great sense of humor. What's the best comic genius, to remind us of that than Jim Carrey <br /> <br /> Thanks again, Jim. - It's great to have you back !!
