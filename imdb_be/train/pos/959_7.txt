There are many police dramas are doing the rounds. I do not know why. This is probably to do with the old main theme of good and evil. <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary style, we go hard start Ann raw draftee, a police detachment stationed in the Baltic Sea, no attempt was made to glamorise police. They are really down to earth, hard times and unforgiving, Anne, on the other hand, have a soft heart, perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Against all the rules, she sometimes says nothing incriminating information found in the search of her band, and other studies. <br /> <br /> This is not a pleasant film. Not one to relax. There is not much sense of optimism in it. The police seem to be involved in a losing battle. Tomorrow there will be more massacres, more kills, more family disintegration and more problem children. Let's face it. This is the world in which we live. <br /> <br /> The days Anne becoming more closely associated with the police and the families they are investigating. The only real heat in the film is that it provides the character Benny, 12-year-old from a broken family. Ann has its own way to fix things. She closes her eyes on a shoplifting Benny and tries to help him as best she can. I was surprised, however, that it has gone so far as to seduce the father Benny. It made me wonder if it was in consideration of her father or her own needs. In the end, the film makes it clear that she desperately needs a partner and loving children. <br /> <br /> Well cast, but not my idea of ​​evening entertainment,
