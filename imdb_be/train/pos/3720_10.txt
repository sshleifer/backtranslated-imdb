Joel Schumacher Made a hell of a choice when he decided on this roll, and this scenario. The story is well written and well thought out, and it's a whole new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. It seemed that there was a 6 "leads" and about a dozen support, and today it is the best thing about the movie fresh young faces of tomorrow. It's been a long time since the Hollywood touch controversial Vietnam War films, which says something for the "history that was to be said" (as stated by Schumacher) and Tigerland lands in the beginning of the period of a handful of war movies. Nevertheless, it can not be labeled as a war film, because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit Bozz and others. I think that anyone who just wants to watch a good movie out of all the FX special, but good, gritty drama Tigerland should go see, obviously, Shumachers best works for the past 8 years.
