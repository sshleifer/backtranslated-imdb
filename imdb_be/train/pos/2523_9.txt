When I first heard about the Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. A few months later, I figured I'd guess it's for real. Several reviews I read that were not made by shrieking female fans they were not very promising. <br /> <br /> When I got the opportunity to watch it, I was completely ready to moan, flinch, but otherwise it is necessary to close my eyes to avoid nonsense. <br /> <br /> I was more than a little surprised in a good way. <br /> <br /> So, Moon Child has its moments cheese, camp, general dorkiness - I think it's kind of impossible to avoid if we are talking about Gackt Camui, a person is not known for his sanity. - but overall, it was quite a pleasant <br /> <br /> No, it's not a work of cinematic genius, but it is very, very warm, funny, fun with choreography by touching, fun and gypsum. I know little of Japanese cinema, so I can not judge the action, but given the fact that the reduction of the speaker in the language, or an extreme dialect strangers to them at any given moment, and it's time one of them has almost no acting experience, I I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a good action movie, good drama, good comedy to see this movie. At the very least, rent it, as it comes to an area 1. <br /> <br /> On a side note, there is zero homosexual / homoerotic content in this film. I did not even see a lot of subtext. Do not let people who read too much into things ruin it for you.
