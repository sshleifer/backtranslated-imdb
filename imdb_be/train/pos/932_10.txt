********* Ten out of ten stars ********* <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that it was made for TV movie. Just the phrase "from the TV" makes me shudder. The values ​​for the production of films made for television is almost always significantly lower than the production value for professional studios. That being said, this version of «Christmas Carol» was released in theaters, because it's good. This is my personal favorite of all the films «Christmas Carol», because every aspect of the production of the highest quality. Yes, there are some minor glitches on the screen with two ghosts who visit Scrooge, but there is not a movie that does not have at least a couple of mistakes. <br /> <br /> Scott turns in a stellar performance as Scrooge, it is a pleasure to watch. In fact, I can not think of performance in this film, which is to be applauded. Costumes, shooting place, and in the winter background is fascinating. Musical accompaniment is punished and heart warming. Add to this, solid directing, cinematography and flawless faithful were; here we have something that will one day is considered a holiday classic. It really was not long enough to be a classic, but mark my words, one day soon will be. This film turned into an annual Christmas tradition in my house, because it embodies the true meaning of Christmas: love, selflessness and giving. As a selfish, greedy world, my family and I can lose yourself in the «Christmas Carol», starring George C. Scott.
