In a word - wonderful. It's a movie. Go and see it. Director Ron Howard ... I mean, director Ron Howard has done a fantastic job, as he usually does. Incredible attention to detail, vibrant colors and decorations, breathtaking Whoville atmosphere, an amazing variety of costumes. Wait, there's more than that - the story is very good, too. There is clearly a message to extract from him a thoughtful audience. Jim Carrey is top-notch. He probably could have better Grinch. Girl, Taylor Momsen, it's really good. I'm sure she has some great future. Dog cool. In general, this is a very high quality of the Christmas tale. If you love fairy tales, this is for you. If you like Christmas, it's for you. <br /> <br /> Reading other reviews here ... Get a life. It hurts me every time to see people out there who ... well ... got their heart two sizes too small.
