A great addition to anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 Monkeys movie that you do not see every day. It has an excellent cast to go with a great history. This is not a normal part of Bruce Willis, but he holds the role as he keeps John McClane. <br /> <br /> The virus-killing everyone on earth and takes the story a few hundred survivors are not new, but the story takes a new a new direction to it. <br /> <br /> man (Bruce) is sent back in time to get information about the virus, which destroyed much of a good man. <br /> <br /> actors in it were strange. I must give a mention Brad Pitt, who was hilarious as a mental patient, James Cole (Bruce) is found in a psychiatric hospital. <br /> <br /> The director did an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of the future ruined on a man-made virus. <br /> <br /> animals seen in the world of the virus made it feel like they rule the world, when people are being driven into the underground. <br /> <br /> This film was excellent and a must see, as well as it should have. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
