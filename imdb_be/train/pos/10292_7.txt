Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Carrie. Although I admit that I have not seen all of his films * cough * * cough * majestic. Bruce Almighty was nice. None of the other reviews do not really no how cheese is getting closer to the end, I do not know what I think the author. Somehow I could not help but feel that this film was an attempt to recreate a bad Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, The Daily Show, Steve correlate of fun and so is the rest of the actors, See Bruce Almighty, if you are a big fan of Jim Carrey, or if you just want to see a light-hearted (Que soft piano music) a few funny comedy.
