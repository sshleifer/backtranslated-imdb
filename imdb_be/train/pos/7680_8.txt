"Holly" is an issue-driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. At its heart is a character-driven film that would not have been nearly as successful without bodily form images Patrick (Ron Livingston), a lost soul gradually awakens the conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the strong-willed, but eventually, over conformity of a young Vietnamese girl. From bright places and photos for efficient editing, all right and well done. Modern classic account can put some away in the first, but it's a first-class structure, and stresses the great restraint that is manifested in everything. This film, which causes a lot of questions, but gives few clear answers, eventually succeeds in raising awareness and sympathy for the Hall and a lot of people who share her plight. Kudos to those who managed to get it done.
