May Super Ex-Girlfriend was a pleasant surprise for me, I was really expecting a terrible movie that will probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? It was! But this film has done so many wonderful laugh and a fun story that someone could get hit with. I know that it was very cheesy movie, but the mind and Anna was just as cool and Steve was such a great addition along with a large cast that looked like they were having so much fun and this is what made the movie really work. <, Br /> <br /> Jenny Johnson (scary, is the actual name of my best friend) is not a typical average librarian looking for a woman when Matt, your average man, asks her, he spent more than he had expected, he said G- Girl on a date, the super hero world! But when he discovers that the jealous and crazy girl, she really is and decides that it might be a good idea that they spend some time apart, but Jenny does not have it, because it fell on another girl Hannah, and she would make his life hell, I mean, let's face it, he could not have chosen a better girl to break with. <br /> <br /> effect was obvious, but seriously move past them quickly, the story and cast made the story really works, and I loved this film in mind, it was such a step away from the Prime. May the former super-fun movie that you do not really have to take seriously, it's just a cute romantic comedy, I think that if I could get a laugh out of it, could someone. <br /> <br /> 7/10
