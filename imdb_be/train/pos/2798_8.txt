Jess 18, is very smart and wants nothing more than to play football when it joins the local team, it must again and again lie to their parents, because they never approved of her chasing their dream, they want her to settle down with a good Indian boy and learn to cook. <br /> <br /> Bend it Like Beckham is very funny to feel good movie, do not need to be deep and complex, it is just fine as it is. Acting is all very well, and they play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works great and the script is very realistic and very funny. <br /> <br /> great family movie 8/10
