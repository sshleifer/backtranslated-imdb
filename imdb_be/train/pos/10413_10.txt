I grew up with this as my favorite film. Incredible special effects for its time, and won awards. I remember the dialogue, as if I heard yesterday. It's just wonderful, timeless adventure. Music Miklos Rosza, which film history's best. Sab is a thief. Conrad Veidt is the big villain. I have a copy within reach for the next trip down memory lane. Whoa there! Rex Ingram wants with his genius of the bottle!
