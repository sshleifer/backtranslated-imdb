"Woman in Black" is easily one of the most terrible of British ghost stories ever made.A young lawyer, on arrival in the small town to deal with the estate of the deceased customer, is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed all in black.The film loaded with an extremely creepy atmosphere and fear and is designed to provide maximum effect possible.The effect keeps the viewer deeply involved and fully disturbing.The final action perfectly and the tension almost unbearable times.So, if you want to see a truly awful horror film to g Etam look.I dare anyone to watch "The Woman in Black" alone at night with the lights off.Highly recommended.10 10.
