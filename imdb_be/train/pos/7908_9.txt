I recently found a copy for $ 5 in the video store, and snapped his look. While the music and (obviously) the graphics are not up to the standards of my favorite series, Beyond an imaginary sight, I am still fascinated by one segment: <br /> <br /> Stanley and Stella in 'Breaking the Ice ". The music is brilliant, and emotions, to feel real. Clip Online Odyssey has no history, no music, unfortunately.
