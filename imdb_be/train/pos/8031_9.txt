This is one war drama I really like! Meanwhile Berenger played a military assassin Thomas Beckett. This sea entirely nonsense, in your face, and no questions asked of the person who gets the job. There you have Billy Zane ( "Phantom" and others), who plays Richard Miller, a former matchmaker form DC, working for the government and takes orders only from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do not! If these two pairs, sparks should fly. And how. However, Beckett teach young bureaucrat's how it works. If ingested another sniper, it Wits against the pranksters, cat-mouse, who shot against the shooter. And if an experienced sniper is caught, it is up to Miller put politics aside and save it. Who needs a policy if you are a professional, like Beckett, he took orders from no one but himself to play by the rules, not books, as well as mutual respect is necessary in spite of the policy. The film was a direct hit. Careful. Rated 4 out of 5 stars.
