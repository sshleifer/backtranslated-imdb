This film has it all. Emotion, power, love, fairy nude beach dancing St√©phane Rideau ... It reveals the need for a real internal communication and external communication in any relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu couple who happen to be gay does not mean that it is not very useful insight for anyone in it. I would probably classify it as a gay film, but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual men and homosexual and bisexual men. Mathieu incapacity to handle their emotions gives way to our society does not encourage us to act differently, and this is what creates the dissonance between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must see !!!!
