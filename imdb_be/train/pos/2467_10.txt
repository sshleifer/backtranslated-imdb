Why it did not pick up a bag full of Oscars? This is an amazing interpretaion of frequent removal / performed part. Visuals are breathtaking (especially in a wide-screen ... pan and scan is really killing wonderful cinematography and sets this film). Each frame is a picture. Strange. The game is almost completely intact, and the passion for Branagh is clear from the opening titles. Many Zefferelli here just fine speaking only way a film can, but rarely does. Jacob especially quite as murderous uncle Hamlet: he does not play with him as an evil Villian mustache- curling, but the magic policy that allows us to understand why only Hamlet suspects foul play. Abusive also nails the subtleties of the line between fake / real madness of Hamlet and revenge burning inside him. And many cameos come off pretty well, all of Billy Crystal and Robin Williams Depardieu and Charlton Heston, non-intrusive, if you are absorbed in a vision of Bran, as I was. Fascinating part.
