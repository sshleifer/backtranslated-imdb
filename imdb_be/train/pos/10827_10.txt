Still Crazy compared with Spinal Tap, as both comedy about washing for groups of R & R. In fact, here the similarity ends, because it is still crazy much better written and acted, while the Spinal Tap scenario worsens mildly amusing the first 10 minutes in the nonsense that makes Beavis and Butthead are complex in comparison. Still Crazy formulaic, but likability of the characters and surprisingly high quality of some of the musical numbers for me to get compensated a priori predictability of the film. People who are waiting for Spinal Tap, as attempted satire will be disappointed carefree nature of the film, but I have successfully self-irony romp still mad over the arrogant, but was shot in the satire, which is Spinal Tap.
