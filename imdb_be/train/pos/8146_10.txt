I can not stop saying how much I love this film. This film is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The film about the exploits of a rap group, NWH (Ni # $% RS with hats) It comes from the beginning of the group until the end of the group, after this tragic disintegration. After the group is a documentary Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The film on a shoestring budget, but it seems it does not matter, it is very well done, well produced film and performances of all these actors and actresses, great. The main strength of this film is to write, there are so many brilliant lines and takeoffs on rap in this film, it's unreal. <br /> <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> There are ups on real rapper as MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey taste and songs (Pirate juice, grab your dick, etc. d.) rusty Condieff made a great movie. In the film he plays the rapper Ice Cold. The film does not come out, it is funny from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> In the movie works so well because it gets weird about, but it hits that line, which is ridiculous, without going too far out there. Listening to the three wires tries to talk some philosophy was one of the best parts of the movie as a producer Tone Def says, ??, if you take the bus, you will get there ", and the manufacturer is responsible, ?? it deep! "<br /> <br /> The group, which shows NWH has some natural Chemistry. They work so well together, and they manage to pull this film, where there is not a week point in the film. What really makes this film so good, it is true for some of rap groups of the time this film. Many rap groups were violent problems with the censor, and how the NWA, the group only became popular when the institution began to make a big deal of the controversial text. <br /> <br / > I like this movie because it's offensive. There is something here to offend everyone in a good-natured way. Fil m is tapping into a large number of people, it is too turnips, funny creature film has row after row, that will have you rolling Spike Lee. Where do they come up with this dialogue I can not imagine. on the floor. As I said earlier, than writing just fine. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that this film met this limited edition. this is a smart, controversial, and even the thoughtful film. this is too much for the mainstream, despite the fact that it's fun and almost flawless in this production. There are no big stars, but a lot of familiar faces, including Mark Lawrence, who plays Defense tons. Watch this movie, at least, you will definitely have an opinion about it.
