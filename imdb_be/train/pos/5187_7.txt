The series was the same as what you would expect from a Mr.Spielberg. It's really one of those frighting, funny, children's shows, which you will not forget. Just as the Outer Limits (another great show), this small series does that not many can. It was great, and deserves to work longer. It was a great show that even children can watch, even though some of the shows were a little scared when they wanted to be, but they have always been a moral at the end (like the Twilight Zone), what made you realize that things you do not want to I end up in, or the ones you did. I remember watching some of them on the Sci-Fi, when I was 10, and even now, I love to still see them when I can. Really fun, art exhibition. I loved it, and still.
