I consider myself a big fan of the work of David Lynch, because it gives viewers a totally unique movies with the typical "Lynch elements." After seeing most of his works, I naively thought I could predict the next step Lynch. I was wrong. Country stupid is that I would never have imagined under the name of David Lynch. However, after my recovery from the initial shock, I began to think about this very primitive protagonist, and I have concluded that all the absurdity, cruelty, brutality and disgust provided here mirroring bit from reality, accented distorting it. There are things in our lives, we are unlikely ever to emphasize, as they are either disgusting or horrible, but they are all around us, so I take the liberty of saying stupid country focuses on those bits and pieces. This is not a film to enjoy, if you laugh sometimes strange, twisted sense of humor, an animated display of all the things that we rather reject observe its simplicity, tenderness and absurdity. Take it as it is, you do not have to like it. He was just there. And finally, if you are careful enough, you will find items that are typical for Lynch as well. I recommend it for tolerant people !!!
