William Powell doctor has to do with the murder, and his ex-wife in the "Ex-Mrs. Bradford, "also starring Jean Arthur, Eric Blore, and James Gleason. It seems that Powell was chemistry going with any woman, with whom he teamed up. Although he and Myrna Loy were a great pair of screen, the actor made a couple of other "Thin Man" type films, one of Ginger Rogers and it's one with Arthur, and a very good effect. <br /> <br /> Anyway, one never tires of seeing Powell, as a witty, cheerful and professional "Ex-Mrs. Bradford "is no exception. Ex-Mrs. B to Mr. B is supplied with the order of the child support back and then moved back to help him to solve the puzzle, it pulled. And this is not the first time she did it! It almost seems as if there was a movie, "Bradford" before, or that it should have been the first of a series of films - Mr. B complains that his former mystery writer constantly bringing it into the cases. At this time, a jockey riding a favorite horse raise mysteriously falls from his horse and died just before the finish. <br /> <br /> The solution seems ridiculous things, but it is beside the point. The fact is, the banter between the couple and the intervention of the ex-Mrs. B. Jean Arthur is quite glamorous in her role and is very funny. However, the actress, who comes off in the brainy as Arthur, humor seems intentional, but not windy. I suspect that the author had in mind something else - say, a silly side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur learns that the police came, she said: "Oh, it's probably about my alimony. I was waiting for the police to take a hand in it, "it's more edge to the Powell, rather than a serious statement. It still works well, and it shows how good actress can make a part of their own. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look, as William Powell and Jean Arthur always.
