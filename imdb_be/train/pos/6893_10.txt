Gerard Philippe is absolutely perfect in this movie, funny, gentle, brave and lover.He gives excellent measurement of a film that even a masterpiece, like many other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!), both in history and rhythm. Never boring, always creating new emotions: for me, the best French film of all time.
