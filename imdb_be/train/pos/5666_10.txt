I loved this show when it was broadcast on television and was crushed when I found out that someone, somewhere, decided that he was not worthy to be still! For many years, I hung on my copy of the show, the ones I braid or someone tape for me. That is, until now. The powers that be finally decided to release this wonderful series on DVD, and I was finally able to get my eager hands on the kit. Which brings me to this part; Part of what this show is all. <br /> <br /> American Gothic of good verses evil, basically a struggle between Lucas Buck (ie Buck, with B). He is an evil sheriff of a small town in South Carolina that runs things the way he wants, everything should work and does not stop to get their way. <br /> <br /> I felt that the show was well written and directed and had a lot of life left have not lived yet. I really hated it when it was canceled, but that's the way it seems to go for me when I finally find something worth watching on TV. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole did a great job in the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck, he has just the right amount of charm evil verses to pull it. Other actors have done a super job as well, so I guess you could say, even casting was a hit with me.
