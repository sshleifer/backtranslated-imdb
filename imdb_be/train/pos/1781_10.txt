... here comes Romeo Division to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me say that I was blown away by this short film. I saw it by accident, when I was in Boston at the festival, and I thank God for it every day since. I really, really believe that I was a part of what is happening, as reading Tarantino script before any other has done or to see the first show of Mean Streets. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that festival heads to the short or the fact that the creative team is on tap for future products, but I hope I can be there for him. <br /> <br /> Again, really an incredible piece of cinema.
