This should be one of the best films to come out of HK for a long time, I'm looking forward to getting my hands on this movie just by looking at the name. Loads of fantastic actors in this show, and I was particularly impressed by the incredible plausible insane behavior Sam Lee and Edison image killer machine, which completely changed his normal idol image. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a stylish and action packed film. However, I must warn you, this is also just a depressing film, because every character in the film at some dead end and the problems of their own, and struggled to breathe. It makes you think about what life is really about.
