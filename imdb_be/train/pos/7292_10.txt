I have to see it just this past Friday at the Film Festival in Los Angeles in Beverly Laemlee. This film received the most applause of all the films in the same evening. Given that the two music video opened the first thing that I did not know what to expect, since they were very fast and attracts attention, I was not sure I was ready for a short immediately. But to my surprise, I really enjoyed it. I thought that the main actor demon guy was really good. I was so impressed with his work, I checked his name. I was surprised to see that it was a guy Witchblade. He was very good, especially since! Either that or he got lousy roles or director pushed very hard for this short. She did a good job. I think it's a nut, as this was her first show and, being so young. Dad did too well. It was a lot of really good CG work on the short circuit, and for this and a number of short games «Mexican Hat», which was also good, but I enjoyed it most of all because he had great depth and emotion, and I actually I cared about the characters. The second was a very simple story. The story was very revealing and dark! It dealt with the real subjects, using more imagination, as an approach to add people like me interested. We will not even talk about the last film in the unit, which I left. My only complaint is that I only wish I saw more of the demon character and a bit less than the start, so I gave it a 9 out of 10. I also thought that the final credits have gone a little slow. Otherwise it was nice told the director and edited. Time was very pleased with the full transition from the fast editing MTV did for all days. There will be more coming by this director in the future, as well as an actor. Now I think of it as the Tribulation Lost actor is not the Witchblade guy.
