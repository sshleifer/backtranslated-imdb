Canadian director Vincenzo Natali took Arthouse storm scheme with an intriguing and surprisingly smart cube, which is my favorite SF film of the 90s. He framed the basic conceit group of strangers, closed in the maze in the shape of a giant cube, completely removed in one set, and adopted the idea in exciting directions. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to Natali follow-up, and although it take five years for him to mount another project, I am pleased to say that it was worth the wait. Cypher fascinating study places one person in the world, and through all the logical chain of events, is in a situation beyond his control. <br /> <br /> I do not want to reveal too much about the plot, because one of the pleasures of Cypher is the different ways it takes us. It is so refreshing in this day and age to see the film the SF, which has more than one idea in his head. Cypher such a film. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (North), one of the softest people ever to walk the planet, the company hired DigiCorp. They send it in different parts of America, to record various seminars. To his surprise, they are incredibly boring. Covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese. <br /> <br /> While Morgan is waiting for a seminar, he falls into Rita Foster (perfectly cast Lucy Liu), the definition of ice maiden. She gives him the gate turn, but there is something to it, he finds compelling. It is not too surprising, considering it is a dry marriage. <br /> <br /> If Rita appears in another one of the workshops of Morgan, she tells him that his life is not what it seems. And I no longer say anything about the plot. In order to do this would be to reduce the cost impact on the rest of the film is on us, as well as a winding path, which is so much fun to follow. <br /> <br /> Like the Cube, Natali shows quite a talent that includes seemingly ordinary people, taking them out of friends, and basically seeing what happens when they push into the unknown. And Cypher costs similar models. But it is not tracing the cube. He has his own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a film that has more to do with the conspiracy and paranoia thrillers stories. One of the greatest things about Cypher is how these topics creep into the story without your knowledge. If Morgan realizes that his false personality is part of a much larger puzzle, it's just a shock to us as to him. <br /> <br /> One thing that distinguishes the Cypher Cube by how much more it is polished. Where Cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns, the Cypher and on a low budget, but Natali economises him as much as he can, which allows him to expand the horizon, and the launch of Morgan on an amazing journey through the maze of his own identity. <br /> <br /> direction Natali is exceptional, with a deft hand the reins. There are some amazing angles from above, for example, the magnitude of DigiCorp building as a huge, robust office block in combination with a small speck that Morgan was standing outside. All colors seem to bleed out of the picture, which praises the tone of the film entirely in the modern film noir. <br /> <br /> To act uniformly beautiful everywhere. North is a pretty figure of his loveless marriage into question its own identity. Its performance is great because it is so modulated. He literally seems to turn right before our eyes. With clinical, weak-willed wimp to a confident man who will do anything to keep his new identity. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett put in a welcoming appearance, which made such an impact in the cube. It is located in a secret bunker, which looks like it was borrowed from the men in black. Its scene is one of the best, because it is an exercise in carefully calculated uncertainty and paranoia. He must have skills in identifying double agents, and this is a fantastic piece of writing, brilliantly acted by Hewlett. All he has to do is look at Morgan, and we are involved in his complex mind games. <br /> <br /> But this is Lucy Liu, which is a scene stealer here. Too often, it is cast in the film, where its potential is not being used at full strength. But in the Cypher, she finally a character that fits her like a glove. Rita is away, guarding the rock that populates Liu appetite. I perked up every time she appeared because she is always under control and can reduce the room to silence by force only her icy stare. <br /> <br /> The speeches come to a very gratifying after all, it does not conclude that ambiguous note as a cube made. But Morgan deserves its happy ending. After it was put through the ringer like this, I'm rooting for him in the final scene. This is the perfect last minute, because it is like a ray of sunshine after a dismal 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Cypher succeeds on all counts. Attraction, shocking, always interesting, that's all Total Recall wanted to be, but it was not. And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix. <br /> <br /> Good observation by Natali. And now I'm a dedicated fan of man. Great stuff!
