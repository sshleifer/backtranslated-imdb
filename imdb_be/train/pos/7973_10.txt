Maybe I'm juice, but it's a sweet movie ever! I saw him for the first time when I was about 4 or 5, and I cried my eyes. Between then and now (embarrassed at the age of 15 years), I've seen it more than 25 times and cried each and every one of them. Do not worry, they are tears of joy! And that's not all the juice! There's a lot of humor and comedy in it too. Typically, the whole conversation thing the animal can be a huge resistance, but in this film, it's not the case. My only advice: Even if you love it, do not see the sequel ... cornyness! I believe all the checks it ... you will not regret it, no matter how old or young you are!
