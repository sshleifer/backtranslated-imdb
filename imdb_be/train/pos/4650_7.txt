As an employee of the Swedish Air Force Gripen I enjoyed a good and HKp 9 (MBB Bo 105) flight scene in this movie. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 Jammer pod, in this case, an inert Rb 75 (Maverick) rocket painted black with the letters Â«EWS 39" in white along the sides. Real Jammer pods definitely not like that, at least not the ones I've seen. <br /> <br /> But, in addition, it is an entertaining film with a very funny ending (last minute). Anyone interested in the fact that the various Swedish military units, including the now legendary the SSG, on the film have to see it. <br /> <br />
