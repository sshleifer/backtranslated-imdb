I can not understand what it is that fans of the genre do not like about this movie. It was really a lot of fun. The special effects were wonderful. In general, I agree with the review and voters IMDB, but not this time. I waited until he came to the video home, I felt, there was another reason that I would not enjoy the film. I think that special effects movies you want to see on the big screen, but again this was not the case. For me, the film begs comparison with the two films that were released around the same time. The Blair Witch Project and The Mummy. Both films, which I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overestimate the horror film of all time. Mummy out of the darkness of money, and it was pure dreck. People loved him for that special effects. Films such as mummies and ghosts are not rich character development, they are more like curves attractions. Well, this analogy was Mummy B ticket to the electronic ticket in Ghosts.
