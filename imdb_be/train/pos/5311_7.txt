John Waters most accessible film to date is one of his better ones, considering it cut all campiness and open vulgarity that seems to litter much of his previous work. Of course, nudity and sexual references are still there, at least, it is presented in fashion <br /> <br /> which can not be considered too foul or disgusting. Due to some great options for casting, this film really brought stupidity associated with contemporary art and the subjective nature of your contemporary artist. Funny and somewhat carefree (if it is possible for water), this is one of those movies that I would look for a rainy day.
