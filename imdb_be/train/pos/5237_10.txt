We all create our own reality, or are we? That is the fundamental question for this very original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusory nature of reality. Mixing Eastern and Buddhist philosophies with visual chicanery to M.C. Escher, is a fascinating treatise fails to take the rather cerebral question `Who are we and what is our place in the universe?", And turn it into an exciting and fun 100 minutes. The film centers on Bart, a writer struggling with his script, `It thinks the Sea. If he sits at his computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer, to write the script. By the time he got stuck in the vortex puzzle in which everything he writes, it is becoming a reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with a malicious sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of strange visual tricks that are before the nature and reality of our perception. In the end, the film de Graaff audience challenges on several levels, to the question of whether all that we see or touch or taste is really what it seems, all our understanding of the universe and our place in it just a trick played on us our senses.
