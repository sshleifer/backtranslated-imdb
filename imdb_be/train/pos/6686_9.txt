This film was a brilliant concept. It was original, intelligently written and highly attractive to those of us who do not really "conformist" movie collectors. Do not get me wrong - there are some great films that have broad appeal, but the transition to the viewing of the film on the basis of "all still watching him," - you know that you either animation or do not really have an opinion. It was a wonderful subtle humor - even though most people are probably looking only at the obvious. Actors portrayed his character with aplomb, and I thought that was a lot more "personal" face in this film. My appeal to children as well as adults. particularly pleased to find a good movie that is not filled with sexual references and drug use hints! A great movie, not to be overlooked on the basis of public consumption. This one should buy.
