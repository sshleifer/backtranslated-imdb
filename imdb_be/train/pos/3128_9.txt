Corny! I love it! Banal - just like the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt revive the same chemistry on screen that never seems what's left! They again live old memories, as well as the actors playing them with 1960s show some behind the scenes stuff that is very interesting to know. 1960s television was trite escapism for many of us at that time, and this DVD is no exception, if you're familiar with the original TV show. The fight scene with a written Boofs and Bams or any fantastic !! Cinema scene shows clips of villains who have died. At the end of Frank Gorshin pretends. He died not too long after that again to play the villain Adam and Burt, just as he did Batman and Robin so many years ago as this DVD was made, I believe, is his great credit, he's back. He has not lost his touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar live again the villain role, too. In conclusion, I believe that this DVD is for large memories, and I would like to thank Adam and Burt for the return and restore those memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thanks guys !!!
