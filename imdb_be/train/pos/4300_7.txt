This film could well be one of the usual Â«soapies", relating to everyday events half a dozen families whose lives intertwine ?? .. broken relationships, new friends, street riots, near accidents, hopes and dreams, and even the discovery of the child discarded under the bushes! What a mix of events! <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the filmmaker goes beyond these daily events and put questions to consider, although there are no satisfactory answers. He asks ?? in this chaotic world to do things just happen, it's just luck if sho will correctly taking a fatal point of view, a man destined to be in a certain place at a certain time, and thus are included in the event and its future takes on a new perspective? Most of us have had this weird experience. <br / > <br /> This is our super ego which leads us to believe that we are so important? as one character says, ?? he once sat on the edge with a view of the Grand Canyon and realized how infinitesimal it. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite movies, but it's a good study of human relations. Danny Glover is outstanding in the role of cute.
