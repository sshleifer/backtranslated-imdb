This is filmmaking at its simplest and best <br /> <br /> I had my doubts, because even if Freeman is a great actor, and sometimes he gets involved in a bad project. this is not one of those times. <br /> <br /> This is a small story, which runs just over an hour and fifteen at the time, when we get used to what movies are becoming longer and longer, and is not necessarily better, the director uses a short time in his favor because the characters are so well defined from the outset (large images Freeman and Vega, by the way), which is a bit of background information about them appears to be real, Morgan himself, even if his name is not mentioned that he was from the movies for several years, so he was imbued with the business, and has developed a fear took dream about the script, and does research for the character in the indie film, where he plays a shop / supermarket manager. The story begins with a drop of his time in a supermarket in a rough area where he meets a cashier from 10 points or less (Vega) and has a ride with her business 'production' forgot to pick it up. <, Br /> <br /> In many ways, this road movie, Morgan provides laughter and strangeness with its unparalleled smile and a positive outlook on everything, demonstrating held the actor, who has trained his mind to be able to determine everything he sees in character that he could play, and Paz (by the way, which is an unusual beautiful woman, even more lush than Penelope Cruz) brings the vulnerability of 25 years separate the woman who works harder than all the others, not to get a loan in a dead end job in a bad supermarket. <br /> <br /> This radio station, there is a lot of dialogue, but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad, well maintained, the characters are so cute once you spend the last 20 minutes asking for more time thi s Unusual screen a couple, but the brevity in the nature of the story, so it was a good call from the director did not give in.
