This is an incredible comeback film director mastermind, Tsui Hark. This is one of the few films that deserve to come face-to-face game to Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer. Since beginning of the film, I was astronishing backs on each edge that have been <br /> <br /> deplicted with great style. If you are a science fiction or Chinese martial arts, "freak", you will love the excessive amount of many 3D effects and realistic computer-generated weapons. There comes a fine performance (as always) by Ekin Cheng, who plays «Sky King». He teams up with Louis Coy (Red), I was very impressed with its flexible "wing", rejects incoming attacks. Martial movements of the actors were experienced in all respects. This is not only a great action, but has a complex storyline. Many Criticisers this movie complain about the lack of plot / theme or simply "stuck in random bits debrise» and even described as "The Legend of Pu." However, the viewer can not hope to watch Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga Cartoons understand this film. Others who famarialy movie «Wu Xia» will have a appoach. In respect. It can be a weakness, which could have been foreseen. Blow, who was deliveried to the enemy at the most recent fight scenes could have been more substantial and devastiingly made.In despite all this, it must be seen.
