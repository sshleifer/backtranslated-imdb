For example, Shakespeare was really proud. Laurence Fishburne was not his best, but certainly not bad. Kenneth Branagh, on the other hand, was brilliant. His cunning was as beautiful as it plays with the audience. Very good work. <br /> <br /> There were sometimes too little dramas where one would have expected more. Kill box office, for example, was a bit overshadowed by too much going away from each other, causing the viewer to turn your head to figure it all out. <br /> <br /> I have already said Michael Malone? His madness striken Roderigo was unusual; even annoying. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen before Othello, to see it. If you have not read Othello, to see it. If you have not heard of Othello, to see it. You do, on the other hand, do yourself a favor, read it, seeing it performed on stage and hear it sing too.
