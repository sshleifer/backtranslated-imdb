The first review that I have seen Page 3 said, "that Madher Bhandarkar finally want to say?". Should he say something critical. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing about Page 3 it does not take sides. A lot of propaganda in general. This is a film that captures so many corners of the issue (I do not know what I call as "issue" here) and more like any ordinary film did not come up with solutions. I was so intrigued when I realized that the film ended almost the same scenario as it had begun. <br /> <br /> The film defines so many characters that are completely from a completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all part of the system that is becoming increasingly apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there will be more spoilers ahead. So, see page 3, if you want to see one of the most mature films lately.
