Despite the fact that there were a few rough edges and some storylines that were not the case, to the nature, it was a classic H: LOT. Characters is Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), were true to form, and the reunion scene Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) was so deep and well acted somehow, someday decorate the small screen. <, Br /> <br /> «Kill: The Movie» aka "eternal life" is a supporter of Flick, but stands on its own, as well as any 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura have done an excellent job in pulling the free end of the 7 seasons and all the main cast of "best damn show on television" together for the final series that NBC never bothered to give. Faithful «Homicide» form, there was no happy endings, that's life. This is something that has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie cutter cop shows on television to the left. Kudos to the writers and actors to create something on the scale series and in a film that challenged viewers and producers. <br /> <br /> ** I call myself a "maniac", if for no other reason than to keep my colleague in a cooperative mood. **
