Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Alice Walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy. When first released the members of the black community criticized his treatment of black men, while others asked why the white man directs this film about black women. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a young black woman named Celia, I grew up in rural America after the turn of the century. She has two children from her abusive parents, who snatched from her hands at birth. Her only consolation in her miserable life comes from her sister. <br /> <br /> Celie (played in recent years debutant Whoopi Goldberg) is married to an abusive husband (Danny Glover). The husband humiliated her sister, so she quickly removed from Celie life. <br /> <br /> The history of often harrowing as Celia maintains the hope that it may one day be reunited with his sister and her children. Throughout her life, she meets a variety of characters, including Sofia, tough as nails wife of her step-son, and Shug, loud and mellow lounge singer who taught her a thing or two about love. <br /> <br /> Spielberg's direction is likely this painting, which offers a brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances. I dare you to watch this movie and not be moved! The film The Color Purple manages to capture the essence of what a complicated history. While it seeks to minimize the lesbian aspects, as well as African history, both of which were so vivid in the book, the film stays true to its theme, letting the voice of Alice Walker shine. <br /> <br /> I could not begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded the film. Suffice it to say, however, is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again, and that left a deep impression on me. <br /> <br />
