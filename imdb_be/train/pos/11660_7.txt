A great piece of children's films buried in the world of archaic celticism. Setting the story around the famous book KELS, believed to be comprised monks from the small island of Iona, off the west coast of Scotland. <br /> <br /> In telling the story of a young student abbots, who comes from the forest in search of Crom-Cruic, rigid headless horseman pagan mythology. In the hope of restoring the lost artifact. <br /> <br /> films true beauty lies in its animation. Cell shaded in a vibrant and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in appearance seems less easy. Getting a lot of brilliant art style Cartoon Network series "Samurai Jack" for his use of ingenious solutions brand and depth of the background, constantly creates KELS Secret affective Celtic world, living in the shadow of the Viking invasion. <br /> <br /> The story can be highly inaccurate and lifestyle reflect lacks realism, but these facts are absolutely irrelevant, as the film sets itself in the world of fantasy and Celtic mysticism revived. Girl in the forest is a great addition, and, in my opinion, makes the picture of what it is, as it slides through the branches. As mysterious and disappearing as the nymph with qualities resembling legendary Cheshire cat from Alice and Wonderland. <br /> <br /> KELS Secret absolute pleasure. For all sexes, all ages, this is a great part of the family movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect to be awed, but instead was pleasantly surprised!
