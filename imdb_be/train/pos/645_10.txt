I hate the long-Talky more French films, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest French film of all. I saw him twice in the mid-70s, and then he disappeared. But I finally see him again in 1999, and fell in love all over again. The great thing is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it was 25 years ago. If you have not seen it, do not miss your chance!
