In a word ... strange. <br /> <br /> I was initially not too keen to see Pinjar, as I thought it would be another film lamenting the partition and displays a bias toward India and Pakistan. I was so totally wrong. Pinjar is heart-wrenching, emotional and intellectual cinema without any visible flaws. I had it after seeing it. It's stuck in my mind for so long; theme, the pain, the loss, the emotion- it was so real. <br /> <br /> This is really a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in Bollywood today. It has no bias or prejudice and distributed protects human history. Where no country is referred to as good or bad. There are evil, evil Indians and Pakistanis are good Indians and Pakistanis. Cinematography cool and melodic music, informative (thanks Gulzar sahib) and intrusive. Everything about the film was amazing ... and that acts only took my breath away. All of them were absolutely reject. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in viewing an intelligent and really great movie ... look no further. This film gives it all. I recommend it with all my heart. AMAZING I can not describe how wonderful it is.
