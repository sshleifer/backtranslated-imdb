I enjoyed catch the film at a very late late late TV and it has kept its interest through out the whole picture. This beautiful terrible, but look for the mysterious English house with evil looking weired decorations and furniture and rooms that make you wonder why anyone would want to rent a house or even his owner. There are four (4) Cossack regarding this house, and every inhabitant of the house meets with all kinds of problems. You will notice the beautiful lakes and ponds around the house, as well as the sweet singing of the birds, but do not let that fool you, there is terror everywhere. Cushing, «Black Jack», «80 gives a great performance as a human life in the house and even Christopher Lee," The Curse of the Crimson Altar ", 68, and his young daughter, Chloe francs (Jane Reed) to make a great exciting story together, his daughter for some reason, likes to read witchcraft books! If you like the horrible, scary and mysterious movie, with a lot of surprises, this is the movie for you !!!!
