While traveling by train across Europe, American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet each other and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States of America, and Celine in Paris. <br /> <br /> Â«Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite songs, in fact, one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. This low-budget film with a very simple and a real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and dialogues are stunning. Direction strange feeling handing Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I have just completed my review of the number 1000 in IMDb, and I choose to "Before Sunrise" for this significant amount, because it is a very special film for me. I can not understand why this film was not nominated for an Oscar, with such a wonderful script, direction and performances. Yesterday I probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. My vote is ten <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "Anti do Amanhecer" ( "Before Sunrise")
