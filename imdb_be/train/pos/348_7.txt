Slasher these photos are past their sell by date, but this one is good fun. <br /> <br /> Valentine cards themselves are witty and well thought out. <br /> <br /> The film has one peach line ... "He is not an angel ...." when it is actually an angel !!! Watching Buffy reruns will never be the same! <br /> <br /> Throw sizzling display of young talent, but the story does not give them enough real depth. Denise Richards on the DVD extras, seemed to think that the girls on the set of connected well together, and it would give the impression that you empathised with their characters. Sorry, but no! <br /> <br /> The direction is very good, managing to show very little actual gore, and relying on your imagination understand the threat. Much can be said also in a similar manner in which Miss Richards and Heigel entirely remove their clothing ... :-( <br /> <br /> In fact, main directorial plus lies within the "borrowing" of ideas from various other previous chopper clicks. Psycho shower scene is tributed, along with the "masking" of Halloween. <br /> <br /> to kill someone is hiding in the bodybag, although it is quite an original one, as far as I know !!! <br /> view <br /> The light is not very scary, but a few good moments of the jump. If it was a choice between the hole and it is, though, select the hole. U March movies have had their day, and it's just another slasher. Very good slasher, but nothing groundbreaking !!!
