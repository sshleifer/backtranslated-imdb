A strong pilot, two o'clock this episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and the background for the "Enterprise" in the "prequel" to "Star Trek" the original series. He stumbles a few times Into conventions and clichés "Track" - candy colored space strippers never seems to go out of fashion, and I can already anticipate snickering references to T`Pol as "Seven Volcano" - but the ensemble looks strong, well-drawn characters, and we can already see hints that this crew must be more creative in different ways than before (later?) series. Scott Bakula to get into the right note as the captain of a brazen and bold Kirk, but without complacency and arrogance, and I'm looking forward to the ways in which the series will feature an engineer, a master of weapons and public relations (not only the famous telephone operator more! ) as supporting players. The authors seem to have made a big mistake made in the «Star Trek: The Next Generation», «Deep Space 9" and «Voyager»: Instead of starting with a large ensemble cast and give character to straighten out, he starts with less characters kernel that are a little more variety can be added later - which, I hope, is because after about half a dozen episodes, you will need more variety.
