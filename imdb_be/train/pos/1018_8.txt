The film was sub-par, but Pilot is television provides a great springboard into what became the Sci-Fi fans ideal program. Actors and put special effects (for TV series) are spectacular. With smart interesting scenario they do not interfere. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 is now one of my favorite programs.
