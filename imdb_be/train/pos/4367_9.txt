I have not seen this movie in years so my knowledge is a bit rusty. I remember thinking that this film twice the film Braveheart. It's just a more realistic and has more believable characters. CBSI Roy looks like one would imagine Rob Roy to look messy hair and beard with a simple clothing. In addition, Liam Nesson has a Celtic look about him, he is like a Scot, and more importantly, it looks like Rob Roy. It's a comparison that angers some people, but to compare it with Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson allegedly plays the man who caused the legend can be described as a 6-foot-7 giant while Gibson almost a foot shorter. The history contains a bit of romance, the plot and lost history. Sound anything like Braveheart? But instead of film, which calls for "freedom", freedom and nationalism, we get a film that says that honor, love and justice. This makes it more interesting film. Much like a gladiator. The cast is fantastic and Lee Nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavor. The history of most to how it deals with the heroism and humanity. The scene where Mary was raped, and it comes out of the burning house with an expression of this force should be her Scottish sperm washing her crotch in extreme panic. This is what the character in Braveheart would never do. In general, it is an excellent and almost perfect watch. Go and see it!
