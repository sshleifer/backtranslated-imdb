Ideal for families with young children who are looking for light-hearted film that does not contain violence and fun for the child and funny, though, is quite commonplace for adults. Not bad for a low-budget film assignments. Children will be surprised from the workshop of Santa and the "magic" that allows him to enter the house through the chimney, which are too small, or home, who do not have a chimney at all! <br /> <br /> children will tremble on the success of Santa's reverse breakdown devil named Pitch (full in classic red dress with horns and a tail!). They will sympathize with the poor girl, the greatest desire to have a little doll to love. And the poor little rich boy who just wants to spend time with his eternally absent parents. And what child does not know someone in the school who are just as negotiable boys who recruited the Pitch, to help capture and Sant spoil Christmas? In the end, everyone, including pesky boys get exactly what they deserve for Christmas! <br /> <br /> The film will be to win over the children in both Santa and the message of love that he gives people around the world. <, Br /> <br />
