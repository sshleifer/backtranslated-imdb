Fido is the story of a well-bred zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. Everything falls apart, even if the zombies young Tiogo Fido eats the neighbor's family. Since then, a natural disaster (well, maybe not a disaster, but to some extent, chaos) takes place. Most people treat their zombies with justice, and one of these characters is sleeping with his zombies (a very funny part of the movie, when it is not very disturbing, too). And we see a loving FIDO, what he can do. This is a very funny and unique film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent of the movies about zombies (NO negatives in this statement). I highly recommend it for people who are looking for something funny and unusual. I rate it 8/10. Rated R for zombie-related violence
