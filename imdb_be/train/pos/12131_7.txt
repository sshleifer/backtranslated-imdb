the film concerns about Philippe (Lel Howard), he is a serious, but a disabled medical student .He falls fatally in love with the heartless, predatory waitress named Mildred (Bette Davis) .It leaves him, interaction with other (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny) . At the same time, he courted other suitors (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee), but it returns in a mutually destructive things. <br /> <br /> easily the best and the first of many film version of the novel by Somerset Maugham. Bette Davis as Cockney tough waitress win another wonderful interpretation of the charm and smoldering performance, absolutely hypnotic in its account of slavery, which takes place from the beginning to finale.Davis towered stardom with her role performance.Her harsh and rude imperious woman is repeated several once a posteriori acting. Leslie Howard as essentially good and worthy student subtly destroyed gives a beautiful and melancholic performance.He was terrific actor (Gone with the Wind), except for a producer and writer, and dead in a plane crash during the Second World War. Both will play again in the Petrified Forest (1936). The atmosphere of the film meticulously restored to RKO Studios (Radio Picture Inc) quite convincingly. Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Henreyd; and in 1964 Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. A movie like the classic movie buffs. Rating: Very good, but a little dated.
