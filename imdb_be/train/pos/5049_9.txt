I had to see this gem twice to really appreciate all this. If the widowed father of two interrupts the sleep of his two sons with shocking discovery, they are torn between it and no faith. As the horrific events of the story unfolds, we learn a lot about his father, his two sons, and their destinies. With shocking twist after a shocking twist, the film never allows a lull in the plot. Bill Paxton plays the father, but the most notable performances in the fact that his eldest son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and his younger son, Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while and you want to watch it a few times to evaluate every aspect of the complex plot. I give this film 9/10.
