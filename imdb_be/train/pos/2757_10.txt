If you would like to see the film a different sort when you feel love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this film makes you think. Although Georges mentally handicapped, you can see the final intelligence in the end, when love gives you the direction is not the brain. I'm not emotional, but this film makes you feel like a man. The film is as good as Forrest Gump in my faith. Foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but not enough advertising to make them popular. Â«Rang-e Khoda" (God color) by Majid is another example of foreign films, with almost the same taste.
