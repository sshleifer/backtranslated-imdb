This may not be the best movie of 2006, but it was just a movie, to initiate and to think about.The Sentinel good political thriller film, which seems to be similar or even borrows some elements from the other political thriller films such as in the line of fire and Manchurian candidate. The main plot of the film is similar to other films, like this: conspiracy to kill the president of the United States. Michael Douglas stars as a Secret Service agent Pete Garrison, which is acute surgery only to find out later that he was framed.Kiefer Sutherland co-stars as a kind of rival named David Brekinrizhem and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin, who is a newcomer agent going under the direction of an agent Brekinrizha and Oscar winner Kim Besinzher Award as the first lady Sarah Ballentine. One improvement for this film could be more action, as according to some sources is considered to be the same fighter as a thriller movie, but a good thing about this film, not only in the conspiracy to murder, to kill the US president, this also applies to moles (traitor) in the secret service who heads the president in the wrong direction.
