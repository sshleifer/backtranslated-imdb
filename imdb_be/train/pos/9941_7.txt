You know the story - a group of courageous entirely hopeless not to join the competition, they would seem to have no chance of winning - it's a fairy tale that has been done to death Hollywood (Bring It On, The Karate Kid, Escape to victory, the best of the best etc.). Now Korea gives it a go with taekwondo team fighting for glory ?? and guess what ?? the result is predictable, but ultimately fun. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film falls flat on his face to the young talented actors who really make you care about the characters, and this, in turn, keeps you look through. <br /> <br /> Supporters your typical martial arts film may be disappointed ?? Taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of moves and acrobatics seen in most kung fu movies; the action is limited (albeit impressive) feet and the occasional punch. It does not matter, though, since it is the interaction of the characters and their struggle to make something of himself that makes this film a success.
