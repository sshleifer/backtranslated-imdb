I have to admit, once on top, I'm not a big fan of "family" films these days. Most of them are, IMHO, sentimental crap. But this one, like TOY STORY, Pixar's previous film with, a lot of fun. The two main characters were perhaps a little too soft (especially compared to the two wires in Antz, but otherwise this film is better), but the rest of the film more than made for it. Animations looked great, humor, though wide, was consistently good (I especially liked the line Hopper "If I had not promised his mother before her death, I will not kill you, I'll kill you!") And the actors doing the voices, except for the two leads, it was terrific (Denis Leary makes animated film, what a concept). And, like everyone else, I loved the bills! I hope the video is new.
