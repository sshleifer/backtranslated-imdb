It was the eighth and last film Columbia Whistler and the only one without Richard Dix, who retired from the cinema and had to die in the next year. It's still a competent thriller, the machine is carried out without a fine, but ?? that something is missing: Dix! Stories in Whistler series were always interesting, sometimes brilliant, the script often Noir is always atmospheric, but it was not only the Whistler, who hung together on the screen, too, Dix. <br /> <br /> A young couple going out for a whole two weeks to get the desire to marry in the pouring rain, but fail if the first potential bride disappears, it is found to be already married before she appears, It is going crazy. Is a potential suitor to delay, even if the private member he hired to find her suddenly his snails and Lams, or love is blind? Who twisting, that is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate film, OK, if a bit boring, the best moments of excellent Lenore Aubert came next film in the Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was wonderful, as always, on loan from Boston Black. In addition, the only way out, where he was soaked from the Whistler must stoop in the rain, if it has not been sprayed with the foam of the sea vote. <br /> <br /> A lot has happened in this last hour, it is worth watching again and again, as usual, fans of the genre, like me. Whistler radio series began in 1942, lasted until 1955 acceleration to almost 700 half-hour shows, almost all of which are available on mp3, and based on what I've heard so far, almost all of which are well worth listening to as well.
