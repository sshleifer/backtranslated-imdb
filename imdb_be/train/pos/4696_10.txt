despite the fact that this film is not quite old, no matter how many times I watch it, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> One particular quote in the movie is released. <br /> <br /> When Denis (Joe Piscopo) arrives at the office, and the parks in a disabled spot PDRA, Denis partner says <br /> <br /> "can not leave here, it's disabled.» <br /> <br /> Denis replies, "I am disabled, I psychotic». <br /> <br /> that is one of the many lines in the movie, no matter how many times you watch, it will make you giggle. < br /> <br /> Johnny Dangerously stands in my top 5 comedy / falsification films of all time. <br /> <br /> as an added bonus it also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle to discard. So watch this film and all ayutstsa & many others who watched it, you'll be hooked.
