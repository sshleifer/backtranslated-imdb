Very much not terrible and well animated for one of Disney's direct throw in the video stream. As in the previous sequel (The Lion King 2) I was happy that Disney has brought most of the original voice actors, which makes a big difference, and they have maintained a good level of traditional animation. The plot hangs around for a while, but we digress from the endless series of jokes, ranging from cheerful dull. To break off-plot and joke they gave us some silly musical sequences that are the same as jokes, ranging from entertainment to emergency trip to the refrigerator. For the most part MST3K such moments are soft and full of untapped potential and does not really add a whole lot to the movies, but to act as an agent for the hour retrospective. New characters, at least pleasant, and the old characters from doing their job, so I can not fault them there. Overall, this movie is not bad, and it makes for a good frivolous filler between the more serious Lion King called.
