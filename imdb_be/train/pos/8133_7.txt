Well, I personally do not like rap, but I still found a fear of black hat cheerful. I'm sure I did not get some inside jokes, but some I knew, and it was funny enough to make me laugh only after I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of Spinal Tap, so naturally I had to check it out. It was from this deriviative Spinal Tap, sometimes rough, but this film is still standing on its own as an original, smart and funny satire. My personal favorite: "Back in the time of slaves, they had no hats to protect them from the sun, so that in the end they were too tired to appear now have a hat .."
