The first two parts seek to reduce to absurdity the growth of costly wars and rule, nationalist barbarians. The third part considers that the progress and exploration to the moon and beyond is the key to significant use of human talent and resources. He has a speech that some viewers dismiss naive or pretentious, but what others are doing tingling with excitement. It depicts a space gun / launcher and a helicopter, along with inventive devices of mass communication, elevators, flat screen panels and wireless intercoms. It's probably wrong about the windowless buildings in the future. But it reflects the child, as a vision limitless scientific / technical studies. <br /> <br /> To me, it seems that the film is about a group of rational-minded thinkers guided Spinozean such morality in their quest to perpetuate themselves and live ethically by scientific progress and a one world government. Symbols of progress (for example, the two plots) believe humanity can "live forever", keeping our experiments and progress for future generations, always standing in our humanity, as though on the shoulders of giants. <br /> <br /> Arthur C. Clarke (author of 2001: A Space Odyssey) offered this film by Stanley Kubrick as an example of the excellent SF film. Kubrick hated him and said that he would never watch another movie based on Clark offers (source: special millennial introduction Clarke in his novel 2001). Although the late Clark continued offering him at the top of your list every time someone asked him about the best SF movies. It has a beautiful design art Menzies, but mediocre special effects (persons. The toy tanks). <br /> <br /> Personally, I loved it, and I think it's great to take your breath now. It's a bit naive credence to the creation of a society without crime for a long period of time. Moreover, it seems unlikely the inevitability of progress. I think we could just as easily go back to the Dark Ages, or at least become so stagnant in science, we are killing ourselves from overpopulation through or from our inability to avoid the next major disaster. But it is a good reflection of the importance of taking risks to the public and nurses perturbation potential threats cosmic accidents and deaths. It forces us to choose the side of progress over the petty desires of safety and comfort and happiness: <br /> <br /> CABAL: Â«Too many {} and others too early, and we call it death MAN But there is no rest. . and no end to it should not go. - the conquest of the conquest of this small planet and its wind and road, and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him and then the world of him, and finally across the vastness of the stars. . and when he took all the depths of space and all the mysteries of time - he will still start ". <br /> <br /> cabal: "If we are no more than animals - we have to snatch our little pieces of good fortune to live and suffer and pass entirely mattering not more - than all the other animals do - or did." {He shows up at the stars.} "This is - or is it the whole universe - or not ..." (quote from the script) <br /> <br /> If this sounds like a rationalization. devoting the whole of society to progress, the members of the council (world government) would seem technocrats. But in fact, these "technocrats", allow their citizens to become craftsmen or pursue other passions freely, and they must be suppressed by government restrictions, laws against science and experience, as well as other mandates and limiting the use of force that would turn its critic to Tirana . <br /> <br /> really huge group of rebels in the story feel humiliated by all the events of the Council of science and technology, so they are trying to put an end to the progress and the end of freedom of the Council of the experiment. Progress-based advice is not to suppress the freedom of speech the rebels, although only prepares its "peaceful" gas emergency and just wanting the freedom and space to continue their progress. <br /> <br /> So, it is also a story about the freedom to do science, as well as about the wonders of progress. Many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises, except in the case of social bias (many want to ban cloning, for example) or naturalism (some do not want to develop freely, and would rather we just become extinct once enslaved to the ground) or fear / reasons (some believe that we are not ready for advanced science / technology, because we could destroy itself). But Kabbalah (President of the Board) has the answer to the question of danger: "Our research {} Revolution did not abolish the death or danger, he just did death and the risk is worth it." (The script).
