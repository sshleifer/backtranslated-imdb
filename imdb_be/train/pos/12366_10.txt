A great movie, one of the best horror films of 70-ies. She realistic setting and atmosphere. As usual, it was inevitable the usual negative comments. I noticed that most horror movies a certain period of time a lot can not even achieve prosperity. It is obvious that the majority of old horror movies and should be denigrati, similar psychological mechanism that moves the minds of the music critics of the potential here. <br /> <br /> Before you read an overview of already knew that the final decision. The film is a good gift, because 10 is really well done. Raines reads very well, and the film as a way in which it was produced reminds me a lot of Kubrick's films. He really impressed. Great movie indeed. I think the film anthology years'70.
