There's a lot of stuff from the comics Modesty Blaise novels and that would have been great in the movie. Unfortunately, a few attempts have been made, and they have justified a great potential in the character. Thus, there is no modesty you know from the comics (now reprinted in good publications from Titan Books). This modesty about 5 or 6 years before the first band, and from what you can gather together with its history, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> Miramax had the film rights to the character, with Quentin Tarantino in his capacity as a lawyer and technical consultant. The first projects Miramax project tried to adapt one of the best novels, but never did manage to get out of some important element. Tarantino was not happy with any of them, and offered to remove his name from the project so that they can continue. To the credit of the studio, they wanted to keep him in the process, because they knew that he "got" character and her world. With the rights cinema close to expiration, they decided to try a different approach. The result was "My Name Is Modesty," a small direct-to-video film, which introduces the character. <br /> <br /> The film does not make Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald. These symbols are important to Blaise adventure for most of the published stories. What this film does this shows the power of nature itself. It never loses its composure and you never doubt that it meets the naked in a room full of gangsters with guns. Much of the film takes place in a casino, which certainly saved money on production. It does not matter. The film does not come across as cheap. Instead, he gives a fairly complete (and believable) backstory for the character and shows how far she thinks ahead. If Miramax adaptation of any comic book stories or novels now they have put background character is beautiful and not have to spend much time on its "origin". I understand that the word "straight to video" not credible, but this film is worth a look.
