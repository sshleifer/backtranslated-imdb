One of the joys of picking up the recent collection of Bela Lugosi get to see wonderful films as The Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bel Lugosi team in a film that delves into the meteorites and radiation and while the science is quite absurd (especially techniques Karloff camera and Janos movement is used to determine site specific meteorite) and downright funny, I did not care on loan, because the film quite enjoyable. The effects are well made for its time, acting is great, and the finish was perfect. It reminds me of the pulp science-fiction novels and comics of the 1940s and 50s, complete with ray guns and absurd science. You have to watch this movie!
