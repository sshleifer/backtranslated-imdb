I really can not remember who recommended, but they said that it was one of their favorite movies. It is certainly strange. - as a curiosity on the highway accident <br /> <br /> Someone said that truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth is there is something to see. I really can not understand how a fictional account of this documentary will be released this year. How can you improve it? Aunt and cousin of Jackie Kennedy to remove yourself from the New York society and hide in the Hamptons. In the process they become hermits, and that is best described as "crazy cat lady." They would have remained hidden had the city step to condemn property for dirt and subsequent rescue Jackie. This film was made after salvation. All the time, you could not help but think, "how bad it was before?" This is a look at high society from the dark side, and it is quite charming.
