Wow! All I can say is that when Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (it says in Russian), I'm passing now. In her short skirt, high boots, and a pronounced bust line, she is a real beauty, even if it is kind of like a zombie eye shadow comes and goes. It is 30 minutes, without a doubt, the most sexual of the series. Pay attention to realistic and exposes duel with Bronson until he ungallantly snails it on the chin, ruining all the fun. Well, maybe I should move away from my hormonal response. <br /> <br /> This is a very well-produced half-hour series that underestimated force success, Buck Houghton. Naturally, the manufacturers want to lead off the third season with above-average input. This post nuclear holocaust America (we know, because it is part of the invasion force) and only the American and Soviet Bronson Montgomery remained, along with about twenty tons of realistic debris. They wander among the devastation in alternating moods, while we wonder how long it will take for biology trump policy, which, of course, it ultimately makes (lucky Bronson). And that's about it. No real conversation, so that Bronson must say that rather overblown except. However, the script is still interesting, and quite bold for its time, even assuming that not all Russian women look like truck drivers (the popular stereotype of the cold war time). <br /> <br /> In passing-- it is very interesting that the very Slavic views Bronson (Buchinskiy) is cast as the American and glossy view Montgomery as a Slav. Appearance-wise, it must be reversed. I think that the manufacturers do not want to cast an American in a physically weak role of women, regardless of appearances. However this may be, there is little conventional TZ fright or the atmosphere, still, this episode is very, very watchable 30 minutes.
