Review on screening world premieres September 9, 2006 in the Isabel Bader Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> It was an interesting premise, but it seemed too long too many shots piles eWaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables, etc. dispatched to China tonnes, and then sorted and converted into new products to sell back) and another desolation. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers tried to get more people are interviewed in order to improve the human factor, but often prevented from it because of Chinese censorship. However, what it was interesting. high-end bits of the real estate agent Shanghai embellishment and flaunt showing her luxurious mansion and gardens, interspersed with scenes of other people living in medieval conditions were particularly striking. Tracking shot of opening 480m factory floor was exactly as well. Scenes activities in the project of the Three Gorges Dam were also addition to the film Jia Hans-JE in TIFF (Function Still Life / Sanxia Haoren and documentary Dong), which were also built around this object. <br /> <br /> Director Jennifer Beychval producer Nick de Pencier, cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Burtinskaya were all there on the stage for the Q & A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Veynzuey was introduced from the audience and thanked as the key person who helped in the access to the ground in China.
