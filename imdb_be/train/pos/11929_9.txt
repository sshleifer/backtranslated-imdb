One of the little things that are often forgotten about this film is one of a family business. <br /> <br /> At the time, in 1994, the film held the record for the biggest premiere of the film in history (and may continue to hold). It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - without a doubt, in honor of the original film "Angels" who "haunted" Pittsburgh. In this remake they "excite" in the California Angels. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the premiere took place in the distant past Three Rivers Stadium, which was the home of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Steelers at the time (Pirates currently located in PNC Park and the Steelers at Heinz Field). The premiere took place on the silver screen, that was five stories high and contained inside the stadium (and may even continue to hold) the record of the largest premiere ever shown of 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Donets and Christopher Lloyd were all in attendance to the delight of thousands of sports fans.
