I usually stay away from the TV movies because in many ways, you know, it's telefilms five seconds into the picture. This one got my attention because of the unusual name and its grim, well-thought-out mood, which is set from the beginning. While there is always rain confirmed my suspicions ridiculous stories (even if the claims that set in California film was largely shot around rugged Vancouver, BC), dark and oppressive in the open air perfectly complement the excellent acting Olmos.
