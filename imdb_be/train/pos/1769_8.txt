Just got out of the preview for this film. He made me laugh every 30 seconds. The ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face, and it was I'm sorry that I did not buy that much coke. There are, of course, some calm, but, in general, is very interesting. The film allows Steve Carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell's "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in his films. Paul Rudd cheerful as always. I like that it can be so funny in this broad comedy and continues to work in the indie drama (as PS). I think that Seth Rogen has to get more work done, because it's so damn talented and charming. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you are easily offended, sun to see this movie. If you are a rabid feminist, sun to see this movie. And please, no matter what, even if you think you are one of those "hip" parents do not take their children to see this movie. Of course, you should allow your teenager to go see this movie, just do not watch it with them. That would make for some incredibly awkward moments.
