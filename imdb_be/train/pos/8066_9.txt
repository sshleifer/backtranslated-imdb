One of the best movies of John Ford's "The Informant" does not have any grandiose scenery of the American West. Instead, intense drama Ford was known for being played out on at least a cross-country nature of the British actor Victor McLaglen face in. The former boxer, who once faced with Joe Louis in the ring, gives the Academy awards picture disgraced IRA soldiers Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life <br /> <br /> the plot is elegantly simple :. in 1922 Dublin, hungry and humiliated the man who had been thrown out of the IRA, because not can kill an informant in Hal One blood, he becomes an informant. For £ 20 it betrays one on "tans", and all night he drinks and earns its money in the blood rapidly alternating spasms of guilt, denial, self-pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions. <br /> <br /> This is a great difficulty given the nature of the seemingly simple gypo, which is the most impressive achievement of the film. in most film burly lout type gypo would be cast as a heavy, he would have at best two or three lines and be disposed of quickly, so that the hero and the villain can to their showdown. The "snitch» Gypo himself as a hero and a villain, while dismantling its internal noise, every bit of which explicitly shared with the audience. <br /> <br /> Since the novel Liam OFlaertite in previously filmed in 1929, CSC has given Ford a very modest budget. The Director and his colleagues, in particular, the Cinematographer Joseph H. August turned in their favor in the establishment claustrophobic masterpiece of a man at war with themselves. In addition to the Oscar McLaglen «The Informer» also won his first John Ford, along with wins for best screenplay and best score.
