I just watched it for the first time in a long time - I had forgotten, and as creative images were, and how witty film. I have not forgotten, but the initial stage, which (with the scene in the Candlelight Club in Waterloo Bridge) among the most romantic ever filmed <br /> <br /> Anyone who is interested in politics and history will love the cuff links of the film. - who are interested in the romance will be touched by Hunter-Niven, and those who like visuals will enjoy the image of the underworld <br /> <br /> My favorite movie is "strange man" made about the same time. - but this one is fine. <br /> <br />
