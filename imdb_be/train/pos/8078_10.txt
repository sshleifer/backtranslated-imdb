Despite the fact that this was a disaster at the box office, this is my favorite film. It gives a strong signal about the family. It has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis. Compared with other films Bollywood, the fight scenes are more realistic in this movie. This incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see Indian Godfather, Amitabh reflects that in this movie. Do not read the reviews from the critics, they are just ignorant. This film has a good mix of comedy, romance, drama, and especially action. So if you want to see the action more realistic than Main Hoon Na (still a good movie), it's a movie.
