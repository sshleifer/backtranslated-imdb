I only saw the first part of this series, when he made his debut in the late 90s and just recently had the opportunity to watch all three parts via Netflix (convenient service along the way). In general, I liked the light-hearted, sometimes challenged by genre, a mini-series. Story of a young man falling for an older woman, it seems to be working, and the actors all right. Yes, it does have some romance clich√©s running in the rain or at the station goodbye, but the characters have a chance to be explored, so that does not seem cheesy, as it would be if it were some sort of Tom Hanks vehicle, or the like. Robson Green, which sometimes reminds me of a separated-at-birth Baku Scott does an excellent job of someone who is head over heels in love, and the tide of desire and rejection throws in a series watchable fare. Personally, I think that the series can be done with two episodes, but this is up for debate, I suppose. Apparently, there is a sequel, and it should arrive tomorrow through Netflix.
