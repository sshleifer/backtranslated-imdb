In Paris, a shy and insecure bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rents an old apartment without a bathroom, where the previous tenant, an Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange), committed suicide. Unfriendly concierge (Shelley Winters) and a hard landlord Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas) imposes strict rules of behavior and Trekovsky feels like riding on its neighbors. At the same time he visited Simon in hospital and befriends her friend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After the death of Simeon, Trekovsky sense to get it, and believes that his master and the neighbors they have devised a scheme to get him to also commit suicide. <br /> <br /> strange «Le Locataire» is unsettling and eerie tale of paranoia and error. The history and the process of madness and loss of identity lone Trelkovsky developed slowly in a nightmarish atmosphere in a bad place in his apartment, and what's really going on is totally unpredictable. Performances strange and Isabelle Adjani is very beautiful. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "O Inquilino" ( "Tenant")
