Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko someone we know in everyday life. They were so natural and transformation Sugiyama is an incredibly believable. The cost is so touching, it brought me to tears. The choreography was beautiful, without sounding sports. graceful dancing and charm Mei gave me goose bumps. Tamako a surprisingly beautiful character. You can almost see the enchanted schoolgirl in her face as she recalls the observation of "The King and I". Aoki character at the same time funny and pathetic. Masako is so overwhelming natural as bewildered wife, you almost want to hug her, to reassure her that everything would be fine. <br /> <br /> This film is really a keeper.
