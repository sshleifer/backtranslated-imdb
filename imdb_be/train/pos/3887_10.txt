I was able to tape it from my companion, but I would like to get the original release in the format we use here in the States. Eddie really Glorious in this play in San Francisco. I do not remember laughing so hard at the stand routine. My wife and I both enjoyed this band, and his work on the Glorious I just wish I could buy a copy of the certificate and financial support to Eddie through my purchase. We need more of his shows are available.
