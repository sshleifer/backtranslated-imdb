Dehumanizing effect of war is much studied subject in the movie; as it is equally brutal, but potentially lifesaving, dehumanizing effect of military training. Joel Schumacher «Tigerland» is worth a standard template, we see people treated like dirt, but appear as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their officers, and the court whether such an extreme process reserved could be justified; as a judgment about the merits of the war, for which they are trained (as a rule, as here, Vietnam). But «Tigerland» has an interesting perspective by centering its cost by brash dissident name Bozz (played excellently well Colin Farrell), who understands that all authority controls ultimately, by agreement, as well as the lack of awareness among the disenfranchised of their own complicity, Around this character, student, exciting plot was built, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves America (as Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal jacket", to name just one other film of this kind, lost focus as soon as the action shifted to Asia). Despite the fact that this is not a film of stunning originality is supremely well done and exciting viewing for: best film from this director, which I have seen, and one of the best in its genre.
