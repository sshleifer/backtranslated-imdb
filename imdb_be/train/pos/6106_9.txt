When it comes to erotic genre, I was lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the story, without getting up or find something else to watch. This film is different. Julie Davis (I Love Nha Touch Me) directed two very strong leading participants Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery ~ d in this exciting thriller. Cyrus convincing as "Kim" sweet innocent romance novelist, that becomes entangled in a web of seduction Doug Jeffrey «The Man» handsome stranger. Cyrus loses control of their bans in the roles, and as an actress, giving what could be just another T and the depth and realism. I think this is her best performance yet. And the direction of Julie Davis is a great gift to erotica.
