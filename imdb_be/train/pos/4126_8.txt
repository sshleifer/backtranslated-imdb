What a night. Perry Mason, then a gun, I'll go with the subsequent Gunsmoke (if it was a half hour), and finally at 10:30 pm came «Sea Hunt» with a beautiful opening theme music and the boat Mike off to new adventures. Awesome .. Regardless of the history, it was the main character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, sincere. A man and a man People boy. It called on the interest of the boat, which lasted for many years. Why do not they show on cable, or make it available on video, I do not know .. Too bad.
