"Men of Honor" - a true story about a proud and stubborn black navy diver (fairy Cuba Gooding Jr.) is definitely a great movie that both touching and entertaining, and it's part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema. Excellent performances are the main reason to make this film something really special and very enjoyable, great experience. Charismatic Robert De Niro's amazing how rude, brutal and merciless Chief Billy Sunday - a role written for him almost. This film, along with the fantastic "15 Minutes" (2001) are two recent evidence that he is still one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, the "men of honor" includes an excellent job with Cuba Gooding Jr., who was one of the most promising young black actors as "Boyz n the hood." "Men of Honor" goes straight to the company, "Jerry Maguire," "As good as it gets" and "Instinct". Cuba Gooding Jr. is skillful and a fantastic actor, and I'm ready to get a lot more than a great movie from him. "Men of Honor" are also quite excellent story line and perhaps the most exciting diving sequence of film history. This is a great, exciting movie, and I can only recommend.
