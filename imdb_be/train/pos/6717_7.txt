This documentary was very thorough and revealing, and at the same time, entertaining, which I thought was pretty impressive. I felt as if they had done a very good job of covering the sport from its origins to the present, but, nonetheless, there is a reason why I do not give a high evaluation of this film ... <br /> < br /> I felt as if from time to time the story is too much emphasis on "proper names" of the sport, so to say too much in some places where the surf, and especially too many individual surfers I felt. as if the documentary was more concerned with the nature of sport, sport and ideology, etc., it would be better (although Mr. This, of course, was covered, I do not think there is as long as it is justified). <br /> <br /> And for many people who are not totally crazy about surfing, sometimes hear them move on and then on the specific locations and specific surfers can get boring. Although the videos and in-depth study respected, it could be presented in a way that will be better for those who are not avid surfers. <br /> <br / > in addition, my biggest disappointment was in the time they were talking about how absolutely amazing and miraculous by certain acts in the history of surfing was still they had no actual footage of the events that unfold, and all the while you are waiting to see on the silver screen this strange, exciting events that these men talk about how to change your life moments, and at the end all, all, you get a lot of people talking about it, and not the actual frames. It was too tantalizing himself, to hear these stories, and then do not see them. I understand the difficulty of obtaining footage of all, but please: neither let the event so much, and then do not show it. <br /> <br /> In general, very fresh documentary that I watched with pleasure; not the best documentary of the above reasons, but being very fresh and have some very exciting footage and a good soundtrack is a documentary that I would advise everyone to check out.
