This movie is underrated. I loved it. It was really sweet and hearty. The family, which struggled, but he did in a dysfunctional family, which is so typical of films today. The film did not make it a question, they have little money or the Dominican way of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Instead of the issue Viktor immature and needs to grow. He does, slowly, to the end of the film. He's got a ways to go, but it was heartfelt attempt to move forward. His grandmother is very nice and the scene where the little boy throws made me laugh for a long time. Genuinely heartfelt indie
