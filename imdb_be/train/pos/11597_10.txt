I read so many comments that I, too, shared about remembering this movie and want so badly to see him again, but I do not know the name of the movie. Fortunately, due to the execution of the search and search for names on this site, I read the comments left here and realized that it was a movie that I remember. Then I did a search and did not find the film and was so excited to be able to watch the movie again after 40 years. Because of this site and your comments, you have helped me, and so I want to thank you all. I want to share how I was able to find this movie for all of you who have been looking for a copy as well. It was on the VHS version in the Wonderful World of Disney "Call it the Courage", which contained 2 films, the second of which is "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle." He touched me now as much as it was 40 years ago, and now in I have my own copy of it. I think that it's only available on VHS. I found it on Ebay, and are, I saw a few copies there. Enjoy it, I know I did! <br /> <br /> This is a great story about love boy and an eagle he took over. When the time came to sacrifice eagle, eagle boy set free, because he could not let him be killed. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe to punish after the release of an eagle, the eagle also saved the boy's life and, moreover, taught him how to survive. The proximity of the boy and shared an eagle in the desert was so touching and filming was really cool. What an era it. I've never seen anything even close to this film!
