I just never get tired of playing Freebird. My husband was optional, so I was involved from the beginning. We keep in touch with John and helped with the promotion of the film in theaters, and now the DVD release. Even to the extent of distributing advertising cards on the cross-channel ferries and various locations throughout France. Freebird was able written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments, plus the choice of casting. Only Phil Daniels could fit the role of curmudgeon. An honor to meet John and throwing a party after the prime minister in January. What else do you want to do just ask John, or by e-mail or by phone, you know how to get me. Sue xx
