Jimmy Cagney race before your eyes constantly in the history of stage-producer who is actively fighting against the upcoming "talking" movies. <br /> <br /> This story of love, deceit, women and dances presented in such a way that as a spectator you've never treated a dull moment. the direction of mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was very good. the story never really got lost in the frantic pace. <br /> <br /> Some of the material presented here have become a bit outdated, but it does not matter, because when you look and that in 1933, the timing of its fabulous look is next to a large amount of drag other films that were released during this time. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is a pleasure in this movie, never losing composure as always working manufacturer preview made for cinemas as an intro. So he's trying to save your ass from going out of business, he was the producer of Broadway, before he started it. Joan Blondel incredible as abandoned love interest, Nan, it gives a energetic work, which is so unusual for films of the time, so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with the film was a huge production at the end. They were great in themselves, beautifully choreographed and well-made, but they just do not seem to fit into the story. The only connection they have to the main story is that Cagney had to put on 3 preview for 3 days to get a deal, and that's what he did. I found it hard to believe that this was the fact that the girls were rehearsing throughout the film, and that these kits can fit in a movie theater. Thus, "sitting in the backyard fence" was much more appropriate to the story. <br /> <br /> The performances at the end seemed to drag this furiously paced story of a dead end, and it was not a good thing. I was tired after watching the first musical sequence, and then I realized that there are two more comes up. These sequences and received a lot of laughter from the audience. <br /> <br /> In general, a great film with a sour end. <br /> <br /> 9/10
