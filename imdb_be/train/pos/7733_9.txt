Quality noir Foley in this rich and intense film of cellulose, seemingly "perfect" fit to each other. Frame-by-frame editing by editing, the film revolves around a boxer perturbed manifesting its own purpose (or lack thereof). Other comments about may indicate a lack of interest in the flesh, but I personally think that it's fine to combine cinematic piece!
