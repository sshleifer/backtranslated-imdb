At least half an hour a week. I'm not interested in anything on a large network 3 (ABC / CBS / NBC) in years. All Lions are interesting, although Larry can be annoying at times. I actually how close the action figures of land they bring to the Hunter. Most of the other characters are interesting. Secondary Siegfried and Roy's entertaining at times, too. Animation at the highest level, and by far the best the CG, which was done at a weekly TV show. Usually, when they hire the big names to star in the show, they try to hide a bad script or characters. Not quite right, in this show, though, There's a couple of characters that were weak and enhanced voice, but in general the characters stand on its own. <br /> <br /> This is definitely for the 16 and above. There's nothing that the majority of children did not hear, though, and most of the jokes will probably just fly right over their heads. This is certainly not as rough and harsh, like South Park, but bring some of the same "bash all" feel it. One example is that it makes fun of Dick Cheney's and Barbra Streisand at the same time in one episode. <br /> <br /> Father of the Pride, and other Dreamworks productions like Shrek and feel the spiritual heirs of Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, and Freakazoid. This is the same type of humor has increased. It may not be as clever as the classic television series Spielberg, but it is still good. <br /> <br /> I hope he finishes this season from the well, and updated for future seasons. Otherwise, I will never find a reason to watch the big 3 times.
