Not a film that will be taken seriously, but a great little film, however. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not just a piece of fluff. Actions, IMO, fine. <br /> <br /> One of these films, you would not go out of your way to see, but it brings a smile every time she comes to the cables. As an old friend <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look if you get a chance <br /> <br /> .. - - - - - - - -
