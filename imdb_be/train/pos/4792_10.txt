Straight Story is a multi-level study of kindness and beauty of America. At one level, a slow walk through the heart, a kind of people, and amber grain, on a different level of age and bearing in mind that it is important (and actively forgetting that there is). David Lynch gives us time in this film, and helps me to remember that so much can be said in silence. Great movie, which will lie softly with me for some time.
