I had the privilege to see this movie on the preview screening of years ago, and outside the theater, I was faced with a film crew from a local TV station seeking comments on the film. At that time, the only words that escaped my mouth were Â«Awesome. Simply stunning. "I like to think that I can articulate a bit better than this, but at the time I was a little not in a position to do so. <br /> <br /> The story is intriguing and makes you think, and the acting is first rate all the principal. This film was the first that Terry Gilliam directed that he had no hand in the writing credit for. Back to Universal after a long, hard battle with them on "Brazil", Terry achieved what he wanted most; "Final Cut". Terry is a master, and every shot as beautifully conceived paintings which has been carefully constructed with determination and conviction. It is only fair that such a person should be limited in their attempts to convey the concept. Unfortunately, there are still limitations in such devices. <br /> <br /> Universal Collector's Edition DVD of this film is simply amazing, though most of the bonus features are not listed on the box. It contains, among other things, the director / producer audio commentary and informative and very interesting 90-minute documentary on the making of the film called "Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys." This indicates some creative miscalculations in the movie, including the daring test if the preview screening test poorly, hitting the team with a sense of self-doubt and despair. Fortunately for all of us, they decided to change very little about the film and released it to a huge success. <br /> <br />
