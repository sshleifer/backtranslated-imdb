I was surprised by how exciting this film was. Performances were very good, especially as a sympathetic detective Rea no frills. <br /> <br /> Despite the low budget is not big or ostentatious FX filming, Citizen X-it can not outperform most major Hollywood films like everything. Telling. . History. <br /> <br /> True stories usually end with a whimper, not a bang, and this is the case, but in addition, it is highly recommended detective yarn.
