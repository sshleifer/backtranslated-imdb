I watched a movie on FIDO, and I must say that I became an instant fan. The film feels like a comic book, which perfectly captures the look and surreal in 1950, you know, a beneficial decade when they danced Elvis dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the sake of it. The people were so naive at the time that it scares the thought that these are clean cut people would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here. <br /> <br /> The prestige of this Canadian-made, colorful crisp cinematography, excellent cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and child. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that this film was not a big hit. He deserves more recognition. It is much better than the material of Tim Burton or Shaun Of The Dead team. Oh, well. This is a classic nonetheless.
