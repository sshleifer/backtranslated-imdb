Goodnight Mister Tom so beautifully filmed and beautifully realized. This book is not quite true, but it should be? No, not really. John Thaw hypnotizes Tom Oakley. His transformation from the rough to the care was so well understood, which makes it more plausible than Scrooge in a Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, is a high point in the thaw. He was picked up by a young sincerely Nick Robinson, who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal traumatized evacuees in an abusive relationship with his mother. The script and the music made it worth to buy, and you can also see the Thaw plays the organ. Amazing! The most exciting scene was Willie learned about the death of Zak, and then Tom told him about his dead family, who died of scarlet fever. Buy it, you will love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
