This film may be of questionable pedigree, because it was made for television, but it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The film and its actors have won several awards. It captures, fascinates, and it will absorb you completely. The history of the pursuit of a killer in an iron curtain Russia, people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save the lives of future victims will be a fascinating story, if it was fiction - but it is supposedly a true story. I highly recommend it.
