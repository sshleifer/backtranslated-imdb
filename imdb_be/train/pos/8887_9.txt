I saw the film I was really shocked to see that 60 was going. I know I may be wrong about some things, but it seemed that the '60s really had an impact on the people of that time. Some people said that they would like to go back to the 60s. From what I have seen, I would say yes to worry and not to the result. But this is my opinion.
