Favorite movie. I even enjoyed most of the actors in it. But for me, a very weak attempt to Ms. Davis accent, and her tough action really make another compelling film is very difficult to observe. Seriously, if any other contemporary actor played the same role in the same style as Mrs. Davis they will be laughed off the screen. <br /> <br /> I really think that she is "called this in. Now, when it was Myrna Loy and Ingrid Bergman in the role of wife, I would have enjoyed it much more. <br /> <br /> I guess I just do not "get" Bette Davis. I always thought of her as an actor, which "plays itself" regardless of what role it is. a possible exception Now Voyager. <br /> <br /> I sure many other reviewers explain careful (and I hope that civil) in detail, as I totally wrong on this one. But I will continue to watch the movie it because I love telling al Vinniemu / write / supporting casts, but I will always think of different actresses who would do better.
