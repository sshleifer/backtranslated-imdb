This is my first CG animated film that I have ever seen. As a rule, the appearance of other animated films I have reserved, to see them. Nha Ice Age. I would like to see him in that moment, when I saw the trailer with Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel hilarious. <br /> <br /> Ice Age was sporadically funny and funny film as a whole look. The story is mostly animated version of the Three Men and a Baby, set 20,000 years in the past. Visuals were great. Just beautiful. It is one thing to create a convincing aninmation, it is quite another thing to create a visually arresting material, and a large Ice Age, to look at his stylized visuals. Blue Sky Studios is a company to look out for in the future.
