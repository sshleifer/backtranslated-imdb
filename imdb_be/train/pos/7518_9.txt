Nicely done with a beautiful performance by Gretchen Moll capturing such a simple stainless happiness in their work, and restored small movies and photos, well made and often hilarious. According to Harron they used films which are no longer produced and fifties style studio lighting even for the outside seats to give the color of a portion of its distinctive look. Bettie Page saw a movie in Hefner's house (she is now eighty-rub) with manufacturers there, but not the director, if he got uncomfortable, if she does not like. She apparently was not like this until an official request, which she found disturbing. Some great costumes, too. The idea of ​​the film began in 1993, but it was worth the wait. Her portrait never seems to ring false link to these images and fragments of the (horrible) movies that many of us have seen. It would make an interesting companion piece of Goodnight and GOODLUCK, but much more pleasant viewing!
