This timeless adage echoes in this film, and in my heart. So many years I've been waiting to see this eternal story! I was not ready, perhaps. It is possible that my feelings would not appreciate its power. So I am now gratefully welcome it in my soul with joy. <br /> <br /> My respect and admiration for Paul Muni for a long time. It now legendary luminescence. But now I finally discovered the priceless gifts of outstanding talent Luise Rainer. Oh, how many faces can you say how to do it? Some say that this was done with her quiet years, and it may well be, but her speech is eloquent enough, when he gets the chance. She richly deserved her Oscar. <br /> <br /> This film is the epic in the most classic proportions. All parts are required and committed. Skeptics may leave if they want, but they will be shunned story that stays with one life. <br /> <br /> The Good Earth enriches such a way that one does not expect. But everything will come out of it with a joy that I did. But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Or do not push me with simple technical relative to the principal players of the race. These expectations of modern times, when we are obsessed with perfection. But I dare million evaluation of new films to tell the story of pearl Buck with such intensity, strength, conviction and grace. <br /> <br /> If a contemporary artist would dare to film this masterpiece again, I warn them that they will never come close to the fragrance, which is still based on the core of these stories. Time does not detract from this effort will not progress to improve its greatness.
