Matador is a hit film lightened people .... if you can say that about the hit movie people. Violence is never actually shown, but often introduce. At first I was scared, I was still in the middle of the retread tire 90, the gangster-hit-man-hipsters-dark comedy, but was pleasantly surprised when I realized that it was just sweet and funny story about friendship. Nothing terrible happens in this movie, but every bit of it kept me grinning. Three wires are the best large screen chemistry proposed in recent years, and it looks like they had a great time making this film together. Drawing up sharply, though at times it seemed that the script was adapted from the play from the same set of dialog scenes. This is a good film that I probably will not be too long to remember, but at that time it was a complete joy. Good movie.
