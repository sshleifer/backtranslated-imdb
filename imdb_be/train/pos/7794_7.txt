Victor Nunez fills this unsentimental story about the emotional journey of a young woman with a sense of poetry is rarely seen in movies. For poetry, I mean the sense in which the literary and cinematic come into play. There is something very literary about the film, almost as if the novel was adapted by page on the screen. In this sense, the film reaches a depth of many can not; but it is also quite slow and at other times, cutting depth when something reached in favor of apathy. film star Ashley Judd has not made a better movie than its debut here. It is suitable for the role of leading Ruby like a glove, almost as if it should not work. She has a real presence of movie stars in the film, and in fact could not be sent the same attraction in her later films, though she was great in normal life.
