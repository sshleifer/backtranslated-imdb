I must admit that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. He gave a break in Zinat Oman, a successful model and a former winner of the title of the beauty contest, in casting her in the roles, which was specifically for her debut. Her bespectacled, beaten look, and her swinging on a mesmerizing music made it an instant favorite of the audience. This film is a treat for the eyes, with its colorful locale, ethnic people, those temples of the Buddha, and tweeting, mischievous Mumtaz, which looks very attractive, her ethnic clothes, and dancing skills. Dev, of course, charming, and it's one of his commercial success. Hare Rama manages to keep interest going on, with his carefully written script, editing and exciting music. As Des Pardes, his another film, Anand turned to the subject of young people who get into the habit of drug addiction, as well as the theory of their immediate families of disturbed and troubled childhood, it is quite plausible. Good actor, this film keeps it fresh until now!
