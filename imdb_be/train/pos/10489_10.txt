This light hearted comedy must be filed for entertainment. He gets pretty hysterically funny from time to time, but if you have not spent any time on the "what" side of the tracks you miss a comedy when it breaks. <br /> <br /> characters meld together well and very believable in their roles. Grace handle meeting her dead husbands girlfriend played well. She's a real lady. And my favorite white pimp costume Grace, what she wears. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie for those who want to laugh out loud, which cheers for lost or simply want to see something else.
