This film takes you to another time, when I was a different pace of everyday life. We get an idea of ​​how the family had to deal with the war, and how quickly we send young men to fight. Very touching look at the past and a reminder of the fact that the victims of the war did not occur only at the front. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, many of us have never had to go through what our great-grandfathers, grandfathers and fathers was during the war. This film, in my opinion, is a small thank you. Auterbrizh looks strangely like a young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe are absolutely charming and, as an Australian, as he can be. It is definitely worth listening to him read «High Flight» and makes me wonder what he can achieve with Shakespeare.
