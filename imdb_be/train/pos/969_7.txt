Miike makes a children's adventure film, not unlike Infinite history. It's actually one of my least favorite film director. Even worse Miike better than many movies, though, and The Great Yokai War has a lot in it that should be encouraged. It is at least as loud and back, like most American kiddie movie. I would think children would find themselves much like hers (DVD includes English dubbing), but, like all movies Miike, it may tend to move very slowly. This means that you have such an amazing irregularities, where sometimes there is a loud sequence and the subsequent stage will last forever, as the characters talk. The story itself is not very good, either, and a perpetual lack of Miike of incoherent rears its ugly head. Most of what I liked came with the technical side of things. This must be the most expensive film Miike, and it looks fantastic. «Yokai» Japanese spirits, and they come in all different, bizarre shapes, and costume designers, special effects crew, and everyone else involved only did an excellent job in the projects. I saw the movie in 1968 is based on a supposedly (Yokai Monsters: The Witcher Warfare), and cheese rubber monster suit, you can find out there was transformed into a believable person using embedded makeup and special effects. I especially liked the look of one of the bad guys (or girls, in this case), Agi, who sports a dark eyeshadow, tight, white dress, white beehive hairstyle and whip. She played, incidentally, Chiaki smoke, which you might remember as a teenager Henchgirl Lucy Liu in Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The protagonist played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, give a voice to Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Moving Castle howl.
