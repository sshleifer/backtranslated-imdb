On December 28, 1895, he showed his short films, all single shots to payment audience in the Grand Café in Paris, the film's story writing itself while Louis Lumière. «La Sortie de USINES Lumière" was the first film played, and I wish I was there and not just watch the movie, but also the reaction of the audience. <br /> <br /> We start with closed doors Lumière factory. Apparently, as the picture seems to photos, people thought they were just going to see a slide show, and not what they had hoped for. But then the door opened and people are flocking to the way home. Firstly a lot of women, some men, and a man on a bicycle with a big dog. When all of the doors are closed again. <br /> <br /> If this is the first film or not (some say «L'Arrivee d'UN train à la Ciotat" was the first film written Lumière), it is an impressive early cinema. Being bored is almost impossible for several reasons. One simple reason: it is only fifty seconds. But for people who are usually only as a special effect films should be something interesting here; You can not see historical things like this every day.
