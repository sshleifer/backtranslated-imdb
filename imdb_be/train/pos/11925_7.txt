I happened to catch this movie on cable one day. I must admit that I was never a big fan of baseball, but sometimes I can get into a good sports-related movie. What I found more interesting was the image of the foster family system. As a physician who saw the good and the bad of community mental health system and the reception, I though it was pretty nice to see a film that showed how the ups and downs of this system: people jumping from family to family, biological parents do not always take an active part, and transitions that can be, but heart-wrenching and heart melting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchor of the film, and both bring a very believable performance. Maybe it's just my emotional state, but I consider myself to shed a tear at the end of the film.
