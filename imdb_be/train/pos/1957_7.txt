Yes, I will say before I start to comment on this movie is incredibly undervalued. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone biggest in its role as the Catherine Trammell Morrissey Dr. Glass. He sent an analyst to evaluate it after the death of sports stars. The glass is drawn into a seductive game that uses Trammel manipulate his mind. <br /> <br /> The action was good (except Thewlis) <br /> <br /> Stone does have a talent for this role. It is smooth, playful and seductive, and does not look a day older than she first.She really impressed me (in the casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed a lot of vunerablitity in a role that requires. Thewlis, however, was inaccurate. He destroyed his character and was more-the-top all the way. It really sucks. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is not so good first, but Stone horn playing. Just ignore Thewlis.
