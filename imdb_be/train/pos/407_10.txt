Oh, my ... Just give me a minute to breathe. This film will take you on an amazing journey, and does not allow to go to the final blow in the face ending. This is a movie for fans Stormriders and the like. Legend C was beautifully set up, although I do not like a few things, they used a lot of stand-ins. I would like to see a real fight people, but, oh well ... a few little wasted downs, and I do not really like a lot, until I watched it again when you realize that the more she fully kicks **! I urge everyone who has ever wanted to see a real Asian film to see this movie. I give this movie one of my highest ratings.Go and see it when it comes out in America !!!
