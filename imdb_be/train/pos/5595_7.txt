Polanski returned to the themes of loneliness and madness, which he explored for such a huge effect in disgust and Rosemary's Baby, in Tenant <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is a trademark of Polanski. - dark, thoughtful, unnerving - but there is something awkward about this film, and I'm not sure if this is intentional. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of the most beautiful films of Bergman, it is not doing yourself justice here. What's his name, one of the things that really attracted me to this film, I was a little disappointed with how few examples of really impressive cinematography in the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really lets the film down action. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with a heavy role Trelkovsky. Some of the large supporting cast, in particular, Melvyn Douglas as the lessor and Shelley Winters, concierge, and other weak and miscast. In addition, it is difficult to ignore the fact that all these imaginary Parisians American accents. <br /> <br /> All of a sudden, there are some wonderful moments of dark comedy in the film. Anyone who has seen the fearless killer knows that Polanski, of course, a good comedian. However, there are times when it slides dangerously close to being parody themselves. sudden (and somewhat inexplicable) "conversionÂ» Trelkovsky, is more likely to raise a chuckle than an eyebrow that distract from what should have been a strong point in his psycho-dramatic journey. <br /> <br /> In general, the employer is an enjoyable and intriguing experience, if a bit too sluggish for their own benefit. There's a few very scary moments and consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere, but this film is, at the same time very well, not quite hit the goal as successfully as it can be. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, at the end of the day, "good" Polanski movie is even better than most of the other "good" movies. Definitely worth a look, just do not count on the blown.
