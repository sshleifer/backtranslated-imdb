Full House is a great sitcom, about dad, Danny Tanner, whose wife had just died in a car crash. So Danny asks his brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis and best friend, Joe Gladstone, to help raise three girls, Donna Jo «DJ» Tanner, Stephanie Tanner, and Michelle Tanner. It's my favorite show ever, and I can watch it all day long. And something on Full House always makes me laugh is the sad part, too. There's never a dull moment in Full House. The main characters are played, Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Suitin (Stephanie Tanner), and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle Tanner).
