This is one of the greatest films ever, maybe even the biggest movie ever. I completely forgot about this movie for about 12 years. Until I saw the add-on TV for ADGTH and brought back fond memories of watching me when I was a little kid. And when I saw him a few days ago, I was addicted to the movies. I usually do not like the animated family movie, but this one special is the perfect family film. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie always touches my heart and grieves me very much, but that's what makes this film a surprisingly better than all the rubbish that comes out of the child movie today. I mean a movie rated G and about 2 dogs that are associated with gambling, there is a lot of smoking, drinking, murder, death, and hell depicted in the film. Which I believe makes the film from good to great. I mean cinema today does not bring the reality of the children and they have done in this film. <br /> <br /> RIP Bars & Dom DeLuise
