This film is a riot. I can not remember the last time I had such a great time at the movies. I saw a few good comedies at the time and, as a rule, they are pretty funny. But this is one great wall to line the wall. I think in the Best Show is the last movie I laughed so hard and so much. The film was a non-stop until the end, when they did 5 minutes to clean up the sentimental story. In addition, it is a constant barrage of liners and silly situations. I would like to see him again before he leaves the theater because it's like a movie Zucker, where you do not get all the jokes the first time. You have to see it two or three times to get it all. <br /> <br /> As far as the actual film goes, it could be better used to edit this fluctuating from time to time, but we should be forgiving for that. All the characters are great. It's not like in the movie, Adam Sandler, where he tries to be funny, and everyone else suffers and is butt jokes about him. I think I'll remember all the main characters for many years, because they are all so cute. Many victims in this film. In addition, thank God, they got a 45-year-old actress to play his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her, and she a cutie in this film. You just want a woman as it actually exists. It is not "10", as some of the other leading ladies, but somehow her smile warmer than Julia Roberts overdone bite. <br /> <br /> If you see the trailer for this film, you can not think too highly of him. I assure you that the trailer does not do it justice. They do not give all the good jokes. Just some of the mediocre. <br /> <br /> Oh and one more thing. I hope that the critics put it on their list of the first ten. Many of them complain that comedy does not get the recognition they deserve, and then at the end of the year they do not put it on their list. This means that you Ebert !!!
