Bruce Almighty, one of the best paintings Curry since ... well ... a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a long time, too ... Morgan Freeman played God is good, and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring, but above all the great movie with some funny scenes. Best scene where Jim is the voice of a man messing anchor <br /> <br /> My rating :. 8/10
