Full House is a great show. I'm still growing on it. I started watching him when I was 8 and now I'm 12 and still watch. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. She is my favorite. she had a sense of humor. if there are people in mind that almost do not watch the show, you should, because you'll get hooked on it. I became addicted to it after the first show I saw that just happened to be the first episode, in 2002, it is a really good show. I really think that this show must go down for many generations in families. and it's too much, because it is easy show for all ages. and for all parents, she teaches children lessons about how to go on with their lives. nothing terrible happens, violence or language. it's just a very nice sit-com. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. what do you think? OH, and the best time to watch it when you get home sick from school, or even the old office. It will make you feel much better. Believe me, I'm hardly home sick, but I still know that it will make you feel better. and everyone thinks that the show is stupid, but it is very bad for you, because you will not get as far in life, even if you are happy with your life. You really have to watch it, and you'll get hooked on it. I'm just telling you what happened to me and everyone else that the beginning watch this amazing show. and I need you must go to breakfast. remember that you need to start watching full house and quickly!
