While it certainly was not the best movie I have ever seen, this is definitely worth the $ 8 (which can not be said for many films these days.) <br /> <br /> It was a pleasant the story of a true story, although many details of the actual stories are twisted for a movie (ie, the character Billy Sunday was three or four people in the real history in combination with each other.) Robert De Niro, of course, is good, and Cuba Gooding Jr., was also impressive.
