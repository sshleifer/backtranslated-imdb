If Mulder was looking for his real father is he, Darren McGavin, the first X Files, pity it was only one season for a long time producers do not know the show, they had the makings of a classic on their hands, and in 1993 came to Chris Carter that I I call to follow up Night Stalker, The X Files. And it goes down in history as a classic it is my opinion that the two shows taking viewers to the level of experience that comes only once in a while, and who should appear in the X Files years later, Darren McGavin as Arthur Dales agent helps two of our favorite characters, with a resolution of the cases. Paying tribute to the man, I think so, well done Chris Carter to return the forgotten TV shows in the form of David Duchovny Darren McGavin, if it is not suitable for viewing X files and this particular show, I would never know about the Stalker night.
