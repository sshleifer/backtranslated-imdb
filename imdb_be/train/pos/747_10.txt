Although I was born in the year when this movie came out and never heard about it until my junior year of high school (1996), when I saw him, I became completely absorbed laugh and cry and feel along with the characters, as me and my friends were them. <br /> <br /> their hair, clothes and speeches were outdated, but the emotion and despair every situation was so familiar! I remember thinking how real it was and how I wished that they would do movies like something else. <br /> <br /> In fact, I saw this movie in the night after I was mad at the party (not the case, as opposed to one in the house of Jay), which was split into what we thought We lost an outcast, which are suspended on the sidelines of our crowd. World class BS'er and "responsibility" mother figure type, I immediately identified with Jeanie (I was the one with the car), although I was a bit unreliable Madge floating around there as well. My best friend was Deirdre and her good friend since our childhood was Ani. <br /> <br /> Watching the scene when Ginny is in school or one where she and her boyfriend break up, and then she said Madge, how much she loved him feel like conversations and situations that I personally had. <br /> <br /> now in the age of 27, I recently saw the film again and felt a rush of emotion, because it was like to look back a part of my youth (even though none of my friends did not die). I think that is a must see for all women 13 years and older.
