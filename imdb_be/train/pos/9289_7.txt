The Barbarian and the Geisha, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, currently the United States ambassador, who was responsible for really opens Japan to international relations in the late 1850s. Before him, Commodore Perry basically pushed to Japan from gunboats and forced to contract in Japanese in 1853. Harris, who arrived only a little later, helped work out the details and ensure that - like many Japanese people have little desire to honor the first contract. All this is true and it is shown in the film. According to some sources that I found the romance between Harris and the Japanese geisha mostly fiction and the novel a lot of the focus of the film (hence the name). <br /> <br /> My first reaction the first time I saw this film was a surprise. John Wayne, as a diplomat? When he was being diplomatic in most films, he says please and thank you, it knocks the man !!!! So, seeing as he plays a man who is not a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game, it seemed very strange, actually. In fact, I can not think of too many actors in 1958, which would be more unusual for this role. By the way, I've seen pictures of Harris and Wayne has almost no resemblance to him at all. <br /> <br /> However, despite a history of taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the odd casting, the film is still very watchable. Color cinematography is good, the film shows some interesting ideas in the Japanese customs and culture, and the acting is not bad. In general, the likeable and watchable movie, despite this amazing cast <br /> <br /> PS -. Read the detail for this film. You will learn a bit more about real-life heroes, as well as the alleged fight between Wayne and director (John Huston), where Wayne apparently knocked him out !! Based on what I've read about Huston and how he got together with the actors, this incident, I am inclined to believe. And this is also a good example of John Wayne's "diplomacy".
