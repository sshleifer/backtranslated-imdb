Loosely conceived as a satire D.W. Intolerance Griffith Three centuries was the first attempt of Buster Keaton in the full-length comedies. The only similarity with intolerance are the opening of the "book" of the scene and the fact that these stories over the centuries are edited together into a complete movie. Keaton arguments for assignment of this style is that, if this is not possible, as a feature film, it can be reduced to three two-winding machine. Fortunately, the three age succeeds brilliantly as a comedy, and contains some of the funniest routines that I've seen in any of the film Keaton. There's nothing unique or bold about storylines. They just boy meets girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl graphics, but the period of satire are violent and set the standard for future work Meli Brooks and all the films of this genre. However, I do not believe that anyone ever exceeded this comedy. No one can play pretty goof like Keaton and stunts in this film some of his best. In addition, the appearance of Wallace Beery as a competitor Keaton added attraction of this film. Anyone who thinks that the comedy with the 1920s can not be assessed with the help of modern audiences need to see this movie.
