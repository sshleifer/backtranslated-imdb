Firstly, let me say that I do not like the fact that Rock won the title, which is so much fun. Next I feel Regal had to get back his title of European Champion, Jeff Hardy crappy weight. Rob Van Dam was the Intercontinental title is too long Brock had to win it. I am pleased with Storm and Christian is the tag champs, the best match was the match Booker T and Big Show in my opinion.
