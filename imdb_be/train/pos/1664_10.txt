I thought that this movie was stunning, with absolutely outstanding performances of Valentina Cervi (Gentileschi). <br /> <br /> Cervi reflects the wormwood so beautiful, even with the previous Confidant manners, her arms defining the idea before moving its model in place. Passion for a wormwood gives her art simply fascinating to watch. <br /> <br /> While not every character was obviously beautiful, it made the movie more realistic, as facial hair and clothes perfect for this moment in time. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought that this movie was fantastic.
