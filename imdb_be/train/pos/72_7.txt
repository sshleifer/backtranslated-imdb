Most recently, I watched this movie starring Vincent Price in 1954 for the first time on Turner Classic Movies. Price reflects Don GALLICO, magician / inventor, who brought to the murder when his boss is stealing some of his magical inventions (as well as his wife, depicted in a short role of the great Eva Gabor). Even if the price is a killer, I actually found himself rooting for him, he sympathizes with the character who has gone mad from greedy people around him, who keep it in their own interests. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film doesn "t have" fear "factor of some of his most famous roles (for example, my favorite," House of Wax "), yet he It has enough will to sustain the interest of viewers. <br /> <br /> This is a must for fans of Vincent Price.
