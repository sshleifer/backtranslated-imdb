When I saw the film for the first time in the early 1970s, I was delighted by this film. Visually it was stunning and events on campuses in Europe and the US did you relate to the fact that Antonioni was trying to say so well visually in the last 15 minutes of the film: blowing in your mind "tyrannical" institutions and major business interests. Repeated bloated beautiful home in the middle of the desert, the leading female character, enjoying the natural flow of cold water, the aircraft painted in psychedelic designs (even staid British Airways did it a few years ago), is one of the pattern copied using personnel in advertising all over the world for many decades. Even Pink Floyd fan has increased following the release of the film. <br /> <br /> You see this film 30 years later, and you begin to wonder why the film has lost its appeal. Today, anti-establishment films over substance - facts, documents, excellent performances and an excellent script. Antonioni seems to be out of time; flawed genius. Even watching Antonioni «Blow Up» today gives this feeling that it fades. <br /> <br /> «Zabriski Point» must be evaluated for what it was when it was released. It was a great movie, if you see it on the big screen Panavision unlike dwarf TV screens. Visual and auditory (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Pink Floyd and others.) The attraction of the film still remains. The leading pair were no longer the actors, but they were nice and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in prison in the United States expanding the reality of non-conformist values ​​that he embodied in the film. <br /> <br /> Today, Antonioni seems to be a "synchronization". But look closely and you'll appreciate the muffled sounds of regular actors - Rod Taylor, G.D. Spradling, the lady in the pool, the cops on the air strip. Real sounds unlike appear on nonconformists. Antonioni was relevant 30 years ago, but his grip on the environment can not be questioned even today. He knew what he was doing.
