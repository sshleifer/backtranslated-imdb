One of my favorite films, with a very nostalgic ending. A film about the Sullivan family, obviously, Michael Sullivan (father) is one of the main members of the Mafia, the murderer to say it that way, and one expert. One of the children wanted to know the work of his father (a terrible mistake), so he hides his father and a good car, he sees Tom Hanks in action, to say it this way. <br /> <br /> Mafia doesn "t rule, in the mafia will not benefit anyone if they want you, they take you. Of course, you can see everyone who works for the Mafia with a giant house, the best car in the world, no matter what you want, but do the wrong job, or do something your "boss" does not want, and you're fired and killed. <br /> <br /> You can see what I mean in the film, Sullivan Jr. sees that he should not see, and well, almost his entire family die for it "wrong things" his son did. The film is really interesting, you can see how Sullivan live once chased the Mafia or some kind of this. <br /> <br /> This movie is kind of sad, tells us about revenge, these dirty things people do almost anything you like. Hopefully, the guy is reading this comment does not work for the mafia, and if you work for the mafia to do yourself a favor and get out of the country before they kill your boss and their employees. <br /> <br /> This movie gets: 10/10
