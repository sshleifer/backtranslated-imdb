As it happens, one of the most beloved novels, I was very excited to see the movement. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course, there are a few things that I could take, but I think that the film stayed true to the book, and was a really good movie. It seems that Stephen King movies generally get a bad review, but this is one of the nicest. It's such a dark story, which I think is why I like it .. and what better than the dead come to life .. and something about animals that come back from the grave pretty awful too. If you saw the movie do yourself a huge favor, and now reading the book !! It is well written game screen, the actors could do a better job (I'm only saying this for Rachel and Eli .. she was so snicker) I liked it was still a lot .. and the most important thing for me .. it stuck true to the novel.
