Yakitate! Japan (translated as fresh baked! Japanese bread) is the story of a young man named Adoum Kazuma and his journey to make a perfect Japanese bread or Japan, for Japan and for the Japanese, who will be recognized all over the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is only from the outside. In fact, Yakitate! Ja-pan is really not about bread, but the reactions that come after eating bread, and a pun that comes with the reaction. A series of cute because these puns. From the popular anime titles like Naruto, Detective Conan, and Dragon Ball in blockbusters like The Matrix and Lord of the Rings. It's all there. <br /> <br /> So what makes this title different from the other titles of the same genre as Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike the others which use cooking for world domination, Yakitate! Ja-pan is clean comedy. Of course, there are times that the story turns into a drama, or even murder, but the atmosphere of comedy makes you laugh at them. You will laugh at their own view of the sky. Just watch. <br /> <br /> Just remember that this is also a fantasy, though some of the bread made herein are based on real bread, there is a house of Japan # Do not turn you into a Super Saiyan or turn your body to the rubber.
