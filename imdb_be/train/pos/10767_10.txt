Of course, I would give this movie 10 out of 10, my uncle was a major writer with old crime. Rodolfo Sonego has written more than 50 years living in Italy. He was a great storyteller, and someone suggested that he put his story in writing. So Rodolfo Sonego made. If you check out his biography, you can see the number of films that were made in Italy. Albert Sordie was the main actor, who played a major role in its history. My uncle visited Australia and my city, in 1968, to check the room for "Girls in Australia" and created a great movie about a proxy bride after World War II. You can see his humor in all his films. I found a copy of the film on DVD in recent years. GREAT
