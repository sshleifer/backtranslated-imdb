It's just as good as the original 101, if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with her outrageous outfits and behavior, and the film was probably because the public wanted to see more of Cruella. We see a lot more of her this time. I would also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, rather clumsy actor. In order to use Paris as the culmination of the film was a smart idea. The film is worth watching regardless of your age, if you love animals.
