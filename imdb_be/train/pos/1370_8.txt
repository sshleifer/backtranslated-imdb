I remember that years ago, when it first came out and I was amazed by the performance of Parker Posey. And the film was also pretty good. For those who spent too much time on the stage of a nightclub / after hours, the film will have a special fascination for you. Not too serious, mostly funny, and Parker Posey is definitely making its way through this talented indie rock. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the character Diaz (reminded me of every struggling DJ I ever knew). And many other movies might take an example from this film about how to declare the responsibility of charity, without being dull and insipid about it. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
