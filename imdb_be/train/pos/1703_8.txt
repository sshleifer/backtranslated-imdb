Being from a small town in Illinois, myself, I can immediately apply to this film. Given the era it was made in, ordinary people look uncomfortable, like many people, I grew up with. Yes, the plot is so-so. And so, acting is not going to get an Oscar nomination in the near future. But this is not the point. The point is to suspend reality and just have fun. And the film has a wealth of Fun. With greedy, uncaring bankers meaning good, but narrow-minded deputies, the film was made to poke fun at small town and SciFi genre that lives on it better. Who can not smile at the sight in Play Drone or Verne Droid? and I loved FarmZoid. I wish I had one when I was growing up. In general, given the technology they had available at the time, it is a pleasant romp in his childhood, when you could sit on a Saturday afternoon, popcorn in hand and laugh at the weaknesses of small town life. This is a film that I would watch over and over again, if for no other reason than to mock him and my small town ways.
