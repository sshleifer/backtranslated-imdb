This is a great movie. We are talking about many of the events: the hunt for a serial killer on the bureaucracy of Soviet Russia, the drive of one man, and the relationship between this man (Lead detective) and his superior <br /> <br /> The fact is. that sticks with me most of all, the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (sorry bad spelling, please!). For some reason, it is moving to see their evolution from hostility and crime turns into respect and cameraderie and work together. One line in the film sums up for me, "He said something witty, but he is overcome with emotion." <br /> <br /> Perfect acting all plaster, even the smallest details were made of plausibility. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast-paced thriller; in fact, it moves at such times as slow drama, but it's worth it. Very satisfying and not exploitative of all crimes. <br /> <br />
