I saw this film about twenty years ago, at the end of the show. I still remember well the film, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought that Taylor has been underestimated as an actor, as most critics have seen it as a solid, almost dull leading man type, and the women just love to watch their movies due to her appearance. This film, however, it turned out that an interesting actor, he could be. He did not get enough of roles, as throughout his long career. This is his best work. It is quite plausible in a truly criminal role. From what I've read, he was very hard working and calm guy in real life, and has never fought enough for this kind of role. He basically just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could handle a more diverse and challenging roles. Another thing I remember about this movie, how annoying character Lloyd Nolan was. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really aggravated me. The last scene of the film bailiff with me all these years. This movie is definitely worth seeing.
