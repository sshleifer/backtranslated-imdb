"They all laughed," it is one of those little films, I always recommend to friends who are looking for something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the traditions of the eccentric Roman past, but seems to be more modern. Even strongly in the early 80-ies of the atmosphere is not too much of it dating. Bogdanovic wisely keeps all businesses so light on his feet, that reality never brings it hit the ground. But that said, this kind of a cute movie is absolutely dependent on the actors to keep it, and "Tal" blessed with a dream cast, who understand such requirements tales. This is a film that will not linger so long in the memory, if it were not for the little things, provides an excellent cast: Colin shouting at the same time at the camp, John Ritter and her dog; Blaine Novak unleashing of all that hair out of the hat; and especially at a time, Dorothy Stratten falls to John Ritter and says: ". How strange ..." It's such a part of the crushed one does not want to lay too much on him, for fear of crushing, but it certainly does leave one a light heart and a smile on his face.
