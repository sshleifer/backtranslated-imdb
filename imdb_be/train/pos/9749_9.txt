I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. I certainly was not at least a little interested in opera at the time, but he changed his mind. I enjoyed this film very much and really enjoyed opera ever since. I even bought a few of his CDs. Who cares that his acting ability was, basically he was just playing himself, which was lovely. He was so sweet, so charismatic; I honestly just wanted to hug him. I feel very sad that so many criticize him so harshly. It was so right, do not take people push him around or try him for his actions. He deserves to be respected and admired his talent. He will surely be missed !!!
