«Soylent Green» is one of the best and most disturbing sci-fi films 70s and still very strong, even by today's standards. Although the flaws and slightly obsolete, apocalyptic touch, and environmental room (typical for that time) still feel very anxious and thinking. The quality of the level of this film is superior to most modern SF clicks due to its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider a classic. New York in 2022 by depressing place to be alive, overpopulation, unemployment, unhealthy climate and general lack of vital each food product. The common form of food available is synthetic and distributed by Soylent. Charlton Heston (in good shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of the most prominent leaders of Soylent, he stumbles upon a dark secrets and scandals ... Script little too sentimental and sometimes the climax does not really come as a big surprise, yet the atmosphere is very tense, and the supernatural. Riot sequence really exhausting and easily one of the darkest moments in the '70s movie. Edward G. Robinson, ultimately impressive in his latest role, and there is a great (but too modest) supporting role for Joseph Cotton ( «Baron Blood», «The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). This scientific-Fiction in my book: the nightmare and inevitably fade for mankind! A lot of fantasy spacecraft with hairy monsters are attacking the planet.
