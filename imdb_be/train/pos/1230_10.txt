After watching this movie in the third time now, I think this is almost the worst movie of Adam Punch Drunk Love poor compared to this I have to say, in the end, when Dick thrown out of the boat is so funny (hair differs from it and I I like it when it turns everything off. This film should be shown only if your a true fan of Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> characters poor compared to his funny films as a vessel that has the same people they (Peter Dante), which is one of the killers, who are trying to kill the Australian ptush ku. <br /> <br /> This film is the lack of depth and a decent storyline and deserve to be in the lower part 100
