I really liked the girl Fight. This is something that I could watch over and over again. The acting was fantastic and I thought that Michelle Rodriguez has done a good job in the film. Very convincing, I may say. The film shows how the women must stand up for what they want to do in life. She was so much sympathy and still so much hate at the same time. When dealing with an ignorant dad does not really help him a lot. Despite the fact that he loved her, he really hated. Her mother died when she was younger, but also put some sadness in this role. Love Story was the part that I really enjoyed the movie, too. I could feel the heat in what was each other. Then dram sets, and then again as it chooses between life and her boyfriend old dream. I thought it over again. It was a kind of final, where you have to decide what happened in the future for them.For all you people who love film, based on the sport, I would be a good story to suggest that you check this one out
