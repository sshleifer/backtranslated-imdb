My first Fassbinder was a great experience. Film and Alternative Cinema (small room, with uncomfortable seats, the audience had to wait until filmrolls been changed) was a perfect match <br /> <br /> It was a lot of clich√©s used in the film, but Fassbinder presented them so deftly that i. I found them very funny. The sound was also brilliant (again sometimes be louder than the dialogue). <br /> <br /> Everything seems to be in the right place. And I loved the way was submitted after the war. Real fun! <br /> <br />
