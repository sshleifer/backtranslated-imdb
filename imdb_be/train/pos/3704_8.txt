As a rule, it is difficult to estimate the cut - and - paste films. Some of the segments might be well enough while others bring down the overall rating of the product. In this example, all the girls in the doctor's office scene was quite exciting ... one of the best in the (limited) view of the history of the viewer. Then there's the Asian segment of the lady ... always interesting. And the story that ties everything together was an interesting concept. Swap scene that closes the offering is not bad. From a technical point of view, the production values ​​are high enough. Recommended.
