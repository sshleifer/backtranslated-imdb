First-time director (Bromell) gathered a small but powerful throw to look at the world of the middle-aged, middle-class, the depression hit man and his struggle with his relationship with his father. This film is less than 90 minutes is an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman as a 6-year-old son, William H. Macy is the most refreshing little actor I've seen in a while. Macy is brilliant in the part, which almost seems written for him, as a matter tortured sole struggled to break the reins of his father and his business. It's always nice to see Donald Sutherland, and here he is fine as callous father Maes. Movies alternate audio track should be good to hear the director explained how he chose the actor, space, and filmed. The main Dolby 2-channel audio is sufficient for this movie and well written. Cinematography sets the mood with a very subtle background music. Any movie buff or an observer of human nature will enjoy it, especially if he is a supporter of contradictions.
