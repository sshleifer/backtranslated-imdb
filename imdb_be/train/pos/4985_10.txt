it seems people will not give Lensman enough credit where its due. Several questions have been issued, which are key to understanding Lensman experience <br /> <br /> Year :. During the year it was made (1984) Lensman shows some of the most stunning effects I've ever seen. As someone who watches a lot of the early 80s Lensman animation is unique in its use of what appears to be computer generated image at a time when computers were very primitive. Kim fight against geometric pods cutter in the laser maze can be seen as a perfect example of this. Every time I see that I have to repeat myself that this was in 1984, when it was done <br /> <br /> soundtrack :. Lensman has one of the craziest soundtracks that I've heard, and this crazy hysterical whipping pervade every corner of the film. Lensman borrowed two Western mistakes and failed to cope with the number of first - the need to fill every moment of silence in the movie with the music and the need to heroine. While the music is well-attuned and electroplating stage, such as a motorcycle in the fight Thionite plant Radelyx, heroine topic fails due importance Chris irritation. It is interesting to note that the constant music thwarted my attempts to remove noise when I archiving Lensman over from analog tape to digital format. - because there was not one second available for use as a reference point of silence <br /> <br /> Western influence: Helmut - it sounds like a "hat" and is about the same as the voice of Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn - has the same hairstyle as SW princess and her name sounds suspiciously like Marissa Fairborn Transformers. He takes over the role of Han Solos, flying ship, which has some technical expertise. Buzzkirk - a definite improvement on Chewbaka. Lens - a good copy of the concrete strength, which comes less opportunity to preach Christianity in the audience than the original SW. While the power was based on faith is much more than that of the lens is a pure concentration of the instrument. Theoretically, anyone can wield the lens. The lens is significantly more limited than the Force - to be purely a defensive / offensive weapon <br /> <br /> Technology: boskone alliance have interesting meatballs sponges ships .. They look like stormtroopers with just red, and not white. The idea of ​​DNA weapons was good, if only it was designed. Galactic Alliance kinds Starblazers (or whatever it was called - that a series of 60, where they are struggling with Xylons). There has not been enough to ship naval battles for me - it is much improved in the second film Lensman <br /> <br /> Finally, note Worzel .. This character is unique and very interesting character-design, which, fortunately, It extends to a second film. <br /> <br />
