I saw a long day of death, when it first came out in the movie, I thought that the film gave the soldiers a good point of view, it gave a realistic, men at war. The storyline moves at a good pace, showing a group of people in the rear of the enemy, and tries to return to its own line of hostile prisoners. The characters are well developed and believable. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings good actor and has played a leading role with conviction, as well as Alan Dobie (as the German Helmut) I was surprised that I was not able to find this movie on VHS or DVD, and I feel it was forgotten by the film, which is sad, because it is superior to many other war films that I've seen.
