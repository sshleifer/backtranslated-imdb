I found this episode to be one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. South Park creators have done a better parody of Romero movie I have ever seen.They was really touched the main social commentary Romero that he made with each of his films. I would like to know that George Romero's opinion was in this episode, I'm sure it was purely positive! Retaining his true vision of his zombie epics completely intact! Most lottery deal with pure blood, baked, without making the viewer think about how to Romero tries to make it a movie. I think that if a zombie outbreak happens, we can really worry about our own values, our life before, as shown in this episode!
