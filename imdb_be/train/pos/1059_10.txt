I love this show, it would surely be the winner. Jessica Alba does a great job, it's about time we Funky girl who does not mince type. All the actors are excellent and all episopes are good sites. All is well laid and thought out. To put it together, it shall be accepted for a while, because it's not someone in a hurry, just blurted out something together. This is a great show as a whole.
