This film shows the worst part of the survivors of the war, the memories. For many soldiers, men and women who return home may be the beginning of real problems. I remember my father and his return from World War II, brothers. For one of my uncle, war was never finished. He survived the invasion of D-Day, something like the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. To his recollection, not only delayed, but he had been tortured. He became an alcoholic as did some of my cousins, his sons. Jump forward 60 years and puts soldiers in another war in another country, the same result. When I saw this at the KC Film Festival, I remembered that there is something about the war, which never change. Idealistic young men and women are not spared from the emotional suffering that occurred in Iraq, and especially if you are against the war, you'll come away with great sympathy for the soldiers out there trying to do what they believe or have been told is correct. <br /> <br /> slogan from the Vietnam war film Platoon says it all. "The first casualty of war is innocence."
