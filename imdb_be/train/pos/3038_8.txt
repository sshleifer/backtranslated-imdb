Since Douglas MacArthur suffered more lives ?? ?? the better than any other American wholly elected president, it deserves a better movie biography. Not that "MacArthur" Universal's bad. It's just not all it should have been. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the potential was there. From the beginning, "Star Trek" episode "korbomitny maneuver" (1966) in the last film the HBO "The creation of the Lord" (2oo4) and «Warm Springs» (2OO5), directed by Joseph Sargent has become one of the most clearly human directors in cinema, man, able to subtly shape the emotional shades performances of its actors and bringing the audience exactly where he wants to go. Producer Frank McCarthy, also gave us "Patton» (197O), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith scored both films Universal and widely advertise the fact that the film was "four years in preparation and production." But for all that, "MacArthur" is enough ?? and not much more than that. <br /> <br /> The film begins in early 1942, shortly before the deposited general was ordered ?? President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy) ?? Escape to the Philippines to avoid capture by the Japanese. Thus, this film does not include: <br /> <br /> · birth MacArthur in 188O in the border barracks in Arkansas has attacked Indian tribes ?? thereby establishing that his perfect life spanned the distance from the bows and arrows for thermonuclear weapons; <br /> <br /> · graduation from West Point ?? the first in a class of 95, <br /> <br /> · he joined his father, the famous General Arthur MacArthur (who earned the Medal of Honor in the Missionary Ridge in the civil war) on assignment in Japan, China and, most importantly, in the Philippines; <br /> <br /> · his heroic deeds in 1914 excursion in Veracruz; <br /> <br /> · he jumped on the trenches of the First World War, as a mountain goat, often wounded, and increased at lightning speed brigadier general; <br /> <br /> · his post-war service in West Point youngest ?? and most progressive ?? commandant; <br /> <br /> · his participation in the court-martial of Billy Mitchell in 1924; <br /> <br /> · its routing Bonus demonstrators in 1932; <br /> <br /> · their efforts to maintain woefully underfunded, army chief of staff in the early 193O-x; <br /> <br /> · his resignation from the US Army to become a Field Marshal Philippine Army (!); <br /> <br /> · and restore it to the Commission on PBU shortly before the Second World War. <br /> <br /> All of this is omitted in favor of long shots MacArthur tries to fight seasickness, being evacuated by PT boat ?? Thus, we know that the «General Mac» is a legend, but not why; and we can not understand why the accusation of cowardice have been so wounded in the "dugout Doug" ?? and so manifestly unfounded <br /> <br /> In the rest of his career is now in a straight line :. His island hopping «Hit« Em where they are not, "the company, the implementation of its collateral Filipinos ?? "I'll be back!" ?? its wreath, conquer the world in the post-war Japan, the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman (right angry Ed Flanders) on the behavior of the Korean conflict, which led to its open fire and, finally, his call to Congress that "old soldiers ?? just fade away, "and then he did just that. Everything is quite historically accurate, and all presented with a very deliberate absence of comments <br /> <br /> Sargent and manufacturers almost painful to distance himself from the historical record is decorated with their own approval or disapproval :. If MacArthur's actions are noble, that they may be presented as such; if they are selfish or pretentious, let these concepts register the comment SANS. Since Joe Sargent quite expert subtly manipulating his audience reaction ?? again to see Warm Springs ?? the refusal to offer a comment is quite intentional. Historically, it can be flattering, but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to put this unusual person, in any rational point of view. <br /> <br /> And, finally, there is a kind of "done on the cheap" feel to the film, as there is in the "Midway", released around the same time. Both films were attributed to the "TV" Director - Sargent in this case, Jack Smythe to "Midway" and both have application for viewing TV view. Even march Jerry Goldsmith, while fully functional, does not have the subtle nuances and the greatness of his theme of "Patton" -. Just another way in which the larger-than-life man immortalized in the most ordinary movie <br /> <br /> It was vanity and pettiness in this man, no doubt; There is also the greatness ?? and love it or hate it, we should recognize the fact that MacArthur did something that no military leader was in front of him made :. he won the world <br /> <br /> In the end, "MacArthur" ?? like so many biographies of the film ?? this is a good place to start your exploration of this remarkable man, but a bad place to finish it.
