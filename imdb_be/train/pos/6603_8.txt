I must mention two failures for you to understand that this film brilliantly succeeded where they have failed, "A Scanner Darkly" and "Immortal Ad VITAMÂ». If you are excited by the concepts of the two films and felt very frustrated (like I do), you probably use a renaissance. It immerses you into the world of the future Paris. It's not quite a dystopia. They have made an animation so well that I thought it was rotoscoped, but from what I can tell, it was not, it's just motion capture. Mimicry is amazing! Not since I saw TRON fantasy world so well displayed in the animation / live hybrid. Between black and white are used to slow your attention to the subject of the scene; my favorite was the effect of what they did with the headlights, watching him. The director plays with your attention and the author of confusion, but you satisfied in the end, finding a thread that he wants you to find. The overall effect is dramatic and gritty urban world filled with little surprises. <br /> <br /> The plot is secondary, but it is not terrible. This noir-ish. There is a back story for most of the main characters, which give them some depth. There is the weather. There is a "kit", so you can feel like you are in different places in Paris. There is an action, and even a car chase. I'm going to have to see this one more time to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen for viewing as "sets," detailed and small loans.
