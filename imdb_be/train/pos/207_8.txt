At first it looked like a sad comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I got into it, it turned out, very funny movie. Basically forgetful ex-comedians Willie Clark (winner of the Golden Globe and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar and Golden Gloves nominated George Burns) were a great comedy duo, and brought together to revive their sketch hospital for a TV show . Willie's nephew Ben Clark (Golden Globe wins Richard Benjamin) is confident that they can get back together with no hard feelings for each other, how wrong he is. They can not get on at all times, both forgetfulness, especially during a call, but they do it in the end. Also starring Lee Meredith as a nurse in the Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise Mrs. Doris Green, Ella's daughter, Rosetta Lenoer in Odessa, nurse Willie and dolls from outer space with F. Murray Abraham as a mechanic. I think that the best line of the film Burns noted that Matthau called him a "son of a bitch a freak." He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted from a different material, it was isolated BAFTA for best screenplay, and he won a Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy and was nominated for Best Screenplay . Very good!
