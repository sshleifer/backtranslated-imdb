I was not sure what to expect from this film, given its amazing collection of stars and directors, but in the end he did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> For me one of the highlights was the last episode of the American tourists speaking with a terrible French accent (which made me feel better about my), which was really very moving and a great way to wrap film . <br /> <br /> The story of a paramedic and stabbing victim was also very moving and pure comedy of the Coen brothers and Steve Bush to accept the award. Tykwer clip was also impressive, although quite ambitious in its field. <br /> <br /> However, Bob Hoskins segment was completely cringeworthy and vampire story was completely a farce. Dialogue section Wes Craven also felt very forced and the history of Chinatown was completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is worth a look at the good bits and has a strong finish. It's not too painful to sit through bad sectors - they are only for the last 5 minutes anyway <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la Pine !!!.
