Kudos to the director and the actors of the realistic film. Grit, lack of glamor and despair drew me to the film and kept me there. I was really impressed with the way the date and the information was transmitted to the film; ie newspapers, letters, etc. He held the film moves at such a fast pace, I felt no desire to fast forward once. Personally, I thought that all the principles did a great job ... it was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. It made me want to cry sometimes. Val Kilmer does not surprise me ... his statement of this kind, usually leaves me in awe. Overall, this is a brilliant film, not to be missed!
