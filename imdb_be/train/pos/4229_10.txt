Do not waste your time reading my review. Go out and see this amazing good episode, which may very well be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon perfectly cast as an intriguing yet divine mystery writer who kills her son-in-law to avenge the murder of his daughter. Columbo his usual crumpled, confused and far more intelligent than-he-seems to himself, and that the specific features of installments fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Oddly enough, it was not written or foreshadowed creator Levinson Link still possible blackout, the most complete and original twist-laden plot Columbo ever. Through pleasure in almost every department and overflowing with fun and witty dialogue and thinking. Really unexpected and inventive climax pinnacle of all. 10/10 ... look for this on Netflix!
