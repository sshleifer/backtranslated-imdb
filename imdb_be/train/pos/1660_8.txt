I am a supporter of the arts, I love anything about art, I like paintings, sculptures, etc. This film shows, so I like it a lot, it shows how a woman wants to draw something about art, especially naked bodies, but it can not do so because of their strict family (his father), at the beginning of film, she painted herself naked, but she wanted a man for his paintings, but her family did not allow her to paint naked men, because it is against the moral. Even wormwood could draw her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked. She falls in love with his teacher of art, and it seems that the art teacher is absolutely in love with her, too, so that in the final, he brings his freedom for her lying in sacrifice. He said that he had raped her, but it was not so. Artemisia in love with him, but when she says that she will suffer a lot, because in a study in which wormwood, her father and art teacher were the one who hurt her artistic hands to tell the truth. I think this is a great film about the art of love and art, it is worth watching. Valentina Cervi great as wormwood, it works very well, I also like her performance in "Portrait of a Lady," as Panza Osmond. 8.5 / 10
