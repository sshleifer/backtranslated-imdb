I bought Dark Angel Seasons 1 and 2, two weeks ago, after catching a couple of episodes of season 1 on channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how brilliant show. I did not use anything else, because Firefly (also an amazing show). I admit, Season 2 wqasn't quite as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see Specify this bag Â«Em, then Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation, etc.) and Alec big. I've heard that some of the terms of potential season 3, and I must say that I can not believe that it was canceled - I will not spoil it for you - but it would be rocked! I also think it has great potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems very unlikely). As proof of my obsession, bar-Max number is 332960073452, and within two weeks I had it, I have 3 episodes of watching the seasons twice. It's just too good.
