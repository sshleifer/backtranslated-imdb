Yes, the plot is predictable; Yes, there are a few plot holes; Yes, it made for a quality television; and let Britney Spears "wrote" a book with obvious self-promotion. <br /> <br /> But forget all this ... this film interesting. <br /> <br /> After School fun in a special kind of travel, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Virginia Madsen, as a mother does a great job ... so well that I'm going to start looking for her films. She reminded me of Diane Lane for all good reasons. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast does an excellent job, too. If I were a casting agent, I'd scouting some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> The values ​​production above normal television standards and the music was really great ... better than a few mnogobyuzhetnyh movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for German film noir, this is not for you. If you want a safe, fun and underrated movie, it's a good one. This is one you could show off your 10-year-old daughter, but by using the same.
