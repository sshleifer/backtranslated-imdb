Some of the DVD, have me until I just do not go out and buy it. It was one of those films. Like many here, I remember, as a child and loved it. I never knew that there were scenes and musical numbers that have been cut off, so I was intrigued to see what they might be. I agree that the sequence Â«Portabellow Road" is now a bit long (as a football match), but other than that, I have not found any doubt with the rest of the scene, which were returned to their respectful place. Maybe Disney should have the original version (which restored version) on the one hand, with the restored version on the reverse side, the people can choose what they would like to see. In general, it's still an entertaining film that still manages to regain some of my childhood memories.
