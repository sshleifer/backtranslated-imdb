Each movie Bette Davis stars in worth experiencing. By Davis co-stars with Leslie Howard in «Of Human Bondage,» it has been for tens of films. Legend has it that Davis was "robbed" in the 1935 Academy Award for her performance as a Cockney-speaking waitress, an unmarried mother and manipulative boyfriend users, Mildred Rogers. The story goes that AFI comforted Davis gave her 1st Oscar for playing Joyce Heath «Dangerous». I imagine supporters Davis "Of Human Bondage", which agrees with the legend Oscar loot going to be in contrast to my criticism of the 1934 film for which AFI Sun awarded her statement and one thousand nine hundred thirty-six film "the Dangerous' performance for which she won the 1st Oscar in 1937. <br /> <br /> I tried to see all Bette Davis movies, television interviews, videos, advertising for the second world war, and television appearances in the popular series. In retrospect, it is easy to understand why this film, "Of Human Bondage" gave Davis the opportunity to run for her performance. She was only 25 years, when the film was finished and just about to get to the red carpet in Hollywood. The public began to notice Bette Davis as a star because of her performance in «Of Human Bondage". This is what makes it a legendary performance. However, CSC saw her greatness, "The man who played God," and borrowed it from Warners to play Rogers. <br /> <br /> I'm going to go with the AFI, in retrospect, some 41 years after their insightful decision to award Davis her first Oscar for best Actress in "dangerous" 2 years later. By doing so, then the AFI, perhaps an important role in providing the very best in one of the most talented actors in Hollywood of the 20th century. Because from 'of human Bondage' forward, Davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep within the NSA To find performances that brought her a gold statue is no doubt that it deserves more than 2 Oscars;. May be greater than 6. <br /> <br /> «Dangerous» provides an exemplary contrast in depth Davis acting on the characteristics. Indeed, it «Dangerous» (1936), it becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. Davis as good as Joyce Heath, it is dead center on the red carpet. While in "Of Human Bondage" Davis directly from the edge, still on the sidewalk, and ready to take off the rest of his 60 years of acting career. <br /> <br /> It may not award her legendary Oscar in 1935, instead of the birth of stars, the actor was given an incentive to go beyond the glory in her heart for the greatest work <br /> <br talented actor /> well-known that its contemporary peers opponent Joan Crawford. star, whose performance is still not measure up to Davis. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a "star". Howard Stern radio presenter is a "star", too. Many people on the stage and silver screen are the stars. Few became great actors. The main difference between them is that Bette Davis could feel :. The difference between wanting to do a lot of action or to become a star struck <br /> <br /> Try comparing the two films, as I am, no worse than the previous view. Maybe you'll realize that I did, and AFI. Davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, 25 years to reach its goal by the time she was 27. She spent her next 50-plus years of setting the bar so high that it was not achieved. ,, More. <br /> <br /> If the AFI sent her a message that she had arrived in "Of Human Bondage" Davis story of life as a great actor, might have led to the star-struck house instead.
