If the American writer Edgar Allan Poe visited London, he approached the British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the object of a kind of bail. Apart from the statement of Edgar Allan Poe, that all of his horror stories are based on real experience, Foster accepts bets from Edgar Allan Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood, that he could not spend the night in a castle haunted Blackwood. After the installation in an abandoned castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone as he approaches different beautiful women and handsome men, and the doctor of metaphysics - which explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay the history of their demises on the anniversary of their death! The first time I saw this glorious bit of classic horror, I was fascinated by all the time. I found the film really awful and at the same time sorrowful. Babs Steele undeniably beautiful. Score makes the atmosphere twice inducing terror. Topless scene threw me for a loop, so I was not expecting. It looks like Synapse done a great job with an image intensifier, because this movie looks damn good for her age, and is the international version of Uncut, to boot. This film is responsible for me starting a collection Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski.
