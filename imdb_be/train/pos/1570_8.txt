Invader Zim <br /> <br /> 4. Catscratch / Rugrats <br /> <br /> note the word only with a capital letter? This means that it's Nick show, I'll talk about <br /> <br /> «Catscratch» basically simple, but most animated comedy about three wealthy cats -. Mr. Blik, Gordon and Waffle - that get into the country and really surreal situation, the attempt to join the hen Human Kimberely root beer save the planet slugs from the spacecraft evil. Nick is one show that you simply your funny bone tickled sooner or later! The leitmotif is catchy and memorable. Speakers - including Wayne Knight of «Seinfield» franchise - bring the characters to a new life with a very unusual person. nice stories (fans episodes will be "King of Root Beer" and "Lucky Gordon foot").
