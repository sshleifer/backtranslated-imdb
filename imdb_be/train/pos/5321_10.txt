This movie really surprised me. I had my doubts about it at first, but the film is getting better and better every minute. <br /> <br /> It may not be for action in search of an audience, but also for those who love the obvious portrait of a very strange crime, man, lover and husband. If you do not like bad language or sexual content, it is certainly not for you. <br /> <br /> pretty hard to follow storyline sometimes, but in the end, I think he did better. The ending was unexpected, since you have been fouled almost think that would have ended differently. <br /> <br /> As for the acting, I think it was good. It will not be an Oscar for a long time, but at least, caught my eye. Bellows portrait of a man in prison is not always perfect, but it's very interesting. Shaun Parkes portrait bellows prison mate Clinique large and very powerful. On the other hand, I think I'll put Esai Morales portrait Markie. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and watch this movie, or you love it or do not like!
