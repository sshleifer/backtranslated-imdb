In Dyugey movie in Hitler: The Rise of Evil, the first years of Hitler's life and politics manifests itself in a successful way with some minor historical errors and some exaggeration. It is quite natural for a Hollywood film to contain such things as the main purpose of production is the income that they get from the film. Even if such errors may disappoint some members of the audience who believes that everything should be done in the book, I believe that most of them are in good agreement with the rest of the film, which makes it more interesting. We must not forget that this film is not a documentary. Who cares, as he did his dog died anyway. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Hitler is portrayed as psychologically unstable figure that gets angry very easily and very passionate about their ideals. But he was not portrayed as a super-villain, but a more ambitious policy. I think this is a good prospect, because the film is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions, and it made the movie more objective. Yes, he was a little crazy, and his methods were crude, but he was still a man is not completely crazy figure, as portrayed in "Inglourious Basterds." I believe that this has made the film more realistic, even with some inaccuracy in historical facts. <br /> <br /> The flow of history well reflects the viewer. Even if the focus of the film was about Hitler, we had the opportunity to see what is happening in the country, as a result of these actions, through the newspaper, the discussion of people and songs in the Jewish theater. In addition, the public reaction was also reflected in the film, but it was very limited. Contractions journalist Guerlain and ironic play, which play in the theater was fun and interesting, but that was all. Basically, we have only seen his followers possessed streets and joyful it. <br /> <br /> Another thing that was missing in the film about the origin of their hatred of the Jews. At the beginning of the film, some of the ideas on this subject is given, but they were rather superficial. Suddenly he was a politician who gives speeches about the need to destroy the Jews <br /> <br /> At the end of Hitler. Evil uprising can not be regarded as a great movie that everyone will like, but this is not poor at all. If you can be the director of that change history for cash, it is an interesting film that reflects the personality of Hitler in a successful way.
