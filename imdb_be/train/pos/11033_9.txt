I do not think I ever understand the hatred of Renny Harlin. «Die Hard 2" was cool, and he gave a "climber" in the world, one of the most bizarre fighters ever. That is right, you little punk, the rules of "Cliffhanger" and we all know that. <br /> <br /> Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former rescue climber who "just visiting" his old city where he is asked to help a former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), assisted in the rescue on a mountain top. Walker is clearly back at a convenient time, as the accumulated people actually difficult team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & Co. lost a lot of money they have stolen from the US government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, and they really would like it back ... <br /> <br /> In fact, "Cliffhanger" Another «Die Hard» clone. Just trade within the Nakatomi Plaza on open ridges of the Rocky Mountains, complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him fatal. It is natural that create a completely ripped to shreds quickly as Stallone's character avoids a fairly large number of bullets with ease, and slapped the face of a few rock faces with no apparent ill effects. In the end, it's not something that fighters all about? <br /> <br /> «Cliffhanger" is one of the most exciting fighters around. Showcase of large scenes and stunts. One of the first tricks is one of the best tricks I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the film does not get better than it was in the beginning, it remains in effect awesomeness. leading villain John Lithgow is an entertaining, and one bad guy. . It is quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever <br /> <br /> «Cliffhanger" is easily one of the best efforts of Stallone, definitely the best efforts of Rennes Harlin, and very exciting action - 9/10
