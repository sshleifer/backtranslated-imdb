The film begins with the family, who are all going in different directions and their teenage daughters in March MacIssac (Olivia Dunn) was very in love with Joe McLeod, (Zack). Mother plays Mitzi Kapture, (Jill Dunn), who suddenly goes to her daughter and Zack making out, and then all kinds of problems, it seems, to the surface. Jill Dunn has a husband who is always traveling or while away from home quite often. There are also big problems that arise when a family decides to go camping that their daughter Olivia does not like, and simply can not adapt to sleep in the open air and requires tents to be any errors. In many ways, Olivia makes an excellent performance as a teen and Nick Mancuso (Richard E. Grant) gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner. This movie will keep you guessing how it will end, and you'll enjoy the film, filled with a lot of fear and terror. enjoy
