I do not know why I chose this movie to see, he has a strange name and the description of it just looked like something else. Every once in a while it is good to try a film that is slightly different from the main hero of the Hollywood / thriller film, and this film is, of course, it was different. From the beginning, this film had me intrigued, but I could not understand why in the end, when the film when I realized that the film was great because the characters were so real. I thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you take care of them and I hope that everything will turn out well for them in the end. I think that anyone who watches the film could somehow associated with one of the characters, and it makes for a great view and a good laugh at the sheer everyday actors. <br /> <br /> At the climax of the movie, you will definitely get a sense of well-being, and remains in the "things will be fine," type of feeling. I am sure that it will have broad appeal and should be allowed.
