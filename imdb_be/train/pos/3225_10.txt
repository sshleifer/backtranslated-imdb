When I was shooting the movie to watch it, I knew it would not be Mindbender film. Instead, I thought of this as a lack of faith reality in which someone is going to get a serious beating. And you know, it worked. Kurt Russell did what I though was a great role in showing Emotionless soldier that he was. I recommend this movie if your boys and want to see a good action movie.
