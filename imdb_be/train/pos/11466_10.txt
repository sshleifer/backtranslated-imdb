I was lucky enough to see the day zero last night. This is an amazing film. Very disturbing in this. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Zero Day is very comparable to the «The Blair Witch Project." He was shot with handheld cameras recently completely. It is about 2 children. Just your average kids. Andre and Calvin. They begin a campaign against the high school there called "Army 2". <br /> <br /> The whole story is told in the form of Video Diary, 2 children. This shows that the relationship with parents there, among others, indicate that this is just normal kids, as well as the people we know who will release. We find out the last 2 Army Mission will MAKES Zero Day. They plan to shoot there High School. <br /> <br /> You can see how they get access to guns there, how they plan to it all. They emphasize that the media did not touch them at all, and there is no reason for this. As I said, it's all said in the video Diary form, and then they keep the belt in the vaults to see after the Zero Day. <br /> <br /> The actual shooting is manifested through Survillence cameras throughout the school, Cooling accurately. The film is very terrible. Some of the things that they say they are planning it, you just have to see it for yourself. One quote that I remember this one time when Calvin byhimself. He says that "Andre thought was just going to go in a certain car escape, making it in many schools across the country. I do not know what he was thinking, but the only way I get out of school in a black plastic bag. " <br /> <br /> I probaly not even giving you guys the right idea of ​​this film. You really have to see it for yourself. This is happening around the festival. <br /> <br /> A +.
