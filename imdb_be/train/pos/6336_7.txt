OK, so that FX is not high budget. But this story is based on real events. Not something thrown together to make a couple of wealthy actors, richer !! As with most films based on books, there is something that just does not fit. Only a few people have said that this film was based on real events, and not crashing-off, as most people believe it !! This film is in no way affiliated too TWISTER! Besides the two films about the tornado. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have problems with the science of tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a few things you should keep in mind ... This "night Twister" was June 3, 1980. Since that this film was released 16 years after the actual events. Try to think about how far away the storm advanced studies at the time. It happened in a big city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Despite the fact that the film calls the city is something else, and says it's a small town.
