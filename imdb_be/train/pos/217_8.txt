THE SUNSHINE BOYS was hilarious adaptation of the 1975 game screen Neil Simon on the resignation of vaudeville team played Matthau and George Burns, who was a bitter break-up and asked to be reunited once again for the television special, or something like that, the problem is that two still hate each other and do not want to have anything to do with each other. Richard Benjamin acts as Matthau nephew, a theatrical agent who was given the monumental responsibility to make this reunion a reality. These warm and winning comedy Valentine's beautiful in a forgotten form of entertainment ... a farce, and it works mainly thanks to one of Neil Simon's best screenplay and outstanding work on Matthau, Burns, and Benjamin. Burns won the Best Actor Oscar for this, but I think that Matthau out with this film, with its perfectly hilarious performance as Willie Clark. Matthau was nominated for Best Actor, but has no chance against Nicholson for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest; However, in another year, it was Oscar worthy performance. Matthau team on the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance. The scene in which he had to audition for the commercial chips, and can not get the product name right is a classic. Sunshine-BOYS warm and winning Neil Simon comedy that shines thanks to the unique chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
