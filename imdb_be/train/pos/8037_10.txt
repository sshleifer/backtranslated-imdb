"One shot, one kill, no exceptions." Do you have to in the Marines or snipers. two thumbs up! Large communal plot, great camera work, good drama, action, details and much more. Pretty close to the real thing. But this is not a film breakdown and select Edit disadvantages. is sit back and have a good 99 minutes. The plot has some depth, but this film is not really about that you think. it is about enjoying life and sniper action. Sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good following-ups, but the first is still the best overall film. Meanwhile Berenger does a great job playing his character, and showing the hidden side of life sniper. plain dealing with all the death. A must see for fans of the sniper.
