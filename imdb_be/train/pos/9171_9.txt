I'm a fan of Jane Eyre purists, and this version includes almost all important parts of the book and the characters are portrayed as I imagined them. Jane Eyre is a complicated history of great wealth, and can not be delivered in full-length format, so it needs a mini-series. Rochester Timothy Dalton, probably the best ever. There has been a lot of discussion about how attractive it is and its age. In the book, Jane (the narrator) describes it as "about 35", and not young, but not yet middle-aged. I think Timothy Dalton was about 38 when he did it, so that on the right. In addition, we only have an opinion about Jane, Rochester beautiful. She had just met him, and he discovered that she thinks she asks her. As an inexperienced and modest girl, I can not think of what to say to her that she really thought it was beautiful. The actor plays Rochester has to show us the character of the person, and it worked out to perfection. I love the relationship between the two wires, which is a decisive thing about this story, and humor of their meetings. Other versions blew, but it gets it right. 2006 version with Toby Stephens (aged 37) is in development on BBC1 and very good actually, so I will decide what my favorite, when it is completed. <br /> <br /> On the back watching this series, after watching the 2006 version, I decided that this is the version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke is the best! Dialogue Charlotte Bronte is preserved, and it is important for the history of power. Upgrading just does not work - it's Victorian history and archaic poetic speech characters costumes. This version has a wonderful cast - ZIL Clark tiny and the height difference between her and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has real presence and surprising actor. There's no additional scenes to distract from the story and the script includes all the major scenes, but leaves the unnecessary details, which makes it a point and captivating. I recommend it to all real fans of Jane Eyre.
