Or, at least, one of the best. I think it is very fun and very cool game for the N64. Bowser to their usual shenanigans (yes it is a silent word, but the only one I can think of), and Mario must stop him again. This game is very fun to play and has a lot of nostalgia for me. The only bad thing about this is the graphics, which are terribly modern, but everything else is very good (especially the small mini-game, you can unlock) This is the second best N64 game (best first bad day Fur in Conker) that I recommend Mario any fan or any fan of platform games. It knocks mediocre Super Mario Sunshine on any day <br /> <br /> 9/10 or :. A
