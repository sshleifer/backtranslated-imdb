Having seen a few times in a short horror movie marathons, I think this is a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its use. <br /> <br /> While the crust topics and stale today's audience, it is by no means a waste of time lumps. <br /> <br /> While being a student film gives little cause an excuse, the proof that it seems to be created with care on the budget a little to any test. <, Br /> <br /> As another reviewer noted, it is less than ten minutes, which is plenty of time to clear the sight sky with toast joy to sit back and loaf without work through the film. <br /> <br /> I think this is a short film of bread should be served as an appetizer for reference header and the viewer must relax and roll with it.
