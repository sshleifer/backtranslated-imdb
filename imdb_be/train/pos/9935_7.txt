My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzy * Chop} My - my - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, Chop} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. CUT. Playback} <br /> <br /> I've never seen a director to take as much publicity for his earlier style. It is now apparent that most people do not appreciate gusty that screams, dizzying editing techniques Tony Scott. If I have to choose between her love for him and hating him, I would say that I love it. This border is pulled from time to time, but the end result was very good, and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and originality (even if it borrows from MTV video). <br /> <br /> This stylistic edge appears as Knightley plays the role of a cocky badass bounty hunter Domino Harvey, and even her dialogue sounds strange jerky. Otherwise she plays her badly, because I very much hated her character and does not sympathize with it one bit, no matter how much she suffered. Domino we go through her life, when she connects with other headhunters Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew get lost in the FBI, and suddenly there is a reality show contract for the production of TV company Christopher Walken (that Christopher Walken does every movie, by the way?). I think this is a reasonable method of film, because now Tony Scott free to use as many flashy MTV / reality show for editing the footage as he likes. This becomes stylization MTV culture at the moment. <br /> <br /> it followes that the story is told on a surprisingly hasty pace, with plenty of raunchy language and strong armed violence. There are some funny jokes; all very modern and surreal at the same time. It's a mess, but it's quite a nice mess. This ultimately disadvantages in many respects (actors trying too hard to make his character "cool", for one), but it works. I give it a 7/10 weak, which may seem generous when compared with the general consensus of moviegoers, who graduated this movie ?? but I feel that it was a few good ideas, and executed them. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
