This painting in 1935 left with all kinds Ocars for best director, John Ford, actor Victor McLaglen and music by Max seiner. Victor McLaglen (Gypo Nolan), Â«Call Out the Marines," "42, gave an excellent performance as an Irish rebel, who belonged to the rough and tough crowd, who were all fighting for the cause, and at the same time are becoming poorer and poorer with large of booze. Gypo Nolan made a big mistake when he decided to become an informant for his best friend to go on a trip with his galami to America and a new way of life. Preston Foster (Don Gallagher), "Guadalcanal Diary", "43, gave a great supporting role as a leader of the Irish rebellion and tried to grab the widget of the group. Gypo Nolan becomes pursued his betrayal of his friend and starts to feel just as Judas. Great movie for 1935 and great acting by McLaglen, and depressing in every aspect of the film.
