If you have not seen it, you do not know what you are missing. The first time you do, you will be litteraly in pain, lying on the floor sick from laughing so hard, and having probably moisten well. <br /> <br /> It's funny. There was not a single comedy performance prior to this date, I saw the top of this, or even close. So many classic liners, stories and Segway .. <br /> <br /> drunk uncle at a barbecue, Gi Joe, Mr T, goony Goo Goo, frozen person, you say any of these things for those who saw this show and I'll bet you dollars to donuts, they will not be able to maintain a closed face and explode with laughter, or to read the rest of the dialogue from the act. <br /> <br /> Pure classic !! Shame you can not get it on DVD .. <br /> <br /> 10+ Rating of 10
