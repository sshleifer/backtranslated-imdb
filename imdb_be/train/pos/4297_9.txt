Every now and then the director brings to life a unique group of people and allows you inside to see the things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden has done it again. I always felt theBg Cill was the anthem of his age, and he was able to do it again in the Grand Canyon. Every so often, we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life, and so often we undermine it. This is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience the life of this choice. Imposes large and small events that allow us to see how the largely trivial most of the things we worry about which is really a genius. I watched this film several times, and I constanly amazed at how deeply the emotions pass through this film. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline are doing their roles with great tenderness and Stever Martins fashion film Exec priceless. Thanks again Mr. Kasden
