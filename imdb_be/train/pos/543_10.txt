This film is the best horror film, bar-none.I likes Stanley simply resets woman in lake.I was a supporter of the work of Judd Nelson for many years, and it blew me away. A mixture of horror and drama, and romance, not a lot of comedy. His evil but glamorous look took me right there and then. It's in his eyes, I will never forget. There's something about him, I can not describe.
