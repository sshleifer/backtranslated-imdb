the first dramatic film Spielberg Sun LET-down. This is a beautifully made film without any flaws on the life of African-American women. It also proves that not all films that are part of the African-American history as a center must have helmets on African-American director. <br /> <br /> What I love about this film is Spielberg's ability to make it very realistic, despite the fact that it was based on the book. In addition, Danny Glover was very rich as Mr. and usually, he just himself for most of his films. But in doing so, he completely splits and someone else at one time. But the performance of de resistance of the film comes from Whoopi Goldberg. It is perfect as Celie. You will never forget these characters as soon as you saw the movie <br /> <br /> Now, I've heard that this is a musical version of the film as well, and all I can say :. I hope this is about as good as this one, because this is one film that should not be missed.
