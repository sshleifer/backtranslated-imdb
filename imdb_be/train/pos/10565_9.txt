In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced his way through three Warner Brother musicals, offering Depression Era viewers instant distraction from their troubles. Gold Miner, 1933 42 th Street and the light-flooded Parade ramps have been installed in the world of Broadway theater is basically the same topic show must go on. In addition to Keeler and Powell movies featured kaleidiscopic choreography of Busby Berkeley, stop the show tunes and many of the same supporting players. <br /> <br /> All of this controversial classic of the genre, but I have to admit the obvious preference for the cast the spotlight because of his energy and pace to bring James Cagney. Warren William in gold miners and the Warner Baxter in 42nd Street will pay off well, as shown by the production of heads- especially like Baxter burned Julian Marsh in search of the latest box office smashes. Both do not have an infectious energy Cagney however, which perfectly complements obsessed pace putting on a Broadway musical. He is an absolute whirlwind, as it has to do with the numbers of production partners and unscrupulous gold-digging girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Of course, one does Cagney light-flooded ramp classic it is. wheezing scenario with some sharp double meanings that come superlative supporting cast featuring Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee, and especially Joan Blondel, who will cut everything down to size. Busby Berkeley dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risky and done only at the last moment before the arrival of Hollywood Code 34. Unfortunately, the thirties and once for never see such a rich musical made with enthusiasm and boldness of bathed in the limelight again. Gentility and morality are convinced of this.
