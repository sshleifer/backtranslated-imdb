In the classic sense of humor of four (which are not specific to the concept funny or entertainment), Altman «H.E.A.L.T.H.» heals all humor, and actually very funny, entertaining ways. There's sputum in the face of very slow, defensive and protective character Lauren Bacall Esther Brill, that mission in life seems to be all about appearance, protecting the secrets of their age and beauty more than her well-being. There Paul Dul choleric Dr. Gil Gainey, who like fish out of water (maybe more like a seal) flops around furiously barked and encouraging the crowd to subscribe to a water madness. Melancholy Glenda Jackson Isabella Garnell smacks of Shakespeare's Hamlet, caring and self-righteous - even bringing a monologue or two. And let's not forget, Bile character Henry Gibson, Bobby Hammer ( «The breast that feeds the child rules the world"). Then there are the characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively), relatively intelligent characters who seek to find some sort of balance between all companion and extreme Humors, convened for H.E.A.L.T.H. - a kind of World Trade Organization, which specializes in H.E.A.L.T.H., to say nothing but health. This is a classic Altman better than him.
