It will be hoping that the assessment has changed now because of my brilliant and amazing review that convinces you all to go and see the film, thereby creating an instant choir "8" s true the score of the film. <br /> <br /> As previously mentioned, Chris Rock is King! By going to see this movie, I was not, that on top of it, but now I'm knocking on the door Chris Rock site, who asked him to take me as his protégé. This film is really funny, if you can not find this movie funny you really need treatment, and this humor, which is aimed at all sectors of society, including the race (predictable), class division, love, wealth, employment, dream, get up comedy ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> there was one slight disappointment for me, however. It was the fact that the transition in this film, I realized that it was actually a remake of «Heaven Can Wait» is still a pretty good film, made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. So I was very surprised when I watched this movie and suddenly began to unravel the plot clearly similar to the older movies I watched on TV a few weeks ago .. No matter, this film, in my opinion, the best option from a number of two and a simply because of the different areas it covers, and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than any other Warren Beatty on any day of any week of any year any ... you get the picture. <br /> <br /> Well, the actual plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> not spoil the experience for yourself! Do not read the story! Just go and see the film, because it was two reviews on IMDb so far that raving mad about it, go see, because it's the funniest thing you have seen in a long time, go and see it, because it cinema experience that will not leave you grumbling nausea classified in cost of movie tickets. Immediately evident, because it is a good movie!
