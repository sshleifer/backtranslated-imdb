Simply put, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> It starts just looking as the study of the rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film. <br /> <br /> do not wait gore or zombie. This is a psychological, and just as he would also do in Candyman Bernard Rose was able to convey the horror of who did not believe. <br /> <br /> Every time you watch this film, you understand more about what is happening, and how these two worlds in this film interconnects. <br /> <br /> The drawings have never been worse.
