I've seen "Shadow Brother" at the Tribeca Film Festival and found that he was still thinking about it two days later. The story of the prodigal son (Scott Cohen) return to the custom of his family's furniture business after being in prison, it offers all the necessary qualities of a solid drama - memorials; acute, supervisory dialogue; . Sensitive use of the camera, a director who thinks visually <br /> <br /> But more than that, it is what it is all too rare in the multiplex these days: an uncompromising vision of a mature sensibility. Talent director-screenwriter Todd S. Yellin, it seems, there is a full-scale, but we get the feeling he (and his character) to pay membership fees. He knows how real people are struggling in this world, and he knows, as we long to see - or, at least, indirectly experience - success. However, Yellin respects its audience too much to blow smoke happy our rear ends. In the end, we see that Jake's victory is not in the Commission or in respect of his family, but also in the "work", he could not refuse, if he tries. <br /> <br /> It is essential theme in the world (and especially in the film industry), it can not rise above the "bottom line." This film deserves a wide audience.
