As I watched this movie, I started to feel very nostalgic. As a child growing up in the countryside, I felt as if I were a kid again! The swimming pond (this is called "tank" in the Central Texas) that runs through the countryside like a wild free spirit! The story was very believable, and I completely lost it and screamed until the end. Through the pain we go through in life ... life goes on and it can be forgiven.
