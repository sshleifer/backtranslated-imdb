Back in 1994, I had a very long vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 17 days off in a row that the two weeks of paid vacation, a weekend and the holiday itself. I stayed in the city at this time, the bolts in the parental home much. <br /> <br /> I did not have a TV in my apartment, so I used to see my parents tube. I just finished watching a segment X Files, if the program is started under the name Personal FX. I was hooked instantly. I've always been fascinated with the elements in our house who come from family homes and through inheritance from relatives of my parents' estates, and frequently asked questions about their history, values, etc. <br /> <br /> After my long holiday I went to the house of my people on my lunch hours just to catch a Personal FX. <br /> <br /> I remember one episode, during which the co-host Claire Carter announced that the apartment in New York, where the series was filmed has been repaired, and said something to the reconstruction has been completed, that Personl FX returns to the air. <br /> <br /> He never did! Personal FX was the first and best of all - a collector's show. And he vanished out of thin air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still sore. <br /> <br /> the way, FX.
