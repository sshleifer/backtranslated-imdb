This film was very funny, I could not stop smiling, watching it, and have watched it twice in 2 days! The film is clearly unique in its humor and visual effects are terrible, and, together with other (more serious) film stones Natali's Cube and Cypher. I became a huge fan of Vincenzo Natali since watching Cypher and all that he has made it very interesting. <br /> <br /> Very nice about this film is the music and "losers" characters Dave and Andrew, portrayed by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-author of the story), the actors and I love very much. are also cool X-Box Dead Or Alive combat (you can even see Dave played Halo in point) and amazing guitar solos Andrew, among many other things. <br /> <br /> In general, a great sense of good film about friendship. You Must See This!
