By some happy coincidence, in the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made a haunting masterpiece of Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo", they also made this light comedy. Perhaps the two actors, it is necessary to do so after how the severity of the Hitchcock film. Anyway, it's a great companion piece "Vertigo," as he once again explores the very nya-likely, but powerful novel. In fact, the film can be seen as the opposite side of the «Vertigo» with it a happy ending. Here again, Novak is undergoing a transformation, in Vertigo, she mainly plays two women, and here it is "prototypes" of witches fatal. Stewart again fascinated and tormented for some time his love for her. Unlike Vertigo two met in "Bell Book and Candle", the perfect antidote for the film Hitcock. Again, the dynamics of love and attraction are considered, but in a completely different way. The cast is terrific. Lemmon cheerful as a warlock brother Novak and Elsa Lancaster give classical work as the aunts. Ernie Kovacs as an alcoholic cult writer and of course she Zhingold play rival Novak all excellent. A scene from the comedy Stewart drinking the potion, it's better. Anyone who has seen Dizziness or even if you do not see this memorable light comedy.
