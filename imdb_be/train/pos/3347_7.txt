Robert Mitchum star Clint Tollinger in this short but firm Western: Man with a gun. Tollinger is a professional town tamer - like when the city needed someone to save himself; he is the one who brought to do it. Tollinger last concert comes by accident: a walk in the city in search of his former cast, he stumbles into the city played as a puppet of local western gangster. But many citizens are beginning to curse the day when they hired Tollinger, as his way of cleaning the city becomes very taxing (suddenly High Plains Drifter seems less original). <br /> <br /> A man with a gun begins as an average Western movie tough guy, but begins to amaze you more and more as the film progresses. What begins as a forgotten and mediocre finishes dark and sign in the middle. The entire film is very well filmed and the actors are very nice. Mitch his usual fine self are people with guns - not one of his best performances, Mitch still has his classical and effective presence of the screen tough guy in high gear, and he knocks futuristic, significant and shocking scenes of the movie right out of the park. A good man with a gun Mitch western and easily while standing in one.
