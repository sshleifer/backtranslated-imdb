I was so amazed at how much more a man on the moon really was.I is, at first I was kind of expecting a cheesy and predictable movie, but I decided that aside when watching.Well, when it was all over, I just left a stunned (basically in tears), by the way a great man on the moon proved be.This film so interesting and so aware of his tone, and it's just fabulous film.The action was great, especially with Reece Witherspoon (who was so sweet and mil), and all else.There there was nothing that really bothers me, I felt that the end of a sort of forecast flax, but very well done that.Also I felt some things to be as simple or as if it had been done before, but still a great film.Overall I must say that I have not much to say about this movie, not that it was bad, it's just a movie that you either like or not like.I, however, recommend to anyone and everyone, even if you do not like these types of films, it is also enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
