I have to start talking, I came across this movie.It was winter in Alaska about a year 1990.A friend of mine from Australia stayed with me and my girlfriend in a shoe box apartment.Winters in Alaska can be a little harder and most people stay indoors , drinking heavily and watch whatever comes on television.I found this film outside the commissary, which lies in the snow and immediately new she was treasure.It quite possibly the best worst movie ever.We spent the next two weeks to watch this movie and drink like fish.We watched so many times that we sometimes turn the TV sideways or upside down for a more complete filling effect.It is true gem.The nonstop laughs and memories will last forever.If you see the movie rental video store, steal it.You will not regret it!
