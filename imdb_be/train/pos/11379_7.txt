Castle of Blood (aka Scream Demon Lover, Altar of Blood, Ivan - better, but at least the name of the operation of a movie that sounds, and so on) is very traditional Gothic Romance film. This means that it has a large, eerie castles, stubborn young woman, a mysterious old man, hints of horror and the supernatural, and Romanesque elements in the modern sense of the genre. This also means that it is very deliberately paced, and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement. If you love movies like Robert Wise, The Ghost (1963), but you also have a taste of the end of 1960 / beginning of the 1970s, the Spanish and Italian horror, you can love blood castle as well. <br /> <br /> Baron Janos Dalmar (Carlos Quinn) lives in a big castle on the outskirts of the traditional unidentified European village. Locals are afraid of him, because legend has it that every time it is a woman's bed, she soon after the end of dead - the consensus is that it sets his fierce dog on them. It is very difficult, because the Baron has a very healthy appetite for women. At the beginning of the movie, another woman become a dead and mutilated. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Dr. Ivan Rakowsky (Erna Schürer) was at the center of villages, to take measures for Baron Dalmar castle. It is the visitors employed by the Baron of her experience in the field of chemistry. Of course, no one wants to go near the castle. Finally, Ivan finds a shady individual (which is even more shady) to take her. Once there, the odd woman who lives in a castle, Olga (Cristiana Galloni), Ivanna denies and says that it should not be there because she is a woman. Baron Dalmar constant, whether it should remain. She ends up staying, but somewhat reluctantly. Baron hired her to try to eliminate the consequences of severe burns that Baron brother, Igor, suffer from. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the brother of Baron seems to be just a piece of decaying flesh into a vat of strange, blackish liquid. And besides, Ivan feels strange, hallucinations, dreams. Just what is going on in the castle? Is Baron responsibility for the crime? Is he crazy? <br /> <br /> I'd love blood castle more than I do. As I have said, the film is very deliberate in pacing, and most of them are very low. I can go either way on the material as it is. I do not care about ghosts (yes, I am in a very small minority there), but I'm a big fan of the 1960s and 1970s European horror. One of my favorite directors Mario Bova. I also love the work of Dario Argento from this period. But sometimes, the blood castle moved a little too slow for me at times. There are large chunks that make up the scene is not very interesting Talking alternated with scenes of Ivan slowly walk through the corridors of the castle. <br /> <br /> But the film's atmosphere well. Director Jose Luis horse managed a passable sets and locations, and they shot well enough Emanuele Di Cola. However, the blood castle feels a relatively low budget, and that Roger Corman film production in the end (which usually means a low-budget, but often surprisingly high quality of the "running"). Thus, although there is a hint at the richness of Bava colors and complex set of decorations, everything is much more minimalist. Of course, it does not help that I was watching retromedia print looks like a 30-year-old photos, which had been left in the sun too long. It is "washed out" of the contrast is compromised. <br /> <br /> However, Merino and Di Cola eventually create fantastic visual effects. For example, the scene of Ivan walking in a dark corridor, which is fired from an exaggerated angle, and where an important element of the plot is revealed through the shadow only on the wall. There are also a couple of Ingmar Bergmanesque shots where the actors gracefully blocked implies a complex relationship, besides just being visually appealing and pulling eyes are deep in the frame. <br /> <br /> Representations pretty good, and women --especially Schürer - very attractive. Merino exploits this fact by including a decent amount of nudity. Schürer went on to make a series of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were, and other genres, with English names, such as the sex life in a woman's prison (1974), naked and voluptuous (1974), Strip Nude for Your assassin (1975 ) and erotic exploits of sexual seduction (1977). Castle of Blood is much tamer, but in addition to nudity, there are soft scenes include rape and slavery, and of course the scene mixing sex and death. <br /> <br /> primary attraction here, though perhaps a story that is very slow burning romance, like everything else. horror elements, mystical elements, and a somewhat unexpected twist towards the end bonuses, but in the end, the blood castle love story about a couple, overcoming various difficulties and contradictions (often with a physical threat or harm) to be together,
