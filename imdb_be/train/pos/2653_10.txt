Kubrick once again proved its brilliantness, is now in suspense horror film based on the book by Stephen King called the same way. Jack Torrance is a man of forty years old, married, with one child, and with the past troubles and alcoholism. Overlook Hotel in Colorado to suspend the service in the winter because of its extreme weather conditions, and has a well-paid job for a person who cares about the objects during the five months; and Torrance that aspires to be a writer, found it ideal. But, Torrance manager advised of loneliness in this place during the winter, is potentially dangerous, and told him that a warden in the past came to mind and killed his family. Before they got there, his son Denis, who has something of an imaginary friend who illuminates his future (brilliant), knew that the place was not well and did not want to go. Once they have established themselves in the hotel, it started immediately, but within a month, Jack began acting strangely, irritable, and depressed. At the moment, we know that something is going to happen, but I do not know when and how. Terrible things happen such as the emergence of two twin girls to talk to Danny, and someone attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack began to see other people and immediately felt good with them, as if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic guard, Delbert Grady. Grady says Torrance, that he should kill his family because they are "criminals" in the hotel. Obeying this order, Jack went to the goal, and many of the worst things I've ever seen happen here. The ending is spectacular and the audience will remain interested and shocked to the last minute.
