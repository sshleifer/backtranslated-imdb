Very slick, very Pre-Hays Code, and still very arrogant. I highly recommend this movie to see, even if you are not a fan of Stynwyck. She's funny, she's sexy, she is hardworking - and love that she gets Perm <br /> <br /> Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as doozie with whores, which rises in the world, beautifully painted building banks !. John Wayne (in costume!) Plays one of his first conquest. <br /> <br /> In the last three minutes of frustration, but it sets the line clothing all added to one heck of a movie to raise vertically into a horizontal position.
