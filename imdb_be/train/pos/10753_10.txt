For those who say that this film deserves nothing less unflaunting affection that he showed, I do not agree. This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to appreciate this film. I ask you to consider the fact that the documentary was made. The courage it took to shoot this film is most notable. We believe that the two brothers separated when there was at that time. They continue to document the bravest of the brave, not knowing about their own safety and eachother. In order to judge whether it is nobler to shoot video of this tragedy and to save lives, as did these strange, strange fire is not mine to answer. I just know that within 30 years, a full class of children will not know one without the other. <br /> <br /> I submit sincere 10. Therefore, it was created an art picture! In order to capture the natural emotion that real life offers. You can leave your kung fu garbage. Romance cute. The action will never reach that level. This film, 9/11, is timeless in that it did not glorify himself. He did not sneak-peek. He did not have all the outrageous puts the lion's share of the many films to roar on many screens. It was class, self-control, substance and had a record of the day that changed the face of modern America and even the world. He talked about the inevitable for the camera eye. Please note that this film, as he himself says, stirring tribute to all those who lost their lives because of the free, the beautiful name of America. <br /> <br /> How can you give anything less that a film that shows sun exaggerates the natural courage of real people acting in an unreal time. I like "The Godfather", but the "9/11" for all different kind of movie, as it is now a different kind of world. It is an art with no issues or questions. <br /> <br /> JF
