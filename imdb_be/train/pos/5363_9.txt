This is a classic action movie with 80 minutes with Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including television networks. One of the most popular television show is "The Running Man", where convicted criminals are hunted and killed for the entertainment of millions. It was created as a game show where the audience votes for their favorite "stalkers" trained killers who hunt down and kill the unlucky "contestant" show. Spectators also win prizes for correctly predict who will be killed by anyone. And the owner played by none other than a family feud, Richard Dawson, who plays the show experience makes him well suited to this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play the game sadistic. <br /> <br /> This film is full of classic Arnold one-liners, such as his famous "I'll be back" just before he enters the arena. And he scoffs stalker armed with a flamethrower, "What about the world?" I could go on and on, but I do not want to spoil the movie. This is the fun stuff! <br /> <br /> Whether it was intentional or not, this film is a great parody of today's "reality" craze. there are already many programs that show people endure the pain and humiliation for the entertainment of the audience, and even court cases on television for the "entertainment". Running man shows what happens when the reality TV meltdown, and it scary picture. One can only hope that the networks have a healthy Enns, so as not to let it go so far. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a funny movie and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
