This film was released the year I was born, and will be, as I have, 70 in 2007, I watched it again last night, not having seen him out of high school. While he was a full 30-sentiment and the action was a bit stereotypical, nevertheless, it was fine. History of Pearl S. Buck did come to life through the magic of chemistry Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel, which earned Ms. BUCK Nobel Prize for Literature comes to life under the control of Sidney Franklin, who, together with an excellent script tells the story of a peasant farmer, Wang Lung, whose father received a bride for him, the slave of the kitchen of the local landowner. In the history of Buck, Wang success will be guaranteed by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and love for the land. In the end, he comes to understand that his wife, as the land is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Stories Buck has always been strong women thrown in a critical place to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. A German Luise Rainer brings advanced but some Peasants Chinese woman to life in its image OLAN. Mooney also captures the naive but honorable Wang, in the end, sandwiched between the two worlds of the rich and the peasant. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Kansan Dorothy Gale's uncle Henry from The Wizard of Oz, Walter Connell like meowing, treacherous uncle and KEYE Luke as the number one for his son, but this time, not Charlie Chan. <br /> <br /> Classic can be defined as a movie that you can watch over and over again and never get bored. If this is true, then this film is not a classic, no doubt.
