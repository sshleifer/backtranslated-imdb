All I can say is, if you do not fall in love with the Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, you are not human! Even after watching it for the first time, I was hooked. It is fascinating experience that is hard to describe, as I'm sure other supporters testify. After viewing, you'll cry, to think that these two lovely ladies are no longer with us. At least, we have the Gray Gardens to remember them! I think that we all long to have a rigid independence, these two ladies were adorned with. Although I have always admired Jackie Kennedy Onassis, it does not remain in your heart, as the Grand and Little Eddie to do. What a rare treat to have know these people; I just wish I had!
