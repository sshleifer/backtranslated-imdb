On the second viewing of the film, I like it even more than the first time. It is full of nuances and perception of life as a very common and often frightening, but what elevates this film to a height rarely realized is its focus on small occasions in our lives, which we usually offer only the best of the short attention span. Here, the film unwinds in the celebration of these incidents, a tow truck driver's meeting and the client on the runner's hearing a baby cry from the bushes. Dialogue, action, casting and direction perfectly. No two by fours or great discoveries. What I was to see how the characters were exactly their basic natures and how to improve their life began when they were celebrated. Kudos to all involved in this, we need more "Grand Canyon" in our lives. 9 of 10.
