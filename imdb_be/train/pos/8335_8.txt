While the sparkling chemistry between Ryan and Robbins reason enough to see this movie, the supporting cast (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning and cheerful trio Jacobi, and Saks Maher) is an added plus. Matthau glitters like Einstein, Fry is ideal as a clinical fiance Ryan and Shalub line in the gonads of Einstein is, as already mentioned, one of the highlights of the film. Things that Robbins delivers his first appearance in public pure poetry. Kudos to the writers for the treatment of this foam with wit and levity. I also thought that Keene Curtis was excellent, Eisenhower. This can be seen as something of a chick movie, but I think everyone will get pleasure from it. Eight very solid point.
