I saw this movie when it came out when I was 17 years old, and classic rock (still am) ... <br /> <br /> I never liked opera before, because I hate the soprano voice, but he has changed all that. It was like in a movie, and there was such a strange voice. <br /> <br /> I heard on CNN, he died today in the house of pancreatic cancer, it is not to be missed, and he certainly left his mark on this world. <br /> <br /> I hope to buy this movie if I can find it, watch and enjoy. * Smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and look before it is sold.
