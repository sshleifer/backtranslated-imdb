Japan is in serious trouble. Demons were infected Edo, seizing earthly form and to bend them to the godless freedom. Moreover, the revival of Ashura, the Queen of demons closely. The only thing that is against this serious threat are the Demon Guards, menacing group of soldiers, that could be just as bad as the demons themselves. <br /> <br /> Demon retired Izumi Ward, who five years ago, took the theater instead Slaying demon after accidentally killing an innocent child (in a fight that is remarkably similar to a bar scene from sunset to sunrise). One night during a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fates are intertwined (literally), and they involve the fate lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think that this sounds like your typical Japanese Fantasy / Swordplay epic, you are wrong. In fact, there is nothing typical about Ashura. This mishmash of different film genres. Those just mentioned, as well as comedy, drama, and romance. Yozhero director Takita (Onmyoji) juggles genre rather sedately (Although, comedy seems forced in some scenes), and the end result is a funny, but really fun popcorn movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are drawbacks in the film. Some of the humor seems contrived and ridiculous. And the actor is not the greatest. But seriously, you see Fantasy / Fencing / Comedy movies for big acting performances ?? No, we are watching their actions and crazy the CG visual effects, all of which is in the Ashura lady. Do not be fooled, the film all the action, but separated quite generous with a lot of fencing and buckets of green blood to the average viewer happy <br /> <br /> The result. films have their drawbacks, and not martial arts epic, but he's not trying to be, and it shows interesting visual effects and good action fencing. The reason why the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously, and if the viewer does the same thing, they are sure to be delighted with this fun and silly swordplay fantasy action film. <br /> <br /> My rating of 7 out of 10. Fun popcorn movie.
