This film is one of those nostalgic things with me, and I never expected that someone will "get it", but I'm glad that I recommend it, and someone will like. My late father HATED Arthur Askey, but this film was the one he really liked, and his consistent enthusiasm for "Ghost Train" and "Old Ted" Olmes "given to me as a child. Many years later, I watch it every now and again, enjoying the familiarity. I always wonder if it would not be quite the same, but I never give up on it. There is a lot to enjoy. train sequence is really inspiring, if Askey and Murdoch continued to annoy arrogant male passenger. Then the entire area on the country so much going on the station, you have to keep up. Yes, it is dated and full of wartime British accents in the plot (based on the original play by Arnold Ridley of Dad's Army fame!), But full of wonderful performances in nature - including Kathleen Harrison as a point virgin. The atmosphere is really as close as the sinister Arthur Askey vehicle could get. It can be cheap as chips in the UK on DVD, so treat yourself. This is the perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any day lazy day light piece of entertainment. Thank you .... <br /> <br /> old movies can be a good movie!
