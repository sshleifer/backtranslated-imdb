Well, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was funny and sad, and let the guy seduced Andie MacDowell was hot. Interesting, realistic characters and scenes, as well as beautiful scenery. I think my mother would have wanted it. I still think they should have been allowed to call his Sad F ** KERS Club, though ...
