The film really challenge your ideas about the personality and the society in which we live. It is well made and very powerful. Persons in the film honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological point of view. I believe that this gives a great insight into a sub-culture that shakes the very idea that the viewer has the society. It's shocking sometimes more powerful because of it. Some parts were hard to see how the majority of reality, but it is nothing more than to do. Its good for the first time, when you look, but it gets even better the second or third time; because you were able to wrap my mind around the most is that they discuss and challenge.
