Mary Poppins, of course, is much better, but it's a great film nonetheless. Angela Lansbury's fine point as Engletine price, and David Tomlinson has great fun as Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was just brilliant, as well. Children, however, simply did not have the same shine, although Paul is very funny and cute. Songs were actually not as bad as some people say, "Beautiful salty sea" is the best, in fact, all the songs are outstanding. The special effects were excellent, there was a lot of magic, history and quite original. Highlights, although as Mary Poppins were animated sequence. Underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favorite was a football match, which was absolutely hilarious. The only other criticism is that I do not quite understand the ending, when I first saw it. In general, a great movie, which is hardly ever on. 8/10 Bethany Cox
