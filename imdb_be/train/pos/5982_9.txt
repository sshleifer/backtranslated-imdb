One of my favorite movies. It has everything - a rocking soundtrack, affectionately Eddie Clarke, the former of Motorhead, loads of action, loads of laughter, completely ridiculous plot and the most beautiful "stereotype 80th as signs. Eddie, it hurt a good guy who just wants to be left alone, to be different, Leslie (about as wet as they come), Nuke (rock burnout), Eddie Mom (pathetic), Roger (freak) and Ozzy as a preacher (he is, of course, exist in America?). Then there are boys (rich, evil and stupid) and girls (free, empty and stupid). What else could you ask for? <br /> <br /> Well, firstly, there is a Tech Summit, a rock star, an amalgam of every "bullies rocker 80 you can think of. What about the rocket firing guitar? Then there's a scene where Sam leads the old lady through the TV screen and smashes it. And what to do, Roger? Why, vacuum it, as well as a good will freak. My favorite scene where Tim Hainey received his long overdue award from Saogo through a wet finger in the plug - Magic <br /> <br /> If you were in a rock in the 80th or just loves funny movies, as I do, then check out this. It is available on DVD and is very cheap, so (or trick) refers to itself.
