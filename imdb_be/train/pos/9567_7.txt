I watched the DVD of the film, which also comes with an excellent commentary track (in English). It seems, in Cambodia (English subtitles speak character speak Thai, but the film says Cambodia) is very hard to build a villain boy be killers using starvation and train them to fight and kill. He sends Pang kill people in China and around the time of the murder of police Partner dies. Cap Wai is Loose Cannon, who is worried about her father, who is also a police officer who was shot and is in a coma. Chief Wai is a member of his father's strange behavior worries Vai. He does not know, Wai was the one who caught his father in the fight against drug traffickers and shot him and put him in a coma. Pang runs away and hides in a squalid hovel landfill, where he meets a woman, who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father will not let her go (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand it, but saves her from her father apparently, have sex with her, perhaps this is the reason for Cat III). Wai is becoming more and more obsessed with getting Pang Pang, but almost impossible to stop. Even after Pang steals a boat and take a woman to his home, where they were married, and she becomes pregnant Wai stands and joins the evil person (who trained boys) makes a deal to fight and train so that he could get Pang. There is a great confrontation between Wai and Pang abused woman with a very major casualties and leaving the dead and Pang Wai cutting her baby from the dead mother to die and leave it as a possible next boy be raised as an assassin. This film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many very cruel violence. The woman, a long nail pulled her legs. Knives to the neck and torso. Gun shot in the head. And some very intense beating. It can be intense and grim grim, but it is definitely worth a look.
