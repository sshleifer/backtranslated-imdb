Mensah was very rich in this hour special. He worked hard to show everyone that he was the real deal. I know that people say that he stole the material in this special, but it is not. Carlos brings the comedy front as he wants to, and not as someone wants to, that's why he's so good. People say that it is not funny, because he says Dee Dee Yes too much, and they still did not understand, Thats a part of his act, and they do not want it that way, but it brings him anyway, and was able to get people laugh. For all the haters out there, this is the message, by Carlos to stay here, you have no point in trying to bring it down.
