So that is a real independent film? In the day and age when the latest oddity mainstream Hollywood to appear robust and cutting edge, I'm sorry to say that the public tends to be perceived as independent film is not, as a rule, no more than a clever marketing ploy. <, Br /> <br /> That is why we should be glad that films like "Hate Minute" exists. Across the board, this movie makes a point to contradict its own template (indie horror film). Love it or hate it, "Hatred" is not afraid of what it is and watch this movie, you get a real sense of what Cullen (Director) is not only to make this film to dispel the fake blood all over the place, he is telling it. All right. You can find this movie to see a horror movie to your video store, but do not be fooled, this is a story about love, about good people pushed over the edge, and so distant light at the end of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting, soot, or Evil Dead robbery, stay away from this movie. But if you dig the subtleties of horror / suspense genre, check out this film with. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell did to make this film, and I'm sure he was proud of the fact that anyone say that it is not "Evil Dead". Bruce never tried to rely on its "ash" of the image, and it is obvious that he did not communicate with the "hatred", so that it can do this either. <br /> <br /> My advice, though, all the Dead-ITES nothing furiously devouring issued by Mr. Campbell, to see this movie anyway, and see what else Mr. Cullen and Mr. Campbell is trying to show you. <br /> <br /> action is well done, although there is nothing about this film is not Oscar caliber (perhaps intentionally), it is good to see the honorable performances in the horror film. So often, the actors in films such as this does not seem to even try to "hate", it seemed that all the actors have taken thier charecters very seriously, never resorting to the typical horror movie campiness. <br /> <br /> Technically, "Hatred" is about as competent as an indie movie gets. Fast-paced editing, cinematography good considering the budget, and "Hate" keeps a fast pace without any points bog down or bad anti-climax. <br /> <br /> In general, Hate can not have silenced all these kind of multi-million dollar counterfeit indies, but personally I do not see a problem with it. This is a film of people who really care about the environment. People who have achieved in the shooting broke ass pocket, pulled out a shooting Nickles and dimes, threw caution to the wind and made a hell of a good movie. <br /> <br /> Check out this.
