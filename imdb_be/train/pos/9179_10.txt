This is the best option (until now), that you will see and the most faithful work Bronte. Dalton little hard to imagine how Rochester, Jane Eyre who said that "not nice." But its effect is overcome and ZIL Clark, cute, as it is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre. This production is the long hours, but well worth it. Almost direct quotes from the book to the script, and if you want the very first true "romance" in the literature, this is the way to see it. I have all copies of the film and read and re-read the original. Shooting may seem a little dated now, but will never be another like it.
