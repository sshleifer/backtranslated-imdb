Most people who pursue movies with Audrey Tautou does not seem to understand that Amelie was the nature - it's actually not a real life person Audrey Tautou, which means that each movie she participates in is not going to be Amelie part 2 part 3, etc. <br /> <br /> Now, with that said, I also took this film simply because Audrey was in it. Yes, it's true, there is a big gap after the first scene, where she could not see at all, maybe 45 minutes, but I did not miss it, because I had so much fun with the other characters. The guy who is all too funny, the guy who lives up the people who are fleeing from their cafe and pass on by, finding coupons are those that balance the loss actually there .... all the characters here could take some time, but it is one of the best films I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> character of Audrey Tautou in Irene not exaggerated annoying girl that Amelie was. In fact, as Irene, her rudeness homeless asking for change caught me by surprise in the first place. In this film, Irene girl with good intentions, but on the go (really terrible) day, its position is becoming more and more sour and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> What makes the film completely is great you have all these really interesting stories and stories ... the building is very interesting to see great scenery and arrows, are very colorful and never too slow and all characters can actually act. The best part of the movie is about 20 minutes to go .... this is where all the sites are beginning to mesh together, and the trip really lifts and everything is interconnected, and it makes sense, and the whole effect butterfly is thriving. I swear that it was the best 20 minutes of the film I've seen in quite a while, and the end .... It made me think that the "pancake really lucky to find this movie." The end of the film at the highest level. Whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant, because not only have all these other podagovory happening, but some way to make it all tie together (and in a reasonable manner, in this case), but also to make each character feel people and come to life, and not just some stale person is used as a crutch to build this entire butterfly effect ... very impressive. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie as it is a great movie to watch at any time, in any mood, any company or alone.
