This movie was great! It was a wonderful performance of ancient myth. Animation was a bit strange, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected, the Disney film without singing. <br /> <br /> The background animation was magical. It was a different level of work for the Disney people. Some of the characters were a little square, but this was more than compensated for the beauty and splendor of the scenery. The music was mostly instrumental, but it was perfect for the film. It's definitely not a movie that needed characters bust into song. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 out of 10.
