Note that the previous reviewer: This film is a "sci-fi adaptation of the Iliad," according to the writer. So whether links are painful or not, no apology, it is the basis for the film. They admit that they stole ... but is adapted RS term. <br /> <br /> Great film, but too short. Probably will not come out, as well as author, director or the studio wanted, but devilishly fun. The fact that the studio itself is integrated while creating only helps to add his legacy. <br /> <br /> big budget remake will not be as fun, and probably will not make the script more than justice. But it's fun to dream of potential there. DVD release with some poor extras, apparently available, but I do not think he will play on NTSC players. I'm no expert, and thus, still trying to figure it out. Now I live with VHS incarnation.
