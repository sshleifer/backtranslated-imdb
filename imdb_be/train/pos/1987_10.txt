This movie was awesome! I can not get over this song. I think I'm too old for musicals, but this film deserves credit here, folks! My particular favorite Jack Wild. I, being a British actor lover, you can not keep me from all these nice fresh weld, young people. I never knew that if Jack did this film, he was sixteen! It looks like an eleven year old. He is short, it is something that helps. Try to post the answers posters colleagues, so I can relate to your experience. Oh, and Oliver Reed, that guy Bill Sykes, I think that the drone look really familiar. Any idea where he played a major role in the past? If so, post it, I'd really like to know.
