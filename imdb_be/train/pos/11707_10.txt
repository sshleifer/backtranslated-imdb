I remember this film for a long time, then, even if he did not have any special effects, the effect was very good. And he still has the same message today, despite the fact that the technology has changed, maybe they need to do a remake of this film, it would be interesting to see the remake. I also enjoyed the music from the film, as well as Larry Norman was a really good composer during this period, although currently most Christian music is now worshiped and glorified music. I was always curious to know what happened to Patty after the end of the series? Perhaps she had gone to make more films, she came to the end, to get married and start a family? I would like to have an update.
