"Kolchak" was a series that does not really fit into any category. Part horror, part comedy, some social consciousness thrown in, and the fact that we have something that I think people were not ready. It's a shame, really, as I started watching the show in the refrigeration network (I have never seen the original), I realized how different and interesting it really was. <br /> <br /> starring Darren McGavin, Kolchak correspondent of the International News Service, and Simon Oakland as he always angry boss, Tony Vincenzo, the show follows the exploits of the Chicago news reporter, who did not often become part of the story, he was looking for the windy city for modern day creepies, that go bump in the night. The main charm of Macgavin really sets the show apart. A few dumb guy who always wears the same suit, you can not help but love him. His jokes are great, and the back and forth between him and a skeptical editor, Oakland, downright fun. <br /> <br /> The stories for the most part pretty good, and the effect is very good. In the 70s there was * a great period for the special effects, and the show is suffering because of it, but if you suspend disbelief that you have a fun series that was in front of the pair.
