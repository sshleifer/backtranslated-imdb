I thought that racism and prejudice against Brashear was much dramatized for the Hollywood effect. I do not believe that the US Navy was ever that openly racist. I can not imagine a full captain, commander, he had never told his boss deliberately flunk anyone. Of course, without risking their lives. And never was the foreman, how shamelessly biased against all but the Wasps, as the nature of De Niro. Neither the chief as slovenly and drunk, he would have played had never risen to Sergeant in the first place. Cuba Gooding preserved otherwise poorly made film.
