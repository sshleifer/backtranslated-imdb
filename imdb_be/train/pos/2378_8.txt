This film is much better than the version of shelters mainly war of the worlds. Tripods looks pretty cool, but their gait and deaths could have been better. The scenes were really cool. Walking ... walking ... walking ... walking !!! My God to stop to go, please, or I'll kill myself. The roar of the baby scene was my favorite sequence is mainly because the ship rammed a bunch of racks. A good film that I recommend for people ho read the book. Music is an amazing director and cut looks very cool. <br /> <br /> Pros. Good soundtrack 99% of the book Cool tripod violence and feeding machines look cool <br /> <br /> Cons. some bad actions cheese looking London
