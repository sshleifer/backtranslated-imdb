I saw this little Belgian stone two days after you see the "American Teen." Make no mistake about it, the teenage roller coaster, whether American or European. «Naissance de Pieuvres» (or as it is called in the US «Water Lillies») is a story of a young 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Akkar, which is sometimes reminiscent of the young Scarlett Johansson) acts cold, withdrawn girl who wants to be in school swimming team, just to be with other attractive girl (Adèle Haenel). It is more than obvious that Marie more than attracted to Floriane. Figuring among all this is quite chubby, unattractive other dreams, Anne, who just wants one, just like any other girl her age. Along the way, we showed the usual array of teen games (broken hearts, lifting the store, alcohol and / or drugs, casual sex, etc.). This is a quiet little film that takes a lot of time to work it's way into your system (Michael Bay fans, take note: Shagan here s-l-o-w, so stay away), but if you do not have a problem with it, water Lillies is a charmer. No ratings here, but will not pull down hard «R», because of the language, poverty, adult situations.
