Stack was to receive an Oscar for this performance period. Its a crime that he did not. Surprisingly, it humanizes rich useless character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone did earn a well-deserved Oscar for its implementation. In fact, in this film all the action perfectly. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a trip by taxi, the airplane trip, and then continues to move on an emotional ride that will keep your interest throughout. You will have fun! <br /> <br /> However, this is just a blatant soap opera. Univariate 100 percent soaper. You could call it the ultimate soaper, because acting wins so carefully over the material. Brilliantly acted, well directed, but strictly within the limits of the soap genre. I would not even call it melodrama (eg, "Mildred Pierce" and "Imitation of Life"). Without denying the great entertainment value of the film, you can only imagine what these talented actors and directors could achieve a significant subject.
