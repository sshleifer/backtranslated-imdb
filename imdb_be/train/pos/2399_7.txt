It was a blow to the festival South By Southwest (SXSW) in Austin film last year, and has a wonderful cast headed E.R. Gloria Reuben and scenery chewing John Glover. Although shot on a small budget in New York, the film looks and sounds fantastic, and takes us behind the scenes of the vortex through the rehearsal and the installation of the actors referred to as «The Scottish Play» in reference to the word "Macbeth" is thought to bring the ancient curse of the play. Operating company shows all the emotions of the play itself, lust, envy, anger, suspicion and a bit of fun as well. The game starts when the veteran actor is replaced (in the title role) with the help of the well-known "beautiful face" with the television soap opera scene, in order to attract large crowds. The green-eyed monster takes over from there, and the drama unfolds beautifully. Fine soundtrack and good performances all around. DVD includes a director's commentary and some deleted scenes as well.
