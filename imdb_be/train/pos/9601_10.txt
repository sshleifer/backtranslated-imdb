Darius Goes West strange documentary about a teenager (Weems) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and his 11 friends, who take him on a trip cross country to see if «Pimp My Ride» is a pimp with his wheelchair. <br /> <br /> I recently watched the film at the film festival cinema sun. He played twice during the festival. This film is an amazing story about the human spirit, and the spirit of Weem friends. I do not say this often about movies, but after watching this film, I feel moved to do something in relation to the case. Each festival this film took part in the film won any. It is located in the Tribeca Film Festival, and he went to London and Athens, Greece. I would not be surprised if this film went all the way to the Academy Awards. He snowballing out of control. If anyone has a chance to see this film, no matter where he played, go! Take as many people as possible, and go! He goes to New Orleans Film Festival, followed by Atlanta and Palm Beach, Florida. Darius from Georgia, so I expect the tickets to the show Atlanta will be sold quickly if they are not already. Please go see this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
