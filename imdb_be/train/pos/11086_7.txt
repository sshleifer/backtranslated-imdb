I saw this film when I was a kid - he was named "Fox Glacier". I was completely traumatized by it! It follows from this cute little fox around the family. The start was great, and I remember getting very attached to the little fox. I also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater when I was in hysterics. I will not tell you what happened, but let's just say it does not end well for all the foxes. I'm used to the type of Disney nature films where animals do not really die. About people. This movie made me cry for hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was very little, and I remember being happy for the fox, and then see one of them die in truth -Sun. Rent, if you can, but do not show your children!
