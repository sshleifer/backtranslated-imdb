I do not even want to watch this movie after reading the review in Maltin and 1 1/2 star rating. I still watched it on the advice of my son and found it much better than I expected. I would give it 2 1/2 stars out of 4 star system. You have to watch a movie more than once to understand it all. If you do not know much about religion, you miss a lot. I graduated from high year the film was made by the school, so maybe I can relate to it better. Yes, there are some harassment in the movie, and it is surprising to some degree, but it was in the 70s, so what do you expect. I can understand why people might not film; However, I can not understand people saying that it is boring. The film was not boring. You either hate it or love it. If you find it boring, you probably brain dead.
