For a long time, "Menagerie" was my favorite episode of "Star Trek", although in recent years it has been overshadowed by the "City on the Edge of Forever." What I prefer that the "Menagerie" was the fact that it is more angry Star Trek with this exciting pre-history to the then-current Trek storyline. I still think it's a pretty ingenious way to Gene Roddenberry including the original pilot episode of two parts. While the "new" part of the story is largely a justification for Kirk and several other (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea of ​​Spock be three Boone clever one. You can poke holes in the office, when you want. For example, taking into account the ability to control the mind talosiane and the status of Captain Pike why it should even physically bring Pike back to their planet? There are other intricate questions about pike and Commodore Mendes ... it is better not to think too much about the details and just enjoy only two ST-partner.
