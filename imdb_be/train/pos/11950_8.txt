I went into this film knowing nothing about it, and eventually actually like. It lacks precision and believability- Some of the things that the characters said and done, it was absolutely amazing and a lot of the script felt like it was on-libbed (perhaps this is typical for Woody Allen? Forgive my ignorance), but the entire audience the theater was so funny. It was not even a joke in the movie itself, but in the whole movie. Actions reminded me of the Seinfeld acting, where he is trying not to laugh at his own jokes- they are banal, but if you do not take the film too seriously, you can really appreciate the humor of the actors rather than characters. If you are looking for a casual movie and you like Woody Allen, I would definitely recommend!
