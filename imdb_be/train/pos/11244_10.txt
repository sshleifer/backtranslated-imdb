One of my best films ever, maybe because I was good in the punk scene in the late 70s and went on to many of hazel concerts, but the film was a good story and very well that acts hazel and up and coming Phil Daniels entirely sure about his latest project Eastenders !! excellent performance of a large number of unknown actors, if you keep your eyes will see them in many of the UK soap today exp: Carver with Bill, the more I watch it more of them I blotch, well, if you have not seen it yet has the night video, be sure to dig up the pin nose and heavy black eye make-up and shave your head Mochanian style .... Enjoy
