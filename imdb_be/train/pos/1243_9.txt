Every once in a while, Eddie Murphy will surprise you. <br /> <br /> In the film, as "The Golden Child", especially. This is a movie that you would understand that the star may be, Harrison Ford and Kurt Russell or someone else. But Eddie really works; he's smart, he's funny, he is brave, kind, gentle, economical, clean and everything else that the hero should be. <br /> <br /> After has been selected to provide a mystical child, who holds the key to protecting the world from over evil (embodied perfectly the dance), Eddie comes from California, Nepal and back, all while beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis) wonders if he is, he says he and crazy old holy man (Wong, perfect as always) knows what he is. <br /> <br /> It's interesting, breathtaking in spots, shocking and, of course, ridiculous. Eddie is the only action hero I know who could start the movie, making rude remarks for some guy is reading a porn magazine and at the end of his smart remarks about herring Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> There is no problem with this "child": This "Golden" find <br /> <br /> Nine stars .. Viva Nepal!
