Incredible actors, beautiful scenery, the harsh reality. I will not dwell on all the comments of other reviewers, because you get the picture! Nevertheless, the film is not for the faint of heart. The reality of the slaughter of pigs and other domestic animals in order to survive. I also have a homestead book Elinor Randall Stewart. I read it a few years ago, I have to read it, so I just watched the recently released, remastered DVD movie. <br /> <br /> I tried to buy the video for several years, finally bought before the store video, which went out of business. But Yippee! DVD is now for sale, I bought it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but worth it to me. This movie I'm going to look to the end of my days!
