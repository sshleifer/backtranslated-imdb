I did not have any expectations; I've never heard of Jamie Foxx; all I knew that the movie has some strong character actor in it. I thought it was very interesting; it was fun. The plot is different and unpredictable enough to keep my interest. For me, Foxx is the original. David Morse stunning (though it was not his best role). I think the chase and pyrotechnics contribution to cinema and is well made. I was not expecting much and I was pleasantly surprised.
