I must admit that the film touched me to such an extent that I burst into tears. Nevertheless, I always think about twice, and instead of writing a eulogy, which will determine the film impeccable and irreproachable, I prefer to take the risk of a closer look <br /> <br /> First, it is the first :. The film has an undeniable impact on the viewer, simply because it begins and continues at a slow pace of the film that does not try to blow you away with real scenes from 9/11. Not bad for this ingenious because, in contrast to the world's center of Stone, the film trade, fortunately, does not focus on the most attacks, but the fallout, which, like the loss of a nuclear explosion, barely visible, but nevertheless dangerous and destructive. Psychological impact, emptying itself that caused 9/11 and ruin it sows on the American people most sensitive in this film. I think, Binder turned astute observation of the American post 9/11 society and Sandler comedy soared from an average of the true talent of the actor in my sight the sky, which delivers a performance worthy of an Oscar <br /> <br /> However .: The film Blood Diamond DiCaprio character says, and I quote: "Oh, these Americans always want to take about their feelings." Now, I do not want to reduce their suffering, but I'm sure he would like to make a comparison. Since 9/11 the whole world is faced with souvenirs, memorials and celebrations 9/11. Hollywood industry and writers such as Safran Foer more than hint at 9/11 in his works. Now this is a huge amount of cultural products, dealing with 9/11, to turn the death of 3000 people in the greatest tragedy of this young century. The number of books written on the subject, and the number of films aimed at the subject, and I say this with all due respect, to undermine the importance of this heinous crime somewhat out of proportion <br /> <br /> The fact .: People are dying every day due of unjust acts and heinous crimes committed by the evil or simply lost people. We have a war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma and many other countries. On a daily basis, we forget about the poverty of the African people suffer from, and we tend to do empathize with them, to a lesser extent than with the American victims of 9/11 simply because they are black and because their life does not have much to do with our Western life. Africa has neither the money nor the capacity to honor its national tragedies so America can. So, what I am saying is this: The reason why we feel more than 3000 victims of 9/11 and their families, because we are constantly reminded of 9/11. Not a day goes by without a newspaper article, a film or a book that discusses 9/11 <br /> <br /> In conclusion :. I sympathized with Charlie Fineman, but I was not sure if I have the right feel for him more than for Huth, who lost his entire family in the Rwandan civil war. <br /> <br /> You catch my frugality?
