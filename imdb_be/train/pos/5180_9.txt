There is this private campground in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which has been around since 1959. My grandparents were among its founders, my parents have taken place since 1965, and my two brothers, there are sites out there nowadays. <br /> <br /> (it has nothing directly to do with the movie, bear with me) <br /> <br /> I spent the summer in the Blueberry Hill from when I was five years old, when I was eighteen, and it's people. . I, whom the film says, those for which the group camp in the forest was, as my fiancee tells me, "good and happy place" If you have never experienced life, Indian summer is likely to be lost to you; do not bother. This is not a fast-paced, he has no quick cuts, scenes not in the least confused, this is not an explosion, a dramatic tension that exists is soft, there is no A-list actors, there are no quick-fire is not an island just to show how smart writers are (except, perhaps, Kimberly Williams killer line about how her fianc√© must not "twist his toys." this is not least of all, this film is about more than the Godfather is a slasher movie just because that he has a lot to gore the screen. <br /> <br /> But the Indian summer is and the opposite sign of the cross. If you have experienced life, see this movie. Sun read more, just do it. <br /> <br /> it's 9/10 movie for me.
