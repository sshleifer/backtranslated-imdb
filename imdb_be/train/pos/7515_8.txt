I knew about Bettie Page for many a year. Soft-core porn images of her from the 1950s have since become iconographic and still have a strong draw even today. Appearance "Bettie Page" is also still very popular in the world of fetish heteroatom and is distinctive today as it was then. So I watched this movie with quite a bit of familiarity with the beginning. The result does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Among other things, it was very interesting to see the recovery of the real film figures such as Irving Klaw, John Willy, and Bunny Yeager ?? all considered pioneers today. Mary Harron did an excellent job of creating the right atmosphere of sexual repression and hypocrisy in the 1950s America, along with sexuality, which by today's standards, was not to blame in the extreme. against use of the monochrome color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate Bettie was in I especially liked. <br /> <br /> I think Gretchen Mol has done an excellent job of presenting the Bettie nature in all her innocent sexuality and all of its complete innocence. Betty loved to look beautiful, loved the attention, he sees nothing wrong with nudity, and enjoys dressing up in "silly costumes" for the camera. The underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desire whatever caused were completely lost on her. Until now, she still does not understand "what all the fuss" when it comes to her pictures or S & M content of them. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that she is very educated or too easy to understand, it's just that it just does not "get it" about fetishism and never will be. Nope no casualties. Betty Paige just be who she is. The film is preserved quite nicely. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the 1950s, portrayed Mrs. Harron and it is written with Guinevere Turner makes me really happy that I live in the day and age, what I'm doing. Hypocrisy and repression combined with massive ignorance about our sexuality, all combined with a terrible stuffy world. The film captures this well and brings applause as Bettie endure all this with her strong faith and her constant naivete. <br /> <br /> This film was a little slow at times, but hit all the points Ms. Harron encroachments and press them well. I would recommend this film even for people with little to no knowledge of who Bettie Page was and what effect it has on American culture. For those with such interests, then this film is a must see.
