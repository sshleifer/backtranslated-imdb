I love to play football, and I thought this movie was great because it contains a lot of football in him. It was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I'm glad he won 17 awards. Parminder heating and Kier Knightley were good and so was Archie Panjabi. Zhonaton Rheyes Meyers was a great coach in the game. Jazz (Parminder heating) loves to play soccer, but her parents want her to learn how to cook want her to marry. If the Jazz began to play for the football team secretly she meets Juliet (Kier Knightlety) and Joe (Zhonaton Rhyes Meyers), who is her coach. If her parents find out a nasty shock, but her father gives her to play a great match to the wedding of her sister, Pinky (Archie Punjabi in). At the end of her parents realize how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play.
