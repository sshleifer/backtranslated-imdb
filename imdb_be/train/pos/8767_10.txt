I saw this film to succeed, because I went through a phase where I had a new found admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all of his recent films, and thank God I did! This film stuck with me ever since and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls who go on a dramatic journey to a foreign country, where they will learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene were just trying to spend a holiday together before going to college but their journey ended in a much more complicated story. The struggle they go through, they were arrested in Thailand and became prisoners of very moving and intense. Act weird, unusual images, the soundtrack is fantastic and so good for the movie, and the transmitted message is definitely powerful. I actually can not even find the right words to describe how this film makes me feel every time I watch it. I know that some people do not appreciate how much I have rated the film, but I swear, this is the one you must see !!! I promise that it will follow you!
