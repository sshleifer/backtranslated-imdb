After reading the reviews for this film, I knew started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that this will actually any good. Nevertheless, it is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Most of the reviews I read said that the difficult part made it too difficult to follow. And while some parts do leave you confused, the end links are so many loose ends that you feel like pushing yourself because you miss so much. It's not like «Lock, Stock ...» or "snatch", in the sense that it is not funny (actually, it's quite dark), and it is much more reasonable, so that you can see the details of scenes different points of view (and, in one of the best scenes of the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in the elevator arguing with himself). The way in which it is similar to the two films I have just said that it is full of unforgettable characters, in particular Statham, which gives an excellent performance as the lead, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the movie in Speedos, but does not give a great performance nor less. If you have time and have time then to think about the film, and even watch it again, you really start to see all the symbols and clues that are laid through the film. I think it's fantastic, and that Guy Ritchie is a director at the top of their game.
