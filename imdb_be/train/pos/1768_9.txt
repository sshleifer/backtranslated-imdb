I have not laughed this hard in a movie for a long time. I have to go to a pre-screening, and was excited, because I'm dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughing over the movie. The audience all shared my laughter and shouting and screaming throughout most of the film. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Steve Carell (who I already was a fan). He argues in this film his enormous talent for comedy. He has a style that I have not seen before. And Catherine Keener as beautiful as always. Thank God, there was a cameo by Will Ferrell (I like it, but I saw him too much this summer). <br /> <br /> There have been part of the comedy genius in this film. Partly thanks to Karel, and partly due to writing (as Karel). Depilation stage and speed dater with "obvious problems" were absolutely hysterical. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely going to watch 40 Year Old Virgin, when it comes out. My advice is to go to see his huge laugh and incredibly enjoyable film on top.
