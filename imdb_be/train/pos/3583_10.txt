It was a great film, but it was the worst end, I think I have ever seen !!! The actors were great and displayed outstanding talent. The whole story has been twisted and unexpecting, that's what made it interesting. As well as the film was, the whole film is judged by the finale, which was terrible! Maybe continuation can eliminate this bad ending.
