This is in my opinion one of the best action films of the 1970s. He not only has a great shot, but it is also loaded with wild gunfights and explosions, which is still impressive today. The story of the Vietnam vet (Kris Kristofferson) enlists his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent), to help clean up the criminal element in a small town, and what happens when Kris begins to take advantage of its position and becomes as bad as the criminals he was hired, to get rid of. It's great to see Kris play against type. Bernadette Peters and Victoria Principal and offer great support as appropriate give two male stars. Jan-Michael shows the real movie star persona in the film. I do not think Vigilante Force on video, but sometimes appears on television. This is a great movie for guys who love movies.
