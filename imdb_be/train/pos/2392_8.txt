I have a 19-month-old and got very tired of looking Caring bear constantly. Rooney is a great dancer, who cares if he's gay. This guy was a cheerleader or something. <br /> <br /> Beats Barney, can not get the song out of my head .... not ... stop singing ........ Doodlebops songs. ....... Now. <br /> <br /> should be 10 lines of text, so I have to continue ..... what about when they say all Canadian things like OOOUT Aboooot. Simpleton Canadians ..... Jazmine is rhyme too much, it has to be Dutch. <br /> <br /> Knock knock, who's there, Dee Dee, Super Hottie <br /> <br /> The bus driver Bob can not dance, taking lessons from Rooney
