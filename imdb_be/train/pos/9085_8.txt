I see a lot of really negative reports from people who wrote in August, although the film was not released in the US, at least until mid-September. Maybe these poor immigrants living in South Korea, who had seen him before. I'm in the US and just saw it today. I thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was not western, but I think we're all used to it from many other films. It was not hard to follow. Action on conclusions were weak, but other people were very good. It was the humor around, too. I rated it an 8 because I had a good time watching it, that I went.
