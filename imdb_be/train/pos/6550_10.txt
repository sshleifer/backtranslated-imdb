Look, if I was interested in the book, Nancy Drew, I'd like to do is pick up a book and read it. I do not. Ever since I can remember, I've read people trashing movies, because it was not like a book. I'm sorry - we can no longer in the digital age to watch movies on a flip-book, but I'm sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form. If the Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. If the third one won an Oscar - "The book was better." When I watched Kill a Mockingbird, "the book was better" Now a lot of people are upset again because Nancy Drew did not like the book.. I'm not saying that Nancy Drew is going to win any Oscar - if anything, it will be one of those Nickelodeon blimps or the Kids Choice Awards. I say give the film a break. It's a movie, not paper. In the film, I found Nancy Drew is quite enjoyable - featuring cameos from Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (The Hebrew Hammer) and a supporting role featuring Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper on The OC) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That). This is the first time I saw Emma Roberts in the film and to be honest, I love my job more than most of Julie and Eric; her character remains constant throughout the film, and responds well to the conflict. Carefree film in the spirit of Harriet The Spy and now good again. <br /> <br /> I give ten stars, because I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, I would like to see him again, and probably buy a DVD release.
