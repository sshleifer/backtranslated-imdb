In the very first episode of Friends, which aired September 22, 1994 "The One Where Monica gets roommate" is a song play as Rachel sits in the window to the end of the show, a line that plays like: "If you ever need to conduct" ... . does anyone know the artist or song title of the song? It seems that this is a great song .... I would like to receive a copy. Thank you for your help. I am looking for an album / CD it is on so I can buy it. <br /> <br /> I have a show, are available for purchase and enjoy the show over and over again. It just seemed plausible ... thank you for hours of entertainment you have applied for many years.
