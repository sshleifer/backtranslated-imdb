I saw the blob a few times and it is one of the best low-budget alien invasion movies of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A strange meteor lands in the vicinity of the small town and the old man goes to investigate it. Strange jelly-like substance, and then attached to one of his hands and the young couple who saw the meteorite land in time to come and take him to the local doctor, where the old and then gets completely absorbed by the ground. Doctor and nurse are the next victims, and the mass becomes more and more. If these incidents are reported to the police, they do not believe that the young couple and charge them to do it all. They finally believe them, when the mass is now huge queues in the cinema of the city and all run into the street screaming. It is then attached to the diner with a young couple and some others inside. Blob quenched by spraying extinguishers load on it, and it will freeze its weakness. Then transported by air to the frozen wastes of the Arctic and disposed of there. But this is just frozen, do not die ... <br /> <br /> This film has a typical installation for your period: teenagers and a small town. Blob has a good rock 'n' roll song and style at the beginning of the movie and atmospheric throughout. <br /> <br /> Later, Beware! Blob followed in 1972 and the remake came in 1988, but this is the best of The Blob movie. <br /> <br /> Cast manages Steve McQueen (The Great Escape), and the film that made him a star and Aneta Korsaut plays his girlfriend. I'm not familiar with any of the other stars. <br /> <br /> The circle must see for all fans of science fiction. . Fantastic <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
