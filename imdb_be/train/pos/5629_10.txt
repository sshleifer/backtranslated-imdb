I liked it a great movie. Farrah Fawcett played the role of phenomenal and with a good heart. She plays a woman who is driven to extreme measures to protect yourself and your friends after she is attacked by unknown. Once rejected by the police, she realizes that she is. <br /> <br /> Then one day, when she was home alone stranger breaks into her house and attacked her again. Not being about to call the police or get it, she has to spray it in his eyes and puts it in her fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think there is a need for a wake up call to the laws of the land. They are too easy on these criminals. It's time for more severe penalties.
