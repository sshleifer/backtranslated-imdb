Little funny movie. It's absolutely incredible, unbelievable, impossible. But it's funny how closed masochist can become totally addicted and mesmerized, even under hypnosis, a girl he barely knew, but who was able to come down in its phantoms. Of course, this conviction crazy deals you can get on the Internet. You should not believe ten percent of what you said, and never, never, never accept to tie the hands in one form or another with someone or something or some organization, you do not know personally. Most of their "business" is to some extent deceiving you and your raid. But here's the head deserves to be a victim of these bandits, because it is not only naive, it is ridiculously stupid. But then the film becomes funny because it ends with the victim crooked business, having a top and end up playing the same game with his executioner and the victory. One brain too sure. Security in airports English is not quite what it should be, but I believe that it is no better than anywhere else in the world, and even now they tightened all the rules and regulations, it's just fun to go through their procedures and spoil them systematically. Then they their vengeance, losing their luggage, a real plague on modern airports, and should not expect to receive fair compensation. Or even to confiscate the bottle opener or the opener, because it can be dangerous. I see myself cutting its way through the plane of the edge of a can opener. Funny, is not it?
