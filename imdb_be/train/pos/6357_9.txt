I found this very interesting film young children are actually geared more for adults with plenty of jokes and humor only they would understand. A few things that are not appropriate for children, but only some of them. Othewise, «Grinch» (Jim Carrey) cracks so many jokes, you can not keep up with them all, ranging from the sexual to the cultural insider Hollywood race. <br /> <br /> The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD. A little girl here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is very nice and the costumes and hairstyles of the young people here interested to see. the voice of Anthony Hopkins nice, too, so having him narrate it raises the film further. His rhymes are interested in hearing. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater, even though it was "fair", but on DVD, it was much better. I've seen three times, and it got better every time.
