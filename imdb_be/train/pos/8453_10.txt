I could write a big enough comment on one of the Gundam Wing characters, each of them can lead to a series of these internal conflicts. Instead, we get 8 large customers, which take us through the 49 episodes of the anime gold enjoyment. <br /> <br /> It contains a dialog that you can roll in your head for a few months ... years and then go back to, and derive new meaning with a masterpiece in script writing (even if it is a typical feature of the anime there being a discrepancy between the subtitles and the English dub). It has a variety of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the cold unfeeling men and women who love the characters is a separate aspect of the series. Relations between Heero and Relena and Noin Milliardo and is a joy to watch. The apparent failure of the rest of the male from the inner bustle, making love (the word is never mentioned in the series) women that they need in their harsh environment soldiers. Women chasing men aspects that we rarely if ever see that makes the leading men are more mysterious. It takes HeERO all 49 episodes, to show some troubles, but he is getting there, and when he does, it will pay off big. <br /> <br /> And then a giant fighting robot. Fun to watch the strange sequence as good as any Hollywood epic fight scenes. Any less well informed person to see a giant robot fight like a silly animated feature for children, as has become clear, when I try to recommend this series to his friends, but they are wrong. Many of the giant robots fighting in the Gundam Wing contain a good dose of pathos, as a rule, in relation to the young rebels, fighting for what they believe in respect grim society makes their beliefs are outdated. <br /> <br /> constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode of Gundam Wing makes impossible to be boring, it's exciting, thoughtful study of the potential of the human mind and body.
