A young woman comes to his hometown of her husband after he died in an accident. She struggled to calm down in this small town, but soon after lost his young son in the kidnapping and all her hope ... This can lead to all kinds of the following sections in the usual film: to find a new partner, and be happy in the end; or sufficiently suppressed to fight and finally kill herself ... She does try to kill themselves, but after a series of heavy fighting with God. She believes in God, only to find that God seems to forgive all, even killers. Well, I have to be careful about God, the film does not mean against God. The way the film deals rather interesting question: is not the point of view of women, or from God's point of view (and therefore, it would be a lot of grass, clouds volatile points of view, I guess). Most likely, this is from the eyes of a third person, let's take a movie and does not explain anything. <br /> <br /> The film is not so interesting there were only women. There's also the man who is all around a woman and obviously in love with her, but in his own way. He's a funny guy, like a clown, I should say, who shamelessly hanging around our heroine. The combination of these two, a woman full of tension, crying and throwing up ever, and people smile and say stupid, after all, a good balance of emotions :. Nothing funny incorrectly or too tedious <br /> <br /> I highly recommend.
