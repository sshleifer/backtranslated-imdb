I'm glad other people like this movie, because I know that it does not have the greatest reputation, and it has no money in hand. I thought it was gorgeous, and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches, the cast (especially Colleen Camp) is perfect and Big Bad Apple has never looked better on film. You've already seen worse movies!
