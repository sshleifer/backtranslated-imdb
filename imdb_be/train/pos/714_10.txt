Even if you're not a big fan of the Ramones, Rock «N» Roll High School is * still * is the greatest rock 'n' roll movie ever made. Why? Because for all campiness, he respects the contempt and disgust teens often feel (and rightly so) for drilling, stupid, fascist, the establishment of adults worldwide. This final scene is one of the most glorious and exalted the final scenes in the movie I've ever seen. "My eyes have seen the glory ..." Rock 'n' Roll! <br /> <br />
