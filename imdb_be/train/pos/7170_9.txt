Blade is not your average Disney stuff- it's really, really fun, even for adults who tend to crawl on the artificial, focus group intended "for the whole family" that the studio uncle Walt that issues as human action . Perhaps the secret of the success of this film in his fidelity to the original book, a little darker than your average kid things. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to the camp boys, where all prisoners are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form rehibilitation. But as the story progresses, the story of Stanley becomes intertwined with the legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney film of all-boy's camp has the right to be. Jon Voight is particularly abhorrent and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver as beautiful as always.
