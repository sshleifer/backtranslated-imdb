Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors that I liked. I love just about each of the shorts, which they did. I love all six Stooges (Curl, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts fun, as well as the star of many other great actors and actresses, which many of them many of the shorts! On my view Three Stooges some of the greatest actors of all time, and the team is constantly funny comedy! <br /> <br /> This is a good Three Stooges short. It's funny and it cast includes Kristin McIntyre, Simon Boniface, Gina Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore LORCH, Lynton Brent, Jude Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Hein Conklin and Bess Flowers. Marionettes have performed very well in this short! I recommend this!
