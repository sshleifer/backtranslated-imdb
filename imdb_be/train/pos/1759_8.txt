I'm not quite sure if the term "serious comedy" refers to this film, Im not even sure that it can be applied. In the last few years of comedy films have become filled with theater, who are too stupid to even make us smile. So I think the films that do not fill these requirements as a "serious comedy." <br /> <br /> Suitable whether 40-year-old virgin in the guild? That is, finally, to you, but in my opinion, this is a very funny movie. You get to laugh a lot, plus it provides a social commentary in a few really great characters and situations. <br /> <br /> I really have more than one 40-year-old virgin there and even those people who do not exactly conform to this specification, can feel identified with one of the characters in the film, especially the men. <br /> <br /> the story, as the name says, it is about Andy, shy, silent guy who collects figurines, watches Survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band Asia. <br /> <br /> When Andy employee in SmartTech. He believes that a psychopath Andy, Andy's a secret not revealed. Unless explicitly sexual pervert, but he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre. <br /> <br /> David hot guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, which escaped with another guy, and Jay, a man in a relationship that seems to be dependent on its continuous acts of deception and will fall. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the majority of young people between 13 and 21 have already watched this movie, but it actually has no restrictions on age, to be able to enjoy it. Thus, if you have not seen it and enjoy laughter with social commentary than to go to the video store and take a break from the deep and harassed independent films. <br /> <br /> It also includes a DVD-bonuses that you will really see the top down.
