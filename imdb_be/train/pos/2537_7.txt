Boris and Bel well together in this film, whether they are against each other, or the same row boat.I saw this in 1972, and has just bought it from the border this year. At this time, watching it with my children, I have taken note of 2 things: He held the attention of 3, 4 and 5 years; and I caught a few things that I did not when I first saw it.Very quick story with an unpredictable ending. Required for movie lovers !!!
