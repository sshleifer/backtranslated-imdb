As someone who has lived with cerebral palsey for more than forty years, I consider this film to be inspirational. If someone with such a severe case of CP Christy Brown can do so much, then there is no reason that I could not achieve their own dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker both give strange performances. <br /> <br />
