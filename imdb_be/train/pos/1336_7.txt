This is generally a good movie with a good story, great actors and great songs. Cinematography, unfortunately, bad. One of the weaknesses of the film is annoying chain sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Is it an attempt to hurt originality, Abbas? Mustan? ? Does anyone <br /> <br /> The film is about a young, Raj and took (Salman - Rani). Adopted can not get pregnant after the accident she had during a previous pregnancy, and they finally decided to use a surrogate mother who will carry their child. They choose Madhubala, vulgar prostitute, played by Preity Zinta. The film is not very realistic, I mean, is not it easier to take? And even if they choose a Woman, this means that a person has to sleep with her? Have you heard of insemination? Anyway, I think if the writers had heard it all, the film would not have been made, so the concept is probably intentional. <br /> <br /> Salman works very well. Nice to see that he is playing a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love for his wife, and how much he finds her to sleep with another woman. Well, it's cheesy and unrealistic. Rani just about OK; It is usually effective, and does not try to do something with the role, but gets completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to, moreover, that steals the show in a big way, with its superb performance. It makes the transition from loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally. She lives the film, and makes emote you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of its role, in part because of its magnetic and positive personality. This is one of the best performances of her career. There is no doubt that she is more talented than her contemporaries industry. She should just do more of these roles. <br /> <br /> The film that ends only reinforces what I said above. This tear-jerking, exciting and very well acted. While watching it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the film! 10/10 - for though!
