Originally conceived as a solo vehicle for Dudley Moore, "not only ... but also" I saw his ex-'Beyond fringe "co-author Peter Cook guest on the first show, and as it was received controller B-2 has insisted that he will be on it every week since. They were classic comedy team - Cook was tall, handsome and witty, while Dudley was short, charismatic and musically gifted. The sketch, which brought the house down was their pub, wear flat caps and mufflers, fantasizing about movie stars such as Jane Russell and Greta Garbo. He remains one of the most hilarious parodies of all time, and even when cookies corpses he is still holding up well <br /> <br /> These characters -. Idiot Pete and even more idiot cotton rags - has found its way into every episode of the show itself, seen in a different location such as a zoo or an art gallery. In the latter case, they munched sandwiches while discussing art. "This is Leonardo da Vinci's cartoon ... I do not see a joke!" Says ext. Pete shows that, when it was first introduced, he probably had people in fits. Additional almost chokes on his meal. "Do you really use these sandwiches!" Announced by LIBS Cook. The pair bounced their humor from each other in such a way that it was joyful to behold. The sketches themselves set new standards for comedy standards, which do not correspond to the «Monty Python» arrival. <br /> <br /> As the popularity of the show grew up as a guest star. Peter Sellers, for example, and John Lennon, the latter representing the removed item based on the poem "The Blind Ted, Danoota, & Me». "One leg is too small" - was a Dud as "George Spigott» (the name later reused in "Blinded"), the one-legged man, who jumps at the office of Cook producer to audition for the role of "Tarzan". Cook tries to let him down as best as he can. "I have nothing against your right foot!", He says. "The trouble is - neither you» <br /> <br /> Dud would interview about the eccentric Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling (Cook), who, if he did not teach the crows fly under water, was planning on opening . a restaurant called "The Frog & Peach. Another classic was" Jump Nuns "(also reused in" Blinded "). But my favorite has to be« Superthunderstingcar », wickedly funny (and accurate) parody of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's" Thunderbirds " . Pete and additional playing all the roles with the latter, do pick up "The Lady Penelope." "Ludwig" was Ludwig van Beethoven, as the star of «This is Tom Jones" style variety show. "Bargen Immortal" was a parody of a documentary film about the life of a hermit movie star "Emma Bargo In an unforgettable moment it was passing through London, roaring through a loudhailer:.« I want to be alone »<br /> <br /> The peculiarity of season 3 was" Poets Cornered " with the likes of Ronnie Barker, Spike Milligan. Barry Humphries, Willie Rushton and other Gunge suspended above the tank. Each of them had to improvise a poem line, and who are not able to make it rhyme hit the unpleasant things. <br /> <br /> three seasons have been made in all performed (at different times), Joe McGrath, Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilb EPT. Sadly, very few publications survive. To top it off, the scripts were destroyed as well. I can not believe that this situation was allowed to happen. <br /> <br /> The show ended in 1970. The comic then hit Broadway, made infamous tape " Derek & Clive », but growing alcoholism Cook broke them apart, eight years later, Cook announced that a new series was in the near future, but it turned out to be wishful thinking on his part. His former partner, makes films in America, and had no intention of again (not at the time anyway) is working with Cook. <br /> <br /> Enough frames were scraped on the BBC-2 season repetitions in the early 90s. As expected, some items are not picked up, as well as others. Cook died in 1995, and by the tribute B.B.C put together a program made up of various interviews «Parkinson» and «Not only ... but also" show. It ended, and accordingly with Pete and additional find themselves in heaven. "Bloody hell!" Exclaimed one. Moore gave in 2002.
