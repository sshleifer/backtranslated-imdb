You know? Our spirit is based on the revolution, she was asleep ... I can explain, I think !! Well ... until it happened April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we did not have freedom of speech, but when we got him in the back, it seems that the Portuguese people have lost their minds, we do not use our freedom of speech! This is all a consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear! ... About the film ... I think it has some errors on the actions of a character, but the way I use to watch in the Portuguese cinema is very good !! I like it very much!
