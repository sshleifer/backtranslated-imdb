Science Pentagon team seems improved serum that is invisible, but when the lead researcher is trying it on himself, he can not reverse the process. Frustrated and drunk with power, he turns into a psychotic classical tradition Wells. <br /> <br /> This is awful gloating Invisible story comes with an appetite for all tastefully Verhoeven and Bacon as a genius-turned- loonytoon-maniac. As with most of the work Verhoeven is a terrific irrepressible feeling Boy's-Own a comic adventure (a secret underground laboratory, where scientists are working just fine) in conjunction with the most horrific and perverse visual (women in their underwear while groped and attacked invisible villain, animals beaten to death literally gallons of blood and massacre in the last two reels). Although the story does not ring a new twist on an old idea that CG special effects Scott E. Anderson poppingly eyes shining, as we see, vein and artery, the cardiovascular system, muscles, tissue, bone, and flesh is literally appear out not scratch. In particular, the sequence where the team bring back gorilla with an invisible state, and scenes in which Bacon tone Devane in the pool is absolutely breathtaking in detail and fiction effects. The film also has an excellent soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and the classic horror movie pictures of Jost VAK. The young cast is largely overshadowed by the technical pedigree of the film, but both Shue and Dickens clearly from their depth. It's great fun bad movie.
