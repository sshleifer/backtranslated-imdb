This film is incredibly realistic, and I feel great doing justice crime that many people do not understand, because of the lack of experience. Many people who think that they could understand what was going on in his head arrogant victims. As a victim, I feel that Dawson did a fantastic job in her role in May. I agree that it is incredibly brave film. It looks at the rape of another, more realistic point of view than any other film I've ever seen on the subject. End made delayed a bit long, but I know that many of the victims have imagined this kind of justice, because the chances of an attacker sent to prison for a crime is about 1%. It's good to see the film that sticks closer to reality than most dare.
