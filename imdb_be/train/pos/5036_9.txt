Bill Paxton, Aliens, Near Dark, and Terminator fame, I'm surprised he made his debut as a director for Frailty. He hits on all cylinders, but there is one incredibly close to the end, which includes the FBI agent (Powers Boothe), which contains a point from this otherwise frightening and thoughtful thriller. In addition, the film was very good. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays a dad. He never gave a name, but it is not a weakness of the film. It actually enhances the film that allows the viewer to see it as some kind of some kind of symbol. He has a vision of one day, he says that he was sent from God, telling him that the world is coming to an end, and he and his two sons Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Sumpter) shall be fined demons and kill them , Demons look like normal people, they kill, and it makes the viewer think, when my father had just lost his mind, or is he really doing the work of god. There are scenes that reflect the two points, which adds to the confusion and gives the film more uncertainty. <br /> <br /> The story is told in the memoirs of one of the sons, who are now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) and speaks with an FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe), who is very skeptical and rightly so. In the end, it's not every day that someone comes to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of twists and Bill Paxton directs great, keeping us guessing, without losing interest. Incredible act. Two young conductors and Paxton work well together, looking like a normal family, even if they are involved in the murder. As I said, there is one involving improbable character Powers Boothe, but in fact it is not a great thing. It was a very well made film with faith and family.
