Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors, and I was worried about it making the film the children, because I would not want to see him depart from his movies that I loved: Visitor Q, Gozu, fine arts, Ichi the killer and Black Socioty Trilogy. Lately, he seems to be exploring new territory, and I think he's following. Nevertheless, it was the first of his films that I've seen him take this direction, so I was excited. With rough, I bought it without seeing it, and was glad that I did. <br /> <br /> Great Yokai War movie perfect children and adults should like it too. The entire movie reminded me of so many movies that I loved as a child: The Neverending Story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, etc. I enjoyed those movies, because they do not treat children like they are stupid, and this one is not like the dark, which is the basis of morality is, but it's also as silly as any children's film should be. I personally did not bother CGI and prosthetics. I feel that they are good and I do not think that children will notice. <br /> <br /> If you are a die hard fan of Takashi Miike, you may not like this. However, I propose to give him a chance. This proves that Miike is as diverse and talented as I suspect that it is. He also continues to make his films signatures Miike outside these units, which is very encouraging. <br /> <br /> For those who are new to Takashi Miike and want something light heart or dramatic as this, I think these other movies Miike: «Zebraman» «Happiness» «Katakuris Sabu" and "bird People in China. <br /> <br /> Good work by Takashi Miike! 8-10 star.
