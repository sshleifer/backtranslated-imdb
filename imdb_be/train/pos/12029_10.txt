I like this movie. Twisted Desire Jeremy Jordan was one of my favorites and one of the cutest actors ever. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I've seen most of his films, but Jeremy Jordan. I do not like the thing Twisted Desire, where "Nick" arrest and "Jennifer" rat him. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first is The Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
