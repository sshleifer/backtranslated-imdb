This is definitely one of my fav time Trek episodes. There's just so much going on in this one film, that he was crazy cool. At first, the guys beam down on an alien planet is about to explode. They are found in the quaint librarian type dude (played very well). Kirk manages to then himself transported back to the fact that is very similar to Earth of the 16th century. Mack Spki and try to stick to, but instead almost freeze to the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years in the past. Kirk manages to get himself locked and accused of witchcraft, and Spock uses a time rampage sexual cavegirl, who was defeated in this icy, terrible world some bad guys. <br /> <br /> Spock decides HPP happy where HES on McCoy and gives royal whuppin 'Turkey is needed if the document stipulates that they must find a way out. Anyway, they finally move away, leaving the poor behind cavegirl. It takes a ton of credibility before Spock finally gives up and leaves. You can literally taste of sorrow in the end. And it's really touching cavegirl leaving her alone in the frozen wasteland just seems tough. Spock had with his vulkin 'mind to leave his greatest hope for love and to be a man. Albeit, in a not very nice area! <br /> <br /> In any case, you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode .... love story of the witches of Salem, Spock as a man, the desperation to remain in complete isolation ... abandoned, and three completely different settings on an alien planet. Its amazing they managed to jam it all into one fifty-minute film. This is another classic, do not miss it .... I want it on DVD fer Shure Vulcans !!!!!!
