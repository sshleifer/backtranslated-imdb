I approached this movie with low expectations, but was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done, and it beats hands down the ballroom dance films of recent years, especially «Strictly Ballroom». While the music is good and colorful dances, for me the film is not about dancing. We are talking about the Japanese institution that gives a man a long-serving switched to work and free time after work to have fun that do not involve their families. Here we have a man with a full family and a big mortgage and stubborn love of life. He refers to an attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio, it passes during his commute, and this leads him to try ballroom dancing. In addition, Japanese is the fact that indecent motives, initiated by his new passion to make a simple, but once accepted, at least in the end, the family and the audience. Drinking ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, of course, not western, but discipline and the music is clearly a cultural import in Japan. Cultural contrasts therefore intriguing. Even without the cultural insights, color, dance and enthusiasm of the players all make it a fun movie to watch.
