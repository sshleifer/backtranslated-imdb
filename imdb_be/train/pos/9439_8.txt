Before watching this movie, I have heard a lot about him and some of the scenes in the film, but did not listen to it for me, so I planned to watch it and wow! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds make for an interesting group of people who are obsessed with canoing down the river and Cahulawassee unsuccessful series of events that transpire on all of them. Character development takes some time in wrapping a better understanding of each person's audience, but in the end, you know, these guys, they were your friend. Action, dialogue is very, very real, as close to reality as you can get for Hollywood to act. Reynolds character "Lewis" was interesting as a man who comes off very hard, but in the masculine veneer is very soft and broken man (I was impressed with his work!) Jon Voight, seems a landmark that will focus on the most, unfortunate circumstances, which seem to find it on every corner exact shape and caste it to another person, in the end (his character transition was fine). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really seem as silly lunkheads, who just love to joke and do not seem to get too terribly seriously, if they are not too much, and they are ... I was really struck by the vision of the director Boorman Dickey novel, very impressed. You can not go all your life, do not watch this movie. I give him eight out of ten stars, very impressed.
