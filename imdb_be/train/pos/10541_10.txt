I thought it was a strange film. Leitmotif sweet! :) Anyway, the only thing that bothered me more was in the beginning, when all should be fine. It was very strange and unreal. Most cable company basically what I'm saying. In addition, the film was very creative. I think that all the action was well done, the actors played their characters face completely. All are in good agreement with each other. It really is a shame that they do not track it. That would be great! Because it's a Canadian film, and because it's one of my favorites, I give this movie 10 out of 10!
