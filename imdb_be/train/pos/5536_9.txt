I actually really enjoyed this show. Even in my youth I was interested in all sports, and that included horse races. It will always be difficult to make a series based on the race of corruption and at the same time to receive permission from the race track to record the filming of this controversial topic. One episode I remember, in particular, around the horse is expected to win the big race, which looked a bit of color. The syringe was found on the floor of a stable and everyone thought that he was under the influence of drugs, but nothing showed in blood tests. Too late they realized that the horse hadnt been doped but had his knee cartilage. How does a car engine without oil and jamming, the horse broke down, with tragic consequences.
