The only reason why I wanted it to be because Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the film was incredibly average. It's not bad, but it really is not very good. Editing is good; the film is well developed. Direction is competent and confident. The history of perseverance. Central film acted by Ledger, Bloom, and usually large Watts and Rush. Accents tight, if you are from the US, so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as I like to call it, Orlando Bloom). By the end of the movie, I was neither sad nor moved. Some people ask what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the film. I must say, I did not care for that matter. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only reason I can recommend this Orlando Bloom View, shows some hints range (although oft- real "I am very confused and" view visible), so the fans may find it to be the price matinee. In addition to this, just do not see it. It is neither good enough nor bad enough to be interesting.
