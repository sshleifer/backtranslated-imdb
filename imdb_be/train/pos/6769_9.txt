I watched this show when I was a little girl. Although I do not remember it, I must say that it was a very good show. Also, I do not think I've seen every episode. However, if you ask me, it was still a good show. I vaguely remember the song. Everything was perfectly cast, costume design was great. Performances were top grade, too. I just hope that some network brings the series back one day, so I'll be able to see every episode. Before we wrap this up, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, although I do not think I've seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if and when this show is ever the gateway to the air, I hope you catch him the whole day before it leaves the air forever.
