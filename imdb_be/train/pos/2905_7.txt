This is a very funny film, just to see what entertains you almost all the time. Work and director known type of humor is his trademark. The film is a typical police partners history as a weapon of death, but the joke and comedy are Argentine native. The twist is that one of them is a psychologist plays Peretti and should go with the detective Diaz (played by Luke) on their tasks while it also help him (Diaz is concerned, because his wife cheated on him). Some of the funny dialogues in the world: it is clear and funny anywhere. This is very good in general, it would be deserved 8, but I rated 7, because it gets a bit down at the end. On a personal basis, I must add that this "bravo" for the Argentine filmmakers, given a little good fit lately.
