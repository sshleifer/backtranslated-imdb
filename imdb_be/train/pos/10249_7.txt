This is the first of a series Guinea Pig, and is one of the most notorious films of the collection. <br /> <br /> It took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films. I bought a Guinea Pig Box Set and decided to see the collection in order of release date. So I popped the suction cup and sat down. <br /> <br /> From what I read on the Internet, and knowing the content involved in this film, I was expecting to test their nerves in full force. It ultimately is not the case. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of people who kidnapped a woman and begin to torture her in the hope of finding a man tipping, and how long a person can endure the pain. <br /> <br /> It seems that one patient Flick right? Wrong. The film may not come as a shock. This may be because I have become insensitive over the years do to my obsession with horror, but I think we can say with certainty that any true gorehound could sit through it with ease. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, an person who has no knowledge of such a film is likely to be overloaded and disgust images that they see on the screen. Although it failed to shock me, the film contains some pretty average evil and graphic scenes of violence. Including breaking with nails, intestine, thrown into the unconscious woman and a needle through the eye. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that for most gorehounds on this board that you just have to get your hands on a copy of the film for the novelty of it, but I believe that for any new comers to this type of films, you have to work your way up to it.
