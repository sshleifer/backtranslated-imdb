Set during World War II, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun fantasy adventure for children, starring Angela Lansbury as an apprentice witch who, with three children and evacuees "Professor witchcraft", breaks the Nazi invasion. <br /> <br /> Brilliantly inventive, with loads of laughter, this film will please the child of all ages with its large characters, a fascinating history and memorable melodies. Lansbury is ideal as Rosehip, in not quite perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime, and her three young employees stars (Cindy o'Callaghan, Roy and Ian SNART Veyhill) are just as impressive as cockney villains that help in the fight against the return of the Huns. <br /> <br /> special effects are somewhat outdated, but let's face it, kids do not care too much about these things, so long as they have fun. And entertained, they will. With some impressive scenes that are brilliantly mixed live action and animation to great effect, and the more of this magical movie than a hundred of Harry Potter, it would be hard not to enjoy this beautiful piece of cinematic escapism. In fact, only a fairly extended musical number set in Portobello Road mars the perfection of the film, but so much more to enjoy, which can easily be forgiven. <br /> <br /> And, in addition, any film starring British TV legend Bruce Forsyth as the «Flash» Spiv Harry style guarantee a good rating from me.
