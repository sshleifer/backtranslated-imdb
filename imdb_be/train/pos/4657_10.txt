Hot Millions are great film in all respects. Fun, unusual story with great performances of four of the best professionals ever work in the business. Peter Ustinov is brilliant, as usual, and Maggie Smith --- definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time --- it's a total joy. Karl Malden and Newhart complete throwing and also perfect. If you want a movie that has a perfect casting, this is it. What is so impressive how these people work with each other in such a natural and easy way to create lots of laughter and fun moments throughout. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a great sense of humor, and this is one of his most memorable performances. Direction, photography and editing of the first speed as well, and this is a great time capsule of London in the 60th years. It is definitely on my permanent list of favorites.
