I've never seen Richard Thomas plays the bad guy. I was not sure I would like it that way. And I was not sure if he can pull it off. But it struck me. He shivers down your spine and made me take a closer look at the people outside. The film is an exciting and fast paced. Bruce Davison convincing, but all he can really play a good guy. Real talent here, Thomas. The ending was a little awkward, but maybe it is, real people will fight ... If you're a fan of Thomas, you should see it here, at its best to be bad!
