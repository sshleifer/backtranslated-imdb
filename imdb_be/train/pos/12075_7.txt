Foch insists that "My name is Julia Ross" in this 1945 film noir also starring Dame May witty and George Macready. This is a brief, and because this film suffers. He could have stood, I had a good fifteen minutes to half an hour longer. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up, Fok was a fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, the wife of a cheating husband, a nervous wreck. She became one of the great teachers working in Los Angeles. Here she is quite young ingenue played a major role. Julie responds to an ad for a secretary and immediately hired Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know - even though we know immediately. - that employment agent is a front created to get the right woman for the job, a woman without a family and without a boyfriend <br /> <br /> It is a living -in situations; when Julia enters the house, she was under the influence of drugs, and when she wakes up, she said she was Mrs. Hughes, and not allowed to leave. <br /> <br /> To act very well. Low budget, but still entertaining - some things, in particular, in the end, there will be too fast, so I said that the film is too short. Nevertheless, I recommend it.
