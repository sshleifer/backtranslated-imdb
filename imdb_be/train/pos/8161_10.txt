When I saw the dentist, I thought it was very cool. But this film is not for everyone, especially people who do not like the bloody scene as the dentist has a lot of bloody scenes. That's why it has this rating of R18. We are talking about Beverly Hills dentist Dr. Alan Feinstone, who finds his wife cheating on him with Brooke PoolMan. It is best to go to the dentist, "before" you see it. But if you do not like going to the dentist already, it is best not to look at it, you can put off going for a lifetime. dentist has better massacre in it that I have ever seen. Who have seen the film, which has a dentist (Spoiler) to pull out all his teeth cheating wife and cut her tongue, without anesthesia? In general, a strange film, but not for all.
