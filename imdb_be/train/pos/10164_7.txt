This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to watch the chicken Flick, and some as finished with it. I never heard about it or anyone in it (excpet Mike with your friends). <br /> <br /> But this is great! Eva Lake and Paul give amazing performances. Humor is constantly dry and witty. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd largely acts as a microphone from his friends (which works great). The other characters are stereotypes and formulaic plot (I mean, we do not say "Apocalypse Now" here) but cute characters, the story is engaging, soundtrack, production and direction of all works well. <br /> <br /> In all a great sense of good film that really deserves much more credit than it receives. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own tastes, but I really do not see one star reviews for this.
