A number of factors make it easy for me to say that I still believe this is the most important science fiction movie ever made, in spite of some actions, outdated dialogue, etc. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the scale representations when describing Krell, a humanoid race native to the planet, and now all dead, who were 1 million years more advanced than people of the Earth (USA), and their technology, in particular 8000 cubic miles of the machine. <br /> <br /> Second, there is music and sound effects, which are inseparable from each other. This creates a terrible, unearthly feeling, as opposed to "2001", which had a traditional classical music. <br /> <br /> Third, his "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadly ever imagined, it is also based on real science and not to violate the laws of physics and biology. <br /> <br /> And finally, most importantly, Forbidden Planet is the only film ever made that attempt and, more incredibly, it is possible to make an honest, clever and ruthlessly logical statement of the limits of the ceiling or a person (or any other biological entity) development, no matter how long we survive as a species. <br /> <br /> In other words, he predicted our inevitable fate.
