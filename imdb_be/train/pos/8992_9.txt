Really cool flick. A must for any music snob. You really do not know about the groups to enjoy the movie. For the film, I just heard only two songs from the Dandy Warhols. The only thing that is required is an open mind. <br /> <br /> the movie centers around the Brian Jonestown Massacre. The Dandy Warhols plays a role in the film as a "rival group", but they are second fiddle to BJM. The Dandy Warhols plays such a big role in the film, as I originally suspected, but then again, they do not have an element of risk and unpredictability BJM.You can not help but be fascinated by the group and its very charismatic frontman Anton Newcombe. In itself, this insightful film and study the music industry. Just watch this movie and enjoy.
