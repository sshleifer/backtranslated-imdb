Great concept, great throw, and what a pity that there was no more time to flesh out the story. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis, and Laine, now have a real woman! Nevertheless, Dench and her character alone was enough material to run the script on some of his lesser moments. I have it on tape and will continue to monitor it, in the hope that there is a key at the end, which suggests that there will be a sequel. <br /> <br /> The top drawer! - No Question! - No argument <br /> <br />!
