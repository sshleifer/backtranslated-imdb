This film answers the question, how can the relationship survive if your girlfriend is codependent, clinging, needy, jealous .. and has the strength and ability far beyond those of mortal men? <br /> <br /> Or, without spoiling the film, I can safely assure you that, but there are a lot of fun to be had along the way. Uma Thurman is ideal for both mercury super-heroine, the uber-baby, mysteriously called G-Girl, which, unlike most of her sisterhood, Sun * always * devoted to truth, justice and the American way. <br /> <br /> Thurman as believable as well Daft, but somehow still flirtatious, curator Jenny. When it falls on the less endowed, but more emotionally secure and well-tuned enemy, G-Girl goes ballistic, and what is not. It's funny, but it is not very .. <br /> <br /> This beautiful room, hell does not fit of rage as a super-heroine neglected, and those who are engaged in is not quite bear, but it does have its moments, and I I think that I will get a DVD. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie ..
