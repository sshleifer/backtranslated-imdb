Most likely, you will think that this film is incredibly stupid the first time you see it. But if, by chance, you see this is the second and third and fourth and fifth time (I am well in to hundreds of now), you'll be spitting lines from it here and there, and cracking yourself! My friends and I actually threw Fear of a Black Hat parties to get more of our friends "as they say, down with the riots."
