The first time I saw the blood of the Samurai at the premiere during the International Festival Hawaii Film. WOW! Blood just blew us away with sheer passion, blood, vitality, gore, excitement, gore, full campiness, and even more blood, and all in such great FUN! Especially for those of you who love these chambara Japanese samurai and ninja movies, you definitely need to see blood!
