Jörg Buttgereit goes a little too far with his films and themes at times, even for my taste, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They skillfully made, often with a deeper sense of his subject. This film is an excellent example of its operation. <br /> <br /> It is also very difficult to label this film. It's actually not a film with a history to it, in a way that has a beginning, middle and end of it. He also does not have the main character, but instead focuses on the 7 different suicides and homicides, in 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All the different stories say with a lot of class, although some of them, of course, the more "interesting" and realistic than others. They are not necessarily linked, yet together they still tell the story. The film does not feel disjointed at all. All stories have a different feel to it and Buttgereit tells the story without any words will hardly (also characteristic of his style), but instead allows images and explicit sensual emotions the characters tell the whole story. This helps to make this film an effective one to watch. <br /> <br /> Again, the production values ​​are all not too high, and it can be something that may scare some people. This, however, makes for this particular film to set the right tone and atmosphere for the film, and his dark, anxious and depressive themes. <br /> <br /> The film, Buttgereit, I "enjoyed" watching. <br /> <br /> 7/10
