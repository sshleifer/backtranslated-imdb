I did not expect much from this film. I got a ticket for an advanced screening. I just got off work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in line at the movie for 40 minutes, and did not seem to be any cold air flowing through the corridors of the theater complex. <br /> <br /> After sitting in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the flow of the movie was perfect. From the beginning, I became obsessed with the film, it becomes more and more excited by the minute passing. I think this film is destined to be a fantasy / fairy tale classic. The actors were incredible, the pace was perfect, and the ending was magical.
