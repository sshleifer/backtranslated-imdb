I have this wonderful program about 4 seasons and since then I have seen all the episodes have all the episodes on DVD and is getting better and better with the seasons 9 and 10. Now may not be the Richard Dean Anderson, but now the addition of Ben Browder and Claude Black, he still gave the show more strength and more original, even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately, at the present time, the sci-fi channel rid of this amazing show, without relay hopes for 11 seasons have to make two straight to DVD movie and hopefully more. Atlantis is still going strong at its 4 seasons. And there is a third branch in the work of Stargate franchise is not dead. It's a TV show a must see for all fans of science fiction and the genres of people because it has such a wide variety of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people to watch it !!!!! 10/10
