Perhaps one of the most important and pleasant Greek films I've seen in the last ten years..Excellent performances (especially Yannis zouganelis large), a well-written script and the effective direction of a very special, very average for the Greek level, the film director. The film clearly influenced by Sam Peckinpah in Straw Dogs, which could be a masterpiece, if you avoid some of the obvious and exaggerate situations and symbolization in the end. Nevertheless, this is a film that deserves our attention, and belongs to that rare category of Greek films that you need to look outside of Greece. It's a shame it does not work in Greece on a commercial basis, in addition to other counterfeit and runaway large-scale production like Cousin policy ..
