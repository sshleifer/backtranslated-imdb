Of course, it was a remake of the 70s movie, but it was unknown and the action of this film, for example, breakdown. It works, desperate to be with his wife was hospitalized, police have the least concern. The chase was very good, with part of it be <br /> <br /> driven at a rest stop was well done, the end of the film was a great culmination. It's better than Bullitt, boring film so that the muscle car chase, which was filmed bad? character Vigo knew that he had to do to avoid Johnny Law, several films have effects, night vision devices, CB radio is good, I forgot the name of the movie, the guy 76'Caddy souped up Man toy he's upset. The ending is great, you can not tell when he fakes his suicide or not, very well done-it-done-it or not.
