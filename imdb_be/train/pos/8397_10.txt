The film earned ten votes each, which I gave him! Thank you guys for making a movie worth watching. You have shown the world, you can write, direct, produce and star in a movie with no black negative stereotypes. Poetry was strange as well, hats off to poets and musicians. <br /> <br /> I watched it last night when I fell in love with my darling again. I'll add it to your collection of movies today, and recommend it to friends and family. <br /> <br /> Please continue to produce quality, do not worry about the number .... <br /> <br /> Thank you again and best wishes and bless you!
