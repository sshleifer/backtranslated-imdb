Hell, I've seen this film, at least 4 times now and I still do not get tired of watching. <br /> <br /> The visual is so good, and along with the music, which is totally awesome and perfect this film is a fitting stunning to me. <br /> <br /> CGIs IMHO pretty bad, but the whole video with black and white sense of it and completely sterile interiors just ... a genius perfect combination for such a film. In general, the feeling of an indescribable feeling, the story so well. <br /> <br /> However, although the film was a little flaws, such as I sometimes thought that the film was too "slow", but I do not mean a picturesque part of it, I totally loved them . <br /> <br /> Also, I was distracted very often quite complex history, for example, if it is in an underground bunker as a thing digicorps, where all of their data, and has this conversation with a guy down there .. . but it can also just be me: D and the end could be in some way reflected a clearer, they had to make getting-back true memory-part a little longer and "louder", but then again, not all of these shortcomings, the film would have been so good I would never have stopped to watch it again and again ..
