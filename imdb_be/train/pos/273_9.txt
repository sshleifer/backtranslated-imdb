It's hard for me to criticize everything Mitzi Kapture does. She just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and a phenomenal actress. Despite this, yes, the plot was predictable. I think, perhaps, when Jill had slept with Richard, he could have done it a little crazier than he already was, which would have added more uncertainty. It would also be good to see Jill and her husband learns of Richard's little problems with his ex-wife, maybe a little more back story. I was a little disappointed with the end of the film. I would like to see more of the closure with the death of Zack and possibly closing with her husband. I must say, even though I'll never be able to look at the pistol and not a picture, it's worth it. It was a fitting end for Richard. Of course, Mitzi Shook! I look forward to her future projects.
