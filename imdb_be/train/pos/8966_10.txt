this is a great movie, making 1950 looks pretty stylish. Kim Novak is intriguing and convincing as a modern witch with one foot in Manhattan, and others in infinity. All performances are terrific support from Jack Lemmon, her bother Nicky Ernie Kovacs as a writer of magic in Mexico, which works on magic Manghattan, to Elsa Lanchester as the slightly batty, and Witchy Aunt Queenie. And then there is the cat- I have no idea how many witches (except me) named Pyewacket cat but to offer a million. Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but only in the same way as his character from the p ace in this strange world south of magic and witchcraft. Perfect. And it is the perfect romantic happy ending, which is, in our opinion, so films of this vintage have the happy ending. Gillian and Shep will definitely have a better chance to be happy ever after Rose and Charlie Allnut in African Queen (another great film)
