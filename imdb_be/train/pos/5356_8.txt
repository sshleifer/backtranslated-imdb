Running Man is not a great film, really it is a kind of silly. But it delivers what you want in Arnie movie, and the action and entertainment. I do not see how anyone could not enjoy this picture, it is so silly and over the top, that almost makes fun of himself. By the way, this is probably one of the most Quotable Arnie films there.
