I thought it was really good for the first episode of the first series. It was very fun, and I thought that the actors brilliantly. I think it is a crime for those who say it was bad, because it looked at the right time. I find it really annoying when people say that it was not historically correct, since it must be Saturday night entertainment show not a boring history documentary, so I think the costumes and settings were exactly. Brilliant start and I will love what happens next !! I spoke with many people in my school, and they love the show! we all think it's brilliant fun and have a great story to go with it.
