Summary: It's business as usual in LOUCHE casinos in Tangier. Casinos are going to close and prepare for a major transaction for the next day. Louche owner and some staff left for the night, leaving modesty in charge. Suddenly a detachment of armed thugs to storm the casino, shooting wildly. Unknown modesty, they had already killed LOUCHE, and now after the money hidden in the safe. But none of those present, and is still alive, the casino does not know the code to open the vault. Self storage strongly booby trapped with explosives, so that attackers can not blow the door, as planned. Modesty suddenly finds himself alone with gangsters leader Miklos in the roulette game of their lives are in danger <br /> <br /> Note :. This is a review written without regard what so ever to other published media reports Blaise modesty, as I have never seen nor read any of it. The first thing I wanted to do something that is a little wrongly classified. First of all, I thought it was a thriller with a battle of wits between modesty and Miklos as the main plot. Of course, there are some bursts of action, but they are not really an integral and important part of history. <br /> <br /> As we have already mentioned the main plot and the main suspense filled scenes is a game between modesty and Miklos. It is an innovative and intriguing way to identify the background of the character, and thus much of the story takes place outside of the casino much earlier time. Someone said it was almost like a pilot for a TV series, and the feeling that it really can be used as such. But I felt it was much better to enter a character than many others did. I was in no way disappointed in inaction, and I enjoyed this game, the history of a lot more than just a thriller. <br /> <br /> I think that the two main stars, Alexander stage and Nikolaj Coaster-Valdano ~ d done very well. Stage especially Modesty reflects very well and actually carries this belief and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
