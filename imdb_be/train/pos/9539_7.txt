For fans of the genre of cyberpunk Troma or mixed with a small amount of blood shed then this movie is for you! There is a good amount of blood spilled within the boundaries of the film, as well as the effects can be spectacular and strange. The plot is funny and refreshing, is not confined to the fact that we, as the audience expectant of films of those days. <br /> <br /> It is also characterized by small aliens, which I found cute. Overall, this is a good movie for the fans of the genre. Also recommended films such as Tetsuo: The Iron Man and Versus for this amazing Japanese approach of the film, filled with a great uncertainty and bloodshed. Of course, after seeing this movie, you should have knowledge of two.
