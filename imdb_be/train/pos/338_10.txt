I saw this film at the International Film Festival documentary Amsterdam and had the honor to meet as a director and Tobias Shnibaumom, all of which are lively and open a New Yorker. The name of the film in Amsterdam was to keep the river to your right, making a sensational aspect of cannibalism a little less noticeable. No less important was the love - and gay - Tobias Shnibaum relations were with members of the group, he studied as an anthropologist. His reunion for nearly 80 years and the inevitable farewells were very moving. I can only highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian.
