High energy Raoul Walsh classic from 1933, Plantation provides salon owner and operator of Wallace Biryu against the eternal rival and dandy, George Raft, adopted homeless Jackie Cooper and elegant Faye Ray in roles which are played in their very competitive. It is not clear exactly what the competition is all about, but all come to him in the daily tabloids. A lot of jokes in the beginning, but the characters to soften as the film progresses. In addition, there is an obvious wealth of scenes Beery in the cabin. Different characters, sexy chorus line, a lot of drinking, a perfect creation den of iniquity is not too abstained from the so-called limits to the code, and then come to Carrie Nations, led by the very Carrie Nation. All of this creates a very vivid picture of life that is long gone. I do not like to compare age, but this film is entirely different from anything that could be seen today. The film has a lot of heart and a long-lost innocence and absolutlely must see.
