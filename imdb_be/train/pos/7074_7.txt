Terry Gilliam went back to the future (it has already done so in "Brazil"), to tell this story about a virus that destroys the human race. <br /> <br /> The script is completely crazy a few simple tricks on it but it's pretty interesting and Gill proves that he has an idea (futuristic scene just wonderful). As for the actors Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and beautiful (what happened to her ??) only in the order, but Brad Pitt is so annoying when he plays the role of which are out of his hand, he achieved results forced and he can not be trusted in all. He just needs to play good-looking successful young people <br /> <br /> * My rating :. 7/10
