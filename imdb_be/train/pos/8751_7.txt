Two enterprising teenagers, best friends, take a trip to Thailand for the last experience before separating and going to college. It looks like a fun time touring an exotic land, until they meet an attractive stranger who lures them into taking a trip to Hong Kong and puts drugs in his luggage. They get arrested by local police and believe that justice in Asia is very different from the US Justice <br /> <br /> This is a storyline for "Brokedown Palace", and it was good. The film does a decent job of drawing arbitrary and corrupt justice system in third world countries. In fact, the picture was quite mild, as prison conditions are often much worse than shown. It serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our system of justice, it is untouched compared to most of the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were too many contrived situations in the film that complicated history. All of this escape attempt was a fake fantasy. To think that friends can forward the money for a bribe to a prison in a soft bra, and did not find the guards who systematically checking all imported from visitors suggests that either the guards or the audience recite sheep. <br /> <br /> history also does not bring closure to the painful question of how the drugs got into (Claire Danes) Alice backpack. Did she actually agreed to transport drugs? One can only guess. It was intriguing to be guessing about the girls' innocence throughout the film, but we finish the film never knowing when one or both of the girls could be guilty. for this significant flaws addition, the ending was excellent, and the results are unexpected. <br /> <br /> To act on Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale were very tough and well done. The Danes, who had been resold and more bloated, actually arrived as an actor in this movie. Although its image was often immature (her character), it has improved as the film progressed, and circumstances became sadder. Beckinsale, as opposed to flying under the radar all of his short career and bright as goody-two-shoes, which suddenly finds himself in prison. It was the best job in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman has been the role of the lawyer was charged with an error. His controversial and uncertain style is an advantage in such films as "While You Were Sleeping", but as a lawyer in a third world country in the crusade to free the two innocent girls from injustice, he had the wrong person. <br /> <br /> look a tourist in Thailand, it was interesting, but it does not make me want to go there. <br /> <br /> as a whole, an entertaining film made implausible in part by inserting some funny scenes. I gave it a 7/10.
