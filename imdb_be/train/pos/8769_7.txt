Gentleman Jim is another legend print case with Errol Flynn played the legendary boxer as heartburn, but charismatic climber in reckless fun that almost stopped breathing. It's pointless looking at the historical accuracy here as Flynn in charge of the Light Brigade - this is an obvious deception with all the stops pulled out, taken a surprisingly generous scale and give a real sense of energy bright direction of Raoul Walsh. Flynn still in his prime (you'll never guess that he had suffered a mild heart attack during production), Alexis Smith, a beautiful romantic sparring partner and eternal sidekick Alan Hale along for good measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes Sidekick debt at this time). In fact, even a pirate galleon early Flynn movie makes some of the ridiculous cameo portal battle! In the 103rd time by the wind.
