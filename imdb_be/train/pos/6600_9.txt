I'll keep this review short and sweet .... <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer for this and thought I would give it a whirl 5 minutes and my first thoughts were "what the hell is this?" But 10 minutes later I was hooked, and after 20 years I was collecting my jaw from the floor. this film is an excellent example of how different the film may be, and besides, it's the French. this film is high art eye candy, wrapped in a neat package futuristic noir film, motion capture is very smart and black-and-white animation style, which does not have the color gray, the CEC the first did not do it for me completely captured me, and thus the end of the film, and I found myself wanting to each film was made, how it is. I think that my opinion has helped lots of dubbing would be very easy to destroy it, if they had not landed so many respected actors, as many voice actors do not give any sense of the characters (Just watch any legend movie Hong Kong in English, to see a fine example), I gave it a 9, even though I gave him an extra 2 due to how fresh and new it all feels ....
