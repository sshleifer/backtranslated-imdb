Not the most successful television project John Cleese ever made, "Strange Case" takes the form of the first draft, which was brought into production before any changes can be made. There are some silly ideas around, and even a few smart, but history in general, unfortunately, does not add much. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe whistle, though, as Dr. Watson, a bionic bits and all. "Lord."
