Initially, I came across seven minutes Linda Feferman in heaven, when I was 14 and worked in a video store, and I loved it. I recently watched the movie again and realized it was a lost treasure. The movie star Jennifer Connelly, almost twenty years before she would go on to win the Oscar for Beautiful Mind, as well as Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays her best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is definitely softer, sweeter and softer version of Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful in the 1980s, and that is why it is so good. It really does not make as these films, and parents will enjoy watching this movie with children there. <br /> <br /> When the Pope Natalie away from home on a business trip, Jeff convinces her that he has to move because his home life sucks. With the support of Natalie, Polly, played exquisitely Maddie Corman, she lets him. But this film is not about putting children in situations and seeing what they can get away with. Three wires so natural, and the script, amazingly so honest, that's what comes across best in their speeches in the heart breaking. These characters really care about each other. This is a great film to show the children that reach up to adolescence adolescents. <br /> <br />
