I am very surprised that no one reviewer so far not commented on the rather elementary mistake in the chess game Puddle as white against an unnamed opponent just before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as a consultant on a chess expert, Puddle shown winning the game against illicit traffic. In between cuts, and soon back to the board is not difficult to see that after the combination Puddle culminating in the sacrifice of a queen, rook on d1 has pinned black rook on c1 against their king in a corner on h1. Thus, he can not play the course pairing movement RD1-d8, which would be illegal - but he showed by doing so, to the enthusiastic applause of the audience.
