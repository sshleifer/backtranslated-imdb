I was compelled to write a review for Space Cobra, he got a good grade 7.3 stars, but only a few of the reviews at the time of writing this I was particularly positive. A strange situation, and I hope that my positive review will show people so old and mostly forgotten anime film. Space Cobra funky story about a rogue smuggler and involved with three sisters and old dead planet and the evil force that wants to use the powers of the planets. This is an old film and animation shows, but what it lacks in finesse it makes modern with lots of charm. Space Cobra is very strongly oriented to the western audience and is very easy to observe. There are few, if any references to a specific Japanese culture and is great for beginners anime to watch and enjoy. Space Cobra himself witty and likeable. I can not say whether this is due to the English dubbing or manufacturer's intention, but it is one of the few Japanese comedy characters, which I find really funny. The style is very sixtieth Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack Yello. Style colorful and creative, and have a permanent effect, to move the story forward. A surprising aspect of this film, as it starts off as a comedy and ends on a very pessimistic note dramatic. I can not think of another anime or total film, which has been able to do that so easily and convincingly. You just realize that this is happening, but it is done so subtly, and it seems quite natural. You also really feel that the characters went on a trip, and they changed the life of the whole experience. Check if you can.
