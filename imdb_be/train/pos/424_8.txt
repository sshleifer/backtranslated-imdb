I love this movie, because I grew up around racing. Pat Boone for droshky reminds me of my father, which was drawn up on the lines, because, unlike the thoroughbred jockeys, people of normal height and weight can be drivers. <br /> <br /> Since 1944 Home in Indiana best film, but it is also very different films. April Love is light and easy to see, feel good film. (Disappointing though religious / moral views that Pat Boone forbade him ever kissed a girl! Quite a change from today's standard rate.) Home in Indiana with Walter Brennan (shot in black and white with no hint that anyone ever sang ) captures the stress and fight better, thus making the final achievement of a suit, but it requires a lot of emotional investment.
