This is an interesting little movie made in 1967, with a cool jazz soundtrack-sounding music and a story that will make you laugh ... OK, it's not really stupid, but it's fun cheese. I saw a lot of similarities between this and "being with Blue HandsÂ» (AKA The Bloody Dead) and they have the same director! Scotland Yard is investigating the murder of the most beautiful young women in college. It seems that criminals are currently available from the local prison to do the bidding of the evil man, and then returned when their work. There's a nifty device hidden within the Bible that injects hydrogen cyanide, and there is another device that is neither sophisticated nor underground, it looks like a big water gun and the victim should be pretty close soaked up the deadline. Joachim Fuchsberger plays Inspector, and it is mainly chewing gum and looking into the distance. There's a "monk" and as someone who identifies this thing as "Monk" for me, it carries a whip and dressed in a red suit with a red hood, more than one member of the clan of a different color than the monk. There's all kinds of bizarre devices, such as a fireplace hearth, which goes up and down, to admit a monk, and moves directly over the fire, without installing it robe lit, neat trick right there. This is a wonderful combo crime drama with stupid overtones, and although it is a bit silly sometimes funny to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
