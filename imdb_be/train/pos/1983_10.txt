I saw it recently on cable channel. great movie; this is one of the few musicals that I've seen, does not shy away from the light and the darkness. It reflects the splendor of the age along with a lot of poverty. Some of the dance sequences isolated so happens, I do not know where to look next. One day I'll go and see it on the big screen, just so that I can see what's going on. But what really elevates it to the next level is the performance of Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. Not only that, it means carefully and threatening people, but there is something else, some inner demons. He gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner, he was capable of anything. It was almost as if the character Sykes was on the verge of madness, just waiting for the trigger. I saw Robert Newton Bill Sykes' 1948 film, and I thought that it was "just" a bad egg, but the performance of Oliver Reed intimidated me in my own living room.
