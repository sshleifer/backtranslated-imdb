I do not expect that this film will be well understood by the audience from Romania. It says something, of course, the cost of, or perhaps due to the absence of the film flexibility, but also says something about how different stories and even the lives of ordinary people was in Romania, compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe . <br /> <br /> The film is an adaptation of the novel before Marina, controversial novelist who died during communist rule shortly after the book was published. It tells the story of an intellectual, a professor of philosophy, whose life is crushed after he imprisoned on false charges at the end of the Stalin era. Basically the first part of the film tells about the struggle for survival in prison, the other describes it estimated to rebuild their lives after release. His release is really only apparent, Romania 60 asks different types of trade-offs and crime, yet his struggle for survival in tough mentally, like a prison. <br /> <br /> The film is superbly acted by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache, who plays the lead role will be in another time and another place, the mega-star, we can get here a good idea of ​​his fabulous acting art. Although suffering from uncertainty and the fall of the story sometimes irrelevant details or the nature of the comics, the movie still is a milestone for Romanian cinema, as well as for the process of restoration of moral and historical values ​​of the Romanian society.
