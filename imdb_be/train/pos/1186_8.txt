A lot of talk was made about the "psychological westerns," but this is one of those few who are really in this genre. It has a great name stars that perform very well, but it's the director who makes it such a good movie. Stewart Granger loses his British safari hunter stereotype play emaciated retirement buffalo hunter who regarded in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays the upstart (unlike ordinary young upstart character Taylor is the average age, too), who wants to kill the buffalo, and attracts Granger in business with him. They hire two other major actors name, Lloyd Nolan and Tamblyn, in the life of their Skinners. Granger pursuing buffalo he killed him, knowing that he may be at fault if they die, knowing that they are extinct, the Indian way of life will suffer. Taylor soon finds sadistic side, but it is a realistic saidism, in contrast to the one-dimensional sadists modern film created by botanists and Dorks. He is dangerous, and needs human interaction. However, he will not stop killing. The final two holes facing each other, with an output. Psychological consequences of what they do well drawn.
