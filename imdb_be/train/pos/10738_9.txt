SPOILERS 9/11 very good and very realistic documentary about the attack on the French WTC.2 filmmakers who are in New York in the movie action NYFD currently faced with this event and make the most of it.Before 9/11 nothing special in fact it occurs that gives the film more terror, like a script. On the day of the attack, it seems just another dull day at work, but it quickly change.As filmmakers one goes on the road with the fire, which takes the first plane to crash, this is only the frames first strike. he rides with firefighters at the World Trade Center and extends inside the second plane crashes building.As people understand that this is not accident.In the next period of time, we see fire plans to save as many people as possible, as much as possible at this time we hear crackling sounds, the sounds of people, who jumped down from the tower and fall to the ground, it is the most grueling time in documentary.Then tower collapses, and our French friend has to run for your life, you hear him breathing like crazy when it runs out of building.Then huge explosion type sand storms on d it, and the screen is black, he was very lucky to survive, and now he can shoot the empty streets of New York City. Because this film has received so many historical frame and because the film was ment to be something completely different, this documentary is likely to remain in the general memory.I seen attacks live, because I was in the afternoon, so that it does it even more realistic look. 10/10
