You sit for half an hour and see the story, believing that all of this, and then another half an hour to watch the same scene unraveling completely ... and then put back together again. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting feature films at the International Film Festival in San Francisco is a documentary. I do not know - except for Andrew Jarecki in "Capturing the Friedmans" - "Results of the $ Lee" there's never been anything like Anna Broynouski in He has rebuked, protects, reveals all about Norma Khouri questions, the author of «Honor Lost,» acclaimed and criticized the 2001 best-selling book about honor killings in Jordan. <br /> <br /> What is incredible, and that makes the film so exceptional that it is "impact" on Khoury made with full participation in Khoury. <br /> <br /> For the initial part of the film, Khoury is a story of alleged honor killing of one of its Oman, the history books. It sounds plausible to convince. <br /> <br /> Then, her story is dismantled, exposed, at an extremely believable and convincing people, such as women's rights activists in Jordan, a researcher there and in Australia, where he lived for a while Khoury. <br /> <br /> Khoury returns and denies the charges, taking the test successful lie detector in the process. There is another segment of the devastating effects - should not be shown here because it would reduce the shock value ... and then Khoury returns and faces charges (not all, but the main ones in the book) <br. /> <br /> Houdini act and continues every round in this heavyweight, swings a prize fight, surprise after surprise - and no "happy ending" in the sense of resolution. Brilliant.
