And that someone is me. And not just for me, as I can see here IMDb or when leaving the theater. Why do people love it? It is obvious: The whole course, zombies are now (at least Horror supporters of the heart and the other through the "Dawn of the Dead" or redefining the Resident Evil movies, etc.) <br /> <br /> Or, at least, they thought they knew everything about zombies ... that is, until this film does not appear. And you'll see zombies in a new light (possibly). This is not a horror film, although it contains some scenes of violence, but it is a comedy. Satire, to be exact. And he never runs out of steam! That is why I have rated it very highly. Going wise it is incredible, great acting and the script has no (obvious) mistakes ... quite the contrary: It is a gem and if you are just a little bit interested in a zombie you have to see it! And even if you do not like them, look! Because it is large (comedy) movie!
