The film takes place in a small Swedish town, where everyone knows each other. Here Mia visiting her parents at a birthday party of her father, who sometimes there is always some kind of tragedy, the only question that it will be this year, and you'll be surprised ... This is a very well-made film with a story that has the perfect humor balance and seriousness, which is rare. You are happy, you get hurt, and basically everything in between. Finally, you can not help falling in love with Mia (if you're a boy, I believe (main actress)) It is very well chosen actress, like many other actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
