Even without saying a word, Billy Connelly great zombie ... Carrie-Anne Moss as "Mom"? Even better. Zombie friends? <br /> <br /> «... My father thied eat me ... I've never tried to eat Temi.» <br /> <br /> And I thought: Dawn of the Dead is good. It's kind of like an airplane encounters (meat?) Night of the Living Dead, which is sponsored by Zomcom .. <br /> <br /> And do not forget my coffin head <br /> <br /> And Fido in the Aloha shirt is just way to perfect! <br /> <br /> And so, social commentary are just too many to even begin to comment. <br /> <br /> Sufice say it all really works!
