It was surprisingly funny comedy with a large cast. John Ritter and Saga were perfectly cast as the parents and the kids were great. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice to play Bridget, who was a sort of toned-down version of the Kelly Bundy from Married with Children. Letters and speeches were both first class. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, John Ritter died during the series, and put a damper on things. They had to fight to change the show and bring more actors, and it was obviously uncomfortable situation, but they coped well. James Garner was a nice addition. It might take longer than was Ritter lived. <br /> <br /> I especially loved when they brought in Ed O'Neill in a guest spot. It was great. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
