This is one of the films Dev Anand, who has given even greater premium films in Hindi film industry, such as Jewel Thief and guidance. Story short (if you ask me, it's the story), the plot is simple-minded brother is looking for his lost sister. Sister joined the hippies who smoke with pot and chant Hare Rama Hare Krishna. Nevertheless, the film reflects a number of important events that the world has experienced in 70's.Hippie culture, their subjection to the drugs, freedom, fly debt, family, and introducing anything new, such as the east (which was new to the white ) religion. They were treated well. Zeenat gave her best and Dev, as usual, was great. Compositions are best used (as opposed to having them abused for the sake of songs) in this film. They were not spoiled.One perfect example is Â«Dekho of deewano ... Ram ka Naam badnam bark on." Each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end of a tragic, but it is not the essence of the film. Overall Devji who believe in making different films were successful, showing that he wanted to show here. We must see to experience the hippie culture and beautiful Nepal 70s.
