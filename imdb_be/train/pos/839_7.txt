Think of Pierce Brosnan, and you think, polite, neat, clever James Bond. In this film, Brosnan plays against type - and there's a lot of fun doing so (as does the audience). This film is about a hired killer who befriends exhausted businessman ... and it works! <br /> <br /> This is an interesting film, with a very good scene (riveting, edge-to Brosnan and well, corresponds to the "OffÂ» -The edge Kinnear has some good lines). My only niggle that Hope Davis, playing on so tolerant wife ( "May I see your arms") I do not are most: it could be a marvelous foil for these people <br /> <br. /> This film is like a matador he plays with the audience, while the "go for the kill." The ending is surprising, since the story line (with positive morals!) Arises: this is a crazy, crazy and funny movie that really deserves a wide audience.
