I take part in a symposium filmmaker, and the film was shown after we have seen not just a great film and participate in 40 minutes of discussion. Even though it was incredibly late and we were tired, all the audience really liked it. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought the movie was fun in all the right places, and I loved the quirky characters. They really grow on you in the movie.
