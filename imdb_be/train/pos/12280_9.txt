This is one of the few films that I saw twice in the theater. I love this film for its atmosphere and telling about the life of tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes a lot of mistakes, but gets a chance at redemption. Is not it enough comforting thought <br /> <br /> When I watched it for the first time, I thought that after winning the election, the film will be finished? - I do not know the book. So the boy I was wrong, when the dramatic climax is yet to come! I was literally swept away by the strength of the last half-hour of the film. <br /> <br /> A lot of people here do not like this movie. I can not understand that one bit. Perhaps those who read this book first is - as is often with adaptations of novels - just disappointed that so many things that were unspeakable, invisible, inexplicable. But, as the film tells the moving story - a family history of the growth and the fall of man, deep sympathy to the women, the power of love and madness of hatred (and conservative) - this film is just great! In addition, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is excellent as well -. Especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons <br /> <br /> So what is certainly one of those movies that cinema was invented for!
