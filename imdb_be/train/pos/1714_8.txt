Watching the film, I was in a very light mood, and this film is a lightweight, but at the end of the film simply unexpected that leaves lasting memories in mind. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Abhay and his profession to be a witness at the marriage registrar. Saha comes to marriage and his boyfriend does not, leaving one plow to the street, she can not go home, and she did not have any thing to live here, in this situation is Abahy assistant for her, is the basis of history. <br /> <br /> The rest is just watchable and the end of the history of bitter sweet that Abhay has to face that keeps you on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> dialogues and music lyrics OK good direction and good as the script you feel that the film is slow, but looking at the history of the demand it's all right. <br /> <br /> really watchable especially with a light mood, I enjoyed it at home with coke and peanuts. My rating for this 8/10
