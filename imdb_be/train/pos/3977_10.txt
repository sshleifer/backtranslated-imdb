I personally watched it to see footage from the 60s and 70s. It was very interesting to see as essentially a movement of drugs and became a pop-culture and ultimately uncompromising force in life.

I loved him with all segments of 60's-date. I highly recommend it to all aspects, including rock music, hipper movement, policies and good "Alla history. Checking noted that the box it contains spoiler, only because I have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this respect, as I have discussed the fact that in all 4 segments, so just wanted to be safe.
