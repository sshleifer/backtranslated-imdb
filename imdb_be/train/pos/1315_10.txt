I saw this film in more than a few times on TV. I always watch it again ... NEVER turning the channel. This film is full of scary surprises and absolutely ribs with his anxiety seats, without being overbearing or foolish. Talent Helen Hunt perfectly illustrated in this film! I recommend this movie to anyone !!!
