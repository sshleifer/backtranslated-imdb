It's very funny and sometimes very scary anthology that if a little less in the scenic department, more than compensates for the deficiency in the current, place of work and the general abundance. The best episodes this is the first of Denholm Elliot plays a horror novelist was wandering character of his novel in the works (the perfect example of an operation to pull it out of a pedestrian); the third, with Christopher Lee as a man scared of his own daughter and the last episode of the late great John Pertwee as the pompous star of the horror film, which gets more than just a new role in his new project. Conversation Between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt sparkling and inspiring as obviously relishing the opportunity to exact his HAM! Cushing's is usually good in the weakest segment, which is certainly not helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he is obsessed down in the local wax museum, is nothing but "beautiful", as we have said, to believe that it is! It needed someone shocking beauty and instead we gave a woman with jaw turtle. Minor quibbles aside, this movie is great Field house one to catch, if you can.
