Okay, I'm sorry, but I loved this movie. I just love all the 80 genre films of this kind, because you do not see many like this anymore! I want to ask all of you people who say that this film is just a rip-off or imitation cheese that is an imitation? I've never seen another movie like this, well, I do not fear in any way. <br /> <br /> Basically it about a popular group at school, who love to all sorts of living hell, so they decided to choose this nerdy boy named Marty. It is fatal if it does suffer from one of their little pranks. <br /> <br /> So, it is 10 years later, and a group of friends who are ill Marty start getting letters middle school reunion. But ... they are the ones who receive them! Thus, they go back to the old school, and one-on-one shot down on ....... Yes, you probably know what's going on! <br /> <br /> The only part that disappointed me was the very end. It could be done, or thought better. <br /> <br /> I think you should give it a try, and try not to be critical! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ ~ CupidGrl * ~
