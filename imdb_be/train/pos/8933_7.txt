Claire Denis has shown that the film is not repeatedly need to tell a story that is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make them what they are. <br /> <br /> As if the idea as part of most nonlinear film is an elderly man living on the Franco-Swiss border, a man devoted to his dog, who still has a lover, but whose cardiac status are increasingly threatened his life . He has a son from a small family, which is rare with him, but when he discovers that he needs a heart transplant, he chooses going to Tahiti via Japan to receive a heart transplant on the black market and revive long-lost relationship with his son it was formed Tahitian women years ago. <br /> <br /> What is Denis doing this outline of the story used his camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the vastness of nature, human interaction with humans against animals, etc. Most of the time "film" does not make sense, but that's because we try too hard to connect all the points set out in front of us in the beautiful photos. Life is like this: we look, we see, to observe, to integrate the process and make of it what we will <br /> <br /> If you are using this form of filmmaking (as she did in a surprisingly beautiful "Nice work.") Claire Denis developed a technique signatures. Regardless of whether or not the viewer is ready to reward the product has a lot to do with our individual methods of processing of visual and conceptual information. This is an interesting and visually interesting film, but many viewers will find it too long talking about very little. Perhaps look again to change. grady Harp
