I love this movie! Animation is large (for Pokemon movie), OIG look so strange. I love the music in the film. So they kept cool Japanese music <br /> <br /> As for the story :. Her big. She has a great sense of friendship. Celebi is a very nice and powerful pok√©mon. Ash really great in this film, and I like his friendship with Sam. The only thing I did not like the appearance of Suicune, he just suddenly pops up and helps Ash & co a bit and leaves. They could do a role in the film a little more. <br /> <br /> But on the whole, an amazing film! I can not wait to have the US version on DVD!
