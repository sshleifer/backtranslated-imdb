I thought this movie was amazing graphics that made me confused and my cousin, who was watching this with me.to tell the truth, I think that the younger Kevin Dillon was hot.hahahaha ... but I also thought that she was stupid enough to go along with the police, and it was wrong, that he said to her before he died, "I was inside you" .And I think that's what she gets for what she did to him, and how he was going to say her that she was too young, if he never cared how old were.?now other girls I do not think I could trust myself in cop as that.but tell the truth it was quite obvious that it was his, even if he wanted to become a cop, I would still be suspicious of his or way.and that was funny when it is sprayed in his eyes store.hahahahaha.she still silly to go back to the warehouse on their own, and so was a policeman who died HELLO !! he called back-up.sometimes these films makes me mad when people act stupid and do stupid things.but is that I think that the idea of ​​the film.
