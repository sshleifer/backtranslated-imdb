The Secret of Kells is one of the most unique, beautiful, and podveski- popping animated films I have ever seen. Before watching this movie, I was sure that he could not give up a run for their money, and that it was shoo in to win in this category, but I've found in Kells serious contender. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kells tell the story of a young orphan named Brendan who lives with his uncle, Abbot Kelly. The abbot likes a watchman, but perhaps a little too hard and much more concerned with strengthening walls around the city from the impending Viking attack than he the boy's upbringing imagination. If the legendary Brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly like Willie Nelson) shows up and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan goes on a journey into the forest and meets a beautiful forest nymph named Aisling, who takes a liking to him (and saves his life more than one time). With the help of Aisling, he is trying to save the city and help Brother Aidan complete the mystical book that ?? Legend has it ?? It may darken in light. <br /> <br /> See my full review of The Secret of Kells at: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of- kells.html
