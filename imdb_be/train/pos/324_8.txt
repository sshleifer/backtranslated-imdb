I did not expect to like this movie as much as I did. I got it just because I saw him in the list of Top 25 most controversial films of all time. It did not look particularly great. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most elaborately drawn films of recent memory. <br /> <br /> This is about twenty-year-old woman wants to know everything. It retains every bit of information that it collects in a huge archive. She is experimenting with experience in sex, political activity and human relations. Meanwhile, the film's team will show the creation of the film and we see their reaction to the story and to each other. Nudity, sex is obvious, and ambiguous policies have kept the film to run in the US, and his capture of Customs has been appealed. The film is a story yet it is a documentary that shows us behind-the scene of filmmakers the world during the story, the fourth wall was broken. This film is the most direct way possible to make a film that I have ever seen. The film basically works like a time capsule of 1960s psychedelic habits, freedom of fire and sexual liberation. I like to think of it as much more than that. <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to spend my time with a blue version of this film, but I really really. This film is a treasure. Give it a try.
