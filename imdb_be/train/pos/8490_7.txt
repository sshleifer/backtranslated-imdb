I recently saw this film in my International Business Class. I have nothing else, then another sad documentary (not to say that I do not like a documentary I just drove hard with films in this class) Imagine my surprise when this film is that the film actually did not expect, went. <br /> <br /> This film will tell all about the cultural differences in the workplace and how they should work together to get anywhere. Clash of cultures shows how different the world and just how differently we perceive ourselves, until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call. I highly recommend this film for anyone in business or who simply want to laugh, because yes, it is funny. <br /> <br /> Well, that's about it! cheers
