I came across this movie on cable and was totally hooked. History Group surfers who ride the big waves, waves that awful huge waves that would any reasonable person to flee in fear there is one that manages to be exciting and make you understand why people spend their lives in pursuit of the wave. There's nothing special about the film, except that brings together some very interesting people who love each other so that they do, and allows them to speak. Of course, there are scenes with their surfing, but what makes this film so special people. Here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do, what to pass on the people watching. Half way into the movie you want to go and learn to surf as well. Several documentaries have ever managed to Covey passion that these people have the ability and the films that make us feel that makes this a great film. Look.
