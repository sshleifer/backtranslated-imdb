I researched this film a bit and found a web site that claims it was actually a joke about the world after World War II Greenwich Village gay men and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, witches imagined that an alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten, who wrote the play, perhaps, cheerful and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought it was stupid, because I first saw Bell, book and candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade because my parents took me. It was hard to get me to a movie that does not include the horse, guns, or the alien monster, and I planned to boredom. But I remember a time when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the upper part of the Flatiron building and threw his hat to the side, the camera followed him flying to the ground. George Dunning how beautiful love theme soared, I suddenly got the feeling that he felt he would fall in love. The first shoots of romantic / sexual love has left me stunned, as I left the theater. I am sure that I not only to adolescent boys who seduced strange, direct gaze Kim Novak. It's ironic that gay parable was able to push heterosexual puberty in so many of us. I'm in my late 50s now and again watched the movie last night, and the same feelings are mixed, as I watched the hat to land fifty years later. ,,
