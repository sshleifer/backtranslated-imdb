Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of the ACC without the British accent, he more than makes up for it with his over-the-top, and larger-than-life interpretation of Scrooge. <br /> <br /> is particularly effective when it is faced with Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the film. Scott stands in front of a large window, the sunlight casts a glowing robe over him; All that you can see his silhouette. Impairs the voice of Scott, with ponderous roar, galvanizing effect ... as well as the first scene Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. "The horror," really! <br /> <br /> However, as they say, the same thing works for you can also work against you. As Scott shows a gleeful rage throughout the film, it proves contagious. In other words, the "before" Scrooge nearly as charismatic as the "after", although he really should not be. This is what you could call "Dr. Smith" effect, as Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach to the game, the role of many other heavyweights (as well as stage and screen). <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not consider fighting fury Scott liabilities. But other purists «Christmas Carol» can. See the movie and judge for yourself.
