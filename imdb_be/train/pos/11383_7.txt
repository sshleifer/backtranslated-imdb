This beautiful piece of music with an infinite score one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice atmosphere "Parise", which gives the film a lot of charm, but from the point of view of history .. Well it does not really exist. Or at least not very well designed. Action is also not as smooth Caron. But I liked some of the dialogues, I liked the scene on the Seine, I liked the character played by Levant, color; ., And dance, it is known that completely beautiful <br /> <br /> 7,5 - 8, seems to point to me.
