this film was almost a great creative film. A mixture of Shakespeare, pop, jazz and faerie tales. This film was a creative twist on the Cinderella theme. Featuring a strong cast, headed by Kathleen Turner completely reject, this movie had everything going for him. All but the production values. I almost never think the film needs special effects or big budgets, but with a top production like this, he went out with the same quality as the battered every made for TV movies. In addition to the best film, the film was nearly perfect. <br /> <br />
