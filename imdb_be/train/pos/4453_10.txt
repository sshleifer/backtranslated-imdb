I really think I need to do their job and have every (or horror and cult) film lover to go and see this movie ... <br /> <br /> I did! <br /> <br /> It is -Excellent: very atmospheric and anxious and scared ... <br /> <br /> Incridible, they could make such a precious stone of the film with a very low (Read- Â«! no ") - the budget they had .... <br /> <br /> Summary taken from the site: "One morning, the old wanders into the forest in search of his runaway cat instead he finds a child without parents and murder without a corpse ...". <br /> <br /> This site (IMDb) NO trailer, but I leave here a link to the website of the film, where there is a trailer, which is quite disturbing, so please go and check it out. .. <br /> <br /> www.softfordigging.com
