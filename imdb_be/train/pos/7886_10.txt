Well, I'm a supporter of the Nightmare series, and everyone says here that this is the worst! But it is NOT !!! Is not this what you saw Freddy's Revenge ??? WTF! This was the worst !!! Now this film is pretty decent and it sticks to the story of Freddie, and it's great that he has a daughter, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> And then I found out that it was in 3-D !!! I was so excited, I remember when I saw him on the set of the DVD case, I immediately passed to the 3-D sequences. Quite a few were in 3-D, though, as Lisa Zanes hand, Dream Demon Freddy Claw (more than once), Leslie Dean holding a knife, Lisa Zane with a baseball bat, hands Doc Freddie's head explode. <br /> <br /> I really loved this film, because it was in 3-D, but I want the whole movie was in 3-D is not only the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Along the way he is not 15 minutes TEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
