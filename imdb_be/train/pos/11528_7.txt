I saw a lady with red hair back when she appeared, and I do not remember, such as pets. The truth is that, despite its basis in real history, its screen play and incredibly stupid. The real merit of the cast of the picture. Constellation some of the best support players in the 30s and 40s to make the background for a gentle, intelligent work is always underestimated, Miriam Hopkins, and a great, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best thing that the picture . Which actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in good company Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps the lady with the red hair contains his best work in film. Watch and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
