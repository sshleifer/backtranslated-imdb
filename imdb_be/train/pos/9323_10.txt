For me, this film was powerful. I do not want to be a spoiler, but I had a friend years ago; We were like brothers. This movie brought back some vivid memories. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I could not put the voice for the film, which would have been 10. I keep getting a message like "No voices were not placed. ... "And yet I have seen in the statistics, what it was there. Will try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> minor flaws I missed. It is the relationship between the characters, that got me. Beautifully acted and real situations. I was in several of them. <br /> <br /> A small gem of the film. Just as the "Spring Forward" another stone overlooked. I am very pleased that these films as they are still being made; about the relationship between people, well written, sensitively unfolded with first-class acting and direction. In the end, it's not what it's all about?
