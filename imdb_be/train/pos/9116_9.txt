The idea is very cleverly named the film has a serious tongue in cheek feel to it. But it's so thin, you do not know how to read it! Are these guys do a full-blown comedy or something else is going on. Little dialogue the film has a very thin, and it adds to the film's power. When the entire sound has been removed from the film, he does not really take anything away from the film. Physical acts or display art is so strong that it alone carries the fullness of history. <br /> <br /> I have the blessing and the blessing of emotion should be ashamed. I'm the first to say this film as part of the "black" film festival. After watching the film, I was so impressed with the work. But then I asked myself, what's next? Where someone will see this job? General association Art Without goals should not be found here. You can see the intention of the design from the beginning to the end. Using African music style, differences seem planned and for a reason. Character development is strange. Casting I think this is the strongest aspect of the film; characters easily determined during 2 minutes 6 minutes of the actual film. <br /> <br /> We need to see more of these kinds of films, there really should be more support for the development of short films on all boards.
