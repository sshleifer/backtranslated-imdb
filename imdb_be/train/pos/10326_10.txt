We speak so often a movie milestone - Kane, The Godfather, bout de souffle. One film, but too often forgotten "serious" critics. I'm talking, of course, the classic Doc Savage (M.o.B.) <br /> <br /> This film is not only interesting, but also seriously explores the problem of exploitation of the developing countries, US imperialism. Not to mention the kung fu. <br /> <br /> He also did not have the greatest soundtrack in movie history (until of course the exciting work at the Queen Flash Gordon). Although a bit unusual, this film is well worth a look for - he will repay your efforts to find ten times.
