first television special Barbra Streisand was just fantastic! From her parody, like a child to her medley of songs in high fashions department store - was all first class! It was easy to understand how this special won awards. <br /> <br /> I do not confuse down the appearance of guests, the focus remains on Barbra all though out of production.
