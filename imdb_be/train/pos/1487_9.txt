«Casomai» masterful tale that tells the story of a young couple who wade through the murky waters of marriage. The story is very plausible to tell the strange swings between forgetfulness and continuous interference from the other, which is quite typical in Italy (one might wonder whether such incidents are different elsewhere, though). Pavignano D'Alatri and were very good at writing, and this is one of the strengths of the film. Acting Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo sober and exciting. And the figure of the priest's pretty funny and well-rounded. In general, really deserves a movie is probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
