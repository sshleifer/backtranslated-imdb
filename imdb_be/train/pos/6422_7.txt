Military training videos have become so common that they have become a genre in itself. Among the most famous we have, 'Officer and a Gentleman "` Top Gun »,« GI Jane «teper` and Men of Honor." The fact that this one happened to be true, does not change the fact that the formula is the same. This film is probably most closely resembles `GI Jane», because it is focused on desegregation angle. <br /> <br /> The story is actually quite inspired, and probably the best human interest story among those mentioned above. Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is undoubtedly a man of great courage and integrity, and his strength of character shines through clearly in this film. Unfortunately, director George Tillman has tunnel vision in mind characters and shy character development other than in favor of Brashear Brashear display in a constant state of misery of different signs. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a central figure, and for the initial scenes, fights and a couple of scenes with his wife, except we have a lot of it I do not know. For example, Brashear see scars on his hands on Sunday, and we have to assume that he was working the plow, but there is no follow-up on this issue. Mr. Papp (Hal Holbrook) received only one short scene, by which we can judge him. The rest of the screen shows the time of his walk and speech. If the director is going to make an interest-free human history, he needs signs of humanization. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an excellent performance as Brashear. This is perhaps the best I've seen him. It is the role and character, which is much more complete than any part he played before, and he rises to the occasion. In `Jerry Maguire," Rod Tidwell were magical, but the one-dimensional character with deep puddles of rain. Brashear is much more complex and well-founded, as well as the issues he faced in life crises, making it part of a much bigger challenge. This is a great way out of the latter role in Gooding `Chill Factor", the film is so horrible that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take part. <br /> <br /> After a stay to try his hand as a comedian (Analyze This `` The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, "" Meet the Parents), Robert De Niro returned to his roots with dramatically superior performance. DeNiro is not a bad comedian, he's just such a great dramatic actor, it seems that he does not have to waste your time doing comedy. DeNiro sacrifices Billy Sunday with a rock-hard party refuting tortured soul. It's fun watching him work. <br /> <br /> It seems like every movie I see lately is Charlize Theron in it. I saw `Legend of Bagger Vance« `Man of Honor 'and` Yards directly in line, and I began to wonder if she had a role in every film in 2000 (in fact, it only took five). It was a minor role Theron, but she carried it well and was able to stay with Deniro step by step. David Keith, who co-starred with Richard Gere in 'An Officer and a Gentleman ", has a cameo here <br /> <br /> DVD has some nice features, including a reflection of the real Brashear and some deleted scenes. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this film, despite the hackneyed plot and one-dimensional presentation. I appreciated it on 7/10. I youngsters for the losers of stories and I have a love of history, where the power of nature is the central theme. This film is particularly strong in both areas, and brings us two memorable acting performances, which offset some of the shortcomings of the director.
