I'm 14, so you're probably thinking that I had never heard Matthau George Burns or whether someone like that. Boy you're wrong. I heard that George Burns was in this film, and he won the Academy Award for it. I was a supporter of George Burns, since I was ten. I saw the movie Oh God recently and loved it. This one was very strange. George Burns did a great job. Just Matthau (this is the first time I saw his performance). And even if they were really small roles, Phyllis dealers and Steve Allen he did a good job. This particular shot they would be strange if it was really done. Let me say this, if you are a fan of George Burns and Matthau, you should see this movie now!
