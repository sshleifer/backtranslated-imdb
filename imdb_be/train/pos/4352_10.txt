I looked through the list of movies in my area on Yahoo and see the film, which was not advertised. I looked closer and saw that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser was in it. Looking «Mad about you", once, I was not a fan of Paul Reiser. However, I'm a big fan of Peter Falk. Thus, my husband and I ventured. We both have been involved in this story. Beautiful scenery, heart action and a sense of family and moral values, which are rarely seen in the movies and the modern world. Not that emoted juicy stuff, and real-life situations of real life people. I even have to say, Paul Reiser was very rich, but I still will not look «Mad about you." I do not know where this film is gone. I heard he was raised in a limited edition. It stands together with the world. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. M.
