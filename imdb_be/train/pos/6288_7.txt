Gone in 60 seconds / (2000) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> «Gone in 60 Seconds" is energetic, clever, stylish pattern of action with a high-octane star power and a lot of amazing looking cars If you are a viewer is interested in cars of this production, producer Jerry Bruckheimer ( «Con Air», «The Rock»), is worth a look just to admire the shiny cars. Although the film secrete stench of weakness in many areas, its exact sense of action and excitement make it successful enough to ride in the summer buzz. <br /> <br /> film stars Giovanni Ribisi ( "The Mod Team") as a young swindler named Kip Raines, who, as the film opens, is not able to deliver a long list of expensive cars to powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). If life Kip is under threat due to such as its big brother, Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but a skilled car thief, is designed to perform a task in exchange for the survival of his brother's steel fifty cars, called the model, color year and do in four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis allocates the first three days of gangsters set the team to help him pull off a robbery. The crew includes Sarah «Sway» Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy yet rough retired car swindler knowing Memphis through the previous business, a man named Mirror Man (TJ Cross), aging and common Otto Halliwell (Robert Duvall) and massager ( Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott), and Donnie Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> The participation in the film drive and tension podagovor involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect from previous experience that the Memphis and his crew to Niya. good and keep an extra close eye on them <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development here; the audience learns of these people, even though their robust lifestyle and take tough person through hard core movies, stylish atmosphere. To make matters even worse for the film, dialogue can not identify the characters with a rough cultural tone. I'm not about that, I think, profanity and vulgarity is necessary for thrillers thrive; I actually honor the decision of the director, to sustain from extreme profanity in the film, which could be very easy to make R-rated. Nevertheless, I believe, in the movies, such as "Gone in 60 Seconds" to strongly develop the insight of the character, dialogue must be believable and authentic. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems, the characters are effective due to the top notch, absolutely reject the Executive meet. melodramatic performance of Nicolas Cage is an intense and convincing. sloppy appearance Angelina Jolie is quite appropriate. Delroy Lindo is an extremely strong and believable. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, and Christopher Eccleston provides strong supporting role. <br /> <br /> The film contains a standard structure, with a satisfactory first act of developing a style based on the story and character sets fast-paced action theme, but lacks depth and strong character entered. In the second act we face several problems: During waste story for most of this segment, never actually did not accumulate the third act. While in the middle of the film takes a long time, and sex scene provides a solid middle section, not much happens. The third act is almost a sheer adrenaline rush, containing vehement excitement from wall to wall, and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed. <br /> <br /> soundtrack for the film "Gone in 60 Seconds" contributes a great deal to the inspirational scenes. This scene, as a pursuit that makes this film work, despite several devastating errors. Dominic Sena, whose career consisted mostly of guide rollers has an attractive style and decisive position in "Gone in 60 Seconds," which will give viewers two o'clock stir excitement and exhilaration ??, but not much more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
