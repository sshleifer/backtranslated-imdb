Director of the First Tom Kish turns in a winning film in the spirit sharp, black comedy. Shot on a shoestring budget, but had a taste of blood smear the beginning of the Coen brothers ... and just throw in some flavors Monty Python to boot! Requirements have seen more than once, to evaluate all the elements that carry one scene to the next. Expect more good things to come from this writer-director-actor.
