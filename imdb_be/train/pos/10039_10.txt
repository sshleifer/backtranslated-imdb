Titanic is a classic. I was very surprised that this movie had a solid ten overall in the ranking IMDb users. Maybe it's just great to keep the Titanic credit now, but when he first made it was really something. When the film came out people flocked to the theater. When he came out on video my sister and I would watch it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed, and for good reason. Some of the scenes of distress were hard to forget how the frozen child, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in an unmanageable crowd. Many died on that ship, and pass that on film with the immediacy and emotion is necessary, it is difficult to challenge that James Cameron went to. And let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Is their relationship was the result of someone's imagination it was great. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trust each other. They sure as hell give Romeo and Juliet run for their money. "I'll never let go, Jack." Titanic great film down, it's very core. This is a powerful story told through a brilliant action movie is excellent, beautiful music, and the crew, full of tough and dedicated employees. It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.
