It has funnist jokes of all movie Cheech and Chong. This is the first I've seen with these guys. I found it to be very good. My dad really encouraged me to get it. That the big role the MODEL, and my grandmother actually bought it for me, knowing what it was like. What family I have. Well, this movie is very good and excellent rent if you want to see a good classic. I must warn you though, it's not a gut-busting funny. It has its moments, but not as funny as there something about Mary. Check it anyway. I am sure that you will laugh. Unless your activist anti-drug or something.
