Strange rent at the local video store, I was delighted to find a media satire quite worthy challenge Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers". And almost as disturbing. I think it was well with my view, to be at the end of 2004, watching the Republican machine do it's magic on most American television viewing crowded. This begs the question: "Are we really that manipulativeÂ» <br /> <br /> It is definitely skewed my view was also a theological question is provoked- history of Christ may by word of mouth and suppressed depending on what?.. the exploitative as television produces the Messiah? is Jesus story can been exaggerated? could it have been completely fabricated? that's what the film sets in a very insightful view.
