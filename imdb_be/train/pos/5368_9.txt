This is an amazing fighter with big liners with Arnie!. It's tastefully done, with a lot of strenuous activities to keep one satisfied. Characters were strange, and Richard Dawson, a very formidable as the main villain. Yes, he has a ton of plot holes, but it's very very interesting, with a great finale as well. It was a great story, too, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had a great chemistry together. Character development was also pretty good, with some excellent performances. Directing more!. Paul Michael Glaser, does a very good job here with an amazing use of colors, while maintaining its stylish throughout, strange angles, and generally keep the film in a very fast pace! good job. There is a bit of gore. We get a few bloody gunshot wounds, head explode, cut throat, bloody pieces of chainsaw, skinless corpses, blood, and without taking off. Responsibilities great!. Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING, as always, it's great in the acting department, has a lot of fun aircraft, kicks, Dad, and as always a great physical presence! And had a ton of fun to watch! (Arnie rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso, does well here, it was very nice and had good chemistry with Arnie!. Japhet cat decently here, that he should do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre, good as a geek type guy, he was great!. Richard Dawson is amazing as the main villain, and was very, very sternly, and he is fun to watch. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, of Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch, and Professor Toru Tanaka, everyone is doing what they should do very well as stalkers. In general, a must see! **** 1/2 out of 5
