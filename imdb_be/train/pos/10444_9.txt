Sweet and charming, funny and sarcastic, the plot less, but the meaning is, "Before Sunrise" (1995), the third film by Richard Linklater, dedicated to all those who have ever been in love, in love, or have never been in love, but still dream about him and hope to find it. it is one of very rare movies / should / will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. it seems very simple little movie without any spectacular visual effects, chases , or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young men in their early 20s in, two college students (Ethan Hawke, an American tourist who returns home after a summer in Europe, and French student Julie Delpy, going to Paris to attend the Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly, even before they start talking, they jump off the train in Vienna, where they walk around exploring the city all night. they say and fall in love. that's it, it's a movie. this may have been dull and stupid, but instead is excellent, believable, intelligent, and moving novel, the ki gets better with every viewing (at least for this viewer). High praise, and my sincere thanks go to the director and writer for the delivery of two charming characters other than letters, always interesting and witty dialogue, two amazing performances and magic atmosphere that fall in love. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli angel, drawing perfectly intelligent, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman.
