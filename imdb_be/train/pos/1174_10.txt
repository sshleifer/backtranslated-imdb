Some people have claimed that as of the 11th season, South Park started the trend to go beyond them politically scathing satire on shallow deceptions; but this could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> While this episode makes spoofing Living Dead series, there's more. It is a satire about how people are homeless. Characters say things like, "They pretend, as we" or "They want to be a man." This episode attacks the culture of the people, ignoring the lower class, which are often simply down on their luck. <br /> <br /> So, yes, it is still a satire, as well as a beautiful deception. What more could you want?
