I'm pretty old man, old enough to remember the taste of Oreos, and Coca-Cola as they were 50-55 years ago, when for every taste was fresh for the child. I would like to somehow put aside, that is, some kind of magic hanging locker, so I could try these things today. This magical locker may even have arranged food on the cloth by the fact, as I drifted, physically and otherwise, a kind of dynamic chemistry expectations. For half a century, they would have to build quite a bit, because you see, I would have known that I put them aside. Meals will now be one holiday itself and the past and history, and a sense that almost make the expected remuneration over the years. <br /> <br /> I did not have enough common sense to do it with the original Coke. And I could not think of one of those magical mental lockers ?? not that. But I did something almost as good. In the seventies, I was really set on Roman Polanski's. It was strange and exotic fun ?? You know, movies smuggled out of the Soviet bloc. Movies are so sensitive to beauty, that you cry for a few weeks after that. Movies that make you want to live with a Polish woman, one, and then, thinking that they would be the last to get it. <br /> <br /> That's what I did. I took what I knew would be my favorite movie Polanski and set it aside. I have not looked. I put down until I thought it would be big enough to deserve it. Over the years, I would have to check yourself, your ability and the surrounding beauty of its outline, without her. There are probably a few Poles who worked on it, practicing to deserve Chopin. Deserves womanness, when I see it. Trying to get the flask from the edges. <br /> <br /> In recent years, I have achieved something like a certainty that it was time to pull it out. I already knew that I was already past the time when it will work optimally, because I had already seen and understood «9th Gate». <br /> <br /> If you do not know, we are talking about a person who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant (of which the story is named) jumped out the window, to die later, after this man (played by Polanski) visits. What happens is that during bends, and he becomes the woman. We make mistakes, believing that it is simply crazy. But as we follow him, he is not. He just has a flash that the world is normal, and that the people around you are not part of his coven warping reality. <br /> <br /> The story has no special significance. What matters is how Polanksi creates this thing and how he inhabits the eye, which only makes the edges and in populating the body, which consists only of tangled flesh. The two never meet. There is a dissonance that can haunt me for the next 30 years. His idea, and inside and the outside, with no edges at all ?? on all but the red wig. <br /> <br /> I do not know of any other that can do this, in this sketch, which is a sketch of this horror that is natural. <br /> <br /> In order to understand the genius of this, you should know one of the greatest films ever made; ". The rear window" post-noir concept of the genius of this film is that the camera produces the world; that the viewer creates history. What makes this novel take this film and turn it inside out. In the rear window, the idea was that the screen view (Jimmy Stewart) was the anchor, and everything else was fiction, woven, as we have seen. Here, the occupant is directed to the screen flat. We know what it is. We know that everything that we see, though, because he is the narrator. We know that it is true that the authorities shifted identity that times have changed, that the causal link plastic. We know that the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator leaves us in constant terror at the edge, which he attributes, but never shows us and allows us to imagine. <br /> <br /> Evaluation Ted - 4 of 3: cineliterate Each person must experience it.
