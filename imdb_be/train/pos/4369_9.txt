I loved this movie. The scenery was spectacular, the story has some interesting twists and turns, and the characters are well-rounded. On two fronts, however, "Rob Roy" scored significantly above average. Firstly, I have rarely seen "popular" film in which the quality of the dialogue was so high. There were a lot of verbal thrusts and oblique to accompany brilliantly choreographed fencing. I could cite many examples, but why should I? Just watch the movie. Second, this film realized a principle rarely acknowledged. For drama, in order to succeed, he must not only a hero, but really believable villain. If you are one, there is not much joy in rooting for the good guys. And "Rob Roy" has not one, but three - Earl of Montrose, his protege Kilairn and Archie. Nya-dimensional villains, either, but it is specified and very ugly. It takes a little more patience than "Braveheart" - this is not a dialogue, but the emphasis a little harsh, but it is much more clever and subtle piece. (As I said, I loved this movie!)
