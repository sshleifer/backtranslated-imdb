<br /> <br /> This film is definitely one of my favorites. I saw it while in college in the early 90s, and while I could not identify with thirtysomethings in the film, I felt that the story, the characters, and the film as a whole were at the highest level. For people who spoke negatively Indian summer, feel free to stick to your bloated movie Armageddon type and leave movies with big, satisfying story for those who can appreciate them.
