- After their sons were sentenced to life imprisonment, Adel (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) begin to receive threatening phone calls because someone knocks their children lightly. The couple decides to move to California to avoid the publicity of the court and start a new life. They start a dance school that will soon be very successful. One of the students have a rich unmarried father, with whom Adelle quickly falls in love. At the same time, Helen is busy breeding rabbits and getting a little too carried away with the radio evangelist. It is only matter of time before it all falls apart, and women enter into the world of madness and murder <br /> <br /> -. I can not help but compare what happened to Elena? to whoever Slew Auntie ROO?, also starring Shelley Winters. Where this film seemed almost restrained in his presentation madness HIS aunt, there is nothing holding back Helen in this film. It may take a lot of time performing the film, but when she snapped, Helen One Bad Mad Mutha. You do not want to mess with it. Winter so perfectly mad, that was impossible for me not to enjoy her performance. I'm not going to spoil the movie, but the fact that Helen is able to completely over-the-top <br /> <br /> -. As well as Winters, Reynolds is totally inappropriate in its role of gold -digging tap dancer. I got the impression that she thought she was in a film that would get her nominated for some awards. It's not Citizen Kane! Throw yourself so seriously. Hey, Debbie, you do not understand what you major goal is to become a victim of madness winters <br /> <br /> -. I just love these former female stars-in-the-twilight of their pits of horror films. What happened to Elena? as fun as any.
