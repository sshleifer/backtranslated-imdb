one of the best ensemble acted films I have ever seen. There is not much to the plot, but acting- incredible. You see, the characters change very subtly, undr the influence of a rented villa in Italy, and love. And happiness. The film casts a hypnotic spell on you, as Villa makes all women. Truly "enchanted".
