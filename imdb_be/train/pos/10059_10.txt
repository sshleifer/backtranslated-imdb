This movie is the best movie ever. I can not remember the last time when the film has drawn tears from me. with tears in my eyes, I admire this film. It has all the elements that a good movie should be: excellent dialogues, music, acting, story / Plot. A story of friendship, courage, kindness and loyalty between the street which is known for carrying out the King of masks and a little girl who is sold as a boy in the Castle Bazaar. The little girl loved to be his granddaughter and grandson loved King of Masks. They were not conventional real. Each scene they were together priceless. The camera work is flawless and grabs you. Actions inspire. Xu Zhu was very rich as the King masks. Renying Zhou "dog" looks and plays her character very well. Zhigang Zhao Liang as San Lang was great. He played very well a useful and good-hearted character. If you have't this movie, try once and see.
