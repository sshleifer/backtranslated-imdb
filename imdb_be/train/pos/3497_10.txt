Another one of those brilliant young men who went to all and dare to make a teenage romance movie (I can really call it that - it will cause the devil to its supporters) on the micro-budget, but packed with taste, sensitivity and maturity. Peter Sollett- you deserve more admiration and respect.Thanks again to demonstrate to the powers that be in the "industry" that stereotypes can be flushed down the toilet. One place, a handful of rich characters, a low budget, good acting (and it also lovers), decent lighting - the supporters of this indie movie must watch over it and stop looking ... well ... you know what.
