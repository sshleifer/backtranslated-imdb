Gundam Wing I happen to be good anime. Bit moves slowly (especially in the middle of the cycle), but all enjoyable. Now before anyone jumps on my case, and calls me "winger" I admit that I watched all of the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, The MS Team to 08, and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I will admit that there were a few problems with the story and some characters may seem that the "rip-off" (ie Zechs Marquise Char original Gundam), but it's an alternative universe shows through the original series as SEED. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this series, make sure that you watch the original Gundam first, and then know that you are watching in AU series.
