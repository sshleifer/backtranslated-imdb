While the "Kiss of the Spider Woman" cast Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified Latin American country, this time he is working on the dictator in a fictional Latin American country. In particular, the dictator suddenly drops dead, so Julia replaces El Presidente of a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss), a film in the country. From there, Dreyfus has to figure out how to be a dictator, all the while balancing it with their own lives. <br /> <br /> By the way to turn a tense situation in Latin America in a comedy? Well, «Moon Over Parador» does a good job with him. No matter what they do in this movie, they do not cause it. It just goes to show why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our time, and what we lost when Raul Julia died. Definitely worth a look. Also starring Sonia Braga (who starred Raul Julia in «TKOTSW»), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: the First Lady's hot.
