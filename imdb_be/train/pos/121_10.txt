Critics should reconsider what they are quality class film. I think the critics have seen too many movies and action movies succumbed Matrix style. Europa is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers, one sight is not enough to understand and appreciate this outstanding film. Lars von Trier shows that the old shooting styles can produce a beautiful film and drama and tension to build. Rear projection effect, which he uses in the film causes and enhances the character and focus of the conversation they have. Other effects he uses such as color and black and white in the same scene, just as Hitchcock and girl with red coat draws attention and reinforces the sense of drama and stage. Comment beautiful and has a hypnotic effect, again keeping the focus on the central characters in the scene, and there is action. <br /> <br /> I can talk about the effects of more, but I think you would all agree they are pushing the film in the category of their own, and truly enhance the drama of the film. The film, to buy, if you do not have one already, and see if you do not. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Do not miss this feature film noir from one of the great directors.
