This- not sure, a bit overestimated Southern soap opera's greatest epics to come out of Hollywoods most of the year, 1939.I nya nya enumerate the obvious-Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was a Bengal Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. gives a fine comic performances. HOWEVER, I want to mention two other, less well understood elements of this masterpiece. Gorgeous final battle sequence is a great Jaffe rises laboriously to the top of the temple, to blow his horn to warn the regiment, just great. It never ceases to fascinate me. Another underrated element in the film performance of Edward Chiannelli as the Guru. This is not a Fu Manchu caricatures, but well drawn, eloquent, historically informed ( "Have you ever heard of Changruputra Mauro? He defeated army left in India, Alexander the Great") villain. Indeed, one can see parallels between this mysterious, angry nationalist and a well-known figure of the thirties (the German, not the Indians). Gunga Din, the anti-Hitler tract? Not really. Still, huge, funny, moving epic.
