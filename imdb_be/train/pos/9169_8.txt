I liked Timothy Dalton is even though he was a bit young and too handsome to Mr. R., but I thought that Clark ZIL too chubby and short. This version, however, was very accurate novel and very well filmed. I saw 4 version of Orson Welles is still my favorite Mister the R, although George C Scott did very well, and it's a toss up between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, although both of them were a bit too old for the role. Recently I saw a brilliant TV version of Rebecca Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I would like to see those two doing Jane Eyre.By time I got to see the version Ciar√°n Hinds, I think Jane Eyred, but I never get tired the first few minutes of hearing the voice of Joan font narrate the opening of the first version, which I kogda ever seen. I always want to go back and read the book again.
