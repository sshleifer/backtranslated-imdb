Sudden Impact is the best of the five Dirty Harry films. They do not fit leaner and meaner than Harry romps through a rigorous series of collisions with the bad guys get their just desserts. That's just the way I like it. Great story well and skillfully directed by Clint himself. Excellent entertainment.
