Any movie that has to do with fanaticism in a positive way is a film that is still to be seen on the current audience of the message and the moral of the story is always will be relevant as long as we have a world full of fanaticism. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is really an old-fashioned love story..boy meets girl..boys loses girl ... boy gets girl back .... <br /> <br /> weakest role goes to the After Kent Smith as Lt. Gen. Webster (Riccardo Montalban close second) ... my question is, how it ever to be 3-star general in nature ... so weak in the presence of his wife and his military subordinates, it is surprising that they show him any respect at all. <br /> <br /> Brando southern accent a little exaggerated, and some scenes have a few holes, but overall, I like the movie every time I see it. <br /> <br /> Red buttons great ... I always love to see the comedian in dramatic roles ... as in the case of Button, comedian often better reflect the human tragedy, the more traditional g ramatic actor.
