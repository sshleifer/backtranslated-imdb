This is a great series. You'll laugh, you'll cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. As the family care for each other and helping each other through their crisis sets a great example of how we should live. There are many good things that they do, and a series of bad choices, but they will never turn away from their families, they work through the problem. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the cutest thing I've seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter suffers from the syndrome of the Middle child and with the help of everyone in the family is better. DJ, the eldest daughter, is growing, whether her father wants it to happen or not. One thing that they all share, they miss their mom. Denis (dad), Zhy and Uncle Jesse loves the baby so much, and it's apparent in every episode.
