Before watching, make sure that you have seen Night of the Living Dead ... It may be the best 7-minute parody I've ever seen! Absurd, trashy "special effects" (rope, rope !!!), and maneating slices of bread ... What else do you need ??? <br /> <br /> (Do not watch this movie while eating bread ... you might be scared!)
