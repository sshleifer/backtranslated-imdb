I have just returned from a screening a few hours ago, and I was very happy with the film, when I left him. It's very intense, and the closer I came to cry in a movie in awhile. It is the merit of Adam Sandler, which provides excellent performance on many levels, and which probably deserves an Oscar Nom for it, if not go so early in the year. Don Cheadle gives his usual excellent performance playing the straight man in the disturbed Adam. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of humor, but most of them are really funny, but in comparison with the tearjerking moments, as Adam deals with his loss and do my best to help him. Adam plays two levels very well ... if he is mentally balanced, it is funny and cute, but when he, well, less stable, it is powerful and dark. <br /> <br /> I recommend it for those who love intense psychological drama about friendship and heavy losses.
