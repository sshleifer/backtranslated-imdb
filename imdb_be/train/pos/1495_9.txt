This is an amazing Amicus anthology horror, with 3 great stories and fantastic views!, Only the last story is disappointing. All the characters are awesome, and the film is quite scary and alarming, as well as Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee just strange it!. This is a very underrated and my favorite story to be the third one "Sweets to the sweet", as well as all the characters are very cute. Some are predictable, and the last story was incredibly disappointing and rather bland!, But the ending was really cool!. This is an amazing Amicus horror anthology, 3 great stories and fantastic views, only the last story disappoints! I say it's a must see!. <br /> <br /> first story ( "killing method"). It's an amazing story, with a lot of uncertainty, and the killer Dominic really terrible, and it's very well-operated as well!. It was a great way to start with the story, and for the most part it is unpredictable, plus double-twist ending is shocking and quite creepy!. Rank <br /> <br /> 2-Story. ( "Waxworks"). It's a tough story all around, with excellent performances, but the ending is quite predictable, but it's still terrible, and has quite a bit of suspense, Cushing did an amazing job, and I could not believe how young Ekland was, I really enjoyed this stories!. Grade B <br /> <br /> The third story ( "The sweetness of the sweet"). This is the best story here, as it is very horrible and unpredictable throughout, it also has a nice twist, as well!. Christopher Lee did an amazing job, and Chloe Franks has done an excellent job, as a young daughter, plus the ending is quite shocking!. I do not want to spoil it for you, but it's one of the best horror stories I've seen!. Grade A + <br /> <br /> 4 Story ( "coat"). It's a terrible story, which is really weak and unfunny Jon Pertwee annoyed me, but the ending surprised me a little, and Ingrid Pitt was great as always, but it's just bored and has been done many times before, plus where was the work ??. Evaluation D <br /> <br /> Direction great!. Peter Duffell does a great job here with an amazing camera work, high angles, added some terrible atmosphere and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. <br /> <br /> Perform duties are amazing!. John Bryans big here, as the narrator, he had some great lines, I just wished he had more time on the screen. John Bennett well as by Det., And was quite intense, it was especially good in the end! I liked it a lot. Denholm Elliott well as Charles, he was vulnerable, showed fear, was very nice, and I liked his facial expressions, he rocked!. Joanna Dunham stunningly gorgeous!, And make the most with what she had to do as a wife, she also had great chemistry with Denholm Elliott !. Meanwhile Adams incredibly bad as Dominique, it was horrible looking, and got a job very well!. Cushing is amazing as always, and it is strange here, he's pretty focused, charming, and, as always, had a ton of class! (Cushing's rules !!). Ekland is fantastic, as always, and he looked so young here, I hardly knew him, his accent was not so thick, and has played a different role, I loved it! (Ackland Rules). Wolfe Morris terrible here, and did what he had to do well.Christopher Lee amazing as always and surprising here, it's incredibly intense, very focused, and, as always was that the greater the intensity of the look on his face, he was particularly strange at the end! (Lee Rules !!). Chloe Franks beautiful, like daughter, it is somewhat terrible, and gave one of the best children's performances I have ever seen! I loved her.Nyree Don Porter beautiful and was very rich, as a nanny, I liked it a lot!. Jon Pertwee annoyed me here and was quite soft and completely unfunny, he also did not have chemistry with Ingrid Pitt!. Ingrid Pitt is excellent and does his usual thing vampire and does it well!. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast do well. In general, a must see!. **** out of 5
