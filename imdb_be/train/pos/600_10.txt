Michael Bowen plays innocentish young man who is hitchhiking thousands of miles to visit him in absentia millionaire father (awful Ray Wise) stretching, wind power ranch and ends become entangled in a dangerous web of his youth, insidious and seductive stepmother from hell (notes Clare Wren), which causes problems for the already troubled family. Sharp, stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent directly to VHS and cable TV - where I first saw her. It is beautifully written, I acted in a fight, and tightly directed from a script that keeps you bite your nails. I can not believe that reviewers who did not like him ever actually seen him. This undiscovered classic.
