Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) out of school reforms and rises to the slums. His sister (Ann Sheridan) is doing its best to keep him out of trouble, but it just seems to follow him. In addition to his association with termite gangs Gabe followed by real-life gangsters who have set fire to the scheme of random buildings to collect insurance. They need someone to blame for the arson, and Gabe is. It's up to the law of termites work in their favor and give them gangsters just desserts. <br /> <br /> In a scene that leads into a dead end kids really well. The boys wander through to furniture a new resident on the street, and continue to do it yourself. They communicate with each other in the fake posh accents and talk about how to drink tea together; Bernard Punsli takes a nap in a chair. The children then go on to fight with the new boy, but after he proved himself a good fighter, they ask him to join their club. <br /> <br /> The initiation stage is pretty good also filled with mischief that seems risky at first but is actually quite intelligent and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, when the slave research Billy become the mayor of a boy, he has a dream about the school. This great set, with tiny holograms children walking on it on people and guns at him. <br /> <br /> Angels wash Faces is a perfect name, because he plays on the success of Angels with dirty faces and really says that the children are doing. Notorious for bad behavior on and off the set, these guys are doing well in this movie. But instead it seems disingenuous, this makes for some great laughs. This is a preview of what many of the boys would have been in the Bowery Boys series. We even get a few garbled words from Horsey.
