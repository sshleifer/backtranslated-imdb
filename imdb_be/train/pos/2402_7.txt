The main reason to see this film is Warren William, who is in better shape as a manager of shyster. He is electric, constantly finding ways to deceive the public and to defeat the opposing party in the midst of the greatest disasters. William is a great actor - I feel that he has never received due. Betty Davis, his girlfriend also shines as a written. Personally, I found Guy Kibbee's not quite true, as the lame-brained candidate, William and others are trying to impose on the public. He seemed more like a blank canvas, than man. I would prefer to see the real nature of the float, rather than non-character. The story itself is implausible, foolish and trite. But Warren William and Betty Davis is well worth watching.
