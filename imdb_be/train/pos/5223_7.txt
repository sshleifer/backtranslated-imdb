It does not seem that this film has managed to please many people. First, not many seem to have already seen this in the first place (I just stumbled upon it by accident), and then, judging by the reviews and ratings of those that do, many do not use it very much. <br /> <br /> Well, I did. I usually tolerate Gere for his looks and charm, and although I do not think it is a great actor, I know what he can do with the mind is very good (I loved him Mr. Jones). But this performance it's different. He was not much in it, and he is not magic. His character is completely different from anything I've seen from him to this point --- an old, ugly, broken, defined. And Gere, is that for me it is still his best result ever, pulls it nicely. I believe that this is a sign of how well the actor does the job if you can not imagine someone doing it instead of thinking --- Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, or Washington as Alonzo in Training Day . That is, how well Gere was here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors were different from me, too. I believe that I would not have dropped the Dane in this role, mainly because I think she's too good for that. But in fact, it does an excellent job of keeping her own with Gere in the best shape, that is no mean feat. Strickland easily provides the best warm-up, in the part that requires a considerable range of her. I actually think that it has a key scene with Gere and Danes, and it is a great achievement. <br /> <br /> So what about the rest of the film, except for some excellent acting? History is perhaps not very surprising, some 8mmy-ish aspects to it, but the addition of the "veteran breaks rookie" storyline to the who-dunnit, and (as Silence of the Lambs) added a sense of urgency by an attempt to save the girl and the future resignation of character weight. All that is the backdrop for the development of the two main characters, as they help each other to settle into their new station in life. That's a lot to achieve in a period of 100 minutes, but it's done well, and we end up caring for the characters and what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The direction and photography were adequate. I could do without modern movement music video camera and a sharp, but then I'm an old curmudgeon, and it's actually not all that bad, in fact I think it will help with the film's atmosphere, which, as you might have guessed, by and large is not happy. <br /> <br /> It is worth a look.
