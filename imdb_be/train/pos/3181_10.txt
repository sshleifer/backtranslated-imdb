I had the opportunity to see this film debut at Festival Appalachian film, in which he won the award for best film. This film is brilliantly done, with an excellent cast that works well in an ensemble. My favorite performances were by Yaassefa Kerkura Justin Lane and Adam Jones. In addition, there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches, I was surprised to find that this film was made on a small budget. Written and directed by Adam Jones, who I believe has also received an award for his writing, he does an excellent job with the direction. The audience loved this film. Cross Eyed will keep you laughing throughout the film. Definitely a must see.
