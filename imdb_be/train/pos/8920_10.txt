I did not know Steve McQueen in 1958, I only knew that I was very scared going to see this movie. (I was devastated film «Trantula» at the age of seven years ... But I was ten at the moment). The first scene, where the Blob creeps probed farmer stick and absorb his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater. But I stayed and suffered through each of our monster attacks. I felt so awful when Steve and his girlfriend had just made it out of the doctor's office (bad document), and even more if the drop came to the theater and to absorb a large part of the audience. ,, So many in fact that IT-oooooozzzzzzed from the front door, it is now too huge to climb only one. It seemed indestructible and unlimited growth potential, and when he trapped the poor Steve in a sieve like a diner, he seemed like a true lunch to be. <br /> <br /> To say that the Blob was cold to-date description of the day, but in the end, better than ice frightening and mentally tearing small children. <br /> <br /> I remember going home that evening with my uncle Nick, trying to act boldly. He knew I was in trouble, and when I went to bed that night, I could not only feel the Blob in the room, but when I found the courage to look down on the floor, there is the red pulsing heart, like a hungry man sitting waiting for me to try to get up and go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. <br /> <br /> Now I'm 57 years old. ,, I did it. <br /> <br /> Of course drop it was not destroyed.
