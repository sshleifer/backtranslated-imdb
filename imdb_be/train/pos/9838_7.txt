Born Again is a good episode of season 1. reincarnation bit, in my opinion, it's cool. The more I look, the more I like it, but it never rises above "very good" for me. Despite the fact that it is not very memorable, I will always remember him as an episode of reincarnation. Anyway, now I will say that this is good and bad about this episode, <br /> <br /> The good: Oragami. Oh yeah! <br /> <br /> This Fish Tank was nice. =] <br /> <br /> thrown out the window. Very cool. x] <br /> <br /> The bad: Marry your best friend's wife? O_O <br /> <br /> What is a random selection of reincarnate. <br /> <br /> Why do not you the guy who died, with his scarf confused, try to take it from a scarf instead? <, Br /> <br /> Conclusion: Good episode, not very memorable. 7/10
