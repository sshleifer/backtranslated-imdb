Pickup on South Street (1953), film director Samuel Fuller dissident, contains a stunning discovery, which establishes a double complication. Subway rider Candy (Susan Peters) faces pickpocket Skip McCoy (Widmark dipped in cool shades Sinatra). She knows that she has valuable microfilm; Mack does not know about his grifting. Both do not know there are two federal agents. Thus, Grift drives the degree of knowledge. Candy looked twice (Skip the police), and therefore doubly naive; Skip, the arrogant thief, it is not particularly aware trailed by federal agents; Feds, all knowing, ultimately, are helpless. They can not stop the "passing" state secrets or the spread of communism.
