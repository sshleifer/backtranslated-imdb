This film is easy, funny and beautifully photographed. Lightning is absolutely gorgeous and the colors clearly recall Vermeer paintings. <br /> <br /> This is a sentimental comedy at best, way above the US and French standards, and perhaps better than the English, too. <br /> <br /> Each character is moving, and the interpretation is close to perfection. Isabelle Blais gorgeous, Sylvie Moreau better than Catherine series, St√©phane Gagnon magic, Emmanuel Bilodeau big role in this amazing his and Genevieve Laroche perfect best friend! <br /> <br /> I could go on for several hours before you find any negative comments on the film to give it a chance, and add your own.
