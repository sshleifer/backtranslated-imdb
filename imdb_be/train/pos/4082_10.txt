Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a narrative form, but it is often compared to Walt Disney. It's just so unfair, because it is evident when watching Miyazaki's films, he is the best artist. He does have a gift excite both adults and children, and Laputa is really an amazing ride. <br /> <br /> But where do I begin to describe the film so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's work never ceases to amaze me. Laputa is an adventure on a grand scale, and I wonder how a movie can be so packed with detail and imagination. Ask yourself this question: when you as a child dreamed of adventure, so grand in scale and so magical, what would it be like? The answer will fasten themselves in some place and watch Laputa, because it really is the childhood fantasy come true. Every minute of the film a rich and exciting ... from the train chase in a strange sequence of kites ... and wonderous kind of floating castle. Not to mention the outstanding estimated Joe Hisaishi! Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure film here.
