I fully disagree.i idea that this is a great movie for kids.dawn wells Gilligans island, and the promise shown in barely known then Dana plato.it was disneylike and that can hardly be ignored as meaningless fluff.no is WASN Â«so scary and should not spoil be.i custom ending.but it was an unusual way, it done.i symbols mean kids were great, and I do not know what to expect in end.the main story, too, was a lot more to do with these children, what you say, the fact that these children were skilled fishermen is very central to the plot, especially initially.it also helps them out of jams in end.it direction also has a plus not being overly long.i think that the clock in less than 95 minutes
