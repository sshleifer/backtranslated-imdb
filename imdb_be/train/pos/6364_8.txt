"Atlantis: The Lost," was all that previews have shown that it would be. Not often do you find that. Most of the time, the preview shows only the best parts, and then the rest of the movie is terrible. So with this. I was pleased with the original story, even though the sub-plots were not. Animation does not break as "Shrek", but it was good nonetheless. The story and plot were well presented and had a few slow spots in them. It keeps you interested. I found myself enjoying it. "Atlantis" receives and retains their attention. You also need to think a little bit, but not too much. Once you think about it a little bit, you can figure out what needs to happen, but you really do not know for sure how it will happen. <br /> <br /> Casting was also good. Michael J. Fox, and Maile was an excellent choice. His personality fits. A gruff good-natured Commander Rourke was also well selected with James Garner. His character reminded me of his performance in «Maverick», which I loved. I really liked the cast of Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair. Its ability to play a no-nonsense personality makes the film more interesting. It's just too bad that it is a villain. <br /> <br /> Overall, definitely worth your while (8 of 10).
