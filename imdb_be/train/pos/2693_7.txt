Although the story is, in fact, routine, and "surprise" ending is not nothing but a bad joke on the audience, you can see what attracts the good actor in the project - it offers them the kind of roles that good actors can shine, and shine they do. The film is made perfect - for its time. It was remade in 2000 as "Under Suspicion", and if you want to see only one side of the story (that's all it deserved, in fact), I recommend the last one, with the direction of Hopkins refined and more obvious references to the story that the original can only hint. The ending, however, is still blowing. (** 1/2)
