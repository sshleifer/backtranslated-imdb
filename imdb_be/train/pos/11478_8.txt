Chris and Andre the middle two, ordinary teenagers. Misunderstood and some other stick. But together they are, and everyone will pay. Together they form the "The Army Of Two". They scheme and plan «Zero Day». On that day, when they decided to attack his high school and inevitably kill 14 people in cold blood. This was reported by the tape that they did «Zero Day», which is slightly fictionalized eloquent of the Columbine tragedy. <br /> <br /> «Zero Day» is one of those films that will bind to the head then. The two main actors (Kelvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) do such a good job, that their characters seem like almost any disenfranchised teenagers walking on the street. Their performances were very believable, you seem to like these guys, and it was scary. Shot on video almost entirely from the perspective of a teenager «Zero Day» feels very real and present, as you right there. These children try to rationalize their actions to the audience and the actors sell it to you. But keep in mind that is really worth the tragedy from beginning to end and the end makes shocking and difficult for some.
