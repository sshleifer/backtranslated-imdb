While the story is sweet, and dancing and singing in the main part of the film is a joy, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is a dream sequence. It has a combination of the highest form of true American music (Gershwin), contact the beauty of French impressionist art, be carried away by the choreography Kelly (including his enthusiastic "pas de deux d'AmourÂ», actually a separate genre), with the most beautiful color palette ever created for a set. The coincidence of the surge of music and the visual explosion of these dances was a real piece of creative genius and great artist.
