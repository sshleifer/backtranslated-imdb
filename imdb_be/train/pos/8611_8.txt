I loved to see this film. I wrote while watching, so that I could review it later. I really enjoyed the second view more, as I was able to absorb a reasonable dialogue between Natalie and Adam, 2 main characters. I thought this story was developed was very thoughtful. I am very intrigued by how Natalie is going to communicate with members of his daughter, at first it seemed that she was going to throw a lot of hostility, but as soon as she began to interact more pleased I was to see how this visit will unfold. I was not disappointed. Gradually secrets that Sara retained by his mother, began to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect, flawed people, like most of us who wanted her freedom from overbearing mother who thought she knew her daughter, but, unfortunately had to learn in a very painful way, that sometimes really love someone, you have to give them freedom. Viewers who are stuck with this film until the end saw a very moving performance by Diane Keaton (who is always excellent, even in some of its less to the film, I think, the city and the country). Closing scenes Diane Keaton driving home is well worth the wait, showing that the one who loves another man, got to know that we have to live your own life, we love others, but do not own them, and ultimately, we have to let go. It's a harsh lesson, but well worth considering now then.Thank CBS you for this transfer, it is necessary to wait for a long time.
