I saw this movie, and play, and I should add that it was the most touching story that I have ever seen. While I have not seen this movie, I did not know about how terrible life, and probably still is for South African children and adults who were living in that era. It brought tears to my eyes and a lot of sadness in my heart, that any person should have to fight so just to stay alive, and to bring the children directly from the field and teach them how to act and preforms and make them freely speak their own story is simply amazing . This is just to step five stars, I estimate it at ten. Thank you Mr. Mbongeni Nzhma such an amazing story. Despite the fact that it was 12 years since the story was told that this is one that is heavy in my heart.If have VHS or DVD out there at the games, please let me know as soon as possible. PS There was nothing wrong with the fact that children want to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in the hope that someone will have a heart and offers to help.
