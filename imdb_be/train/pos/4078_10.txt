This is one of my favorite films, period. I can not think of another film that combines the advantages of so many movies, as it does. This movie has everything: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, good against the bad, and even some Romance (even innocent "bite" on the cheek between the slot and the screen). Perhaps best of all, you should not be in the Mens "get" and enjoy movies as you do with some of the other films of Miyazaki (I do not know about you, but I watch movies, take a break of thought). It's just flat-out enjoyable film that everyone will enjoy, so do yourself a favor and go buy it. Only sour note is the American dubbing. I found Vander-Geek just be annoying. But all is not lost, the original Japanese version on the set of the two-disc and it rocks! Who cares if you can not understand the Japanese say? If you can read at the second grade, then watch the original Japanese with English subtitles entry. You will not regret it.
