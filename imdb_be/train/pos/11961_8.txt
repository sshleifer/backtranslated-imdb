I thought it was a great way to spend time on very hot summer weekend, sitting in an air conditioned theater and watch a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and cute characters (even a serial killer suspected of good bread). While some may be disappointed when they realize that it's not Match Point 2: Risk sentiment, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen still have full control over the style of many of us fell in love <br /> < br />. it was exactly what I was laughing at one of the comedies of Woody in years (I dare say, ten years?). Although I have never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in that she was able to soften her "sexy" image and jumped right into the middle, but the energetic young woman. <br /> <br /> This may not be the jewel in his career, but he was witty, than "The Devil Wears PradaÂ» and more interesting than the "Superman" great comedy to go see your friends.
