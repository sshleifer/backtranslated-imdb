This clears the drama has it all: high quality action, incredible photography, a good story. He is often compared to "Braveheart" because both the film take place in the historical Scotland. Despite the fact that I love Braveheart, I think it's the best of both films. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the lead role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil, vile, characters in movie history (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent, as the Lord Montrose, another dislikeable character. I am always amazed at the incredible range of characters, John Hurt can play. This is the story controversy over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy self-made man who will solve their problems with Montrose, if it violates his sense of pride. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that's basically what this story is all about; honor the nobility of the common man against corruption. This film is very interesting, it should appeal to all. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and a fascinating story. One of my favorite movies.
