I love this show! <br /> <br /> Every time I watch an episode I have to repeat this line and remind yourself how good a show it. I'm a huge science fiction fan, and this show has reason to be the most important science (fiction?) Show in the history of cinema / TV. There are so many theories, in this show about the universe, I could start a religion. Its awesome, season after season, the show is getting better and better. <br /> <br /> I was a supporter of MacGyver, since I was 5 (19 now), and I find it so ironic that has 2 favorite TV shows are constantly star Richard Dean Anderson. It is also interesting as almost every character is opposed to the other. <br /> <br /> In the past, when I first saw the film Stargate, I immediately liked, and considered him one of my favorite sci-fi movies and then listen to the TV show will run from him that I got very excited, but I did not get Showtime, while the fifth season is almost over. <br /> <br /> While I am disappointed to learn that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to make a trilogy of films, but the studio instead of a series of options. <br /> <br /> Id say, though, that it was very good. Maybe even better. <br /> <br /> This show is weird, and I hope it never dies. Atlantis here we come!
