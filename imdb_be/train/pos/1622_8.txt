I just saw this cartoon for the first time and learned caricatures of famous black entertainer ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit (in spite of) Louis Armstrong and the girls choir of the famous «Cotton Club» in Harlem. True ... stereotypes, but it was the way it was ... and these cartoons have been designated as entertainment for adults in the local cinema before the main feature. <br /> <br /> Harmann and Ising cartoons, tend to be more "coyly" and more upscale (in the end ... we're talking about MGM), than the standard animated short done more in Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or submissive Columbia. Even very early Mickey Mouse Disney had a heap of the threshing floor of humor before Uncle Walt to clean it just before he went «Technicolor». <br /> <br /> Disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black artists, but ... for example 1937 Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But we must remember that these films are part of a particular time and place. 50 years later ... clips Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park will also be considered, analyzed ... and even reviled future viewers.
