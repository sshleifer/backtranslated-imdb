David Beckham is the British football player and husband of Victoria Beckham ( «Posh Spice» with the Spice Girls). His trademark is the aim of a shot that curves across the field and into the network. Soccer equivalent unhittable curve ball in baseball. "Bend It Like Beckham" is what makes this type of spectacular shot. In addition, a little shrine in his bedroom, the main character and the pseudo-cameo at the end, the film has nothing to do with him. <br /> <br /> The film is full of little football -jokes, for example, imagine that one of the characters of the parents to give her a jersey with the number 9 on it (the property of a large Mia Hamm, to those who know), references to the "Posh "n" Becks "WUSA tribute video of one of the characters in the play for each other in disbelief (" They * have * what ?? "), lesbian jokes, gags sports bra, and so on. <br /> <br /> the story of a teenage girl in England who idolizes Beckham and wants to become a football star. It is a true gift, but these two seemingly insurmountable obstacles, it must overcome the lack of professional women's league in the United Kingdom (hence their enthusiasm for our WUSA), and her father, who is an Indian immigrant, set in a very old-fashioned methods which do not allow daughters, among other things, engage in contact sports. The girl's family is portrayed as an ironic figure of fun, but with a lot of love - I think my Big Fat Greek Wedding. She loves and respects them enough to go through the hell of a sitcom, to hide his growing footballing glory from them.
