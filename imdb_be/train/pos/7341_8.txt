I like Bakshi films ( "Wizards», «Cool World» and underrated animated "Lord of the Rings") and I Frazetta collector and fan. I'm also a sword and sorcery fan who loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. <br /> <br /> I missed the "Fire and Ice in the" theatrical release in 1983 and hopes to see it on video or on some revival ever since. Therefore, the 2005 edition has been a dream come true for me. However, I bought it with some trepidation, because I was hoping it would not only worth seeing once, and then put on the shelf as a "collector" gathering dust until the day I died. Fortunately, my fears were in vain, and I was pleasantly surprised by this film. <br /> <br /> As Frazetta art is a gritty film that has the physicality and sexuality, it is difficult to find in most fantasy / sword and sorcery movies without cheese or dirty. Art good, and you will see glimpses of Frazetta at its best. Even my young boys love to watch it with me and ask to watch it again and again. However, my wife has some objections to the poorly dressed princess (very Frazetta-Esquire). I do not mind, because it is true and there is no sex scenes. <br /> <br /> There is a mouth-foreseeable use, but personally I like the mouth-scope. This gives a more fluid and realistic movement in the characters, which are hard to find in the animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some continuity problems, I recommend this film to all Bakshi, Frazetta Conan, and the sword and sorcery fans. Enjoy!
