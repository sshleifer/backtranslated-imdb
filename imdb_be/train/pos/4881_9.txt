«Kaabee» reflects the difficulties in women before and during the Second World War, resulting in her children alone after her husband was in prison "mental crime". This film was directed by Yamada Odi, as expected, this film is really cool atmosphere. Although historically correct some scenes, especially on the beach scene is a suspect. <br /> <br /> To act in this film is absolutely unbelievable. I'm baffled as they were able to pick it up all-star cast for the film in 2008. Yoshinaga Sayuri, perhaps, the most award-winning actress is still active in Japan, of course, will win more individual awards for his role in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was very good as well. It was Asano Tadanobu, though, who made the most impressive results, perfectly portraying the wit of his character and the difficult situation he was in. <br /> <br /> Movies with the pre-war situation is not my business, but thanks to a great directing and acting, I was completely absorbed by the story. In addition, it was not far from the left nonsense as «Yuunagi Sun Machi, Sakura no Kuni" and considers a controversial and sensitive issue of state oppression and brainwashing that have occurred during this period in Japan. Great movie, highly recommended for all audiences.
