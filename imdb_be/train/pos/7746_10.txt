Those of you who know Deus group know the lead singer Tom Barman. He directed this film a little, he creates music that's a mix of everything. It's a comedy, although mostly absurd and cynical drama, none of the main characters do not have a happy life, to put it mildly, and it does not really have a purpose. <br /> <br /> The film opens on Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with scenes from several people, some of them have nothing to do, but they come in contact with each other during the day and night. There are several main characters: the teacher who writes books no one reads, a young researcher from a pathological taste of death, and his sister, a gallery owner, two young people who are constantly in contact with the law, a person who works in the theater and two young women. Throughout the film there is a person who has something to do with the wind. All characters have their own problems with their family or friends, or just life itself. <br /> <br /> The film is set in Antwerp and shows some beautiful shots of the city and port. Events of the day is not easy to explain, I advise you to just watch a movie, there is simply too much to say. But I can say that it has an excellent bartender using a camera and uses a lot of music (mostly dance music, in fact, not rock), to set the mood, especially a party filled with beautiful music. <br /> <br /> This film is an experience for yourself, it does not leave you any wiser about life, it could be just what you need to live, rather than spend it, whether there is some kind of false moral truth. <br /> <br /> In short, to see it, it is definitely worth it!
