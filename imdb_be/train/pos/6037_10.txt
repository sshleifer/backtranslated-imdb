What a great British film that screams good laugh and sexuality Garry Stretch, too, and a lot of bicycles and beautiful Welsh countryside. <br /> <br /> Our members ARROWHEAD bike and Trike Social Club are in it as extras! Hooray !! <br /> <br /> There are some really funny bits, good acting, good idea. <br /> <br /> Met director, John quince on show in Wareham, Dorset. A great man, down to earth and a good laugh. This film should be supported, as more and more Brit films should! <br /> <br /> So, please go and see if you can, they have a website with cinemas that show it, so find one near you! <, Br /> <br /> I can not wait to get the DVD. Some of our friends bikers have seen the film two or three times already and can not get enough. <br /> <br /> Amanda
