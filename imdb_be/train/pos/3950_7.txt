Finally got to see this classic TV movie at the informal discs recorded from an old VHS, is a classic of the horror. It's a pity more of this neglected corner of horror in terms of official releases on DVD and VHS ... TV horror movie. It is recommended for all fans of the 70's TV movie as well as a trilogy of terror. Those interested should get a book on the subject by David Deal - TV Movies funk 70s. Email me to get the chance to see it ..... its fabulous to see him again. <br /> <br /> He has it problems such as many television movies that they have to be very creative in the effects of cafes and even 70 minutes, it may seem to drag, perhaps we are all accustomed to the more advanced editing, but still great stuff, and much better than in many theater fright released today.
