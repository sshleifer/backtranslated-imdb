The Ramones, whom I consider the founder of modern punk rock, then give them unique sounds in horrible twisted film about the scandalous rock fans (PJ Soles), which faces off against a ruthless, joyless principal (Mary Raven) for the right rock. <br /> <br /> Due to the soundtrack crammed with incredible music, RRHS mesmerizing in concept and execution. He is full of wild fun (like mice experiment), teen spirit (probably my all time favorite movie opening), and bizarre, off-the-wall moments (scenes strait). If you are looking for a film that seems to be made of pure pleasure at the molecular level, look no further. But if you are looking for a good, decent, dramatic epic, maybe you should look a little bit further. <br /> <br /> "Hello everyone, I'm Riff Randell, and this rock & roll high school!"
