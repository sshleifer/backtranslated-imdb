Talking parrot is not a very radical idea for the new film, but Paulie turning a simple idea into a brilliant, moving film that will delight the whole family. He was able to bridge the gap between the sentimental trash and rigid severity when Marie and Polly division, and all of the events in the film leads to extremely satisfied with an emotional conclusion. Training the animals is well done - all will be affected if Paulie spreads its wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is a great character and had to get a lot more success, although the film was not an event in 1998, as opposed to Saving Private Ryan. This hour and a half, will certainly be a pleasant one and one that you will remember. History Poly is moving, boring, happy and interesting one - from the moment he first saw at the time when it is combined with its original owners, you will enjoy following him and watching to learn about friendship for him and the harsh realities of life along the way. Not one to be released, if you have any heart or emotion. 9/10
