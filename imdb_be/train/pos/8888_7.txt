This film began slowly, then grows to the middle. However, the fact that the film ran for two nights to break this momentum is at its peak. The second part really got interesting, but then gave way to a miserable end. Playing football in the yard? Indeed, if you can get a juicy and whiny? Now I hear the plans of this film based on the 70s. I will not make any great effort to tune in to this one, if it's something like "60s."
