Sunshine Boys Neil Simon starring Matthau and George Burns funny comedy about a strange connection to life and its brevity, but the laugh is always a bitter taste. Seeing Willie Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns) two great actors of theatrical comedy is now reduced dementia with hard and unceasing age you may feel only anger and blue. Willie never give up and continue to look for a job, while Al is tired to the players, and he went to the house of his daughter. A couple of his old time was really funny and harmony, but has been out of the scene continue to squabble and quarrel, and for eleven years after their broken, they do not talk in between. Now, when they work, they should get back together again to make one of his best old sketch comedy scene for a TV show. Meets explosive and release to old questions ??. Scenario Neil Simon to a certain corrosive spirit to stories and melancholy and blue preferred, many jokes and laughter managed to create a good mix also thanks to the great steam Walter Matthu (nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actor) and George Burns (Won Academy Award for Best Actor in a second support plan ). The two actors are very believable and real and harmony, it seems almost like they work in real time with all this, and they do not carry Realty between them. The film is very touching and overwhelming reality for him, as the story goes, and how to report Love-Heat, which connect the two actors, a very real part of the strange, but at the same time, usually clear things in life. My bet is 7.
