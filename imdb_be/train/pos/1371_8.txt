This film is a great, light-hearted look at both sides, where the "club kid" rave scene combined with the New York art, music and performance of artistic worlds (with a cameo ubiquitous Miss Bunny). It's "Torch Song Trilogy" for perky post-adolescent girls. . «That Girl» for our disappointed affected by the time of the Millennium <br /> <br /> Dialogue fast and funny, and dresser Parker Posey deserves - if not the Academy Award, at least - at the stadium "wave" prestige. <br /> <br /> you know, this film is based on the very trendy platform heels Miss positions, and it is absolutely reject. How much acting work, it may not be very deep, often self-referential and, well, sow ... but it works. She is a talented comedian, an incredible entertainer and this film is entertaining, it carries it on his shoulders, like an artificial leopard wrap, and does not allow it to fall to the floor. <br /> <br /> Mary surface Party fashionista who is not above theft of designer clothes from the closet of one or the other to do with someone else. On a deeper level, this story of a girl and her friends who care less in every sense of the word, including for others; and the learning process that the care necessary for life. <br /> <br /> The script is beautifully crafted, witty, and the only thing that's disappointing performance is the aunt, in a role that was too one-dimensional and heavy-handed; more performance nuances of it, it would deepen the relations between them ... but ... hey ... it's a comedy. Surprisingly profound role that gives the film some of the substances and the world view, is fallafel sale boyfriend. We should all be so lucky ... he's one for Mary? or one that escapes? <br /> <br /> I see it as an 8, because it is not a big time movie history, this is not a classic, but not great art (deeper and richer by repeated viewing). As "Desperately Seeking Susan" is something very precisely about this time, but may become irrelevant over time. However, it has everything you need entertaining movie and worth seeing just the clothes a few times!
