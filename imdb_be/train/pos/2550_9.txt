This is truly one of the "Golden Age" of Hollywood, like they do not make anymore. This is a unique, fun movie that keeps you guessing what will happen next. <br /> <br /> All the actors are perfectly cast, and they are all great actors that support. This is the first movie that I saw with Ronald Colman in it, and I was a fan of his ever since. Reginald Gardiner has always been a favorite actor of mine plan and the second adds a certain quality in every movie he is. While he was playing a different kind of character here, he has added something to the movie that another actor cast in this character will not be added.
