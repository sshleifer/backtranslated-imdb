This show was my escape from reality in the last ten years. I, unfortunately, miss it. Although Atlantis filled the hole a little piece. <br /> <br /> The last ever episode of SG1 (on TV anyway) was nicely done. Robert wrote that felt close to reality. As if he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show. (Anyone who has worked closely for such a long time, there is bound up and downs. But over the years they have become a family). I thought it was a great way to finish, despite someone's criticisms. <br /> <br /> SG1 was something special, and again and again he took me through the rapids of mistrust and astonishment. Great characters, stories, directors, and writers. From the first series, I was hooked. The combination of action, science, drama and comedy in particular has worked so well that made me keep wanting more. <br /> <br /> There are no real words that fully express what this show means to me. I can only thank those who kept the show fresh and interesting so for many years. He inspired me to do a lot of things that I thought was impossible. <br /> <br /> I look forward to films in the next year, and I really hope there will be more of them. I do not want to show to die <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1. - 1997 - 2007?
