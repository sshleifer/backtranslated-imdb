I liked the show a lot - we got the first and only seemingly a series in the UK on Channel 4. Characteristics of the rights to the money - a bit like The Simpsons is that all the different aspects of the population of a small town were. represented <br /> <br /> There was no laughter track - I have not seen it on American television comedy at the time for Larry Sanders with the exception, and it really worked well here, reinforcing the assumption that these stupid cops on the reality as it is, and not just hamming it for the camera <br /> <br /> in general, the nimble little number that tickled me just :. I can not help but think that may have missed a sign to some viewers. . I think it would have been a cult that was shown in a reasonable hour in the UK <br /> <br /> I'm going to round it off with my standard comment: Where the hell can I get it to watch it again? Any ideas?
