Well, this is again a film that plays with your senses, and you went all soft, in contrast to the rocky movie. But I'm a sucker for those, so I gave it a good score for its ... effect was very good, and there were a lot of feelings. Violence kept to a minimum, which makes a difference. I would give it a 9, if there were no fireworks in the end! In general, a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
