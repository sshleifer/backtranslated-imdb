The film exposes the blatant exploitation of Chinese workers - all female - collecting footage of Chinese business owner who shares his dishonest and insane point of view, his American counterpart, as well as shameless and crazy, oppressed workers who give a voice and, of course, drunken Americans who are in a beaded necklace without thinking, which is celebrated in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> glimmer of hope comes when some Americans really outraged that people who make their beaded necklaces were getting paid as much as $ 0.10 per hour to do it. In addition, there is a sense that the workers can have a chance to avoid work in a bead mill, but is likely to do so when they are annoying treatment penalty popularity in the breeder and / or they just get too tired to work up to 20 hours a day hard labor. <br /> <br /> I was wondering where these necklaces come, not knowing how to completely debilitating and hard it would be to do them. I just really appreciate this film, as it perfectly reflects the influence of American indulgence is on something we believe are relatively harmless in our society on the people on the other side of the globe. Honorable Mention goes to Wal-Mart. It's just amazing. And it is clear that only the tip of the iceberg!
