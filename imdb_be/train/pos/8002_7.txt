I saw Olive beach a couple of times - both on free TV in Brisbane air. I will not go into whether it is good, bad, or otherwise, as the others were well and truly covered it. <br /> <br /> I will say that it is so Australian. Only in Australia we have a film about the relationship between the people who spend the day as naked as the day they were born, and view it on the free commercial television. <br /> <br /> I have a friend from the United States, which is constantly surprised by what we put on our free TV as compared to its native country. Sex and the City and Huff just as examples. <br /> <br /> Despite our government is trying to turn us into the 51st US state, it is good to know at least some things are truly Aussie
