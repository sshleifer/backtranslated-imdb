I've heard good things about this movie was, you guessed it, a little disappointed. Reese Witherspoon, as it was promised to be surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, at a young age; in fact all of (small) cast quite tough, they simple 50s American environment. So I did not appreciate this film above, basically, that towards the end, the mountain showed older sister did not seem so real, and it got me out of the film a bit. Perhaps we are expected to fill in the story, or perhaps the film had to be a little bit more. Maureen character quite well developed, I think. It is understandable that Dani (Reese W., Jr.) gets hurt and angry, but why her sister showed more upset? Because she's a few years older? Not the end, and blew the rest of the film? Walk the film makes it seem that Maureen and the court had just met when he gets tractored (warning:.! This scene is surprisingly hard, in retrospect, it seems that it may be trying to shock the little works well) It depends on what you want - if you want a happy story of a young girl's love, it seems that you are going to get you a surprise. Man in the Moon as a whimsical and dreamy and stern-age movie ?? rather uncomfortable combination? I liked the character of the court, though, I can see what the girls look it may look. And I loved that they had the courage and let him hurt younger sister (the majority of men, most of the films are not) and kill. <br /> <br /> 7-10 on my rather rigid grading scale. For some reason, I found Jason London tractor funny.
