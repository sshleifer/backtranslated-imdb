Preminger Dana Andrews cycle noir movies are among the (mostly) invisible values ​​of the genre. Because they do not have paranoia, misogyny or hysteria, it may seem out of place at the time, but with a clear-eyed images, a complex game with unity, courage and imagination, undermining traditional psychological principles, strict geometric style all seems surprisingly modern today, and very similar to Melville.

Brilliant at entertaining thriller, as well as intense and packed with a double-edged dialogue.
