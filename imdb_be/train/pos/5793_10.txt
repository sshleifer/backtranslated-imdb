Moonwalker Michael Jackson real adventure for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before the real story of the film begins, we get productivity Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror), and it starts a great movie. Then we get a kind of collage of Michael media, as it was until the Lunokhod came out in 1988. After several musical videos too (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.), the story begins. <br /> <br /> the story is basically what Michael and his 3 friends (who children) chasing the bad guy of the story, "Mr. Big", because they have opened their evil plans getting children around the world put on drugs. During the chase, we see fantastic segments, FX. Michaels video for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences, etc. But then one of the children kidnapped by Mr. Big, and Michael is the shaft to rescue her before she gets an addict. <br /> <br /> in the film we see the special effects, not only for those odd days of standards, but also impressive today. For example, see Michael turn to the robot / spaceship to protect his friends! This is so cool! <br /> <br /> The film ends with the performance of Come Together (later published in Michaels double album HIStory), and you leave the film with a sense of magic. Amazing! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to every family who wants to spend the night together with sweets and popcorn in front of TV. And now, some parents can stand up and say: "But Michael Jackson's alleged child abuser!" Yes, he really is, but, come on, we all know that it is not so! Wait and see ..
