This is a very interesting project, which could be very brilliant. After collecting 11 famous international directors and giving each of them 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice; each short studying global echoes of 9/11. Without using any spoilers, I would say that some of Ken Loach is a jewel in the crown, and short ( "India" segment) Naira world based on a true story deserves to be in the full length feature film. It can also be understood by observing its short, why Gonzalez Inarritu is one of the best directors in the world today ?? he is just a master of the medium, which is also a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are made as well. Youssef Chahine in the segment "Egypt", says the Arab position in self-inflicted collective guilt, that part could potentially be the most interesting. He fails miserably. Shahin short poorly written and poorly executed, at least enough to stand out among others, the superior managers of the film. Despite the imbalance in quality, I would still give the movie 7/10 for the concept, if not execution.
