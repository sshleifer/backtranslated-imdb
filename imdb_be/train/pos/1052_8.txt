Excellent documentary about the remarkable achievements of the Association of Women Lawyers (WLA) with Kumba, in the southwest of Cameroon, in the legal protection of the rights of women and children from domestic violence. In this Muslim culture where people always dominate over women, according to the Sharia law, one can imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights of women and children. After 17 years of unsuccessful attempts, the leaders of the WLA have recently started to win some victories, and the aim of this film to share these winning stories. <br /> <br /> Leaders of the legal reform movement is Ngassa Faith, the state prosecutor, and Beatrice Ntuba, a senior judge (the presiding judge). Both play themselves in the film, which can contain footage spontaneously, although I believe many, if not all, consists of the following events for the recovery of the real camera. Four cases examined, all the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film <br /> <br /> Two cases linked again beating his wife with a violent sex in one case. include other forced sex, on 10-year-old girl; and also refers to the repeated beatings of the child, 8 years old, at his aunt. One of battered wives is also seeking a divorce. We are going to the cases of the complaints in connection with the test results. The results in each case are favorable to women and children. Criminals are strict conditions and / or penalties in prisons; divorce granted. <br /> <br /> The aggressive prosecution of beating baby aunt shows that these female employees of the criminal justice system really gender-neutral when it comes to applying the law. Also worth noting is the respect with which all parties, including those found guilty are treated. This is a very important and well-made film. (Of interest is the fact that one of the directors, Ms. Longinotto, also co-director of 1998 film Divorce Iranian Style, which dealt with related topics in Tehran.) (In broken English, with English subtitles). My assessment: B + 8/10
