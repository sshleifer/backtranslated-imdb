The story of four teenage girls who grow up in California. Ginny (Jodie Foster) is the most balanced of the bunch - but he wants to get out of his house, where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and beat up her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has excessively parents. . Deirde (Kandice Stroh) believes that it is more mature than the rest of them <br /> <br /> This is nothing new from what we have seen many times before - but this one is one big difference - it is true, I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw the film) and I was amazed at how realistic it was. They got the dialogue, clothing and attitude down quite correctly. Even the main song of the film ( "radio" Donna Summer) was a big hit to the left of this. This film struck me more than any other teen movie of the time, because I could understand and relate to the characters. I knew a girl in high school who were just like that! The film (of course) is dated, but it's an exciting time, we will never see again. <br /> <br /> actions are good on all counts with Foster, giving better performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (who was excellent) are realistic and well done. Even Scott Baio (who has a small role as one girls) are more or less realistic playing teenage boy <br /> <br /> It is a good film -. Substantive review, if you came of age in 1980, the film has a well-deserved rating of R (plenty of drug use and abuse), but should be seen by all teenagers. I give it an 8.
