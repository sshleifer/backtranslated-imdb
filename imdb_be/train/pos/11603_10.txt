The first time I saw it, I got half of it, but I saw it, and I knew that in the future it was about the Salem witches. They focus on the family of Sarah Hood. It is famous for cursing the priest who has come true. In the film, he paints her daughter Dorcas and her husband, the spirit of her husband of Sarah Ann Putnam comes to the future of hunting this girl to redeem his soul. which happens at the end of the film. Serna is reflected as a witch at 5 years old, which is burned at the stake. That will never happen, Ann Putnam rescues her from the flames. she is safe, she goes to the grave of Ann Putnam, to see that it is not empty, but this at first, because she accuses her of witchcraft, and allows it to burn. Now, when the apostles Putnam saves her, her spirit is redeemed, and it is not a social outcast for the Salem witches.
