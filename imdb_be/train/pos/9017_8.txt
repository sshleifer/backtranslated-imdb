This movie does a fine job with the image of misery with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) a martyr. The subject is made with sympathy and humor. Helena Bonham Carter is so convincing as a man with ALS that I found it hard to believe that it is only valid. Kenneth Branagh, an excellent actor, lives up to expectations as a quirky artist who behaves badly and had to ensure communication on the character of Helena, as part of its "public works", an alternative to prison time. Watching the development of relations between the two treat from start to finish. Tha fact that this tale does not detract from the fabulous performances. One comes deep to take care of two of them.
