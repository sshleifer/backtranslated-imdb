I must say, Undying Clive Barker is certainly the best horror game that has ever been made. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and The Evil Dead and Castlevania games, but none of them have captured the pure joy with which this game Tackle your monstrous elements. Barker is good because it makes sure to attach the horror in our world, and it shows how his hand is clearly everywhere in this game. Heck, even his voice in the game as one of the main characters. Full gorgeous visuals and atmospheric enough to shake a stick at, Undying is a game to beat in my books as the title of the best horror. I just want to have it done it in the console, but alas poor PC sales dropped that one in the bud.
