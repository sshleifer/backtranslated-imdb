Industry dropped the ball on this one. The trailer does the film justice and when it opened it was on hand, full screen. Had people had the opportunity to see this work of mouth would have made it very successful. 2 lead actress each give great emotional performances that truly draw you into the story and especially the characters. I tested it on the basis of the recommendations of the rave Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a great film, which was never fully released with the exception of a few screens. Which did not give him any chance to be seen. Some films are in the video quickly, because they are not as good. It is worthy of an Oscar, and it is a tragedy on many levels, the majority of them have never even heard about it. Maybe, through word of mouth, he will receive the following on DVD or cable. If you do not see this movie, you should. 2 great performances lead actresses make this film. It could be just one more formulaic teen movie after school special, but instead he stands up well to other worthy musical film. Interrupted life comes to mind. If you want, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Both girls are in the same amazing emotional scene after another, without stopping, as the melodramatic. While Alicia Dean angry and crying through most of the film it is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or melodramatic. The film takes you in many scenes, and if you are an aspiring actor to use the actual performance in school. Eric this is even better than in motion. I hope that both of these actors to get more roles that use their talents and let them shine. Watch this movie, and if you want to recommend one, so it does not get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year. The film was buried in a while Spider-Man 2 tops records. What words do we live? AGHhh. Thus, to make the world right again to see it and recommend it.
