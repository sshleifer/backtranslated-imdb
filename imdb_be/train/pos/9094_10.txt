I have seen the independent film, when he was in Philadelphia, and it was a pleasant surprise. I left the theater with a smile on his face. One of the things that made it so funny that it was based on real events -hilarious! She has a lot of character actors in it too. Mindy Sterling in it, and it's very good. I loved her in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman also stunning. I remember him with the head of the class. I'm tired of all the dark sharp movies that keep getting made. It's fun and easy, and I can watch it with your family and do not hesitate. I continue to check when it comes out on DVD. I will definitely buy it.
