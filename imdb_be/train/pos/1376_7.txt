It sounds as if it should be a biography of Claude Monet, but in fact it is very focused history of relations between the three teenage girls in the French synchronized swimming team. There are no parents or teachers to talk about, there is no school, and the boys presented a peripheral figure, hunky Francois, which is part of the history of a particular time to time, and always leaves tangled. <br /> <br /> Pauline AquArt is the youngest of the three, only seeking to join the team as she admires. She's kind of strange. She is not one of his teenage rapid growth and has a long, bony limbs, big feet, and do not talk about Derrière. She prognathic and sports, these plump lips pursed. After some time, her appearance grows on you, and with certain angles, it may come to appear exciting <br /> <br /> Adèle Haenel older. - more, well, more developed physically. That it will cut a glamorous figure in her bathing suit, walking around, tease the boy, slicing through her long blond hair. But she is not what she seems. Or is she? I could not understand it. The French have long and short on the paradoxes of consistency. It is not surprising that François is not always sniffing after her. <br /> <br /> There's not a lot of ambiguity in the character of a louse in Blachere. It is also in the team, but stocky and simple, and sensitive about it, and has an intense crush on Francois. Blachere good actress and ungainliness adds to the character through her performance. <br /> <br /> film deals with the relationship between the three, which mean intrigue, deceit, hidden feelings and everything else that we have to deal with young girls who spend a lot of time with each other. This is certainly a complex topic. This becomes more difficult in the course of the gradual development of homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele. Not what you should expect that it will be soft porn. Only nudity we see, much less than in its turn, that, and there is little sex under a blanket, sometimes literally. <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to get into the story, or in his analysis too much, partly because it suggests rather than expressed through action, partly because it is a complex and partly because I am not sure that I got it all. <br /> <br /> I will give an example. All right. Adele woman jealous of others. It is also quite far away and enjoy itself. In addition, it seems schtupping every boy and man in mind, if they can be of any use in it all, from the beautiful, but dumb Francois bus driver it wants to benefit from. She brags shamelessly about her experience in fellatio. If Pauline approaches her about joining the swim team, Adel uses it as a viewing platform at the time of notes with the guys. Lovely and one indulgent narcissist, you know? But then seemingly skinny slut takes Pauline under his wing and shows Pauline that she was still a virgin. Really? Yes, actually. Pauline begins to approach Adele Adele and finally confesses that she would like to get rid of it foams, and she would like Pauline to do it for her. Pauline now turns sexually Adele performs the task with subdued appetite. NOW Adele really wanted to get it to the man, mostly older and more experienced. Thus, it takes Pauline to the Boite, where she dances seductively with some guy, as long as it is not necessary to Pauline in the ladies' room. Two girls do not stand staring at each other, neither one openly expressed sexualized interest in others. But Adele is so close that Pauline slowly loosened its own entrails, reach, and kiss on the lips Adele. Adele step back, smiling, and says: "There is now, it was not so bad, is it?", And then returns back to the club. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly close description of what is going on between Pauline and Adele - but what the hell is going on? Initially Adele Pauline considers as inappropriate the child, later, as a close friend, at last, like a potential lover - and at the same moment Pauline responds, Adele leaves satisfied. Is it USE Pauline as she seems to use the man? Adele has to meet to know that she now has another person in servitude? I do not know. <br /> <br /> I neglected Louise Blacker as the third member of the trio, simple and ripe wallflower whose expression always involves dumbfoundedness but who at least thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to get rid of this pernicious virginity, but I only let her out of space considerations. <br /> <br /> If you see this? In all senses. (Just compare it to a typical American movie about high schoolers.) For men, some of whom had never penetrated the female mystique, it can give you some idea of ​​how it looks on an average shot.
