Hey, guys, <br /> <br /> I've been looking every where to find these two films, and I can not find them anywhere in my neighborhood. (I, Australia). Could you please help me and tell me where I can buy it. In general, Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 of the best films I've ever seen, and they are good for people of all ages. It was my favorite film Wen I was 5, and he is still, even now, when I was a teenager. This is a great film for the whole family. My whole family loves this film for my younger sister, except because I watched it that many times that she was tired of it. I love this movie, and I can not wait until I can buy it again on DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
