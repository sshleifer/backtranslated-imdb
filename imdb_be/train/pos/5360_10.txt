Among the standard type of action films each liner, where action and logic checked at the door, this film is in the top of the class. If the person responsible for the casting were put "good" actors in this film, it would have been worse (with the exception of Richard Dawson, who actually act well, if you can call yourself playing "action"). I love this movie! Running Man, in all probability, the gift of God to man (well, maybe just a man). Definitely the most quoted movie of our time, so I'll leave you with my favorite line: "It's all part of the rich sample Brenda life and better F ***** g get used to it." Ahh, more people are referred to as "Brenda" quote for this film than I can imagine.
