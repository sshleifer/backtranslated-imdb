Vivah in my book the best film of 2006! PERIOD !!. In my book, this is one of the best 100 films ever in Bollywood. Its sad that this film does not have that many reviews and not having that much popularity. <br /> <br /> Vivah again a real achievement by the director, who's doing it again. After HAHK I loved Sooraj again took a brilliant one Vivah. <br /> <br /> This is the most simple and cute films I've seen this year. After watching Don 2, which was shit, and then Dhoom 2, which even beat Don in this matter, I finally see the film, which is so close to my heart and my culture. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Bollywood moving away from the beautiful culture that we have, and makes crap remake of Hollywood movie styles like Dhoom 2 and Don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and belongs to a large Indian system of arranged marriage, I would also like to be a part of. Our system, which teaches us to obey their elders, to follow them and, of course, to carry out their ideas so brilliantly shown in this film!. Of course, this is not some force in choosing a life partner, and it should be a short meeting between the ferry and it to them to decide how it is brilliantly shown in this film. <br /> <br /> Returning to the film ..... Vivah story of the journey between the beautiful period of the engagement and marriage. Phase, when a guy meets a girl! .... Both understand each other ..Both try to assess whether they can love each other for seven generations (as says our system), as well as a variety that occur during the marriage. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the film Shahid ....... OK ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are awesome !! Songs BRILLIANT. ! I especially like Hamari Shaadi MAIN HAFTE REH GYE Chaar and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> In general, SEE MUST for those who still believe in the Indian culture and traditions, and I, of course, do !. <br /> <br /> Go this movie ...... I just have to say one word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS !.
