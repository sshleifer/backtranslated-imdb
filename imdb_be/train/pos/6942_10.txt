In the fifties, the age limit for movies in Brazil were as follows: no restrictions, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years. Westerns were usually resolved within ten years, when they were a little more violence they would go up to 14, but it was rare to see western limited to under 18 Winchester 73 was one of those, and I think it explains very well as the film is considered to be different from the average. Hero James Stewart fought against his brother, who killed his father. He sought revenge, and seemed very traumatized, far from the average good guy. Anthony Mann tried a variation of this type of character in these films, which he did with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the leading lady was far from being a benefactor, she continued to follow the man who stayed with the rifle. Dan the Duryea, like Waco Johnnie Dean is one of the great villains who will always be remembered. The history of the film, which should always be a man who is carrying a gun is one of the best suited to westerns. This was to be made into a film by Fritz Lang, who has not come to an end. When he was offered Mann he made a point of starting from scratch again and do not accept anything that has been prepared for Lang. From Winchester, manna created another Western concept, but still keeping all its traditions. Winchester is still a great film to see again and again, but nothing is comparable to the impression he has made those who saw it when it was originally released.
