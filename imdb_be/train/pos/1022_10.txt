Stargate best show ever. All the actors are absolutely perfect for a role there. I love the relationship between the characters. If you have not seen this show, I highly recommend it. Although this program compared to Star Trek much time he actually can not be, because it is completely different. I am a Star Trek fan, but I would definitely evaluate a show is much higher than any of the stellar trips. Unfortunately, I live in New Zealand, and we do not get the Stargate on our TV, so if I want to see him, I can buy a DVD, and season 10 is not here yet, so I can not see it for some time ( which is very depressing). However, this program is very good, and is a must see, but keep in mind, it is very addictive. Thus, in the Summery I Love Stargate (and Tapping).
