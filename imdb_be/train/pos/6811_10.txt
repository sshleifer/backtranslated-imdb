Although I do not like remakes, believing that remakes are a waste of time; this film is no exception. I really do not know until now, while reading the previous comments, it's a remake, so my opinion purely on actual film and not a comparison. <br /> <br /> The history and how it was not written does not matter: it's hood. There's no need more words. <br /> <br /> The game is Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is superb. I saw several films with them, each of which in one way or another. I was sure that they are good actors, and in the case of Eric, I always wondered why his sister was known star number 1, and not her brother. At this time, this confidence does not rise to the fact, not a question. His game, just like the game g-Edwards clearly across the top of his profession. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to be on your top 50 films to see and hold on DVD shelves.
