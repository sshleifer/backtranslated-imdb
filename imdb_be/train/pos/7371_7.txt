Disturbing thriller that bears some resemblance to the deprivation, for decoration and customization. There are also some very innovative scene and good music, although daftness and sometimes seemingly careless attitude of one of the characters inappropriate to the situation, although it is not a mayor problem. It also raises interesting questions about the justification of revenge and friendship border. <br /> <br />
