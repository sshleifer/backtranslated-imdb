Fascinating, a great look at the movies that inspired the great Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he says lightly to his work, especially early, dumb. Very nice, although a bit long, I found it to be one of the best documentaries about the movie yet. Be sure to check if you are fond of Martin Scorsese and his work.
