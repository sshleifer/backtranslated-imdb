I saw this film when I was about 8 years old and I liked it, but it was not until I watched it again at the age of 13 that I really realized it for what it is; Cartoon of criminal dog with real heart of gold "takes" a little girl to use her for her talent to talk to animals. Dog star Charlie B. Barkin, killed his official business partner, Carface, (which is absolutely diabolical, by the way). His soul then goes to where else but the sky only to find a gold watch, which is actually the time of his life, Charlie, being sneaky, but lovable cad that he is stealing and rewinding, sending it back to Earth. Once on Earth, Charlie comes to seeking revenge evil Carface. This is how he comes to the young Anne-Marie, a lonely little orphan, who can talk to animals, which Charlie is planning to swindle of their talents in order to return to his Carface enemy. But the villain Charlie actually comes to the care of the young Anne-Marie and his unfoil plans, he must make up your mind to do what is right after Anne-Marie discovers that her "best friend" Charlie really used it to earn money for the newest and best casino dog. Now he has to save her from a terrible Carface. I still love this movie, even at the age of 22 years, the idea and the story is very different and unique from many other animated films. I particularly like the idea that the dog plays the role of a villain at a time. Carface was even better than he was in the All dogs go to heaven sequel. In this film, he appeared very doubtful of his role of villain.
