I feel there is a mixture of embarrassment and varying degrees of personal taste in reaction to this film. Yes, there is a vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes, covers here. Even martial arts stereotypes. All is well, and certainly not all well done. Nevertheless, I feel an important point about this film does not notice ... the cultural significance of its location. The film is in Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to say so. This is a bold step into the world of cinema today, and a rare treat for fans of indie films. Indeed, this may not be the last. Pensacola is known worldwide as the city of the navy, aviation town, city lumber, and sometimes even as a hotbed for political differences. Rarely it is seen as a growing city of the film. But all this could change. More film companies come to shoot. And native Pensacolians open power movie for yourself. This film is part of a growing trend in the Pensacola-based indie movies, and more on the way. Pensacola makes a great noise in the world cinema community, as well as the world receives more attention. Watch and listen to the world. In Pensacolians go. As the virus.
