Spoilers! <br /> <br /> From the moment I saw a local film critic Trash this movie in this review at 10:00 the news, I would like to see it. I do not remember who it was, or a local Omaha newscast under review, but the critic was very insistent that the film was too fired for the average church-going Nebraskan. They showed an excerpt from the scene where John Glover is going to steal the NBC Margrethe when she swims in the pool. Glover's character is appreciating her how well her body and so on, using a lot of words about what the local felt need to edit the station. I was hooked. There was one question, though. I was only 13 years old at the time, and I had to wait a whole year before he went to the cable. Let's just say it's worth the wait! <br /> <br /> If ever there was a gloating my, this film it. To call this film raunchy would be a huge understatement. The film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed three small time thugs after an affair with a young woman. Roy Scheider, who is just as effective, as always, plays a poor guy who just wanted a little affair, and now is dominated by three stunning villains. The character of John Glover is one of the most memorable of all time scum. He is sneaky, sometimes funny, and always on the border to do something crazy. Then Robert Trebor (in a good name, by the way!) Character, Leo, who is clearly in over his head with this scheme of blackmail. He was crying, sweating, a coward who runs Peep Show place with live nude models. Then you have the Clarence Williams III of, Bobby Shy, brooding sociopath who just afraid of reason. Who could forget the wake-up call, he gives a thumbs with a giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After dealing with the initial shock of realizing that he is against, Scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation, that is, until Glover does not go after him wife! The conflict is played hard, with almost the entire cast get shot, raped, or blown up. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I love this movie so much. This really should creep me, but it is not. Maybe it's because all these characters are interesting, and the story takes a lot of chances that most movies today would never try. It's scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters, like Glover run in the memo, looking for trouble. Just think of his voice was enough to make me giggle. "Hey, sport, have a nice day!Â» <br /> <br /> In this film there are a lot of fights, cool cars, a large dialog box (for example, the line in his introduction), and a decent action. Many cameos by real life porn stars. Look for Ron Jeremy frolicking around in the hot tub with two chicks in the party scene on the spot Glover. <br /> <br /> Another thing I should add: How hot are the women in this movie ??? Wow! Travolta did the right thing by marrying Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see the vanity to get naked at the time, before she became a born-again Christian. And Ann-Margret. What else can you say about it except that it is the quintessence of American beauty. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars <br /> <br /> So sayeth Beagle <br /> <br /> Posted February 14, 2008: .. RIP Roy Scheider!
