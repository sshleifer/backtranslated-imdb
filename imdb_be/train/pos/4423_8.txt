GoJoe takes a little getting used to at first, but the end result is very satisfactory. Tale of a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself opposed to the effeminate, but dangerous Samurai, worth more than watch. There is a lot at stake, from the physical to the spiritual survival of salvation. The film may seem a bit like another anime-inspired Samurai movie at first, but it eventually delve into the territory of more mature / adult shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed. GoJoe is one of the best samurai films to come after Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films)
