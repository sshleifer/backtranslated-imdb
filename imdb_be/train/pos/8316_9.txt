I watched this movie every chance I got back in the seventies, when he went to the cables. This was my introduction to Harlem, that fascinated me (and Bill Clinton) so far. I was still very young, and the film made a great impression on me. It was great to see a film about the other young girls growing up, trying to decide who they want to be, and make some bad choices as well as good. I was dazzled by the beauty of Lonettogo Mac Key to pay more in the end they got to wear, and the instant dialogue. As someone raised a single mother, and I could really identify with these girls and their lives. Ironically, these characters seem almost more real to me than Beyonce!
