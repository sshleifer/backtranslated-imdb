After dipping his fingers in Giallo pool with a masterful film "The Amazing Mrs. vice WardhÂ» (1971), directed by Sergio Martino was followed in the same year, so that is another twisty thriller, "The point of a scorpion's tail." Like his previous efforts, this one star handsome macho dude George Hilton, who would go on to star satanic / Giallo hybrid Martin "All the colors in the dark" in the next year. "Scorpion tail" also shows the actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who would go on the show a couple of unfortunate (to put it mildly!) In Martin "Your pressure locked room and only I have the key" (1972). (I just love that name!) I believe Edwige Fenech was busy month they shot it! Anyway, the film boasts a stylish direction that supporters would expect Martino and tortuous story, some finely made pieces set of murder, and beautiful Athenian shooting location. The history of this time comes to insurance investigator (the Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, here, looking like a prettier Tara Fawcett, smarter sister) who are involved in a series of gruesome murders following a plane crash, and the inheritance of $ 1 million for a beautiful widow, I really thought, that this picture is found out in the middle, but I was wrong. Although the story makes perfect sense in this Giallo, I may have to see the film again to fully appreciate all its subtleties. Highlights of the paintings, for me, was the struggle of cat and mouse with a killer Anita at the end, especially the alarming house break-in, and a nifty battle on top of a tiled roof; many good line of action in this movie! Small people should not be ashamed to give thanks for another great look DVD, with good subtitling and interesting. Whotta great outfit he was in his ongoing quest to bring these lost Italian gems from oblivion.
