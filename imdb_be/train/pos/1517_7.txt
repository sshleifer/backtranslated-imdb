From the mind of Robert Bloch, the "Psycho" fame, come four winding tale of terror in this anthology film Amicus, which, although not quite as much fun or scary as I would like to continue to provide some decent entertainment genre. <br /> <br /> This is due to wrap-around stories very skeptical Scotland Yard detective (John Bennett), who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor; He said that this case is linked to several others in the house, in which they took place, and our film and run. <br /> <br /> «the killing method" has the author Charles Hillyer (always a good Denholm Elliott) pursues his latest fictional creation, which seems to be alive. This sequence has good surreal and rather anxious moments, and surmounted by a rather amusing discovery and isolation. <br /> <br /> «Waxworks» Peter Cushing stars horror icon retired Stockbroker Philip Grayson, who, together with an old friend, Neville Rogers (Ekland) becomes obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a terrible wax museum. The most effective in this episode is a dream sequence, although it is fine, as always look Cushing. The final image presented to us in this story is quite shocking. <br /> <br /> «Sweetness sweet tooth", there is another well-loved star of horror films, Christopher Lee, John Reid, who did not treat the child beautiful baby Jane (Chloe Franks) too much kindness, and it is up to the new partner / teacher Ann Norton (naira Don Porter), to find out why. The mystery of this particular episode is handled perfectly; filmmakers wisely entirely tilted his hand so that comes as much of this shock, we receive the full truth of this dysfunctional family. The "die" moments especially terrible <br /> <br /> «Invisible" is the most open of the four comedy. Jon Pertwee, one of the many actors playing the role of Dr. Who for many years, it's great fun as vain, temperamental horror movie stars (in fact, it is the highlight of this story), who, furious with the lack of quality in its latest low-budget film , goes out and buys his cloak. Said coat has strange powers, which I dare not reveal here. Sexy Ingrid Pitt welcome presence as a companion Pertwees; One example here is the knowledge of humor Jeb made at none other than Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The final fiction then concludes in a predictable, but nevertheless effective as Detective Holloway finds out that he must have. accepted all the warnings given him more seriously <br /> <br /> emphasized unusual, strange and awful dress by Michael in "The House that dripped blood" is an entertaining blend of history; while I do not like it quite the same way as, say, "Tales from the Crypt", it is still very fun. A skilled director Peter Duffell, it is moving slowly but surely in relation to each of its frightening conclusions, and, of course, a good film of its type. <br /> <br /> 7/10
