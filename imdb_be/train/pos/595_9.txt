When John Wayne filmed his story Alam, he built a full set of Alam in Brackettsville, Texas, which still exists and is quite a tourist attraction. By that time, as it should, we have set for future interpretations Alam on the screen. One of Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton has been done in this century <br /> <br /> But I would say, Alamo :. Thirteen Days to Glory Alamo best story I've seen removed. John Wayne movie is a good, if shot down, but it's the film of John Wayne from the story reworked to fill the screen parameters of the character of John Wayne. Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett here and provides an excellent interpretation of the reckless nature of the border it. <br /> <br /> This is much closer to the book by Professor Lon ringing at the Alamo than Wayne movie and read the book years ago, I can confirm this. Book ringing is listed as a source for both movies, but Tinkle, who was alive when Wayne movie was made, and he was not happy with the result. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin was about the right age for a young William Barret Travis, the idealistic freedom fighter, who by the way was the slave-owners. Back in the day, no one saw the ironic contradiction in this. One thing that had not been studied and is not hyperactive libido Travis. It was Casanova in the south-west, he even kept a diary of his obscene libidinal gains. <br /> <br /> But the man who always gets whitewash Jim Bowie played here Arness. He was the hero of the Alamo, to be sure, but his career Alam to that scoundrel. He was a smuggler, a slave trader, all around the sale of land swindler he had the dubious ownership. But his heroic death, of course, has redeemed him. No hint of what is in the picture Arness, nor any other that I saw Bowie on the screen. And, of course, he did design a knife Bowie, enclosed in its specification. This person need such weapons <br /> <br /> However, the main asset of which Alam :. Thirteen Days to Glory is a full-scale image of Antonio de Lopez de Santa Anna, president of Mexico, who comes personally to crush the rebellion incited the Americans, who came to settle in Texas in the Mexican invitation. Unfortunately, the Americans have come up with some preconceived notions of freedom, that just did not make it that far to the south, at least freedom for white people. Raul Julia game Santa Anna, which is even more controversial figure in Mexican history. He was also very rascal, but he was the best in Mexico was made to the present reformer at the Benito Juarez came together. <br /> <br /> This film was a farewell performance Lorne Greene, who appears briefly as General Sam Houston. Greene is not really my concept of Houston, he was really too old for the role, Houston was in the early forties in 1836, it was not the patriarch of Texas. But within imposed on him, Greene does an excellent job. <br /> <br /> For a romantic Narrating about Alam tale sure to see the version of John Wayne, but for historical content, I recommend this film highly.
