I really liked this version of Emma's best. Kate Beckinsale was strange how Emma and Mark Strong was very good, as a knight. only complaint that I had was Mr. woodhouse..i can not believe that people can whine as much or as selfish life..she his daughter was a clever girl in the end though. As always, I love the place where they were shot films of Jane Austen. settings so spectular. it makes me want to visit England 9aS as well as Ireland and Scotland) I think that the actors chosen for the film was a good choice, as well as all the other storylines interwhined Emma the most wonderful! I am glad that I have to see this as well.
