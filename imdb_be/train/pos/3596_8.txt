I finally sat down and saw this movie all the way through, and I must say I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses --- it's not just the fact that it can * act, but she chooses roles that are best suited to it, which are more significant and important than that was the first, I think. I have read some comments that express their relief that it was not some kind of terrible feminist thing, they thought that in advance, but I certainly do not agree. Diana feminist. It keeps track of your dreams and believe in themselves despite the fact that almost everyone around her thinks (except for her caring brother Tiny and her coach and manager, Hector, who is a father figure than her real parent), which is that the word "feminism" is all about. It's good to see the movie as it is showing this side of feminism - that they are not a bunch of losers manhating - but they have dreams and can do anything. Diana true to herself while still falls prey to love, and she, and Adrian, more realistic, complex relationships, and not only that magically work out. Girlfight true taste of reality and put some confidence back into my perception of people. . Thank you, Michelle <br /> <br /> 8-10 - is a very important film, it Relatable, not only to young women, but they all want to go far in life.
