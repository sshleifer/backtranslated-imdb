This show is awesome! I have been a fan since it premiered, and it only makes me look ... I saw horrible things here that I wish I had not, BUT, it really shows how drug addiction affects all participants, not just addict. You can see all kinds of different addictions, from drugs and alcohol in a shopping addict, eating disorders or drug addict. Indeed, it is very sad to see some of the famous personalities that come through too. We have seen, experienced musicians, the player NBA, and even young people who really need help. And since they have begun to show a few follow-up, which was awesome too. Now, you can see them for a long time after their EP ether. If you have not checked this one, please. It is on the A & E, and it's amazing! New EPS Sunday night at 10 pm EST, if I remember correctly ... so set the TiVo!
