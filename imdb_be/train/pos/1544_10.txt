This is a great, but it's hard to find a trippy First World War spy thriller in the Italian style of the inimitable 60s. With psychedelic graphics opening credits and a large number of Ennio Morricone to the lesbian love scene with Capucine and artfully made apocalyptic no man land battle scenes with poisonous gas and the German cavalry in full-protection program "Sturmovik" is a movie that should not be missed. This is a film that captures the horror and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of the players on and off the battlefield. In addition to the battle scenes, some of the production and special effects are primitive, apparently because a large part of the budget for this film was retained for the battle scenes, but for fans of '60s movie, this should not be a problem. I first saw this movie on TV many years ago, and the foresight to tape it on VHS. I still enjoy watching the tape and again from time to time.
