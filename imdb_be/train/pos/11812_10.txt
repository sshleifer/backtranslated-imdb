This movie is the best movie to watch comic book feel. Sets, costumes and color just so bright it's just a step in the comics. This is a film that I think of when mentions Mob, suits, hats and relationships. <br /> <br /> Hoffman gives a comic as Mumbles and you can not help but feel sorry for Madonna as she tries and fails to win Tracy again. This movie contains all the classic mob cliche - to hide people in the concrete by blowing peoples car tying up a good guy and trying to undermine his girlfriend home <br /> <br /> This film is a classic in the history of meaning. the word angels camera urge comics. Its so great to be able to return to the old movie and see someone he knew, as a comic has to be done in the cinema after watching the mistakes such as Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> !!! You should see this film !!!!
