«Hundstage» is the first feature film in Seidl (he sent a great documentaries like "animal love" or "model"). Seidl worked on this project for more than 3 years, but it only cost about $ 2 million. the actors are very good especially the non-professional actors who have played almost themselves.the cinema also good. the entire film is shocking and alarming, some scenes may be too much for a "normal» viewers.the film shows a lot of sex and violence, but also the fact that people are alone and unable to communicate with each other. in the end I say that this is one of the best and most useful of Austrian films in recent years. Please excuse my bad english. <br /> <br />
