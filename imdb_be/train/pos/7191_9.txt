Reed Hadley makes a dapper Don Diego better than him dashing and daring Zorro, but it's almost beside the point, because this series shows a bar-NONE best song of any series ever - and the best version of the famous stagecoach Yakimov Kanatt in the trick. There are other good tricks and a lot of action and a lot of hair tools cliff hanger chapter endings, but if for no other reason, you should see this movie, to watch the stagecoach trick, and then re-watch in slow motion. It's incredible, and despite the low budget of this chapter of the game is to translate better to take the trick here than it is in a much more well-known film "Stagecoach". Indiana Jones, eat your heart out: This is the real deal!
