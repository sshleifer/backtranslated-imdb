When I first saw Â«A Cry in the Dark", I had no idea what the story was. But when I saw it, I was shocked by the fact that he portrayed. When I saw him for the second time in the Australian film class, I realized the second point: the problem of communication. You see, when Dingo snatched (Meryl Streep) Linda Chamberlain child, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were heartbroken, but did not show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted it to happen, and so they could not mourn him. But when people across Australia saw them no grief, everyone started to believe that Linda did it himself. <br /> <br /> The fact is, incorrect messages received communicated to the public, and there were people against Lindy. Despite the fact that this is pure coincidence, it still happened. It may be one of the biggest disasters as a result of the existence of the media, regardless of the political views of any media in. <br /> <br /> As for the performances, Streep does a very good job with the Australian accent (no surprise there) and Sam Neill are equally great. You will probably get blown away just what you see here. Definitely one of the best Skepisi films ever.
