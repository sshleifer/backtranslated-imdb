The name is a sound that makes one of the characters as he drives his cart through the apparent garbage dump, where the characters live. The film is based on a series of short stories and Shugoro Yamamoto tells about a group of people who effectively live in old houses on the edge of the dump. This mixture was laughter and sadness. <br /> <br /> The first color film shot Akria Kurasowa was that I wanted to see for a long time. Awful it is often referred to as being available only in an abridged version of the three or four hours of the original due to an error during the execution of some promotional materials. I went for the full version, expecting Kurasowa wanted to see, only to learn about the recent release of the Criterion, that the 140 minute version of the full version. <br /> <br /> And finally, getting to see the movie last night I have mixed emotions about the movie. In the first place it is visually associated with each film that was. You can see each of the remaining six films Kurasowals reflected in this film, until the drawn approaches. Its an amazing film in the use of color, and you can understand why it took so long to film, he would he happy (of course there are bad projects, as well). The film is a visual work of art. (Although keep in mind if you are going to see it on a widescreen TV it was filmed so 1.33 will appear in the normal ratio TV). The rest of the film is ambiguous. Part of the problem lies in the fact that the lives of all these people who do not quite add up. In some tales, they all work fine, but as a cinematic whole, they do not hang like one. I do not blame Kurasowa, it is not always possible to hit things out of the box, especially if someone like Robert Altman, specializing in several characters of this kind of films sometimes bombed themselves. <br /> <br /> This ISN "t say that there is no reason to see the movie. How will all the films Kurasowa there are always reasons to see his movies, whether they work or not. The first trip, "carriage" is one of the best things that ever made Kurasowa and worth the price. Its one of the most charming moments in the history of cinema, as the trolley inspected and pulls. Father and son lived in the car touching (though ultimately very boring), and there are other bits and pieces that are light (like a cast, which over the side of a large) and should, at least, try to film as something other than human, we usually associated with samurai movies and crime dramas. <br /> <br /> It is intriguing misfire from a master filmmaker, which means that in this case, means that it is better than most other successful directors. <br /> <br /> between 6 and 7 as a whole, is much higher in parts.
