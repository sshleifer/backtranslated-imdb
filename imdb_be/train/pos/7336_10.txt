This is another fantasy favorite of Ralph Bakshi; after watching it on YouTube, that is. Set in the distant past, after the Ice Age, the prehistoric sword and sorcery quest between good and evil. Nekron, Lord kingdom of ice, and his mother, Queen Juliana, have set their sights on conquering the known world. If they destroy the glaciers is a village with a man named Lan, he (Lan) vows to avenge his people to kill the Ice Lord. Meanwhile, sub-human assistants Nekron Juliana capture and hot daughter Firekeep King Jarol Princess Teegra; but she manages to escape, and finally meets with Lang, who promises to accompany her to Firekeep; if the sub-people do not find them in the first place. <br /> <br /> This film did very little cash (like most movies Bakshi), but has become a cult classic, partly because of the quality of the art, a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantasy artist Frazetta. Also, I heard that the script was written by Gerry Conway i Roy Thomas, the two men that made Conan comics history and background artists include James Gurney, Dinotopia illustrator of novels; though admittedly, I've never read Conan or Dinotopia. And the artist Thomas Kinkade, known for his artwork for figurines, music boxes for Bradford Exchange Company in addition to paintings. And Bakshi films in The Lord of the Rings and American pop music, this film was rotoscoped, but the process works better in this film than in the first. <br /> <br /> So all in all, I think this is one of the best animated science fiction films ever made, and a strange collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frazetta. With a lot of fantasy, sexual overtones, and exciting adventures.
