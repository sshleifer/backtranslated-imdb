This is the first review I have written to IMDb so bare with me, but I caught this movie on HBO and was sure glad I watched it. Richard Gere is great in this movie, like a hot agent / detective who bends the rules to get the job done. I think the story is great, and there's never a dull scene, which slows down the pace of the film down. Some parts of the film that have to do with dementia sex addiction is quite shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime movie like Se7en, you'll be able to digest the scene just fine. <br /> <br /> So all in all, if you are looking for a good detective / suspense movie, ignore the low rating this movie on IMDb, and got picked to watch.
