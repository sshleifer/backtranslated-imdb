My main problem with the film is that it is too long. Other then that it is very good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who was going to get married through arranged marriage. Luise Rainer maid who marries Muni. They live with his father Muni on the farm, and they do very badly. When he finally gets some money to buy some more land, drought hit and nothing grows. All Star North Mooney remains behind in the ground. When they come and go into the city, they believe that they do not have jobs, and they are worse than before. They even think about selling my youngest daughter as a slave to some money, but the decision against him. When a group of people begin to loot the city, the military show and start executing people. Paul Muni is doing a good job and Luise Rainer won a second Oscar for this film.
