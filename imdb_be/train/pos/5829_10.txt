This is one of my two or three favorite panties the Stooges, and, undoubtedly, the best performance of a trio of Christine McIntyre. It is good in a number of other cowards, but here it is absolutely brilliant. Her singing is not funny, it really is quite beautiful, but the plot is constructed in such a way that singing improves mood, rather than detracting from it. We listen to MacIntyre singing voice completeness spring no less than three times, but it never gets old, partly because we do not get tired of her voice, and partly because it blends so well with the antics of puppets. Using Opera soprano comedy recalls the role of Kitty Carlisle in the Marx Brothers A Night At The Opera ", but the singing is much more part of a comedy than in the" Opera "and McIntyre (perhaps more than in other productions than here) showed comedic talent of their own Carlisle never did. clown The Stooges', singing McIntyre, and well-constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars.
