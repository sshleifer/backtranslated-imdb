Kirk and the crew lands on a desolate planet where the sun is about to explode. They're going to evacuate, but to find a place for desert Mr. Atoz, which manages a high-tech library, except. Despite trying to get a straight answer from him about the whereabouts of each, Atoz indifferent to their issues and insists that they must be quick "to make a choice, there is still time. They do not have the slightest idea what he was talking about, but wander, looking at the hand-mirrored drives to the audience, and they see the images of the past of the planet. then, while the disc is in the viewer, Kirk passes through the doorway and magically transported back in time to the fact that the world will look like times Louis XIV (1660s). If McCoy and C Gen. follow another drive in the viewer, and they go to the ice age hell. Too late they realize that the library is a journey in a time machine and storage. <br /> <br /> While Kirk's visit with ' is quite short and not all that exciting, Spock and McCoy are much more eventful as Spock falls head over heels for Mariette Hartley -. which was sent to this terrible place as punishment Scenes from Spock's extremely interesting and very atypically normal logic boy <br /> <br /> Spock departure from the norm, wildly inventive script and very different locale make this an exceptional episode. - one worth seeing. <br /> <br /> FYI - Ian Wolfe, a great actor character, played by Mr. Atoz. I'm a big fan of old movies and saw him as a supporting and bit player in numerous films in the '30s and' 40s, and he looked almost exactly as it did in this episode since 1969. It is interesting that, despite looking at old, he lived for another 23 years - dying for 95 years !!
