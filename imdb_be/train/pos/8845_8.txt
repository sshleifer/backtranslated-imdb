At the beginning of this film is a bit awkward and confusing, but sit tight, because you are on the trip of your life. The concept is convincing, interesting devices are used to tell the overall story. There are excellent performances all around, with Hoffman being the best of the cast is not surprising there. Ethan Hawke is also to be commended for a very high performance, as well. G Lyumeta direction is outstanding. The film has a seventies feel in the sense that the risks taken in the message of the story, but unlike most banal films that populate the landscape today is a thriller that truly is based on relationships rather than special effects or plugs products, you will be rewarded for the time spent in this film.
