I loved this movie. Firstly, because it is a family film. Secondly, because it offers a refreshing take on the deal with the news of HIV in the family, with far less hysterical than what I normally seen in movies. The brothers are very close, but does not judge. Their desire to protect the younger brother noble, but it is not necessary in the end. I understand that the choice of Leo about how to deal with his treatment might not have been the most popular one with men, but I figured it was the right choice for him. I can not believe that it was a French television programs. It had great production values. I gave this film ten, and I think that you, too, as soon as you saw it.
