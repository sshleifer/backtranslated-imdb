Normally I really like films such as "Most likely," but I was not completely satisfied with it for several reasons. The first half was pretty well done overall, with Alex Finch dies and reincarnation in a new body (played by Robert Davni- Jr.). he meets his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and one (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who is now grown. Scenes with meeting them again, and Downey, who again he once was well done, and there is a good amount emotions and happiness once Shepherd finally believes that its actually her husband to turn camping, but the movie goes downhill from there. There are a few scenes involving sex-that transformed me completely, especially Downey and Shepherd wants to get together again, despite the difference in their ages at the moment. After that, however, the film has managed to finish in the most satisfactory manner possible, given the circumstances of the story. I was disappointed because I did not expect that the film has become so immoral to end. had a great potential of this story, and in the sky the scene is well done. There is a good song performed by Peter Cetera and Cher, but in the end the film is not great. For the best, like the film, try to «Heaven Can Wait». Decent, but I really kind of sorry I did not see it from behind the scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
