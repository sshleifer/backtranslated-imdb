I always love this movie, when he appears on TV. <br /> <br /> One scene that always stands out to me is, is one of Myrna Loy and Brigadier artists, where she gives him very clear instructions by color and how she just goes, he turns his men and said "Have you got what it yellow, blue, green and white"
