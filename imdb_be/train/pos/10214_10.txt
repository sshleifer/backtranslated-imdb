For me, this review may contain spoilers, but I love to watch movies, not having any idea about what is going to happen, so that's why I think that many of the other reviews here that the film contains spoilers! <br /> <br /> I just watched it again, and I must repeat that it is the best finish for any movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. The actual translation of "Beating Wings Butterfly", oddly enough, is not used as the translated name. I guess they thought that most Americans do not know that Chaos Theory is (for those who have seen or read "Jurassic Park", with the exception). The film is based on the chaos theory, and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events that all lead back to a single event. The film is a whirlwind of amazing cause and effect, as we walk the chain of chaos, as it weaves between several characters (about 20?). In a sense, the ending seems inevitable, in spite of this, but if you think about it, this is the perfect ending. Think to yourself, "what more need be said?" It is at the same time a very brave ending. It is a pity that we have to go abroad on a gem like this, but the ending, as it would never have come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
