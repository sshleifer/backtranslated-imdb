Michael Cacoyannis was relatively long career, but has surprisingly little credit to his name, including some real duds such as the Cold War not funny satire Day fish left. Iphigenia, however, is a highlight. Cacoyannis adapted from the play by Euripides, is an excellent rendering of classical tragedy and recently made his first television appearance for many years in the United States grace Flix channel. The film was shot in an epic scale, but certainly not a "big" movie, with an emphasis on simple story: in prayer to the gods, the king Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoshit), to the horror of Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are outstanding, but it's a terrific Papamoschou, which brings the most interesting items on the screen, which blends the innocence of childhood to the implementation it is clear that it is a pawn in a political game. It is highly recommended for fans of international cinema.
