Alain Delon visited the fast, accurate revenge ruthless crime family, who hired him as a hit man in Duccio Tessari thriller «Big Guns» after they accidentally kill his wife and child. Tessari and screenwriters Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore with "Minutes to pray, the second to die", and Franco Verucci of the "Ring of Death" actioneer take this career for the crowd to shoot straight to the wire. Indeed, «Big Guns» fairly predictable, but it still qualifies as a solid entertainment with a lot of wild and often sudden murders. Alain Delon to "godson" is appropriately laconic as he methodically distributes the death of heads of mafia families who refused to allow him to retire so that he could enjoy life with their young son and daughter. Richard Conte from "The Godfather" playing the Sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the hatchet with the character Delon, but the rest of his sober companions want to hit people dead. Like most crime thrillers of the 1960s and 1970s, «Big Guns» joins the cinematic morality that crime does not pay. Interestingly, the one person who has nothing to do with the murder of the wife and son of the hero survives, and the second character changes with extreme prejudice. Tessari not lose a second in the 90 minute firing. In addition to the mother and son, dies in a car bomb intended for his father, the worst that happens is happening in the automotive junkyard, where the hero is crushed to associate stoned the car. Ostensibly, «Big Guns» relatively bloodless way out, but it has a high amount of body for the 1973 gangster melodrama. Only at the last moment does our hero let his guard, and so contrived morality eye to eye remains intact. Tessari steps a couple decent car chases and death of Don in the train that goes through the train tunnel as a bloody, violent as it gets thread. Photos and fine composition.
