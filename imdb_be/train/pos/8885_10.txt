Sometimes you have to look back to go forward. In the 60's I did. We must remember the past. The past is a part of the future. <br /> <br /> Great mix Gary J. Coppola. I see a great future. You deserve to be nominated and win the best mixer 60 years. <br /> <br /> The best miniseries of all time. <br /> <br /> Thank you Ursula <br /> <br />
