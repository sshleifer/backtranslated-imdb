I agree wholeheartedly with the comments at this time. I remember this film as one of the most amazing and informative I have ever seen. As mentioned above, I remember that I started to look, thinking it was just another study of nature - interesting, is not necessarily special, but I was so wrong. Not only is the history of the colony incredible, but I remember the music as being as much a part of this appeal. If I remember correctly, it was the home Americn pipe (like music at the end of One Flew Over the Cookoo slot in). I'm also looking for a copy. This should always be looking for anybody, but especially in schools. It must be reissued.
