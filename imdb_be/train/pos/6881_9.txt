As a film that shows the song Curtis Mayfield can be bad? It can not be! Groove Tube is a series of sketches koprologicheskih dense, making fun of anything since 2001 for the Olympic Games. Maxima (Coco the clown, light grease recipe) exceeds the minimum number (An overly long "dealers"), but even ridiculous lows. Best of all manic dance Ken Shapiro down busy Manhattan sidewalk. (That is, Shapiro, Sun Nat King Cole sings only you, Just Me). Definitely by now, but while The Groove Tube was irreverent, bold, shameless, and hysterically funny. Ken Shapiro made this minor cult hit, then 7 years later, made the discovery Christmas bomb, modern problems (although I liked it}, and since then, unfortunately, nothing. (He could play the drums in a jazz band) The Groove Tube remains for I have an endless surge of positive energy, a film that 26 years after my first viewing, still brings me real joy!
