I remember initially saw this film in the Radio City Music Hall, when he came out. I do not really understand the humor of the time, but this film can make me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Matthau really deserves an Oscar for this film. Its implementation is strange - considering the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. His manners are second to none. ( "Do you know what songs he wrote shit ?!" And, speaking to Spanish-speaking guy at the reception, "No! NO Enchilada !!Â») is absolutely hilarious <br /> <br! /> Kudos to Richard Benjamin, who played the straight man in the Matthau. <br /> <br /> I just want it to be on DVD, because my VHS recording gets a little old. <br /> <br /> I have no interest in that remake with Woody Allen, because in no way can it match the original.
