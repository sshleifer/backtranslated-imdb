With an all-star throw so impressive that it almost seems as «Mad Mad Mad Mad World» Horror pictures, "The Guardian" (1977), however, effectively a terrible film centering on a relatively unknown actress Christina Raines. In it, she plays a fashion model, Alison Parker, who moves in a brick Brooklyn Heights, which is (and I do not think I paid too much at this late date) is very close to the gates of hell. And as a tenant in the building, she was suffering much worse conditions than leaky plumbing and casual water mistakes, to put it mildly! Indeed, the scene in which Alison meets her noisy upstairs neighbor really scary, and, of course, is to send the icy water running down the spines of most viewers. Despite the complaints of many critics Raines acting skills, I thought it was just fine, more skilfully holding her own in scenes with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The picture builds effectively horrible conclusion, and although some plot are inexplicable, I left feeling more than satisfied. In the book «DVD Delirium» puts it, "any movie with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as topless lesbian cannibals in tights can not be all bad!" On a side note, yesterday I went to the 10 Montagu Terrace in Brooklyn Heights, to see at Sentinel house. Yes, it's still there, and though deprived of his heavy coat of ivy and the lack of a blind priest / nun in the top-floor window, looks the same as it was in this picture. If this house does sit at the entrance to hell, I mean, what the hell ... Brooklyn Queens. But the people of New York know that for some time!
