When I first saw Romeo division last spring, my first reaction was BRILLIANT! However, in the future viewing, I was given a lot more than a masterful film. This picture has a special voice that will echo around annul film history. <br /> <br /> The opening montage provides an excellent palette that Helmer JP Sarro uses to establish their art on the canvas entertainment. <br /> <br /> Sarro does use the camera as his brush, until he brings us along on a walk that envelops the audience in a huge action movie, which goes beyond the traditional format we're used to, and dives deep into the dark treachery threads revenge and the importance of communication. This movie is the dream of every director in its very core. <br /> <br /> However, Sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking. Drafting provided Marking Tim Sheridan, it was just as exciting. <br /> <br /> dialogue was so precise and direct, that he gave the actor of such presence and charisma on the screen. Specifically, the final scene (Warning: spoilers !!! SPOILERS !!!), where Vanessa reveals itself as one of the coalition and the villain of all time, written in a darker tone that is one of the most chilling end I've ever seen. Sheridan next Robert Towne. <br /> <br /> As a final note, it is obvious that this production was not a feat. <br /> <br /> So much praise should be given to producer Scott Shipley, who seems to have creativity and talent to walk with Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before have I been witness to such a grand production with so much attention directed to every detail. Manufacturers work is one of the most difficult in any film and Shipley makes it look easy. <br /> <br /> In general, this film combines creative writing, stunning production and workshop area. It's an art film at its best. If the end of the film only comes, it takes more. <br /> <br /> Department Romeo groundbreaking masterpiece and, most importantly, the Department Romeo is truly an art.
