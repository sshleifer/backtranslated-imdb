I remember, Parker Posey on «As The World Turns», before she became the queen of the independent movie. In this film, Posey shows its potential as a top-opera actress. In this film, a supporting cast that includes Omar Townsend like Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a trader falafel on the street who want to become a teacher. The supporting cast is outstanding actress who plays her, and Phillips only relative of the family, Judy, a librarian who fashioned, devoted and menopause. Posey, Mary learns that she needs to grow and mature. The loss of her librarian position clerk makes her realize how much she misses him a place in her life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side Village in New York, before he became a gentrified yuppie. This film is good enough for an independent and I have come to enjoy Parker Posey, Mary, as well as other characters in other films.
