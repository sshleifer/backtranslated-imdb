Like many of you, I'm a big fan of the real thing - 1940s noir films - but Red Rock West was a real treat for all of us longing for the past. The term "neo-noir" was so often used improperly, in the past ten years, it has lost its meaning and its influence. John Dahl's film on the other hand, really deserves to be described as such. Casting everything around and to feel at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is so tight that you hooked within the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would appreciate it. Many of today's films leave me wondering why they do not make them like they used to, and I'm not even that old. Films such as Red Rock West give us hope for the future, paying tribute to the past.
