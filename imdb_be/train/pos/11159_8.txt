This is a great movie ... First impressions of the cynicism and brutality soon dissipate fun loving display, both men's and women's baser motives differ (Vive la difference!) <br /> <br /> You can love people in spite of, and sometimes because of their weakness. Human beings are a bit rubbish really, but we have big hearts, and we will try our best, in spite of the temptation. It is not our fault if sometimes can not resist the temptation, it's just who we are <br /> <br /> There stylishness consistent from start to finish. clear photos and sharp composition, very nice view when you add the provocative content, is well suited to music and laughing loudly scripts <br /> <br /> Watch out for the very young, "the lone voice of the wise" ... brilliant. the wisdom of innocence balances comedy of the human condition.
