This film is about the seventeenth century Italian artists and one artist in particular, a woman wormwood, unheard profession for women at the time, and she decided to draw a male nude detailing his unique musculature. <br /> <br /> camera work in the main room for where artists mostly worked. There are some great shots. Macro of candles offer beautiful works of classical artists and fascinating to watch the artist and student support complex scaffolding brushing the details of religious murals. Not surprisingly, the artistic elements of the film (costumes, facial, makeup) rather beautifully authentic, because the Italian church kept all these details in his murals for many centuries. Beautiful wormwood urged her parents to study under the guidance of the great Florentine artist, Tassi, who became a specialist in the field of perspective and landscape painting (something very new) but unsuspecting wormwood introduced newer techniques in painting. After posing for her, Tassi brutally rapes her. Her father is outraged. Litigation costs. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama is a rather simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. A distinctive feature of the film is its artistry and attention to detail. Scenes such as women, running across the field with the wind inflated the volume of their clothes add amazing effects <br /> <br /> wormwood says she draws to please himself. her father draws to please others. As for this film, it will please the most, I think.
