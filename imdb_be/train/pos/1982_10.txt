It was my favorite movie as a child, and I was in the stage of production several times, so it will always be my favorite muscical, and I doubt that anyone could again make the story of Oliver Twist on the screen is better than this one did. <br /> <br /> My favorite "" bad guy "," to be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. Not only that, it scares the life of mine, when I watched the 6-year-old, but now, as a woman, I can empathize more with the character of Nancys bar maid / prostitute who helps Oliver to get the life he deserves. <, Br /> <br /> Jack Wild as the beast, was fantastic, and I do not think anyone could outdo him as a street-pocket picker, and best friend Fezhin. The music is fantastic, especially the rooms Fezhin, I'm also very grateful that they did not give Bill Sykes musical numbers, this is not worked out with him to be such a sinister character. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed did an excellent job of sticky ending Nancy, holding it the G rated film, masking her beating, but gives far enough to show Bill's violence towards her. <br /> <br /> This film is both charming and charismatic as a music to sing along to as well as a moving drama that is a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life.
