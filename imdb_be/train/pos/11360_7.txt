Chris Zherolmo took care to not just give us the type of `Jack-The-stripper" list of dead people he delved into the psychological characteristics with convincing results. Maybe mainly due to the outstanding performance of Stephen Rea plays off against Donald Sutherland, both with good empathy. It was a game of these two parts ?? first of all ?? which made the film something more than just a painful account of the history of the butcher of Rostov. Supporting actors, especially Max von Sydow, hold their part very well. Good direction. The photo was too good. Needless to say, the fact that the movie was filmed in Hungary was obliged to make a few aberrations, but to be honest, given the depth of the story and the interpretations, we can completely forget these little trivialia. <br /> <br /> for a time, made-for-TV movie on HBO came up trumps. It is recommended, especially if you want to analyze characteriology and forget some painful scene ?? which, I hasten to add, I never exaggerated.
