This is a really fun movie. One of those that you can sit and mindlessly watch as the story becomes more and more twisted; more and more ridiculous. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (her hey-day), Kevin Kline, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey Jr. ... It is these well-known actors, the quality of acting as if they were soap operas stars / producers. If you've ever watched a soap opera, and thought, "How did they come up with this idea ??", you'll love this movie. I saw him several times; and every time I look, the more I appreciate the humor, the more I realize how well it worked in reality. Do not expect the quality of the Oscars. This is an interesting film to entertain and not some baroque attempt to find a "man's inner man", etc. sit back, relax and laugh.
