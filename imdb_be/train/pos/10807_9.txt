I just saw this movie, and fell in love with her. There is a little something for everyone, and its concrete is free for all, when it comes to romance between the Lachlan and Liv. If they are on the beach, I almost cried ... there is a tacit understanding that time is the most valuable commodity, and it is most obvious when they are together. This idea is taken from several points of view, from his marriage to sibblings to find love in the least ordinary places. The film almost makes you long for such despair, when you know that tomorrow may very well be your last. Crowe is especially great in his role Lachlan. I've always had a weakness for the accent, but I almost melted with his image of his character. This way the film was made and beautiful, the music, the background of open fields and the wonderful action. All together, it's a great movie that pulls all human emotions.
