If you have any sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue, and performance - without the need to sing every twelve minutes - it's a Disney movie for you! My sons loved every minute of this film, and I must admit that I laughed many times throughout the film. There's no juicy songs to get in the way well-told story, and all the characters are cute, and are identified in their own right. It must go down as one of the "classic" Disney because of its beautifully illustrated landscape and its non-stop excitement!
