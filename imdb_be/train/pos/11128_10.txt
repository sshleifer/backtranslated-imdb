Firstly, I would like to say how big. It's strange and sometimes shocking. And, to put it mildly, I'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely worth a boring movie, but it's not boring. It's like a journey through humanity. His harsh realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It is heart-rending tale of two down and a sidewalls (Voight and Hoffman), who build mutual friendship. Joe Buck (Voight), a naive Texan Stallion arrives in New York to make it entertaining wealthy woman. Soon he meets Rico "Ratso" Rizzo (Hoffman), which is a poor man barely able to pay the rent. Ratso becomes "manager" Joe, but soon the two men can not find work, Joe, which leads to stealing food. As they try to survive on the streets of New York, we understand how difficult it is. They can not get Joe girl, until they meet the lady at the party. Joe is making money, and soon Joe takes RATS in place to dream Ratso in Florida. The last five minutes of the heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film. From Midnight Cowboy we get harsh and sometimes disturbing look at urban life.
