YETI deserves a rating of 8 stars, because it is one of the greatest bad movies ever made. I saw him at the screening in the north to LA, and the people were roaring applause and madness - this film is one of those cinematic trainwrecks, where you think it can not get any stranger, and then it! Millionaire who is funding the project to melt the Yeti looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman and poured into an ill-fitting suit - guy plays a scientist is one of the worst actors ever appear on the screen - and yes, there is a mute boy ( that sorta looks like an interesting girl) and he is dumb since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents (hmmm- possible treatment for the child ??). Then this pretty Italian girl seen Yeti (if it will melt - which takes forever) - and he instantly fell in love with it - it's one of the most hysterical things about the film is that this giant Yeti makes a "bedroom eyes" on it - it's like a big Barry White tries to seduce fans. In fact, when the great Yeti raises beauty and has her against his chest - she accidentally touches the nipple and let the yeti, the film takes the time to show his big gray nipples get hard !!!! Clap clap all! Plus there Collie in it, because the Italian manufacturer, must have heard that American audiences as a dog, and he tried to get a variety like Lassie - there's also this crazy scene where the Yeti eats a giant fish - holds great fishbone and uses his brush your hair Italian girl Â«Gee, thanks to Yeti - now my hair smooth and smells like a dead trout You are the best .." This film is more strange, something Ed Wood could ever invent. If you're a fan of the classic movie crap - look for this baby out.
