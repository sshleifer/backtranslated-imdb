"Mouse in the house" is a very classic cartoon Tom and Jerry, faithful to its tradition, but with their own jokes. This is hysterical, fun, very interesting and quite funny. The picture quality is also good. <br /> <br /> This short not only of Tom tries to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house, and he tries to catch a mouse, too, because "there is only one cat in the house in the morning - and it is a cat chasing a mouseÂ» <br /> <br />. If you ask me, there are a lot of funny jokes in this cartoon. The funny thing for me, like when mommy sees two Two shoes lazy cat sleeping and said sarcastically: "I am glad that you are enjoying a siesta" and that she hopes that they are happy, because it is not, which makes two cats suffocation. another interesting gag when Tom disguises itself as Mammy two shoes and clap Butch pan and then Butch does the same trick with Tom. it is known that even funnier than it is when the real Mummy two shoes is and both (dumb!) Cats think they see each other at Vaglen s Mammy, and then they both attack it on the "back" - lol Of course, she was angry and when she is angry, she is not someone to mess with Even Jerry not win this time, because he pushed her.. too.
