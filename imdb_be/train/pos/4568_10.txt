Seriously, can you imagine such a spread of talent in a film without a huge budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, OKonor Hugh and Fiona Shaw? There's no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their awards, but it would be justifiably seen OKonor (as Young Christie) and McAnally awarded: cliche precisely here: they do not fulfill the roles they inhabit them. Performance Day-Lewis is a tour de force - a transformation that induces awe, but it was really a sign of the Academy of Intelligence, which together with this performance, they also honor beautifully restrained, yet heart-wrenching work of Brenda Fricker in mother Christy. By the way, if you have not seen this beautiful actress in "Swan" is another movie worth checking out its contribution (and sublime Miranda Richardson).
