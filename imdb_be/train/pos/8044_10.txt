Firstly, it's just the funniest movie I've ever seen. It includes a very timely farce, sexual humor, and intelligently thought out to the standing. But it goes deeper than that. Souler contrary is an original love story (what we do not see that often), that gave me hope that there is love there, two people who love each other can work through adversity; and that such a comedic take on life (something I think we all need) can be taken by people who are really important. Chris Meloni gives a convincing performance as Barry Singer, that he should have won an Oscar. The film is brilliantly written, and I hope that we will be seeing more films from all parties involved in the future.
