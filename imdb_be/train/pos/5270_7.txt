This film can be very bad, but it's great fun. Bad acting and bad direction increasing hystericalness film. Twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles. If you go to the movie waiting for the first Conan or Excalibur, than you'll hate it. If you look in a good mood and make it as good dumb fun you'll have a good time. Keep an eye on the scene, where they try to hang a brother, his funniest scenes in the movie. I want Mystery Science Theater 3000 would do it !!
