Paul Verhoeven De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most compelling thrillers I've ever seen. It really was a pleasant surprise. The story relates bisexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabb√©), as he lured into a relationship with a beautiful barber shop by Christine (Renee Sautendizhk), but in a twisted mind Gerard could not be more to the story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan de Bont to create a beautiful and dense atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery, it really pulls you into the story, you do not want to look, but you can not turn itself off. This is definitely the best film Verhoeven (perhaps second only Robocop). True Fourth Man is not for everyone, some of the sex scenes entirely gratuitous (just ignore them, but trust me, if you look at least ten minutes, you'll be hooked. It's one of those movies that you need to know how it ends, the real detective this novel in the tradition of Hitchcock, compelling, controversial and exciting. I even like a spider metaphor. <br /> <br /> 8/10
