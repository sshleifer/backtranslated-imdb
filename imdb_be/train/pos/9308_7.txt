If you are used to seeing Gabriel Byrne in serious roles, such as Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton Suspects I recommend you take a look at this movie. Even if you're not a fan of Gabriel Byrne, in particular, all the actors in this film gives a very great performances. If you have about eleven dollars (close to nine pounds) I say to order online, or rent your favorite movie rental place. Guaranteed to make you laugh, do not usually like movies like a gangster. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of those movies that you'll never forget, and find yourself playing again and again. You talk about it so much your friends will ask to take it.
