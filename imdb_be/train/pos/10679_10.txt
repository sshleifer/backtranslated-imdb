The man of the house is a true comedy of the situation in all senses of the word. As for the comedy character named Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O Â»Sullivan), which manifests itself after a wild party, eventually in the house of the two women named Jo and Chris. Ironically the party was held to bid farewell to their old neighbor. Obvious eventually happens when he moves. <br /> <br /> The man of the house was the forerunner of Cook and Mortimer back from the show George and Mildred showed two characters who were the landlords to Joe, Chris and Robin. These two character actually appears in the post man of the house with Mildred (late and missed Yaut Joyce), in particular, to get some of the best lines of the series. Semiregular character was Larry (Doug Fisher) a useless man who was always on the scrounge, and only when he came to himself, he wanted to borrow something (and never get it back). <br /> <br /> Americans made version called three in the company, but it does not stand a chance when compared with that much funnier original. Thames ventured into the production of the comedy about a man share a room with 2 women in a very conservative time, but they have to worry about how the ratings at the time believed that about 20 million people just want to see a good old-fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and sharp script. It is a pity that modern comedy can not reach this high level. <br /> <br /> This program is available on DVD network
