I'm so glad that I got a chance to see this rare little gem of cinema. I saw him at the independent film festival, so do not expect that will soon arrive in your city at any time. In the film, I noticed up and leave for about 10 people. Too bad for them (here in the south, people do not like to read subtitles). The film starts off slow, but so rich that dialogue is never missed. If the action finally arrived, I found that riveted to the screen, as if I were riding a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I also got a big kick out of the name of the head appears in front of the leaders, especially those that introduce characters as they appear on the screen. It reminded me of Zelda (Ocarina of time), if you encounter a level bosses. <br /> <br /> If this is the future, "a video game / comic book" movies, then I welcome it.
