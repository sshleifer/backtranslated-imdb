Other TV movies should be made like this. I saw him back in 93 when he was first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber, both were terrific, giving a very sandy and realistic representation. Weber was especially good, becoming extremely terrible and understated performance as a child molester / murderer. This film really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed «Hoosiers», which was in some way and formulaic and exciting. But the trend in both of these works has the same stunning, simple realism that is so attractive. If you love television films, unpredictable and filled with replays, look, if you can. Side of the story of the Hunt and Fahey on business as attractive without being distracted from the main story.
