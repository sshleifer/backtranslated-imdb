In one of his first films Romy Schneider clear as the young Queen Victoria of England, it suddenly put on the throne at age 18, he learns to control, despite the political intrigue, and ultimately, romances and marries Prince Albert of Saxony vulgar and mannered (although strangely loyal to real events), this romantic part exciting. Seeing this film about the British people of the spoken German language adds to its quirky charm. On this front, one wonders why the Austrian film was made about the Queen of England; but then one remembers that in 1954, Austria was still occupied by the allied forces, including the British. Maybe it's one of the reasons for the existence of this film.
