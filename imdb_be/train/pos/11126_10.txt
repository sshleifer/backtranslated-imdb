Soprano, perhaps the greatest show in the history of television drama. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of another series that can boast of so many crazy, sublime or the first to write speeches rates. <br /> <br /> After its epic scope makes it fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality. Centering around the life of Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the usual wife and two children, nuclear families another huge group of New Jersey by Mafia, of which he is the boss of both. Played by James Gandolfini, True Romance and Mexican fame, Tony is a fascinating, frightening, but a nice guy. Full praise must be given to the adoption of promiscuity Gandolfini and terribly aggressive animals truly identified and perfect leading man. Contemporay American drama never had such arresting and prominent figures like Tony. <br /> <br /> Cast hundreds do not have a flat performance and such distinguished characters such as walnuts and Polly Ralph Cifaretto will stick in your memory forever. <br /> <br /> true genius of this story, however, is the creator and writers have the courage and the revolutionary outlook on the usual drama series. Twenty minutes long dream sequence, a powerful and original use of symbols and metaphorical imagery and really shocking scenes of violence. However, all this style meets really touching themes of love, honor and respect for the family. The series never gets cold heart or free. <br /> <br /> With TVYM currently competitive and often poor Soprano rises above the rest, both in America most original and compelling drama. Forget Family Redifined. This TV Redifined.
