It was a gem. Awesome action with the conclusions of Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all the supporting cast. The film touches upon the topic is not only relevant to Ireland and Irish history, but for many communities around the world, and many marriages units in these communities. With the intensity and sincerity of the film shows how the religious beliefs and tradition drove a wedge in the love and warm family. The name "Love is divided into" failed to capture it better. Despite the fact that this is the real story happening in Ireland '50s, seeing the life of the whole village and corrodes "pogroms" start reminded me of Russian history. Intolerance and prejudices still too powerful in the world and, unfortunately, it is deeply hidden in human nature. Just as in the film the character of Liam Cunningham says that "hatred has always been there beneath the surface." It was interesting to observe the moral choices people make in this story. In addition, the character of a Catholic priest, and what happened to him at the end of the story was significant. History, however, offers hope that the love between two people can win everything, and love makes us better, stronger. Liam Cunningham character goes through all the transformations in the course of history, becoming the man he always wanted to be. Again it operates at the highest level. History is developing rapidly. Irish countryside as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended.
