Of the three remakes on the novel by W. Somerset Mogan, is one of the best one, and especially not because John Cromwell led to the film. The film is worth seeing because of the breakthrough performance of Bette Davis, who, like Mildred Rogers showed the film industry, she was a star. Finally, her battle with Jack Warner and his studio have paid off royally. <br /> <br /> The film is dominated by Mildred from the outset. We understand from the outset that Mildred does not care Philip and never will be. She does not hide his contempt for this good soul, who fell in love with that woman. He will be demoted Mildred again and again, as it does not make bones about what it really is. <br /> <br /> Poor Philip Carey, in addition to be a handicap, a person who is weak. If he tries to cling to Mildred, she rejects him. This is when Mildred returns to him, when she won the tender and that it rises to the occasion, overcoming their dependence on that terrible woman who stole his will and his manhood. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis gives a fantastic picture of Mildred. It was one of her best roles, and she ran away with him. Her aversion to Philip mind is clear from the very beginning of their relationship. When she tells him that she washes her mouth after he kisses her in one of the most powerful moment in the film. Leslie Howard underestimated Philip and makes it seem even weaker than he. Francis Yes, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen, seen in minor roles. <br /> <br /> It Bette Davis shows, and you will not forget!
