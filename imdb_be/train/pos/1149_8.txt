Fast paced and funny satire of what the original "reality show", a soap opera. The script playwright Harling packed with liners and absurd situations. The best of them is the culmination, the live broadcast, which quickly deteriorates in bad improvisation and brain transplants. Keven Klain minions of his lines, due to not wearing glasses, paddles. "Her brain sides to explore over the next few houses." A brilliant cast on the same page, Kline. Sally Field, Elisabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall, and Naji everything is perfect. It is a pleasure to see the cast click, as it does in this film. This is a classic that somehow slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> P.S. Cost Alan Silvestri is an added bonus. It is suitable soap opera with its bright and melodramatic air.
