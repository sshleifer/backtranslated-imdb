There's nothing not to like Moonstruck. I'm from New York Italian family, and I actually get a little homesick when I watch it. Actors and actresses, the plot, podagovory, humor .. they were all fantastic. It starts a little slow, but a lot happens that two days! I fell in love LaBoheme because of this film. On my list of favorite movies, Moonstruck is the number 3. This is a "feel good" movie, where you leave the theater humming "It's Amore" or repeating some of your favorite lines: "old, if you give these dogs a different part of my meal, I will kick you until you're dead, "" Chris, bring me a large knife "," who died "," you love him Loretti ..... well, because if you do, they drive you crazy, because they they know what they are. "I always put a freak, if there is nothing good to watch, because it makes me happy.
