Despite other comments listed here, it's probably the best film Dirty Harry did; film reflecting - for better or worse - the social and political sense of the country during the Reagan glory years in the early 80s. It also Kickass action movie. <br /> <br /> Opening of a liberal, a woman judge overturning the murder case due to lack of material evidence and then go straight to the cafe meeting with a few miserable thugs (a scene that causes the famous "Go ahead, make my day" line), "sudden Impact" is a non-stop action movie slides. The first time you get to take a breath when troublesome Inspector Callahan sent to a nearby town to explore the background killed by a hood. He only gets better from there with a group of top-grotesque thugs for Callahan to deal with along with the Sherriff with a mysterious past. Superb direction and photography, and is just hilarious script will help make this film one of the best from the 80's.
