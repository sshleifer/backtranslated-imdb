I found it deeply amusing black comedy. Brosnan genius; and someone will today indicate that it will not be classified as bonds. Kinnear was charismatic and so funny how someone could be in this role. I do not know when I've laughed so much during any film! Which is an unexpected pleasure! My favorite line is: "I feel like a prostitute in Bangkok on Sunday after the fleet left the city Brosnan delivered this line very nya-bonds with such an unexpected comedy grace I was also very impressed by Hope Davis It looks like... everything in this movie branched from their previous work to such an extent that it actually improved the comedy. If you liked the dark and hilarious "the Weather Man", you will definitely like this. <br /> <br /> I have voted 10.
