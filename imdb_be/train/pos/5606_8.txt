This is a very complex film, and it is almost impossible to get a handle on what's going on. At first it seems rather pedestrian film about a guy (Trelkovsky), who needs a flat and rather inappropriate to invite themselves to one if the current tenant (a woman) commits suicide. Then turns begin. There are neighbors trying to kill him? And why the dead tenant's clothes rotate in the apartment? It is interesting, finally, if Trelkovksy _is_ the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Spoiler Spoiler Spoiler Spoiler Spoiler <br /> <br /> One of the tricks Polanski drags us to lie to us. We believe when we see things from the perspective of the character that we see things as the character does, and what could be a distortion of reality. We believe that the camera shows us things from the omniscient point of view, we see the relevance - but Polanski has a camera lie to us.
