I felt mixed emotions «Les Valseuses» (1974) Written and directed by Bertrand Blier, when I started to watch it, but I end up like. I would not call it vulgar ( "Dumb and Dumber" vulgar "Milk" is both vulgar and inexcusable silly); I would call it shocking and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, especially women would not like or even hate. He is the embodiment of misogyny (or so it seems), and the two anti-hero belongs to every woman they meet seems inexpressible. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that it somehow comes off as a nice little gem. I'm fascinated by how Blier was able to get away with it. The film is very interesting and very nice: it's well written, acting on all first - class, and the music is sweet and melancholic. In fact, when I think about it, two friends have done something good for the women, they came upon: they prepared a woman on the train (excellent, good-natured blonde Brigitte Foss, who began his film career with one of the most impressive debuts "Forbidden games" René Clément (1952) at the age of 6) for a meeting with her husband, whom she had not seen for two months; they found a man who was finally able to get frigid Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) came and satisfied; they are enlightened and educated the young and very willing to Isabelle Huppert (in one of his early appearances on the screen.) Their meeting with Jeanne Moreau raises the comedy to a tragic level. In short, I am not sure that he wanted to meet with Gerard Depardieu, Jean-Claude and Pierrot brother-in-law in real life, and to invite them to dinner, but I had a good time watching the film and two hours almost passed - he was never sad,
