Indian summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found this funny, touching, and absolutely loved it! Anyone who went to camp as a kid, and wants sometimes they could return to the "days of good Ole '" in really need a short time to see it! It begins as 20 years later, the group returns to the old camper "reunion." I will not comment on the story more because you have to see it for yourself. The actors were great, and it contains all star cast. Everything in it played an amazing role. You really felt like you were part of the movie, watching it. Alan Arkin was especially good in the role of Uncle Lou. He plays the kind of guy that everyone wants to have them in my life. It is also a good family film for the most part. I would suggest this to anyone in a heartbeat! It is highly recommended!
