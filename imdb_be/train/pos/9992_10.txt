... this classic is so much more dialogue and scenes no one should miss. A good story, funny situations, riches-to-rags, Mel Brooks is not a bad lead, can not be perfect, but it is fun; D Do not pay attention to the rating, it is BS. Watch it, and then look something like the final destination (2009), and tell me that Life Stinks deserves some of the same rating. If so, I do not think we can be friends XD For now, I recommend the fourth season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" to every fan Brooks;) Vote 10 against the ignorant opinions inchworms! I have to do 10 lines here to leave a comment? I do not want to write a book here: P
