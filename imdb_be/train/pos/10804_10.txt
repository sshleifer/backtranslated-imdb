Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait, I will gladly switched to the channel, indicating it is in the beginning. The first Canon Pachelbel brought a lump in his throat, the eyes of the Tiger Moth (which my grandfather, my father and I all spans) made a little damp around the eyes, and then the name of whom is completely hooked me. I was fascinated by this film, the performance of the blood (again), the subject (and even then, it is the duty we have to), as various issues were discussed, and considered flying sequences (my father was flying Avro Ansons, too), the history - and as another participant noted recitation high-flying blood. I will not spoil the movie for everyone, but separated from my wife for 4,000-plus miles, a former military officer who has been deployed in several wars, and as a pilot, I confess, to cry from the heart a couple of times, Buy, rent it, download it, beg, borrow or steal - but watch it <br /> <br /> PS I spy Bristol Blenheim (training in yellow color) on the ground.? I looked at as a twin-engined aircraft with Tween 0.303 Browning in dorsal turret.
