I agree that «veinbreaker» wrote concerning "Ahhhh" feeling that you get at the end of this film. I absolutely loved the place, they decided to shoot the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic-sounding song, which sings Hans Matheson. It's trippy. Nighy was FAB in his role, Nail «nailed» it was a typical drummer Beano, and Rea held it together. Bruce Robinson was awesome. Elena was a beautiful girl. But I felt Juliet Aubrey performance was magnificent. Scenes between Aubrey Robinson and kill me! Excellent playing and the music scene was in place! It is a pity, a little more musicians to check this movie out! They should! I told all my musician friends. great quote by the character of Jimmy Nail, "it should be a rock 'n' roll, not f ***** g Phantom of the opera!"
