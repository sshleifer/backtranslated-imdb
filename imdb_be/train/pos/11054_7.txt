My brothers and sisters, and I came across the champions if our local station aired a rerun him one summer in the 1970s. We absolutely loved it. There was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially compared to conventional American re-runs (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you get the idea). It was like feeling to the Avengers (not too much of a surprise, as it was also the British and in the spy / adventure genres) <br /> <br /> I would like to see him again today. - I hope it holds. I mentioned the show to others, and no one has ever heard of it, so I began to wonder if I imagined her whole existence. But it is surprising that the internet allows me to keep track of information about it. We hope that she will find a new generation of fans.
