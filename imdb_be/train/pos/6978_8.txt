Well, I must say that I was waiting for him in the future. <br /> <br /> I will not try to spoil it, and a lot of people really brilliantly told the pilot. On the other hand, I'm not quite sure I understand the detractors who claim themselves a fan of the BSG, and not as a pilot. <br /> <br /> What Frack they expect? !! Background set 50 years before BSG we are there to help at the birth of the Cylons, to see the life of Adam's family (we already knew, some of them from BSG), to gain a deeper explanation Caprican population and its perception of the other colonies, and potential sources of faith gods and a unique human Cylon God faith. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the same abundant special effects or space opera, as in the previous series, I make the difference between the two, even though I know that Caprica will strengthen BSG. <br /> <br /> is 1h30 from promising start, I believe, so it will put pressure on the script to be as good as BSG. I expect that many of these, but I have no reason to doubt that we will learn a lot more. <br /> <br /> Watching DVD deleted scenes also gives more material for your brain to chew on. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to January 2010
