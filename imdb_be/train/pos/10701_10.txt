Critics do not like this movie. He bombed in the United States, and as a result got only a limited representation in the UK. Which was a great shame because it is a British rather than American humor and had to be shown in the UK in the first place. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman looks stunning and completely convincing Russia. Ben Chaplin character Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate" and "Birthday Girl" has, at least, 4 scenes, reminds the viewer that the 1960 classic (even though, is another story!). <br /> <br /> Sure, he changed tactics several times from comedy to black comedy to thriller, to adventure - but it memorable, moving and Weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average mega-budget blockbuster <br /> <br / > See p. an open mind!
