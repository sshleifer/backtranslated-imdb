I will never forget this movie, or events that result in Jonestown in Guyana. It just seems so tragic, but it must be said. Powers Boothe gives the performance of the team as a leader Rev. Jim Jones from obscurity to complete insanity. He would have won him the Academy Award easy when it was released in theaters. It's kind of a mini-series, you will not forget. You will not forget the images of cruelty cult obsession with control and its leader. His rise and fall, and the threat from the outside world in order to destroy what he considered a paradise. Mass suicide is a terrible, almost unreal fantasies of someone, why so many people (900+) went voluntarily or by order resisted Jones. They do not make mini series like they are, where we are left with their mouths open, with the hungry and to find out what happened to the rest.
