The film does a brilliant job of speaking about those terrible events that actually e had place.Robert Blackjack well as Perry.Of course, Black had a case of the murder of his own a few years ago, as the accused today the murder of his wife.He free, but we still do not know what ever truth.What, that may be, it is still very good actor.Scott Wilson does an excellent job as Hickock.John Foresight is stunning as Alvin Stewart Dewey.Paul well as Jensen.Jeff Corey amazing how Mr. n Hickock.Same thing with Charles McGraw who plays Tex Smith.John McLiam reflects Herbert Clutter, his wife Ruth Story Bonnie Brenda Currin Nancy daughter and On How is the son Kenyon.Great work on each of them.There is much to remember from the beginning of this film.Let in with side.It lighters in a fairly large when Perry wants to go on the hunt for gold in Mexico and said Hickok: Remember Bogart in the treasure of the Sierra Madre "and Blake himself was in this film as a boy! And it's fun when they are giving the trip so the boy and his grandfather, collect bottles and turn them in to return money.Those dark moments more intrusive sequence ones.The flashback where you see the murder happen very terrifying.When Perry is to kill the girl, Nancy in the past, and she says: "Oh, please do not" ... human cruelty, it is impossible explain.Then hanging scene.First there is Hickock, and then Perry, the first conversation with the last minister.In the image of the film we see Perry hitting end rope.Sure movies, and books can try Vat sympathize with the character of this villains.Especially Perry is someone you might regret for.He thinks his mom and dad, who he hates, but still loves.But it does not change the fact these people these actors portrayed are tough murderers who do not mind anybody.They go into the house and kill the whole family, you could in the cold blood.How sympathize with these people?
