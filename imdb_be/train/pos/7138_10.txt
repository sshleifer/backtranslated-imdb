When John Thaw never played "Morse", "Kavanagh," starred in «The Sweeney» and other industries, it will be remembered for that amazing unforgettable performance in "Good Night, Mr. Tom." <br /> <br /> Superbly maintained the same great performance of his roles (young Nick Robinson in his first role), and unobtrusive cast, this adaptation of the novel by Michelle Magorian magic is a fitting monument to his art. <br /> <br /> When I read the story of the old widowed Norfolk countryman in order to put the little boy from London before and during the Blitz, I found a rather obvious error string of time in it, and credit must go to the creator of this film for straightening this is a mistake. In addition, they should be applauded for not too sentimentalising story, and prevention that could be turned out quite easily in a mild disorder. <br /> <br /> If you store a CD or video library, then it is a good feeling for the TV movie is an absolute necessity to include.
