As a native of Bolton, this film has obvious appeal for me. Shots location and fascinating show Bolton are very much in transition - there are a number of explicit scenes of failure, but it serves to show the city is rebuilt - and the idea that the old must give way to a new right in the heart of this film. James Mason a little miscast is a pleasant ensemble in the history of the hustle and bustle of the herring, which spirals into a full-scale conflict between the generations, the attractive sugary solution. Although I'm a little too young to fully remember the details of Lancashire life in the 60s all here: cashing in on Friday, songs around the piano, on Sunday, constitutional, good neighborliness, in trepidations courtship massive importance of self-esteem, and I was glad to see Naughton funny line of the game remains intact. There is no doubt that this film should be available on DVD - is well established and most of the performances are well implemented.
