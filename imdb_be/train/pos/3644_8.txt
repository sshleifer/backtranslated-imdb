Rookie is based on the true story of 40+ years old school teacher in Big Lake, Texas, reaching major. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a small-town high school teacher of science and baseball coach. His team is losing badly, until the team finds out that their coach played in the lower leagues and can throw a pitch 98 miles per hour. <br /> <br /> After throwing batting practice and made a pledge, Jim agrees that if his team wins the regional, it will try in the big leagues. The film tells the story of Jimmy as a boy to play in his first game in the Majors. This is a great story of a loser and a very friendly family cinema. Dennis Quaid makes the movie worth giving an emotional performance and is supported by a fine supporting cast, which includes: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes some time to develop, and some scenes are a bit slow, but it works well until the end. The baseball scene fun, well filmed and painted perfectly. at the film really is not about baseball, but the search of a man to achieve his dream. It inspires, it is emotional, and it's funny. I liked it, I hope you do. <br /> <br /> rookie. Starring: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T. Jones <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars ..
