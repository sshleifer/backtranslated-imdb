One of my favorite movies for a number of years was the "Last Action Hero"; Unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun, becoming a corrupt bastard policies; so now I can not carry a movie, he can his hand <br /> <br /> The Adventures of Jake rate actually toys with some themes similar to those recently ... Hero. so I was glad to find it on DVD, so I could watch these themes played out so well. <br /> <br /> Despite the "plot dd-plot" involving white slavery during the Civil War, African countries, it is not an action movie. The plot is that the "plot-to-plot" is within, in fact of the matter that the film has no intention of letting Jake real person speed that helps the character to save her sister from a white slaver; or whether it is actually a fictional character (which means that character once went into a universe which actually exists only in a series of pulp novels)? I believe that it is not all that well defined in the film, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane is perfectly aware of this. Thus, the film becomes a representation of what viewers can choose from a fictional "adventure stories" of the universe. It is actually a rich theme, the potential severity of which was covered by polite mannerisms and sense of humor of the film <br /> <br /> There are weak points in the film. - first of all it's a movie that makes the film look like a TV show. And the step makes bending over. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters, and I enjoy the adventure they live, but stupid. And I just find fascinating idea that this adventure is really going on in the novel. <br /> <br /> Keep a few -m seen a good show!
