This film is not a kung-fu movies. It's a comedy about a kung-fu. And if, before making this film, Hung Sun Summit spent some time watching the films of the great French comic filmmaker Jacques Tati (i.ie., such as the face. Jour de fÃªte), he is certainly on the same wavelength. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that films Tati funny; but they are not for everyone. Some have told me that they hate their job. I never understood why, but I think it's because the character who Tachi usually plays himself so completely dead pan, so does not affect the events around him (he is usually called), many miss the more subtle comic bits occurs around <br /> <br /> in any case, the main Tachi mot -. or at least its most famous - it's pretentious to take vertically petty bourgeoisie with the sensitivity of the 19th century and planted it in the 20th century in France, where he must confront a society that is largely determined by the gradual Eroding these feelings. It usually has serious problems with small things like players or radios. It is dangerous in the car, but the light is not safer if he rides a bicycle. But through it all, he never loses his self-assurance, which is derived from its internal recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the 20 as a whole. <br /> <br /> In the same way, the character he plays in the Summit Hung country boy came to the big city in Hong Kong, it is convinced that makes the city interesting is the fact that Bruce Lee made a kung fu films out there . This gets him into trouble in the details, as he takes a step accidents that never would have noticed, in a small town, but are considered to be out of place in a big city - such as the moment when it seems that he was urinating in the street, the cops stop him only to discover that Hung is really just squeezing the water out of his shirt, soaked during an accidental fall in the bay. What is interesting about this gag why Hung does not understand what the fuss is all about the Constitutional Court - in a provincial town, yet no one is watching when you gotta go you gotta go. In other words, Hung not urinate on the street - but it certainly will be - and the fact that the officer problem? Of course Hung obsession with Bruce Lee also gets him into a lot of trouble as well. He has a gang of thugs who refused to pay his restaurant-owner uncle. Of course, in the film Bruce Lee, will be treated as goons spread, and they would have learned their lesson. But in Hong Hong, the reality is, unfortunately, prevalent, and thugs to come back when he's not around to flog his uncle. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hung, finally triumphs in the end, just like always Tati. Characters, as it always should be happy (at least in the comedy), because they are not to blame, and as such, despite their comical blunders and misunderstandings, they really represent what is best in people we admire and we want to be. We really do not want to be Bruce Lee (who must feel the loss of all his friends, before he gets a chance to beat the bad guy), we, in our own innocence, really want a world where heroism Lee is possible. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this world exists only in the movies. <br /> <br /> "Ah, but what if ...?" - and in this regard we find Hung summit in his comic best.
