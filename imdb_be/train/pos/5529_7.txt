I first saw this film at the cinema in France a year ago. He came and went with great fanfare, but I enjoyed the beauty of its landscape photography and filming fascinating wildlife. (History, while good, actually by accident. If you really think about it, there's no way, most of what is happening can happen in real life.) I just saw it tonight here in states on the DVD. Again, I understand that he has a very limited distribution. Blockbusters was only one instance, and I do not remember that ever played in art houses in Cleveland. <br /> <br /> Seen On TV, photos are not so breathtaking, although it is still very beautiful, Frames wildlife still fascinates. The history of relations between the 10-year-old child and foxes even less convincing for the second time, if you know where it's headed. <br /> <br /> However, as I said, the story by accident. This is a great movie to see, and if you love wildlife footage, you have to find it fascinating.
