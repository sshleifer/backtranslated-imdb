The question of whether more than one loves this version of «Ghost Train» film always depends on one thing and one thing only :. Your reaction to the speech of Arthur Askey <br /> <br /> It seeks to steal almost every scene that he is, and not always in a good way. Sometimes you want to, he would settle down or back off a little to a lot of the characters in the story and develop feature (they are to some extent). But somehow it all keeps pointing to Tommy Gander character Asuka in. <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie, and even to the extent of Asuka. I always seem to Plonk it in the VCR in the odd early morning hours, when I can not sleep, and really can not find the energy to look at anything else. There is something about watching old b / w films in the silent darkness of dawn, that I find appealing ....
