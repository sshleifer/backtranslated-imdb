I came to Nancy Drew had expected worse ... because of all the other bad reviews. I thought, even if I do not read the book, there is nothing, as Nancy Drew, I heard not to look. But I was wrong. Of course, it was not a carbon copy books, but if you make a film out of something, you have to modify it to be a big-screen entertainment. The site was pleasant and exciting with lots of real scares, and I thought that Emma Roberts was very believable in their own way to portray this classic character. There were a few funny moments, and, on the contrary many applications, at no point in the film does come off as Nancy Dietz. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and genuine. One thing that this film was also good to balance the whole thing with a mixture of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I loved this movie. What movie, what movie! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go look at it, get ready for some scary moments as hell, because I was, like, excited! Go it or be a bang-bang and let other people decide what you think about this film for you ... mistake I almost made. I love him, I want to have this film! I love Emma Roberts now too. She looks like a mini-Bree Van de Kamp from DH. Love it, I love it.
