I saw this film as a child on the Creature Feature, when I lived in New York. It was pretty awful film, though not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it's different from what I remember, because in the DVD, which I bought a couple of scenes where the actors speak French and / or Italian subtitles, and are not listed. Then the other participants respond in English that has been said. Kind of weird. Also on the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on the IMDb. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is characterized by the fact that the character of Elsie takes his clothes and provides a nude shot in one scene, and elsewhere tries to make Julia Elizabeth (Barbara Steele), to be done with it, tapping her on the bed and kissed her while Steele resists. The scene existed in the television version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there are any additional images that could be included in the re-release of the ultra edition? It seems sad that some of these old low-budget classics were spliced ​​into pieces and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where the master tape and all unused footage? <br /> <br /> In addition to the first bore twenty minutes before Helen delivered to the castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There are not too many special effects (but the face of Herbert after Julia clubs him with a good one). Eerie atmosphere and wonderful, exotic and seductive look Barbara Steele to make the film much better than it should be. I can honestly say that when Barbara Steele was not in the movie, it will be a big zero. It makes the film ten!
