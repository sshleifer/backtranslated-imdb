I watched a few days filming of this movie, that in the summer, the end result was only two scenes in the film. The place was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Bring the car, stop the car, etc .. So Dakota youth hopes to see the film and was not disappointed. The local buffalo herd to be killed so postrelivat scenes were real. (Yes by Doris, the animals were injured during the filming), I think that the ending was copied Jack Nicholson shining? Large Western / social commentary from the '50s. This should be in the same class as High Noon Western drama for real or used as social applications like Blackboard Jungle and Rebel Without A Cause was for 50 young people.
