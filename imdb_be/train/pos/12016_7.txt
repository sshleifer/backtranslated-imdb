Good western filmed in Arizona rocky subsoil. A lot of tough guys around; character Cobern, seemed, to rock back and forth between full of crazy and exciting type. Several holes shown in the figure, but not enough to compensate for this to be an exciting and worth seeing. One really dumb shows Heston emptying .45 cases of powder and collect it in a bag with the aim of starting a fire. A. In order to collect as much gunpowder would have needed him pack mule to carry ammunition. B. The grass was obviously dry, why not just throw a match on it, and let 'er rip?
