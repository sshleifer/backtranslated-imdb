when my sister said that this film will be good, I had a second thought, but I watched it, and it was really funny. mostly the film is made up of an amazing girl who is sent to a small town where no one loves her, and she just wants to go out there and get a reading aunts wear so that she can go. but not so simple. In this film you will encounter a cheerful humor, witch, spellbook / recopies, mentally challenged uncle and the dog. You will understand the meaning of a monster after in any case, I hope you're running straight and try to find it's actually an old film. I hope you enjoy it as much as I'll have to give it a 0 .... no I'm quite bad joke to give him 9 hope you understand that you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you can just take offense. <, Br /> <br /> love is yours: Dakota, you can email me at dakota_loves_it @ hot Mail.com if you want to
