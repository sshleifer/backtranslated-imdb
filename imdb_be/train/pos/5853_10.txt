I really enjoyed this SummerSlam because of the appearance of the arena, the curtains and just overall appearance I was wondering for some reason. In any case, it may be one of the best SummerSlam, someday, when WWF has Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, now it's time it was normal to have a huge fat man against a strong man, but I'm glad times have changed . It was a horrible main event as well as every match Luger terrible. Other matches on the map was Razor Ramon vs. DiBiase, Steiner Brothers against the celestial bodies, Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Hening, it was an event where Sean called him a great Monster Diesel watchdog body, the IRS vs. 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart first takes Doink then takes on Jerry Lawler and material HARTS and Lawler was always very interesting, the Ludvig Borg destroyed Marty Jeannette, the undertaker took on Giant Gonzales in another terrible game, Smoker Huns and Tatanka took on Bam Bam Bigelow and Headshrinkers and Yokozuna defended his world title against Lex Luger the match was boring and a terrible Anetsi. Nevertheless, he deserves 8/10
