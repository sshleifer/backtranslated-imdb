The only film in addition to Soylent Green, who has the air of hopelessness is located on the beach. Both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man-made disasters. On the beach with a nuclear war and Soylent Green from environmental poisoning of the planet. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is a reason for some optimism, because, as in 2007, we have not achieved any of the worlds described in these films, and we should have today. New York still has about 8 million people, not 22 million for the Millennium, as described in the Soylent Green. Environmentalists have always welcomed this film, as the result of global warming. For me, it also points to the right to life of ethical rampage. It is obvious that there is no family planning in the world either. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is the detective the NYPD, who lives with a room mate, Edward G. Robinson, who is old enough to remember the Earth before the disaster struck. It was murder, Joseph Cotten executive with the Soylent Corporation, a multinational concern, which came to the food, my plate come in many colors, to feed the world population. This is the final product of Soylent Green. <br /> <br /> The investigation believes Charlton Heston gets his man, but also leads to some terrible truth about Soylent Corporation and the future of humanity. Like Heston shouts in the end, that Soylent Green from people that we have become a race of cannibals, horrible thing is that there is no alternative. We have exhausted the planet, and we have to eat our dead in order to survive. <br /> <br /> It was the speech of farewell, Edward G. Robinson, and in his memoirs, Heston said, touching Robinson, even if they have different political views, a few weeks after Robinson wrapped, that the final scene of his screen euthanasia death agreed, he died in real life. Not many of them, but Heston knew Robinson was incurable and there was no action to participate in this final death scene between the two of them. <br /> <br /> Although the schedule has been switched off, this does not mean that provided Soylent Green may not happen in the world. Hopefully, we will have not only the intellect, but also a sense of shared responsibility to preserve it did not happen.
