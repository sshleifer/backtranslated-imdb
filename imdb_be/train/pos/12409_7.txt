Prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best films of the eighties horror, and there is good reason for this, because it is not one of the best ... but as you dig past the classic films that decade had to offer, it is certainly among the best of less known / short films. The film has some relation to the blockbusters; For a start it early directorial efforts for Renny Harlin; a capable director for a number of films, including Die Hard 2 Action, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and secondly, we have an early role of Lord Rings star Viggo Mortensen. The film is not very original, but the storyline is interesting. We focus on the prison, which was re-opened after a number of years. It was a prison where a man named Charles Forsythe was sent to the electric chair after framed prison governor. Naturally, that the spirit of a dead person does not rest in peace; and when the old room performance again, the spirit of a dead convict escapes revenge. <br /> <br /> The film is not quite Shawshank Redemption, but he takes care to build their different characters and while the essence of the film is always horror, prison drama behind it all makes for an interesting base. It's a good job too, because, in addition to the main room, the film really has no "plot" to go on and we rely solely on the interaction between the characters, to keep things interesting. The horror film, sometimes grotesque, but it's never over that may actually be the reason why this movie is rarely remembered in the decade of excess being released. Sami murder pretty good and creative, however, give some highlights. As the film goes on, we begin to delve into the background of the ghost of vengeful convict and ho in this quite interesting, something about it does not make sense, and it drags the film down a bit. However, it all comes down to an exciting climax and overall I have to say that the prison film should track down.
