The combination of excellent black-and-white photography, and "Eugene Onegin with a twist" the story made it a real knock out for me. The atmosphere created is basically a very dark scenes contrasted with the sparse very bright white overexposure squeezed. It was a beautiful moment, when, where transparencies - apparently ordinary holiday survey, but where actors' faces showed the character and the situation delicately, but instantly. - were shown accompanied by wrenching Lensky's aria from Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin <br /> <br /> For me, the sign of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities offered by this medium, which means that part of the story is less important than the images and atmosphere - last year at Marienbad is a good example of such a film, Krisana is in the same mold.
