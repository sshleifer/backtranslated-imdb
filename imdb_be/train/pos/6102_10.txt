I had to give this film 10 simply because he did what so many films, abandoned in black audience failed miserably to do. This film was devoid of all clich√©s slut videos as well as skipped gangsters, rappers and mother. He considered several relationships between doctors, African Americans, and African-American men / women relationship to a whole new level and refreshing. I was very impressed with the films careful mixture of light in the section of humor with some pretty stiff and difficult problems. The film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time. I saw him at the Festival of the Boston Film Festival, as well. Premiere at AMC Loews Boston, and I really hope that this film makes it a much wider audience. Black people (and everyone else) will love the movie like this- if the industry was smart enough to put them there! <br /> <br /> As an extra-unless your doctor, resident, medical student, preparatory student, married to a doctor, the doctor-related, there is a doctor in the family, or know a great doctor period- they love this film as well. He portrayed his residency and practice in this way, the true life, which was highly appreciated by physicians, residents and medical students who viewed the film. Dennis Cooper all his residency in internal Medicine- so he certainly apply their knowledge / experience in the film and it is very obvious.
