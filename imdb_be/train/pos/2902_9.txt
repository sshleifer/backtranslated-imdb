I sit through movies like «Tiempo de valientes», and I want to talk about the movie for a few hours. Delight the film called me out of my own explanation of borders, because I look at the film scene, and I look for in my thoughts shooting ideas and dialogue innovations that may arise from something more than mad Shifrona in. <, Br /> <br /> Looking at the environment, so uncompromising, so simple, I mean; This man is a genius. Not surprisingly, he created what is probably the best TV shows Argentina have ever seen, and then the first film full of elements of some modern directors still not been reached. «El Fondo del Marie" is the name, and she wakes up (several years ago), my enthusiasm for our daily movie. <br /> <br /> Having started from the daily reality of people, Szifron goes where trappers can never "El Bonaerense»; Life of the Federal Police Department. Trapero film was a journey into the mind and human experience, and not in those places, which he had seen. Yes, there were a lot of detailed training and crime situations, but Szifron in "there", it is more a detective, like the ones that we know and love, with the mysteries and exciting music. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot of humanity in his writing, and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of its protagonists, Alfredo Diaz and Marianne Silverstein. There are plenty of high-caliber actors in the film, but the two actors are the ones that the film can not do. The first character (Luis Luque) detective who has just found out his wife was cheating on him; and should work in each case. <br /> <br /> The second psychiatrist assigned treatment detective. He wants to deal with it in regular sessions, but the sheriff uses a temporary dislocation, and believes that he joins Diaz in their routines, "Nothing, the usual stuff, no problem." But it's more than that, and it will turn face of the doctor, he did not know. <br /> <br /> The relationship developed between the two terminals can not be explained if it is not there, because it considers this complexity, which shows just how talented some people like Szifron, who are now trying to leave a signature in our history. Reaching the point of unbelievable spontaneity, while a high-pressure situation, Diaz said Silverstein, "As we continue our treatment?" And Silverstein replies: "No, I'm not a doctor you calling me for dinner, I do. your friend ":. we laugh because we can not <br /> <br /> and we can not help but laugh when Diaz crashed car on the street and does not give importance to this, or when he sins all the red lights on street, or if he smokes marijuana in his police patrol and Silverstein could not believe it (but smokes it too, because he screwed up); or if Silverstein tries to be friendly with the robbers friends Diaz Magic from Diego Peretti is. that we get there. He, himself a psychiatrist, provides insight in terms of «Locas de Amorim", but impressive all its dyyapazo . Luis Luque on the other hand, is back on track with a first-class image, which reminds us of the great actor he is. <br /> <br /> There is a passion I have for this, and as I said, I could write about it for a few hours, but, unfortunately, this is not how it works, and I have to be precise and summarize. Despite the fact that I have to watch a lot of old movies and study them, I can assure you that " Tiempo de valientes »is a comedy Argentina waited and did not get ?? Until now.
