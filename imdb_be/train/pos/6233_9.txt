Musically speaking gave Irving Berlin, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musical after another pluperfect Top Hat, whenever possible. Although in this case, as Jerome Kern confection Roberta, they were in the wake of the fleet kept Randolph Scott with another singer, this time Harriet Hilliard. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott career Navy CPO and Fred Astaire is a former vaudeville, who enlisted in the Navy forget Ginger Rogers, his former partner. But now the two are on the shore leave. Fred and Ginger take where they left off, and Randy accidentally meets Ginger tasteless sister Harriet, which blooms in the real beauty. But Randy typical love them and leave 'Em brands. <br /> <br /> Again, Irving Berlin wrote the lyrics filled through its tight control over production. Ginger gets to do some really outstanding vocalizations to Let Yourself Go, she and Fred dancing later. But the real hit of the show Let's face the music and dance that is done on a number of navy exhibition. Sung Aster first, and then danced in pairs, let's Face Music and Dance is one of the greatest romantic room ever written for the screen. They dance in this absolute magic. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard few young people could ask who it was. But they will know immediately when I think of her with her famous husband Ozzy Nelson. This is the right of Ozzie and Harriet. This is something a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she was the only David and Ricky mom on TV. Then she did not even keep her own name. <br /> <br /> No Ozzy and Harriet sang on television. Ozzy was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could actually carry a tune. She sings: Get thee behind me, Satan, and the Moon, and I'm here, but where are you, as a real feeling and class. I recommend you look Follow the Fleet, if for no other reason than to hear dimension Harriet Hilliard incredibly forgotten today.
