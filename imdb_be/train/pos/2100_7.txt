Before she went into politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of the best British actresses of the cinema. This film shows her talent, despite a minor role in the stellar cast that includes Julie Christie as Kitty, the wife of the British royal captain, who lost his memory for the last 20 years, and Jenny plays the American Al-Margrethe in almost changed role as a caring sister. Alan Bates plays the captain, who suffers from memory loss caused by a concussion during the First World War, Sir Ian Holm has a smaller role as a doctor it. You see familiar faces, like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can not help but look Glenda play a sloppy housekeeper, and the first true love of captain, but they come from different classes. It's not the best movie, but it's good to see the amazing talent Glenda. She was still a fantastic actress, comedy or drama. It makes Margaret Gray cute character, and you can see why the king's captain fell in love with her.
