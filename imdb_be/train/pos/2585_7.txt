Here is a rare gem for those of you who have not seen and probably will not even hear about it. During the 80s, Dennis Quaid has been a hot commodity, but in the early '90s, Dennis Quaid had disappeared from the scene. In 1993, he rushed back to the big screen of the three films, each of which, unfortunately, was bombed.

If the carnival comes to town Wilder Wallace decides to reunite with his brother, and also to see Vida, which is that Wallace was in love! house arrest Vida see its end, but Wilder busy.

Brother against brother ... fighting fire with fire! <br /> <br /> For a large fireball cast of this movie ... eat your heart out, Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> The film also has some really strange but funny items like ammunition acapellas Wilder singing songs during the shootings and after wards. Jim Varney (globally known as "Ernest") is as livestock carnival buddy Wallace. "Wilder Napalm» brilliantly shot ... and cleverly put together ... very near the wall, and the avant-garde. <br /> <br /> give this kind of ...
