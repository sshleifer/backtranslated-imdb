Complicated story laid on a background Bharati section. Honest Muslim who kidnaps innocent Hindu girl and educated Indian Muslim to burn crop - even in the end, you end up loving them both. History is a powerful, but the script and the flow can not be solved. Background music score and songs are outstanding. Next comes the memorable acting veteran Matondkar. Photo captures time, violence and aroma rural Punjab is very good. Other actors or did not act well, we not had an opportunity to act. Direction is really the weakest link. These characters were not well developed. Nha crisp, unlike the "Earth", where even the 5 characters of the string leaves a trail. The finish is very interesting. This story may have several different ending - and all of them would be equally good.
