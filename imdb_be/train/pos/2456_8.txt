When I went to see this film, my expectations were very low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought that I would look sad teen movie, but in fact the story is interesting and well done, the action was more convincing - especially with Melville, which really shows his talent in this film, and fighting scenes were - for the budget of the film - very well done <br /> <br /> I think this movie deserves a wider audience than it received .. this is a film that can be seen by the whole family - maybe not the smallest of the children, as it contains some pretty rough scene. A film about love, and the problems that can arise when you are going against your family traditions. <br /> <br /> So, the film is very similar to "Bend It Like Beckham", but I really think that this film pulls it better.
