Dick Tracy comic strip was originally created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He's a detective in plain clothes, which tracks a team of villains ranging from all kinds of visual original characters such as FlatTop for The Blank on Big Boy Caprice. (These villains have become so popular in the 40th year that Warner Bros. has created its own view of the villains Tracy style of such cartoons as Dafy Duck) comic Tracy were known for their liberal use of the shootout to modern advances in technology (eg, wrist hours communicator), has received its share of screen time in this remarkable film. The music was amazing, Danny Elfman, and original songs Madonna was interested in, but they were not the high point of her career. This is strange, because, as you watch the movie and see the moments of anxiety, the film feels like Batman because of the memorable sound Elfman for his part. <br /> <br /> I love the tough-talking child Pacino acting as the Great Boy Caprice (and chin!), taking on the evil of the Madonna, and the cinematography and direction were flawless. This film was very professionally done and has tons of great actors who were known as great actors for some time before this film was made (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara Dick Van Dyke). The film was directed himself Beatty, which was interesting. It's almost like Beatty saw himself as Tracey in a previous life or something, because it is very suitable part. <br /> <br /> I had to give this film 8/10 of all that he brought to the film, received passes (for whatever reason). There were tons of misunderstanding about the rating of this movie on IMDb, and I still do not understand why. The characters were completely original and bright as the style set, wardrobe, lighting, and everything in this film. Go buy today. You will not regret.
