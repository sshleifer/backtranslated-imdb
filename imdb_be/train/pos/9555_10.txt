I've seen this movie 12 years ago on TNT. It was a Birthday Suzanne York, and they were showing the film, as a double feature with Tom Jones (1963). I have not seen this movie on television since. I took an interest in seeing this movie because one of the stars are very funny and talented Jim Dale, a lusty sailors. I believe that Dale is doing the story of Harry Potter books on Casette, but in any case it is quite funny. This fast-paced comedy. It's not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures has to go through their collection of movies, and consider restoring and releasing the movie DVD. Christopher Plummer cheerful as Lord Fopington, Ayano Bunn also quite humorous, as the Ramble sailor. This vulgar comedy, the kind of film one no longer sees, with great production values. *** 1/2 star with ****
