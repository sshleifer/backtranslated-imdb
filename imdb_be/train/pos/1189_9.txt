Last hunting is one of the few westerns ever have to deal with the buffalo hunt, both in sports and in business, and as a method of winning the Plains Indian Wars. Before the white man set foot on the other side of the Mississippi, the plains used to have a herd of American bison as big as some of our largest cities. By the time the period of Last Hunt set to bison was nearly destroyed. The twentieth century, thanks to the efforts of environmentalists, saw a revival in the population of the species, but not much, as it was before. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger is one of the main roles in the second film together, and this one is far superior to all the Valiant Brothers. Here, Stewart Granger's a good guy, the world is tired buffalo hunter, who must return to work, which he hates, due to financial considerations. <br /> <br /> partner he chose to throw in with Robert Taylor. Taylor forgetting for the moment, I doubt there has ever been angrier, nastier soul than Charlie Gilsen, which draws Taylor. In the Devil's door, he was an Indian struggle against the racist prejudice tortured by Louis Calhern. In The Last Hunt, he's a racist here. He kills and buffalo and Indians for pure pleasure. It kills one Indian family when they steal his mules and takes the widow of one prisoner. As a kind of barbarian conqueror, he expects that the pleasure of sex Debra Paget. He really is a mind, if Paget does not see it that way. HN <br /> <br /> No matter how often they are Tamblyn as a half-breed, I was never sure exactly what it was in any of the Indian. This is the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt. <br /> <br /> However, Lloyd Nolan, a gray-haired old man skinning a buffalo Taylor and Granger bring just fine. Nolan steals every scene he is in with the actors. <br /> <br /> For those who love westerns present who want to see the side of Robert Taylor had never seen on-screen, and who does not like cheap heroics, The Last Hunt is the perfect hunt.
