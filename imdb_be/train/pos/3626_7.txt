This work is based on the true story of Jim Morris, coach high school science teacher / baseball, which inspired his players to try for the pros and fulfill his life-long dream to play in the Majors. Dennis Quaid, is no stranger to sports movies, plays Morris with sufficient confidence to do the work, and manufacturers make reliable operation of the recovery of real events that led to Maurice a short stint as a relief pitcher for the Tampa Bay Rays woefull Devil, first half film dealing with his rag tag bunch of players in the middle of baseball school (all of which look too old to actualy be in high school) is less effective, and probably a bit too long. In general, the film does not suffer from some of the problems of stimulation and some additional story that we probably could have done without. Nevertheless, it's still pretty part film with an inspirational theme that once again proves that baseball is the national pastime for a reason. GRADE: B-
