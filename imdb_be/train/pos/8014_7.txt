But if you want Muppet I bet you do not like it. In principle, the same subject spat out (this time in the New York Sun LA) it has many funny cameos and Muppet hi-jinx. Many leave Muppet film pretty early, because it centers around Kermy and Miss Piggy. I happened to have enjoyed it very much. Fun to watch with their children.
