It was one of the best war movies I have ever seen, because it focuses on the characters more, the actual war. All the plaster does an excellent job, and because most of them are relatively unknown, which makes everything seem more plausible. Camera shots are big, so it was pacing and editing. This movie will really get to you and makes the audience care about charcters.
