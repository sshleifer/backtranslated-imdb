This film has a lot of comedy, not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this. He shows his funny side, and it was very strange to see him get beat. His training "unorthodox", and who would have thought a strapping unit can be so deadly ?? A lot of big stunts and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Vang ~ d in the mix, and you get an amazing final showdown! Do not mess with the Manchu thugs; They are ruthless!
