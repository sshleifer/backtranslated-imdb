Enjoying the complex novel by Joyce so badly I was ready to be disappointed by Joseph Strick's script and Fred Haines, given the fantastic complexity of the original text. However, the film was very well done and a great tone translation, naturalism and frivolity of the book. <br /> <br /> It certainly helps to read the original text before watching the movie. I believe the latter would seem inconsistent with the very odd episodes, apparently accidentally sewn together, without reading the text to help you understand the plot. <br /> <br /> It is strange to see how "dirty" the film, considering that he was shot in Dublin in 1967, the Irish film censors only finally unlocked it for viewing by the general audience in Ireland, as in the end of 2000 years (it has been shown to a limited audience in a private film club, movie theater Irish in the late 1970s). Joyce eroticism is not just a naturalistic and untidy, it offers plenty of wild "perverse" episodes. It does not matter that many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still quite a taboo when the film was made in 1967. <br /> <br /> It's amazing and a pleasure to watch the cream of Irish Actor 1960 dear players all daring to utter, and to take an extremely transgressive lyrics Joyce with such pleasure. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
