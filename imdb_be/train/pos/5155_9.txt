"Hitler: The Rise of Evil." Shrouded in controversy, before it ever aired, and the dispute may overshadow the performance of the film <br /> <br /> Those who criticzed film in which they have not seen, and did so in good faith, on the basis of misconceptions that would be too sympathetic to Hitler. However, they did not understand the point: the humanization of the evil Hitler did not sympathize with him. Much more disturbing to realize that the heinous acts committed by one of the greatest villains in history have been committed by man. Sick, sick maniac, to be sure, but a man nonetheless. We need to know the story of how Hitler could come to power in order to prevent its recurrence. <br /> <br /> Â«The Rise of Evil" is highlighted by a brilliant, career best performance from Robert Carlyle, who makes Hitler a human being ever redeeming him in any way. Carlyle flawlessly captures the look and manner of the Nazi leader, rather than allowing incarnation become a caricature or separate us (Anthony Hopkins was not quite able to accomplish when he portrayed Hitler in "Bunker", another very well-made film for television). At the time, it was repelled by the depravity of Hitler's anti-Semitism and the virulence of the ants, Carlyle gives him a certain magnetism and the power of the real Adolf Hitler had possesed. In the end, while more people would follow him? <br /> <br /> From different story, of course, the most important features Modine as a reporter Fritz Gehrlich, which makes it his life's work to draw attention to the reality of Hitler and Nazism. While performance Modin is a little stilted in part 1, part 2, he seems to have settled in the characters gives us a real hero in the movie, full of villains. Peter Stormare and Liev Schrieber also provide strong support. <br /> <br /> Part 1 of this two-part mini-series suffered a bit from too choppy, including a look at Hitler's childhood, which lasts only the duration of the opening credits. And in part 2, section detailing Hitler's relationship with his niece, and his mistress Eva Braun, less successful than the central plot, but serves to give us more insight into his mental and emotional state. <br /> <br /> In the end, no film about Hitler can not make us understand. The average person, fortunately, unable to ever understand the man who will try to wipe out an entire race of people. "Hitler: The Rise of Evil" tries less to make us understand Hitler, and more, to make us understand how he came to be a power. This is an important story that should be told, and it is impossible to believe anyone who has seen the film would have to accuse him nothing but the best of intentions, and the ability to do anything but good. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10. *** 1/2
