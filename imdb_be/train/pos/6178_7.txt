fifth feature of Mitchell Leisen as a director, and he shows his versatility, directing the musical, after his previous films were heavy dramas. It also plays a cameo role as a conductor. <br /> <br /> You can say that it is the pre-code film, and nothing like this has not been done in the United States for some time after that (like 30+ years). Leisen did not shoot the musical numbers that they were similar to what the audience sees - not widescreen shots, or top a la Busby Berkeley. What I find funny or interesting is the fact that you never see the audience. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, resulting in a rather characterless, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their usual persona cinema. Gertrude Michael but provides a bit of a spark <br /> <br /> interesting musical numbers and some good (Abduction Rhapsody, in particular, it's funny), but the drama is unconvincing and fake. - Three kills too many, and there is minimal emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie could have been so much better.
