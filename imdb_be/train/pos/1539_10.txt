I saw it on the Mill Valley Film Festival. Hard to believe that this is the directorial debut of Mrs. Blom, is a beautifully paced and executed. A large cast of characters may be due to the novel, Anne Tyler, that is, they are layered with background and potential futures, NO false notes, sudden bursts of humor among the self-inflicted and anxiety is very real, if not strange dilemma. If you've seen "The Best of Youth," you'll learn how well-drawn characters through small moments, even as the story moves forward quickly. I really hope that it is spreading in the United States. I live in a rather difficult film market, but we rarely Swedish films of all kinds.
