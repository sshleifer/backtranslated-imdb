Page 3 this is a great movie. History is so fresh and interesting. Not once during the film did I find myself staring into space. Konkana Sen did a good job in the movie, but I think that someone with more glamor and enthusiasm it would be better, but it does a great job. All support the actors were very good and helped the film together. Bohm Iran did a great job. There is one thing that stands out in this history, this film is great and very realistic, do not beat around the bush is very straight forward by sending him a message. I think, more than a movie, how it should be done, I'm sick to watch the same movies cotton candy all over again, they become difficult to digest at the moment. Each person must look Page 3, it's a great movie. -Simply has 2 cents :)
