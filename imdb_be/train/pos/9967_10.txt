There are some things I will never understand; why lingerie comes in threes on the packaging when it is obvious that not enough sample. Also, I will never understand this movie, and it's brilliant. When you approach this film is waiting for the actual movie, you may also approaching, Satan is waiting for a hug; although it is quite possible if you greet Satanic figure of this film. Take, for example, Pitch; the most inefficient, camp, unhellish devil image as Freddie Mercury and Wayne Sleep teamed up to create a ten-foot-devil costume on the red paint of the body and horns, covered with condoms. However, it does create some of the funniest moments of any film ever. Seriously, it does not say. The same can be applied to any other sign, block the little girl who acts so painfully innocent she is likely, overcompensating a serious crime, which it is part. Again, if the inter-space Recon Santa real station, there is no chance that it could have avoided it for so long. Simply put, if you have not seen this film, you can not consider yourself a serious amateurs. Achingly funny characteristic operating concept, and almost under the radar of racism makes it is to see beyond any film to date (if you're after pure laughter, that is).
