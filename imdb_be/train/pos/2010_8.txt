I thought that this movie was pretty good. Some parts were commonplace, but it is clear, as it has been done for more than 55 years ago. I thought that the best performance in the film was given to Michelle Morgan, who played Millie convincing. Jack Haley is also very good, as Mike O'Brien. Despite the fact that I'm not a big fan of Frank Sinatra, I think he was very good in this movie. If your cravings is to bad, over the top of the musical comedy, higher and higher is the film for you. <br /> <br />
