<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say that I have Jake speed. I've seen it at least 10 times. This film is one of the funniest movies ever made. The film begins with Margaret (Kopins) trying to find his sister. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family did not hear anything. Along comes Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford), telling her exactly where her sister and makes a suggestion to search for it. Jake Speed ​​hero. It does not work for the money, because he just wants to help and have a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him around and writes his adventure novels. This film is a great adventure. It's fun, it's futuristic, it's just wonderful. I believe that it is a cult film with very little cult. Crawford is perfect as Jake speed and throws some of the sharpness that you will never forget. Kopins and Christopher as good as a girl and sidekick, respectively. John Hurt, the guy who blew up in the abdomen alien, plays the devil, pervertish villain, which only adds to the fun. In many ways, this film looks like Indiana Jones, in a sense, it's like a James Bond movies. Maybe it should be called the Indiana Bond, but that is the name, this is a very enjoyable film.
