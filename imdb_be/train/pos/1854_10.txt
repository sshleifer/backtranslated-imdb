Developing a critical look at the film, and the love of a good movie, I went to Antwone Fisher with my breath held symbolic. While I calm supporter of Denzel Washington - as his skills as an actor and his public persona; I am honest enough to admit fan (very few) times when he did not quite hit the mark in a movie or two. And I could be wrong of anyone - after all, I'm not an actor. But this was different - Denzel would infuse the experience of his career, and the management, processing the film one of the most sensitive subjects known to man - child abuse. In his directorial debut, no less. And to develop this film to show that it successfully to introduce human triumph. I do not want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I was not. <br /> <br /> What I see is a promising film that connected different audiences, and gave the inexperienced viewer a short but true look at the young man's life, whose childhood was a living hell, but who won in spite of all this. This film has made it - and nary a dry eye in any color in the theater proved. It takes one to know that the themes in this film, to know when the truth is presented. He takes a talented director, to tell you the story convincingly, if you do not feel it. And if he can further engage your audience and bring in the audience emotionally react, without pity, the director has done his job. In any film. Black, white, purple or polka dotted. This is what makes a good movie. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and most of all, Antwone Fisher - you really won.
