Just saw the series A Perfect Spy mini in one breath, one can not do anything but take my hat off - pure masterpiece, which, compared with other Minis on Le Carré Smiley has a totally different quality <br /> <br />. The Minis about Smiley, it's Alex Guinness, and Smiley who steals the show - the other actors just to support it, we can say, <br /> <br /> There ensemble of history, it is important as. lead actor, Peter Egan played perfectly in the final episode, the entire charismatic general. <br /> <br /> Egan just playing a guy named Magnus Pym, who, lying, being crafty and to tell people what they wanted to hear, very well-liked by all, big and small. The only one who seems to understand his inner essence Alex, his Czech handler. <br /> <br /> Do not have a car for a spy, and / or a traitor, it was said better! Once listened to his life from an early age, we are well aware that this is what allows you to turn him into a traitor. His ability to lie and fake everything that makes it into a "perfect spy", as his Czech handler calls it. <br /> <br /> And, following his life, we understand how difficult it is to return to the straight and narrow way, as soon as you turned it. He trundles on, even if he never get anything out of it economic, besides promoting their masters spy MI5. Everyone is happy, yet false information flow continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus's father, played superbly Ray McAnally, is defective fraudsters who always imagines scheme to con people with their money. In subsequent years, it was his son who must save it again and again. But the example set by his father and uncle, who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison, and his mother was sent to a shelter, Magnus soon learns that sooner lying lifeline, not telling the truth. First, he overdid it a bit, but quickly learn to speak properly lies, and be constant, not changing history from time to time, that he said to those who want to hear about himself and his father. <br /> <br /> His Czech handler Alex skillfully played Rüdiger Weigang, creates, with the help of Magnus nonexistent network of informants, which supplies the British MI5 with fake information for many years, and years, just as the British did with German spies, who were active in the UK before and during the war - they continued to send bogus information in Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves were transformed, liquidated or simply been replaced by MI5 men <br /> <br />. young boys who play Magnus in his younger years makes it great, and most of them are more charismatic than older, a little more cynical and tired, Pim plays Egan. But you buy the difference easily, as often happens, we change the whole life of the interest in sadness or indifference. <br /> <br /> In fact, worth the money!
