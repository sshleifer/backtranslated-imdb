The State Department would not want to see this movie because they have a beef with the Iranian government. Nevertheless, it shows us how civilized Iran is in fact, in spite of the content of the film, which focuses on the struggle of women there equal rights in the simplest of terms: the ability to watch a football match at the stadium, the audience is strictly limited to only men. The film is funny funny in itself is proof of the freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I enjoyed this film intensely. Five girls are trying to penetrate the border police at the box office gate of a football match between Iran and Bahrain. The ensuing comedy too funny to describe, on the bus ride to the stadium to the police plea and subsequent detention of girls, the resulting end. Do not miss this classic film. It must be seen. One of the best foreign films that I have seen in recent years.
