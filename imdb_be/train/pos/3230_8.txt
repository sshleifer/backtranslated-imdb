Okay, so the soldiers are not deep and significant, as the blade or as big budget as Terminator 2, but overall I found it very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> the fact that Kurt Russell remained in character not to speak and be almost soulless made those moments when humanity broke through all the more acute. I found it an image of limited emotional development more touching than Arnie movies T (and, before I get comments like this, I know that Arnie was a cyborg, and Kurt was a man, but the premise put forward by both was the same film). <, Br /> <br /> So the film itself, a smart US / Brit cast is able to fill this little story. Not quite sure when Gary Busey and his two deputies were thieves or sweets, so it could not decide whether I like them or not. The colony was slightly more realistic or misguided bunch of peace-loving / trusting / cowardly provincials get wiped out from the get go, no group of subversive aggressive paranoid about terrorists offworlders and each other. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is good, and unlike other comments I do not think that this will have a negative impact on his career (as opposed, perhaps, Escape from LA - sequels are fickle beings). Pertwee really made his late father proud by continuing the noble families of Sci-Fi ancestry. And the rest of the actors helped to concretize this pathetic group of people who do most of a bad situation and not doing too badly. <br /> <br /> If you see this on the chart TV I would recommend giving it a chance, I do not think you will be disappointed.
