My wife and I took our 13 year old son to see this film and were absolutely delighted with the charming fun of the film. It has the added appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the movie and especially the chorus Hallie Eisenberg in "Boys so strange." It's refreshing to see a film that is unforgivable shows that boys and girls are really different their emotional and social composition. Boys do these kinds of strange things, and tend to survive to tell the story and scare off their mother's stupid! We enjoyed the film so much that my son and 11-year-old friend, I and my daughter's 23-year-old man went to see a movie the next day during the day guys. We had even more fun the second time, and everyone raved about it. It is pure and charmingly acted on the pre-adolescent actors that resemble TV Classic «Freaks and Geeks». We all believe that will be the sleeper hit not unlike «Freaks & Geeks», which has not survived their first season, but the sell-out of its DVD-release. We see it, especially if you have boys, and you will find that it stimulates conversation about fun and safety! Girls will love it because of the opportunity it gives to say, "Boys so amazing!"
