Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time, and one of my favorites. It's amazing how he catches in each of the characters he plays that makes them real <br /> <br /> I remember, many years ago, we had a party at our house. - friends came, we sat around the table, eating and drinking wine, talking, laughing, - having a good time. The TV was on - was the movie that we did not pay much attention. Then, all of a sudden, we all stopped talking and laughing. Glasses do not clink, the villa is not moved, the food was getting cold on the plates. We could not take his eyes off the screen, where a young crippled man whose entire body was against him, and who only had control of his left leg, picked up a piece of chalk from his foot, and for what seemed an eternity trying to write a one word on the field. When he finished writing, that one word, we all know that we have witnessed not one but three wins - the triumph of the human will and spirit, the triumph of the movie, which was able to catch the moment as it is on the tape, and the triumph of the actor, I not acted, but that was his character. <br /> <br /> Jim Sheridan "My Left Foot" is a riveting, sentimental bio-drama about Christy Brown, a man who was born with cerebral palsy in the slums of Dublin; who became a painter and a writer, who has found the love of his life. <br /> <br /> I love every one of the performances Day Lewis (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY), but I think his biggest role was Christy Brown in "My left foot"
