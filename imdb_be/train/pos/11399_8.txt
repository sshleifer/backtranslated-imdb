Thus, the plot on shaky ground. Yes, all right, so that there is some chance inserted the song and / or dance sequence (for example: Adam and concert stage action Henri). And Leslie Caron is not very, um, you know ... act. <br /> <br /> But one way or another, "An American in Paris" was able to pass through all of this, as polished, upscale musical-- largely based on the incredible talent of dancing and choreography Gene Kelly charm and trucks it seems be imported into each scene with Caron. (He must, because it seems to have a problem with ... emoting.) <br /> <br /> The most experienced and technically impressive number in this musical, obviously, a 16-minute ballet until the end of the film. This amazing shot, and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. But my favorite character of the number must be Kelly sings «I Got Rhythm» with lots of French students, then breaking into an array of American dance. It just goes to prove you do not need special effects if you have some real talent * *. <br /> <br /> Or not at the level of "classics with" Singin 'in the rain, but there is quite high, however. Worth watching!
