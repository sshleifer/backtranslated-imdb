Well, no, I tell a lie, it's actually not the best movie of all time, but it's really enjoyable film, I know, no one has seen. <br /> <br /> This is a buddy cop movie starring Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) with some fluffy story about the missing prototype car engine or something, but it does not matter. the reason for this fun movie due to the interaction between the two wires, which initially did not like and do not trust each other, but in a shocking twist of fate, ended up becoming friends. The whole culture thing made the difference well enough to joke that this watch is quite funny, but with cheese and a pleasant sort of way. The soundtrack is cool, every cheese-like 80 the way it suits the film, I tried to find one of the songs for the ages, but as I work from memory what I think are some of the words I can not find it. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that the film has the most fantastic pay off any film ever, but I will not give that one away, oh no! In conclusion, I would this film for 48 hours \ most of the products Eddie Murphys including Beverly Hills, and all that stuff pal Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence have their names. If you are looking for a buddy cop movie and tired "straight white cop meets black cop funny StreetWise" give it a shot. You may be pleasantly surprised, so it turns the entire formula on its head "direct Japanese police encounters funny StreetWise white policeman.Â» <br /> <br /> I give it 7 to be honest I like more than that. I would I would look at it than a lot of things that I would give 8. But I think I know that deep down inside, it's a kind of madness that makes me like this film.
