Most of the complaints I've heard about this movie really come down to one thing: It's not Versus. Thus, the cast and crew are basically the same. So, Kitamura paraphrasing a few shots in the action scenes, which come in the second half of the film, but that's about where the similarities end. Versus is mainly all the street, demonstrating the ability to craft interesting Kitamura B-movie in natural places. For the survivors, almost all going on inside. In small, tight spaces. Here the art of design pushes in the face, and what art design it! We were treated to some very complex and interesting spaces, and our characters for the most part limited to these spaces. In addition, the main difference is that we do not get a lot of action here until the end of the film. Versus is all about action and cool, there is much more emphasis on characters and situations, and messing with the mind. Because of this, the Living is a much more interesting film than in the comparison. You can not poke it and go to a random scene watching five or ten minutes, cool zombies bloodshed, but you will be sitting glued to the screen for nearly two hours, he watched the interaction of several really interesting characters. <br /> <br /> Now I am happy that I ordered a DVD, despite some naysay. You should too! But be sure to understand that this is the second beast of Versus - is often slow and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it. I hope that the media picks it up Blasters for release named R1 DVD!
