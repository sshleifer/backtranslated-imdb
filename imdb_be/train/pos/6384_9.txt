It is written in stone that Disney animation just ~ ~ should be musicals. Right? Where? Show me. Because I found the attempt to be much more enjoyable for the ~ Sun ~ containing Hokey of five-year-old Disney standard musical fare. <br /> <br /> Although the story was not as interesting as it might be, it was still pretty good, and enjoyable adventure. I was hoping for a little more so, considering the subject, but this film ~ Sun ~ bitter disappointment or complete failure would be exhibited. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation medium, but the dialogue is quite convincing as the story, the plot, sub-plot and amazing creativity I have found in this production. I will refrain from setting out the plot, as it has been done and done, but this film is worth a look if you're a fan of fantasy. <br /> <br /> This, in my opinion, the best Disney. Animated Feature Film Duration <br /> <br /> He's rate of 9.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> enemy's :.
