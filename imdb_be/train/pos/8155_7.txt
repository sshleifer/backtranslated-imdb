I'm too old to know (or care) is that the difference between rap and hip-hop. And, being a Canadian, it is likely that I have never seen MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I thought that this movie was very funny when I saw him, a bright bit of satire. Hip-hop culture is so ubiquitous these days that it's hard not to hear about it again and again. (If only we could say the same thing about bagpipe music.) I got most of the jokes (at least I think I did). Of course, this comes from Spinal Tap, but there are many goals that could be treated Tap. Just do not carpenters, they are sacred.
