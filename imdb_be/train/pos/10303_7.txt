Bruce Almighty Bruce Nolan history, the average person who feels that God is ruining my life. God confronts him and show Bruce error of his ways. Of course, someone gives God's strength could take the worst. Bruce Almighty good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always, Morgan Freeman first speed and seems to be right at home, as God, and cast brings the story together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they look a little too much on facial expressions Curry. I liked the fact that the film is actually painted God, not only that, but as a black man. I thought it was very good, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some funny scenes, the opening scenes of cookies, for example, the other a little bit, but still a good film to hit the target. 10 6/7
