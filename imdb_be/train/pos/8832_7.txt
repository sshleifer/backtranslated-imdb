"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed "Esther" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and pop, everything can be 15-17 years old in 1953, Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Five friends and charged mind jazz, blue jeans, or anything of the American think. <br /> <br /> a very close relationship teenagers sharp, and ultimately sacrifice willingly made to try to help one of the group who have fallen to unexpected difficulties. As a result of changes in communist politics, they go different ways and reunited in 1985 (a year before the film was made). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie with some reservations. Subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there are a number of dialogues, which did not have any subtitles at all. Perhaps conversational pace is needed, but I could not always read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand what the character was involved. I watched a movie (video from our public library) with the other, and none of us really understood the part of the story about the acquisition of streptomycin for a sick relative. <br /> <br /> This is the Yugoslav film majority efficiently transported teens feel invulnerable, idealism, and a strong and loyal relationships with each other. There is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing until the end, to who these characters were vis-one thousand nine hundred fifty-three plaster, and what actually happened. <br /> <br /> I would rate it 7 out of 10 and would like to see other movies director, Jovan ACIN (1941-1991).
