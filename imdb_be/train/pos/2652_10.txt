Why do not more directors these days to create horror movies like «The Shining»? There's a simple answer to that: the modern day filmmakers Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once and for all, with this film, he is truly one of the greatest filmmakers and film directors of all time. <br /> <br /> So, the story is quite simple. A man by the name of Jack Torrance (brilliantly played by Jack Nicholson) and his family moved into a large, secluded hotel, to watch him in the offseason. The kicker is that the previous caretaker hotels brutally killed his wife and two girls. Furthermore, it can be most easily summed up by the title of the film, but you should look to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first film in a very long time to hit me as "scary." This is some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the panic factor is amazing music. Music was an important part of the film Kubrick (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a few), and he certainly will not be disappointed with this. The cost of fully sets the tone, and the film will not be the same without him. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must comment on the legendary performance Nicholson. Jack terribly convincing as a crazed killer. In fact, only his eye steals a few scenes from the film. This is a first-class actor, which must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> There will never be a horror film, which fully complies with this one. Rest in peace. Stanley.
