I saw it and I love that Melissa is well play a role. It was in fact true. My brother in law saw it with my sister and I, and when I mentioned to my sister that I forgot, it was based on a true story (I saw him a few years ago.) He said just because it all my life, you you think of his present and my sister and I were, as it were, in any case, I was wondering if anyone knew that killing was or how someone who was really involved was, because I want to, to prove it to him. I love lifetime movies especially those that are true, or only those that teach a lesson. I thought I saw something about it a week ago, but I can not remember where, any help will be appreciated.
