I love him, Satan !!! David Tennant is such a great actor, and so Billie Piper !!! Who else loves Will Thorp to pieces ??? He's so cute, is not it? I hated bits, where he was possessed by the devil, and where he was told to "go to hell", as Rosa spoke so directly. Keep in mind that it was pretty funny when he said, "Rose, do us a favor, do you? Shut up! ". Mr. Jefferson was so bold, is not it? Die to save others. I was very sorry for Toby (Will Thorp), when he came out of the ownership of the 2 nd time, because he was so scared. I was like "Oh, my God, if I were a rose, I would be so scared for him." And when she hugged him, I was like Â«grrrrrr, he's mine! Hands off! "But I thought that was very cute. And the doctor .... Well, I thought he was going to say in progress "I love her to tell Rose," but he did not. Oh, well.
