While watching this movie, I was upset and distracted, and by the end, I wanted to give the film a solid 4 or 5. I thought the animation was random and everywhere, and there were too many things to do. Even my A.D.D does not have time. It was like traveling light acid. It looked flat, there was no measuring to anything. There were so many shapes, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the movie in the middle of the path and break my burned copy of this film. But after I finish playing, I went online to read about the film, and I had to do a little research before watching this film. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kells is loosely based on the true story of the original Book of Kells. The little boy, Brendan, given the task of making a new page that is set at the largest book ever written. This book will contain information that will help to "change the darkness into light." Brendan lives in the village of Kells for the huge stone walls. Which take place in the 8th century, Brendan's uncle, the Abbot of Kells, is trying to build a wall to the Vikings with. Brendan's uncle insists that he will complete the wall, but the traveler and guardian of the "book" Brendan secretly trained to hone their skills illustrations, and convinces him to finish the "book" and pull it off the floor. <br /> <br /> All this time I watched the movie, I thought I had something missing, because I did not understand what was happening. I thought that I just do not have a piece of Irish history. A simple Google search has taught me everything I needed to know about the original Book of Kells. After reading many articles, my opinion on the film greatly changed. <br /> <br /> The Book of Kells is a copied version of the first few books of the New Testament transcribed into Latin Gaelic monks in Ireland in the 8th century, along with his paleographic and insular script, the book is also beautifully illustrated in the insular art style an early form of art knows this confusion, complexity and miniature illustrations. Much of the art in the Book of Kells is portrayed as a lot of art at that time, is flat and measured entirely infested prospects. But what does the Book of Kells stand out from the other early works of art is its use of multiple colors. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kells is very picturesque. Initially I thought that the animation was flat and boring. It reminded me a lot of cartoon Samurai Jack, who also had a flat and "Amen" look to it. After I learned about the artistic styles of the Book of Kells, it is obvious that many of the styles of the book are simulated in the film. There are lines and swirls and various forms that inhabit the mind of Brendan. Every time he goes in his view, a circular shape, resembling the sun, cogs, clock, and the wheels begin to fill the screen. The edges of the screen framed in steel decorated with moving triangles or circles. Transitions are filled with color, and Celtic knots. From the trees to the floor, a lot of things in this world are covered with molds or models. <br /> <br /> Since the work in 70 minutes minus credits, The Secret of Kells fun history lesson with a little adventure and stupidity thrown to keep people (only in children), are interested. I think that one should be largely open-mined for The Secret of Kells half art, half of the history of film. Despite looking like he was lively with Adobe Illustrator, It is very nice to watch a movie. But based on the 20 films submitted for Oscar consideration, I do not think it's worth to be nominated over Mary and Max. <br /> <br /> ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com
