Mainly profitable for RKO Radio, Bombardier stars Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as instructors at the school for the bomber pilots. O'Brien and Scott argue teaching methods, while their students are vying for the love of Anne Shirley. O'Brien's methods prove sound in the bombing of Tokyo. Scott and his team captured and tortured by the Japanese, but mortally wounded, Scott managed to set fire to gas truck, providing an ideal target for his fellow scorers. Stylistically, Bombardier's is one of the most schizophrenic war films, with moments of subtle sharpness (the death of a trainee Eddie Albert) alternate with scenes of absurd melodrama of "yellow peril" (Japanese literally hisses through clenched teeth as they are torturing helpless Americans). While it may not help, but it seems that as of today, Bombardier's entertainment is propaganda effort (the film is sometimes erroneously listed as the debut of Robert Ryan, who would have actually had that appears in front of the cameras since 1940. <br /> <br / > who is interested in receiving a copy of this film, please contact me at the following address: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
