Ghosts, who are still walking one of those movies that grab you and not let go until the end, especially if you see it as a child. After seeing the film, as an adult, you have to admit that it's actually not all that scary, but the story is very exciting and has given more mysterious scenes (particularly those with a terrible mummy) <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the film, without a doubt, the scene with his grandparents in their new RV; scene of the rocks is very exciting and very scary. In addition to the scene where the protagonist discovers the secret of his mother's pretty scary. <br /> <br /> So, acting in the movie is not so great, and the film sometimes seems to get a little boring, but in general the ghosts that still walk fun. It is a pity only a few people have seen the movie, this movie really deserves better. I just want to say, Mr. Flocker, you did a good job! And for all you producers out there Hollywood; If you want to remake the film, a remake of it!
