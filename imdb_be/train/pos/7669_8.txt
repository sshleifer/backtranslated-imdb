Dr. Mordrid is one of those rare films that are completely under the radar, but totally worth it. It really reminds me of the old TV series from the 30s and 40s. That is why I would love to see these films ... but judging by the rest of the output of the full moon there simply were not enough to satisfy tits typical audience. Unfortunately, due to the completely unnecessary sacrifice scene there are two too many for a family audience - which is sad, because without them "it could Harry Potter style magicfest, that children would eat. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar great - I was not sure if Ms. Nipar not scattered in the picture of A-list for this film, she was very believable. No, seriously! Anyway - it's a shame that they do not have the money to license the Doctor Strange, because I think it would be a total of kiddie events.
