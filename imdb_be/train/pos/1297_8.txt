Faithful adaptation of the witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed software engineers middle-aged (or something), rely heavily on the first person narrative, but no worse for that. Downbeat (in the form of a petty-bourgeois way), philosophical and black humor, the best way I could describe how the film and the novel, it is something like a more intelligent Charles Bukowski (no disrespect for the Central Bank is not assigned). Mordantly funny, but grim analysis of the social and sexual relations, the greatest achievement of the film is that it reflects the real life of the well-known way to ask: why not other movies like this? One of the rare examples of a good book does just a good movie.
