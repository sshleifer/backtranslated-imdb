... and the number allows you to forget all this. I'm three years older than the children drew in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive in the first gas shortages, and got my first post-college graduation working in the second gas shortage in 1979, 70 years have been really terrible time to be young - inflation, competing for a minimum of after school -wage work with thirty fired, horrible music, worse clothes. <br /> <br /> The most funny, this series does not ignore any of this and still manage to make 70 look fun, even for those of us who are old enough to know better. It manages to look 70 in the face - complete with time these clothes - and still fill the show with the hope of young people and the things that make high school and college years in the best of times and the worst of times. Then there are parents. Two young lovers on the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - there really is terrible parents with the best of intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, not quite of June and Ward, although they are common for decades. They represent what happened when the 60 finally reached the suburbs during the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for 1960 to show my whole life to give his strangeness legitimacy. Eric's friends Fez, Kelso and Jackie to round out the group are nerdiness, well-intentioned incompetence and snobbery, respectively. Hyde teenager unusual for a show about the suburbs, but it largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt, even if the cards are dealt in the main absentee and neglectful parents. I strongly recommend that all eight seasons, though the season eight is really lagging behind a bit because of the absence of Eric.
