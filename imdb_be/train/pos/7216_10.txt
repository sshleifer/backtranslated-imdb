Nobody is better not to spoil this part of the job! Awesome movie! Written qualified like Ira Levin and painted with the best career performance of Christopher Reeve and one of Kane's very best, this is just great. I would like to catch the stage version somewhere ... maybe someday I will. I hope that this is grossly undervalued, overlooked movie was not too hard to find, because it is a "must" for any Hitchcock, Agatha-Phile or lover great film. One of the few films that I could not immediately decide or predict, and stands on the second or even third viewing, «Deathtrap» receives 9/10 and receives every iota of it. We need and deserve more movies like this!
