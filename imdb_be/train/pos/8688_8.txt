Very high standard Columbo story that was actually filmed the first episode of a long series, but was initially transferred to the second (after "Murder by the BookÂ»). <br /> <br /> Robert Culp makes it the first of three performances as a killer guest in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency, who blackmails his wife (Patricia Crowley) a wealthy, influential businessman (played by a very sympathetic Ray Milland) after he falsifies a report in its favor, after he learned that she was having an affair. His wife later rebels against Hema intimidation, but die in the rage .... <br /> <br /> Very satisfying episode in many respects, particularly as the plot so much upwards is installed, and then developed and also, because of the rare Columbo ingredient . that the offense is manslaughter All of this is further enhanced when the widowed husband of the killer uses to help Columbo in his research: a feature that facilitates the numerous good quality stage, especially in the first sequence when the three central characters meet and fundamentally deceptive quality Columbo Is a country as evidence. <br /> <br /> Directed by Bernard L. Kowalski talent and at the respective high level, it really set the tone for the entire series (with "Murder by the Book" lowered bad final). The script from the creators Richard Levinson and William Colombo Link is an accurate, well-structured and well-thought out and based on sustainable, productive pace and meaningful sequences that really demonstrates the unpredictability of the plot. Ultimately, the final dignity embodies that Columbo was always one step ahead of the killer. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a very thin piece of detective work, Columbo, and strongly believes that the film crew was working positively and constructively to make a polished story Colombo.
