Here is my first David Mamet film director. Location, as this was his first as well. <br /> <br /> The story here is uneven and it moves along, like every cheater movies, from small to big minuses minuses to the overarching con. It's like "Grifters", but without the level of the film actor. (In the film, John Cusack was a kind of soft, but it was the nature of his character.) To act here is very shallow (I sometimes wondered when insipid acting by Krauss had to be some kind of attack on psychoanalysis). At least in the beginning. He will never be very good, but it is developing is painfully stiff reading line after about ten minutes. At the beginning of the film, some of the lines Lindsay Kraus - the way it reads them - sound as if they were internal monologue or story that they are not. With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is not as fun as it should be. I expected CrackerJack line ring-a-ding-ding that roll off the tongue, but it is those who do not. All this sounds very much to read, but do not say. Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and weakened, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct their words. He's too valuable to them here, and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. What is more surprising is that in addition to this, the film does not look or feel like playing. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with the "Glengarry Glen Ross" that it looked too much like filmed theater, but in this movie, the actors were not only met, but calmly and freely. Everything flowed <br /> <br /> I would not mind so much if it sounded like a movie character to speak of a movie -. Or even play a game character to say the line - but here it sounds like a movie (or book) characters speaking paylines. This is an amazing jumble of theater and cinema, which simply do not work. This does not mean that the film is bad - it is not, it is often very interesting. The best piece in the middle <br /> <br /> This is the standard material against the film :. The new guy (in this case, woman) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) is involved in the seedy underworld swindler. As it is linked: it is a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help him with his gambling debt, so she goes to the house of games, dull games room, where fraudsters in the back room work. I admit, the installation is quite unlikely. (If they were just waiting for Kraus come? Were they expected her to write a check? Does Bill was in on it? One of these issues is certainly in the end, however.) <br /> <br /> And from here cons begin to roll. I found those newcomers - small pupil of them - to be the most fun. We get a lesson in the art of pastry as much Kraus is. <br /> <br /> We see the arrival of the end, and then we do not see the other end comes, and then the real ending I did not see coming, but maybe you did. The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth, and the last scene in the film, we understand that the second Kraus went into the house of games she found his true vocation. <br /> <br /> I will forgive annoying discovery improbable bits and odd line read, because there are a lot of good things here. If the first part of the film seems unnatural, stick with it. After the half-hour mark he really get some momentum going. If you want to have fun fraudster movie, here it is. If you want to Mamet, go to watch Â«Glengarry Glen Ross" again. - James Foley made it better <br /> <br /> ***
