I must say that the events of 9/11 did not hit me until I saw this movie. It took me a whole year to come to grips with the devastation. I was the one who changed the station on the radio and on TV channel, when there was no talk of the towers. I'm tired of hearing about it. If it was broadcast on television a year and a day later, I shout my eyes. It was the first time I cried after the attack. I highly recommend this film. I watch TV now, after 5 years, and I'm still crying over the tragedy. The fact that it has one of the only video frames of the first plane hitting the tower strange. It was an accident, and look where it got them. The two brothers make me want to be there to help.
