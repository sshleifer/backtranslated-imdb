It is always a pleasure when a detective wraps up the case and the offender brought to book. In this case, the climax gives me even more pleasure. . To see the smug grin wiped out by Abigail Mitchell when she realizes that her victim had left "a death certificate", which leaves no doubt about its wines are very nice <br /> <br /> Please note: while I admire Ruth Gordon performance, her character really, * really * irks me. She is selfish and demanding. She gets her own way, putting on a simpering act of "little girl", which is embarrassing in a woman of her age. Worse, it is now set themselves up as judge, jury and executioner against the husband of his late niece. <br /> <br /> If Columbo gets too close, she was trying to break it, manipulating it in the creation of an unprepared speech to the high-end audience will. He turns the tables perfectly, providing a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police work. <br /> <br /> Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice. Abby final appeal to his affection is rejected because he has too much self-respect to do their job well. Here's another situation you can not escape from Ms Mitchell!
