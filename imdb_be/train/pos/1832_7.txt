I saw two movies over the weekend, one was "Kaal" and the second "train station". Both films are made in the "Bollywood", but they are worlds apart. The main difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shaw made his deep mark with «Ankhen», one of the best comedy Hindi movies. His casting Charecteres perfect. History, apparently taken from Gujerati game is amazing, the treatment is excellent with some exceptions. In Bollywood, if the film has collected the first thing the director of Bollywood inclined to do is sign up for a music director and this guy (mediocre Malik in this case) is required to entice six songs to fulfill his contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah to use them to calm Finacier and therefore grandmother, who just can not get enough of these numbers. A lot of music director can not churn out good songs inexorably, as clearly shown in this film. None of the songs is not any music, and they are clearly intrusive narrative stories, in addition to the background music and Europeanized version of Bharata-nate. Duels and the role played by father and son good acting by Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His stunt scene clearly outstanding. Good director surrounds himself with good actors, and he is willing to wait for a good story comes in this super film. Then we have a cheap, classless insipid Producer how Sharukh Khan, who will stoop low to shamelessly plug and promote waste as «Kaal», to enrich themselves at the expense of improving the art, and they surround themselves with the border talent, and they return on investment before the word getting around. This locust Bollywood who hunt an unexpected audience to collect "slapstick film" award, granted to Bollywood Chamcha and most of them in the media.
