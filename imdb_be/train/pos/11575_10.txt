I am saying that I mean that it is not a well made movie, but it is a very good version of the real events and the best image so if you far.and WW2 buff, it's fun for you, because there are three of the four members played saboteur role in this film. This theater, which operates in the best case, but then it has been said before the floor of the documentary. <br /> <br /> I am personally a supporter of our living almost too human heroes of the Second World War, and there must be hundreds of these films, showing us that they did so, he will not be forgotten next generations.Cause nowadays children do not read books, they watch movies. <br /> <br /> So, if you want action extravaganza, hiring a private Ryan, it's true about the lingering pain, outrageous stamina and the will to fight, when all seems lost.
