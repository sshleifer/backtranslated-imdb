It's the French and the Belgians are doing what they do best. It's bizarre, visually inventive, exciting and emotionally difficult speaking. Director Wang Dormal, Jacques takes us into the world of Georges, Down syndrome patient and his quest a meaningful relationship with someone, just anyone. This is not done in a condescending, but with a great sense of humor and honesty. Georges interaction 'with the corporate governance guru, Harry dazzling processed - transition from comedy to tragedy return to comedy again with incredible ease <br /> <br /> On the eighth day puts such Hollywood fare as Oscar winning Barry Levinson Rain Man or Robert. Zemeckis in Forrest Gump is well and truly in the shade. Sometimes it is the humor of Milos Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with shades of Dennis Potter thrown in for good measure. <br /> <br /> As emotionally blunted and desperately lonely yuppies, Harry Auteuil turns in another sublime performance. But this is combined with a brilliant Pascal Daquin as Georges. This is a film with a uniformly strong performances and so many memorable set pieces - a shoe store scenes, auto scene, dance George genesis in "Jesus he knows me," conference scene, fireworks scene. If you have not seen it, there's only one thing to do. Just rent it or to attend the show in retro cinema near you and see what you've been missing. Better yet, buy this film. Sheer genius .....
