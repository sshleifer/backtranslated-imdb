Lisa the hotel manager or owner, and she gets on a flight to Miami. She ends up sitting next to a murderer by the name of Jackson, who tells her that she should go to the family room, or her father dies. The reason it has to go into the room, because Jackson wants to blow it up. <br /> <br /> This is a great suspense film, because Lisa is trying several ways to avoid this trick, Jackson. The whole storyline is great, and I thought that they could have spent more time on the plane. There may be more than the plane, but other than that, the whole movie was pretty good. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the ending, because it was heart-stopping. I did not know what was going to happen, and I was surprised by this. For me, this film is simply removed.
