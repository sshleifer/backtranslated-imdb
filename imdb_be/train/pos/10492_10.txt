I've seen Saving Grace as soon as it came out on video. Since then, he has become one of my favorites! The plot is not particularly difficult, but it does not take from the entertainment. This cartridge is full of comic moments, and has a very endearing quality. Characters, which makes the movie so well. Each of them has its own quirky qualities that add to the humor, the two old ladies, played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllis A leap to mind. Superb action has been done by all, especially the brand Blythen. She and Craig Ferguson was great to pull together some of the funniest moments. If you are looking for a good comedy, I would definitely recommend this movie!
