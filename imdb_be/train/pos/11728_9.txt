There are two things that I love about Elvira, and they are both larger than it is, and it keeps them covered: her mind and her talent. The film is the best thing to show how funny she can be and how she commands attention. Looking like a clone of the combined Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, she inherits a remote relative of the property only to discover that it is indeed the successor of the occult. The comedy in this film the best thing about it, but it could be much more frightening and terrible. It mainly campy fare with so many bad horror movie links in it, such as rioting crowds or cursory character, which produces off and stumbles on his heels. My favorite part is when she uses her superior talent to break the chains holding it locked in the cemetery. Ending sappingly sweet, as if it was written Bradys, but Las Vegas act at the end seems to be too ambitious for this type of film.
