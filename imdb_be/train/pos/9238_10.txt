While others have noted, this video is only an edited version of two shows: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", when viewed original shows, you will see that the dialogue with the publication of this video was cut. I found this video version is much better, because the scenes and lines have been added to it. I would say if you want to see the show in its original version, see the video version on VHS. They have more to offer the fan than the original episodes are available on DVD now. Another good video for Conquest of the Earth, which had more scenes with Galactica 1980 than did the actual transmission itself. Overall, I rate it as 10, because it gives you more love than what the network wanted to show in the time slot they gave producers.
