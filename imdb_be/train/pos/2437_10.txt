To say that this film is simply demonizing Catholics and distortion of history, does not correspond to reality. This is not what this movie. <br /> <br /> What this film is a comment on the abuse of the Church (although this can be changed to any powerful body), means that the abuse affects the person and the family, and how so many people want to just let and are often involved in abuse, not thinking about myself. The fact that the Catholic Church, which is in error, simply because of the nature of the true story of the film is based on. In order to mark this as propaganda against Catholics seems to miss the truth that the Catholic Church has made many times; its history is often not great, and that's what movies like this and highlight what needs to be allocated. Yes, we must comment on the abuses committed by other organizations, but it is not within the competence of the film <br /> <br /> This is an amazing film that brought me to tears and worth watching. - "If we do not study the past, we are bound to repeat it"
