Going for something away from the deliberately rough things he usually does, John Waters (Happy Birthday, John!) I made a parody of celebrity / art world. Edward Furlong plays a major role, the working class teenager in Baltimore, who likes to take pictures of things. If the New York agent (Lili Taylor) finds that his job, she offers him a big break, which he accepts. But as soon as he hits it big, he should reconsider all. <br /> <br /> Basically, "Pecker," looks at how he had lost his friends and his normal life as soon as he becomes a celebrity. Kind of things that we might expect, of course, but with the Waters of direction, there are always a few things that shock us (you'll know them when you see them). I certainly recommend it. Also starring Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
