I loved this movie. It was so well done! More action and drama and historically accurate. I love movies Romy Schneider. This is one of the stones, not as great as Sissi, but still rocks! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, she commented and said the French dubbing. Well, it was originally a German film is not French. So much so. Secondly there was a story, perhaps you are not familiar with the story. Oh, and her mother played the role of the governess, and not the teacher. And the plot really was not Cinderella, and Queen Victoria, maybe missed that detail. <br /> <br /> But in any case .... a story in this film is great, I love historical and Queen Victoria is very exciting! I love all the historical material. Like the guy who is trying to manipulate her mother. And when she ran away and met her future husband, and he showed her "a new type of dance" waltz. If Waltzing was new was considered a kind of scandalous, because the couples are dancing so close. Yes, it was as a governess, my God! <br /> <br /> As well as clothes, I love clothes. Style of the great, strange skirt hoop. And, of course, Romy always looks very nice.
