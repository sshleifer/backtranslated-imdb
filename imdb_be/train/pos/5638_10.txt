I really liked this movie. Britney is a great role model for adolescents and should be higher estimate. This film is about following your dreams and never give up, no matter what people might say or do to discourage and criticize you. Holly performs their dreams just like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are moments in every life when people judge them for what they are not who they are. Watching this movie will make you realize that you are special in their own way, and that you should follow your dreams, no matter what happens. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. She will never know how much it means to me. Bravo Britney. You are the greatest !!!
