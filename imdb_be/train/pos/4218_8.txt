I have not really seen too many movies ... In fact, Colombo, I think I saw only one or two, in addition to this. I've always loved Columbo, though, as some do not even see that much of him. Peter Falk is and always has been the perfect choice for the character, because of his looks, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof of this is that although the number of started all the way back in 1968, the last (and probably not the last) of the film was made in 2003, that is 35 years old. And Falk was 40 ago when he made the first. The series consists of 68 films (if my counter is not lit), all of which made for television. Everybody knows the character, despite the fact that nobody has ever seen a film with him in the movie. This is a great achievement, if you ask me. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I have with it is that the murderer and the murder revealed at the very beginning (although this may be the same for all the films Colombo), Edward leaving a mystery, but Columbo solves this problem, making it somewhat boring (since there are not very to look forward to at the end of the film). Go well, it is unlikely there is a scene where you're bored. Works very well, especially that Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have some great exchanges of dialogue in the film. The characters are well written and worthy of trust. Dialogue and script unusually good for a TV movie. In general, the film, but, surprisingly good for a TV movie, and certainly worth a look for any fan of Colombo and / or a crime / mystery clicks. 8/10
