Wilson (Erica Gavin) is caught by police and sent to jail in this spot and amusing example of Prime 70 operation, marking the directorial debut of Jonathan Demme. After writing and producing some of the New World, Corman films teachers, Demme has been given the opportunity to direct for the first time, and he delivers a film that not only provides the expected and delicious dose of nudity and violence, but has an attractive disingenuous quality to it as well; this is often as funny as it is to scream. <br /> <br /> Standout scenes include the lewd and crude vaudeville act in the style made for prisoners, as well as a powerful dream sequence / fantasy for anxious and obviously very depressed Superintendent McQueen (horror icon Barbara Steele makes a perfect turn in this antagonistic role). I also enjoyed a bank robbery gone awry scenes and theft scenes, which was just wild. As in other films of this kind, it is also commendable that this is the portrait of the empowerment of women, as pure exploitation. . These women are tough, they do not take garbage from anyone, and they are more than capable of handling themselves <br /> <br /> Our attractive cast here does a great part of their roles: John Brown, as aggressive Maggie, Roberta Collins as arrogant Belle, Rainbow Smith as cute and shy Lavelle, Gavin, as the wide-eyed rookie, and Linda Gold (aka Crystin Sinclair) in bright appearance, as an accomplice outside. <br /> <br /> because our climax plays out, Demme comes with a strained "beat the clock" to complete, as our heroine is a race to save Bella from a lobotomy predatory Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), the type of person who does not think anything taking advantage of women. <br /> <br /> bouncing with fragrant by John Cal√®s, "Caged Heat" upbeat entertainment and a guaranteed good time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
