This is another great movie that I had the good fortune to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker, and others). Back in the late 80's I was a relative newcomer to the genre, and is only valid on new Big Three JC, SH & YB. I was not sure what to expect when I paid my hard earned money to see it in the "Three by Classics" in the old Scala. I do not need to worry, I'm left breathless with this film. If you are a fan of Action / Kung Fu Cinema Hong Kong and have not seen this movie, do it now!
