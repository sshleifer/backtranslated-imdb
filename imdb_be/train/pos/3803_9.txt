What people do not understand this film is that it is not the beginning, middle and an end, it is only the conclusion of 26 episodes long TV series. So remember that if you say that the world has not been studied enough. This was done in a television show. <br /> <br /> As a large and stunning as the visuals, I think, *** SPOILERS *** dispute between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo closer to the end of the film was that in fact I love this movie. Seeing the characters I moved through the 26 episodes of the fight as it was painful, and seeing Gwizdo go bored by himself among the flotsam and Lian-Chu sharpened his blade was almost tear-jerking. <br /> <br /> Then we got a total contrast to the Lian-Chu combat this incredibly strange dragon (which was shown earlier in the series), and it Gwizdo babbling madly and indirectly threatens to kill Zoe. * Shudder * I'm surprised that this particular scene is not mentioned more than warnings. Any child who has a lick of sense would be able to see that Gwizdo he was not, and was totally going to strangle the little girl. That was enough to bother me, and I was 15. <br /> <br /> The world is amazing, the story is much better than most of the multimillion-dollar blockbuster, and it was a good way to see some of my favorite characters go. Check it out. :)
