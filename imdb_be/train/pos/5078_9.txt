This one stood out for its originality. I'm seriously tired of seeing Hindi films, which are a whole bunch corner of Hollywood and British films. Some shortcomings were inevitable, however, this film is a must-see. Surya drawing clean-cut, honest cop (as opposed to the pot-bellied, money-hungry ones we usually see) was amazing. He made a long way from their work in Nerukku Niro. I liked this movie so much that I had to have her. I'm not usually the type of senseless violence in the cinema, once I actually felt for each character, and so we can not bring myself to call it a "senseless" violence. I do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with the majority of the Hindi and Tamil movies. I absolutely loved this movie, because this lack of the same. ACT Anbuselvan reaction to the loss of his wife, not exaggerated, it is heart-wrenching and makes me bawl my eyes. There are certain moments when I watch a movie, if I want to press the FF button. Many times I wanted to do it in a movie theater. I never wanted to do it while watching this film. I really hope that Ghajini releases in the near future.
