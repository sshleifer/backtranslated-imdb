Japanese indie film with humor and philosophy, where the three main characters are literally running almost the entire movie, chasing each other because of the strange circumstances and comic coincidence. How they work, we can see what's going on in their minds, and how they got where they are at the moment. The act of running is a metaphor for the lives of these down-on-their luck people. In a sense that they really are in the pursuit of it is not what they originally were chasing, but the meaning of their lives and escape from their personal problems, and broken dreams. Running makes them feel truly alive. Great life-changing work adventure ends when they accidentally fall in the middle of something big, violent, and so absurd that it is ridiculous to sound manner. One of my favorite movies of all time director Sab genius.
