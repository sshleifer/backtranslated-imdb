It is really heart warming family movie. It is absolutely brilliant and trained animals "action" (if you can call it that), and (just think about the dog in "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" ... it was just a bad training). The history of Paulie is very well done, well played and in general the characters really developed, too. No more to say, except that it is a great movie <br /> <br /> The history ratings :. 8.5 / 10, working 7.5 / 10 animals + Fx 8.5 / 10, cinematography 8-10 <br /> <br /> May total score: 8/10 - BIG FAMILY FILM AND VERY worth watching!
