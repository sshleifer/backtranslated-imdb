He ran for 8 seasons, but this is the first thing in the beginning of 1959, and that finally, in the autumn of 1965, were shorter than 2-7 seasons. Chief William Paley, CBS canceled the production of rawhide after watching the 1st season 8 show, in September 1965, because he did not like the series without Eric Fleming as Gil favor, departed after a season 7. The last new episode aired in November 1965 year. lone 1966 CBS broadcast 4. January 1966, was repeated. <br /> <br /> I've often wondered why Rawhide entirely switch to color imaging, as this last season? Most major westerns in 1960 switched to color, 1965. CBS broadcast in color in the fall, for many of its comedies, but Westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide were in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last western (and the last prime-time network series to switch to color) September 17, 1966, in an episode of Snap Decision.
