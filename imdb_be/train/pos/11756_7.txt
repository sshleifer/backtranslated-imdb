The film did not do well at the box office. <br /> <br /> I've seen it in the preview. <br /> <br /> I have always enjoyed the film. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the film, where in the past the players moved. <br /> <br /> Not the best film ever put on screen, but pleasant. <br /> <br /> Robin did well with his role <br /> <br /> The best line of the film in the beginning, the character of Jack Robin :. "I was that SOB!Â» Washed here not to offend anyone. <br /> <br /> He was happy when he came to the DVD a few years ago in a wide screen / mailbox format. <br /> <br /> I am not a real football fan or sports fan. But, you do not have to be the one to love this movie.
