I just saw it last night, he was featured on the series of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation "hot eye". He has been featured recently (September 2003), the Toronto International Film Festival, as well as many others. This is an absolutely wonderful film. The creators of the film literally stumbled into history by being there to make a documentary about the Chavez. Instead, they were right in the middle of the action, as the coup unfolded. They had unprecedented access to the events and people, and for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. Of course, they have their own ideological perspective (they do the obvious), but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus on the events, people, and the background and history, leading to the coup. In the film, it is not innovative in stylistic or aesthetic feeling, and this, I think, the way it should be. What we will see that the "embedded" journalism should be fine. What will we see a remarkable story about the country strives to achieve democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez), who really cares about his people ... a story about power and greed, as the coalition of corporate / military / media interests combine to lead coup the democratically elected leader ... and unprecedented access to the historic event as it unfolds. <br /> <br />
