After watching the film last night, I was left with a feeling of hopelessness faced by organizations trying to solve this problem the film depicts. prostitution seems to be so large that it is difficult to understand how he can be defeated without major changes in government in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> In any case, on with the review. <br /> <br /> While it is a dark movie with uncomfortable central relationship is a very convincing film, and I would even go so far as to say that it was nice. The film was well-edited for the time of work and performance of Thuy Nguyen was fine. I also felt good Ron Livingston plays a very complex role. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have a little more insight into why Patrick feels that he has to help Holly, but perhaps the reason is simple, as he explains the nature of Chris Penn. I will not explain it here - go see a movie <br /> <br /> It's a good reflection film with obviously good intentions .. I hope he gets enough wide release in order to achieve a decent sized audience and get more support for the project K -11.
