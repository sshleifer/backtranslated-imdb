If the brave first came out, I was captivated, and admittedly one of the most ardent fans of the film. If Rob Roy came out, I was intrigued, and although I enjoyed the film, I do not think it was a great movie. However, as time passed, I thank you for Rob Roy grew up, and my enthusiasm Braveheart decreased. Braveheart is great fun, to be sure, but there are disadvantages as well. The most significant, in my view, this unflattering picture of Robert the Bruce, who was without doubt, the greatest king of Scotland. Another example is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which denigrates the film is proportional to the many historical distortions. I think I am also concerned by the fact that it is in this film could only see (at least to me), in hindsight, that the beginning of egomania Mel Gibson can be clearly seen for the first time. In contrast, Rob Roy grew on me over the years. Partly because it largely eliminates errors, I object most Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy, like good wine, becomes more and more mature and sophisticated with each viewing.
