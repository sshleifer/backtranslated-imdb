This film was a fascinating look at the Creole culture and society that few African Americans know. My own two children are the products of the paternal grandmother, whose father was a friend of Gens de Couleur libre and black leather women whose parents were former slaves. He married outside and against his culture and did not have access to all of his family for one sister, who felt sorry for her brother plight except; raising 8 children during the Great Depression of the 1929 year; providing the family with food, if she could. Of course, she was secretly helping the family, fearing for their own ex-communication. My daughter was fascinated by film. We did it's part of our libraries.
