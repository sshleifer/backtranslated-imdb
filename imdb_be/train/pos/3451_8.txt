First of all, this film was not released in theaters (Check does not speak), I say, they calculated the history curves of police, politicians and devotees newsmen were done to death, just send it to DVD and Cable TV> and take the money and run. <br /> <br /> That being said, I usually like this type of movie, especially with so called gypsum. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /> <br /> LLCool J, Carrie Elways, John Heard and on the side of the spinning wheel, Piper Perabo and Roslyn Sanchez. <br /> <br /> The story and history has been done to death, but higher than the cast brings life to this violent movie and it actually watchable. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake is good as a dedicated young reporter for the one-time newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman, the rest are either crooked cops, and politics, or a few decent guys in the house 2 girlfriends with LL COOL J & Justin Timberlake & do what is required is quite tough, many murders, etc., and not for children. In any case it's a great film, but for what it is and cast This is definitely good, <br /> <br /> *** Ratings (4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
