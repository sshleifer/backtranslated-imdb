Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in his own movie ... <br /> <br /> «The Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata" is an irreverent new take on the classic fairy tale. Which is a classic story, you ask? Why, "The Lion King", of course! <br /> <br /> So, if there is one thing that Disney never enough, is narcissism. <br /> <br /> But this does not mean that it is not a good film. This is mainly event «The Lion King», being told from the point of view of Timon and Pumbaa in. And it is because of this that you need to know the history of «The Lion King» from the heart, to see where they come. <br /> <br /> In any case, on one level, I was watching it and thinking, "Oh my God, this is so lame ..." and on another level, I had a ball Much of the humor is predictable -. I am Note that FUIB is two beds, a big one for yourself and one for a small Timon, in which we all know during the first nanosecond that Timon's going to take a lot. But this does not prevent him from being gay, which, IMO, is the "Hakuna Matata "in a nutshell. this is not what happens, it's like <br /> <br /> And a note of warning :. There are also some fart joke. Seriously, th waited anything else in the film, where the First Ukrainian International Bank occupies a central place? But like fart jokes go, they are especially good, and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseur. <br /> <br /> Returning voice talent big. I like surprised that some of the actors were ready to go back, then, that most of them only have two or three lines (if you're lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is especially welcome. <br /> <br /> The music is great, too. From «DIGGA Tunnah» at the beginning to "That's all I need," the adaptation of «Warthog Rhapsody» (a song that was cut from the «The Lion King» and openly is much improved in this embodiment), the music leaves nothing to complain about at all me . <br /> <br /> In the end, Timon and Pumbaa are awesome characters, and while it can be argued that the "Hakuna Matata" is just an excuse to see them in a variety of entertainment and assorted compromising situations let so be it. It's rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with. <br /> <br /> Am I starting to sound awful? <br /> <br /> Anyway, «The Lion King 1 1/2" is great if you've seen «The Lion King» too many times. Especially if you're thinking, "Do not be a fool, there is no such thing as seeing too much time" The Lion King ""!
