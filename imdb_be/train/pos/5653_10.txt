It was absolutely fascinating series and was sorry that I was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late at night in the UK. His style was so different from others of its kind, and all that was unnerving air of stylish fear him. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (no negative that I can see) to understand what is really innovative series it was and how it caught the imagination. Now I understand, reading the comments he got canceled, just so incredible. Which bundles "headless overpaid suited turkey" should be (or maybe still is) running around to do it.
