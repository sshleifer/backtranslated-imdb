I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love for the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford reflects the lyrical romanticism and visual splendor of high rocky mountains of Montana, as if he was a nineteenth-century landscape painter Thomas Moran and others like Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and speech to text by author Norman Maclean, and wonderful camera work by Philippe Rousselot (Kiss Snake, Reigne Margot). <br /> <br /> cast Redford complete. Meanwhile Skerritt is Rev. Maclean, a man whose teaching methods include fly-fishing, as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, his mother, and his sons, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt create a family, the interaction of which reflect the same problems as all clash with the growing teenage sons and then challenging young people. Both Schaffer and Pete is absolutely believable as brothers, whose love for fly fishing and each other will bind them together forever. It is the relationship between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women with the outside world that the base river flows in line with the narrative that is missing in so many Hollywood films produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> What makes this relationship special however, attention Redford gives the language which is spoken in the dialogue. It's a clever script, nice to hear and unforgettable in conjunction with stunning mountain and rivers of Montana. Words and speeches are setting a cast that goes up to them the material. Although the idea of ​​fly fishing may seem strange device for centering the story, it is not so implausible in the director's hands Redford. Considering material, Redford ode to a simpler time and life is worth reviewing again and again.
