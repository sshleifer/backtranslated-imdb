worth a look, especially with a good twist journalist with integrity, you would expect a large fall down storyline as Gray Owl will be convicted as a fraud, but it is not, and adds to the overall upbeat and inspirational theme and drama stories and movies. <br /> <br /> This should be the best performance of Brosnan today, he convinces well as English boy playing Indians. Stand the scene of his return? Aunts? where Brosnan and two elderly ladies actresses make a great scene is full of a sense of nostalgia and a life lost so little dialogue, but with expressions and the right direction. Perfect. <br /> <br /> history is so little known and so universal message, and all of this is important so sorry, this movie is not got the best recognition, maybe over time it can become a little classic and sleepers. I hope so. <br /> <br /> Well done Dickie Attenborough and actors.
