I had the opportunity to see the show of the film recently. I believe that it will be in theaters in Canada some time around Mother's Day. If in a theater near you ... GO! It's not funny feel-good film - it's more along the lines of feeling and thinking, the film <br /> <br /> The director does an excellent job on the development of character. - letting you in the heart, mind, and it hurts a little Hagar. Firstly, her attitude and behavior does not make sense. As her story unfolds, it becomes someone you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings compassion. I found it cute to the end of the film -. Especially when she opens her heart the young man in a hut on the lake <br /> <br /> Hagar relationship with her two sons sick - and reflect so many of our own experience in this world. Her youngest son, John, who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the edge of his seat - in the form of raw emotion, so authentic and rare <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see. Ellen Page acting in this movie. It is so different from a young woman, she plays Juno. This gives me an even broader appreciation for her acting skills. If you loved her in Juno, you'll love it in The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course, there's Helen Burnstyn, like Hagar. There's no, probably not valid ways of expressing power as much as the ability of an actor to make you forget all the other characters, they ever played. Never in the course of this film, I never thought Helen Burnstyn - I always thought only of Hagar. She swept me into her character. - hook, line and sinker <br /> <br /> The volume Kari Skoglend to capture on film the famous book one of Canada's most cherished authors impressive. She brilliantly brings to the screen as a rocky and angelic part of this complex woman, Hagar - stone angel.
