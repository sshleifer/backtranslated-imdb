This is a brilliant political satire. No wonder why it has been ignored in the United States: it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is <br /> <br /> Another good film with the age, color reproduction was also completely removed from the field simply because he showed exactly. What is the US war machine bent torturing, killing and maiming of civilians in its quest for total world domination. <br /> <br /> clever plot, good acting, some big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei, anyone?) and some scenes were fun to make this film a hit. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially if they are involved in the massacres.
