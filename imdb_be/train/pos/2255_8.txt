Not a bad movie martial arts. The fight scenes were good. Michelle Kiss did a good job directing his first film without Van Damme. History worked without profanity and too much blood. Scenario Janet Francessca has a good line in the history of that works. It would be nice to see something more of it in the same genre. She loves art and having strong women promenant. It was definitely worth watching. I recommend this film to all fans of drama and martial arts.
