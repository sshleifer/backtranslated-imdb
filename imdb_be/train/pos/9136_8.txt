It's not as bad as some movie reviewers, and resume on IMDB page for the film, say it. Why? First is the fact that the filmmakers were daring enough to confront in 1984, as one of the elements of the story, the problem of domestic violence - as the reviewers who complain about the sad story is not one of the highlights! Secondly, no element of the plot of the film the relationship of Prince with his tough father, the musical culmination will not work as well as it does - so that those commentators who say that only good music is, once again, missed one of the points - in specifically, why is it so good ... because all the music in this film is an element of background story, which makes the music more efficient. Third, give this film a break! For the first time, film producers and the director, it simply is not so bad! There are far worse movies out there by people who know the movie !! Finally, the reviewers who say that music is "good" also missed the point - to test the range of stylistic musical treatments, variety, musicality and stage Prince - truly one of a kind, descended musically, where no one had ever intended for 1980s, and the style seen in the work of other artists (clothes and motion: who came first costume elements, Michael Jackson or Prince also, if you can find splayed fingers sweeping before your eyes, that the prince does in this film, long before "to ryminalnae Fiction "Tarantino). Since the sum of its parts, not a bad movie at all.
