I watched this show when I was a little girl. When I think about it, I only vaguely remember. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I remember vaguely, are the opening sequence and song. In addition to this, everything was perfect cast. In addition, a letter was very strong. Performances were top grade, too. I hope that some network brings it back so I could see every episode. Before we wrap this up, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, although I do not think I've seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if any network ever brings it back, I hope you catch him the whole day before it leaves the air forever.
