This is an excellent 1983 BBC television production (not a movie, while others wrote here) classic love story "Jane Eyre," starring Timothy Dalton like Rochester and ZIL Clark, Jane, is the best version of which has been made to date, as it is the most faithful to the novel by Charlotte Bronte in both concept and dialogue. <br /> <br /> A classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons; if the filmmakers begin to interfere in the life to a classic that classic collapse. Fortunately, manufacturers of "Jane Eyre" approached the story with respect and fidelity to the original, which leads to incredibly exciting fighters, which is worth several times to enjoy its multi-layered sweets and joy and suspense. Performances are wonderful, the music just right, even the Gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful, and set the right tone for the production. <br /> <br /> May only criticism, albeit small, that this version, as well as any other version ever made Jane Eyre, ignores Christian influences that build character Jane and influenced her moral choice. In today's world, a woman in Jane's situation will not think twice, but stay with Rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her. "Oh, just get a divorce," she would say to the man, and she will live in sin with him. But Jane Eyre knew that she could not agree to this course of life and respect themselves. Why? This decision was based on the foundation of the Christian faith she was taught from childhood, not from ill-Calvinist Lowood institution, but with the Christian example of a true friend, Helen Burns, who was tortured and not turn the other cheek. Someday I'd like to see some versions of these effects draw a little more fully in the adaptation. The classic novel that ends with the heroine of the letter "Come, Lord Jesus!" Do not have to have a foundation belief of separation from it.
