It raises about a year after the events in "Basic Instinct." Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is currently in London. Although sex with football player, speeding on a car going 110 miles / hour (do not ask), it goes off the road and ends up in the Thames. It survives - it does not. Police psychiatrist Michael Glass rental (David Morrissey), to see if she is mentally competent court. Naturally, she begins to play with his mind, and not a lot of murders and sex later. <br /> <br /> This film was doomed even before it opened. He took forever to get the cast and director, script problems were fixed and the cast was not happy (Maurice complained movies often). However, this is not so bad. It is very much like the first one - have a great score, a beautiful place, lots of sex and nudity (it should have been edited for R), beautifully meandering storyline and good acting - but there is no impact. It feels like to restore the first tread. People kill here Choker chain (I think) ... as well as people have been killed in the first stage of an ice pick. In one sweet moment Stone raises an ice ax and looks at him sadly. It also plays mind games with people and can get him involved in the killings. The resemblance is too obvious <br /> <br /> This is a very R rated. - there are a lot of obvious sexual talk, male nudity (Maurice looks much better than a naked Michael Douglas), female nudity (stone still looks great) and some bloody murder. It works well on all fronts. Stone is fantastic here; Morrissey looks unhappy, but that's all right; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good in a supporting role <br /> <br /> Yes. - it is not bad, but it feels like a remake of the first. Nevertheless, I recommend it. People just attacked it, because the stone does not like, and they thought that it was stupid to do a sequel «Basic ...» 14 years after it was made.
