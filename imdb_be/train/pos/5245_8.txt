I thought that this movie was LOL funny. It's fun, is not to be taken seriously, twisted film about a single man on life, love, and ... well, the lady "from the lowly bus Skank, to a high-class debutante ... Bus SKANK.Â» Tim Meadows plays a guy ( leon Phelps), who was raised in a family house Playboy style with the help of Hugh Hefner-Esquire parents, constantly surrounded by beautiful models and porn actresses. If his "father" kicks him in the street, he must learn to take care of themselves anything but chauvinistic outlook on life, his youth taught him ... and that incomprehensible, almost mystical level of charm and dumb luck. And so begins Hijinx! If you have not seen this film, and you will enjoy a light-hearted, half-senseless, comedy / love story, then I urge rent "womanizer."
