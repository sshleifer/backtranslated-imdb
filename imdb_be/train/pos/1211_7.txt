I grew up on this film, and I remember when my brother and I were playing in the yard and pretend that we were at Care-a-lot. Now, after so many years, I get to see the movie with my daughter and watch her like that. If you are a parent and you have not watched this film with children, then you should simply because you hold them in your hands and watch them get excited for a bear-care and care a lot! Songs, especially «Forever Young» is very sweet and memorable. Parents, I highly recommend this movie for all children so that they can learn how nice caring for others can be! When it comes to all the garbage that is on TV, you can bring up their children to have the right mindset about life with movies like these.
