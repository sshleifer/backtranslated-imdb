First of all, I have seen this film, without knowing anything about it, I just knew that Joel Schumacher did it, and that was enough for me. A friend and I went to see him on the Danish film festival called Festival Night movie that a lot of different films shown after a few hours of the festival is largely focuses on the screening of films that would not otherwise be specified in Danish cinemas. <, Br /> <br /> In any case, my friend and I went to see him, and we were amazed at how real it seemed, and he really hit a cord with our senses, we really got into the story without being able to find out the ending, which is a big plus in our book. <br /> <br /> film written in a style that reminds me of the Danish initiative "Dogma 95", which was started 4 Danish filmmakers, including Lars von Trier (Dancer in the Dark). <br /> <br /> At the end of the film is really worth seeing, it gives a different view of how it was for the American GI Joe comes out of school time, it is expected to serve their country in battle a long way from home. <br /> <br /> In addition, Colin Farrell is exceptional, I have not seen in this film it before, but I can not wait to see more of it. <br /> <br /> Lars P.
