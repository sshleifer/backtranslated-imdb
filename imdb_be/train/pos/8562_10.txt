I liked it! The plot was amazing, Drew Barrymore and DC making out was awkward for both of them. Drews action was quirky in places, but it can be traced back to his life at the time. Dennis Christopher as a psychoanalyst was pretty cool, and, as always, he is doing everything possible. - I'm the main fan Dennis anyway, that's why I bought the DVD <br /> <br /> I did not get the ending! that strange thing animatronic red skeleton looked the same as it was with filmschool, that KI I guess, but it might be more. <br /> <br /> .... and all this with a knife-, when it was that uncomfortable, why do not they just get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It was very confusing to when it was a strange look-alike, or if it was DC and it was Dennis all the time? Since Twin did with Dennis and Patrick. In scenes with Patrick when he was Dennis as the Doppelganger I think Patrick did not notice. <br /> <br /> The music was okay, but the haunting in places, the entire orchestral score seemed to revolve around the theme, but this topic has been exaggerated. <br /> <br /> a great combination of a large amount of blood and gratuitus Drew nude shots. <br /> <br /> In general, like GPM-Guilty Pleasure Movie. Do not read too much into it, is not looking for secret messages and a fantastic script, because you will not find it. There are some points of diamonds and inconsistencies galore- watch it and just have some fun with him!
