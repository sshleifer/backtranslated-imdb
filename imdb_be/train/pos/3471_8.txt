Recently featured on cable TV movie begins with the refusal of distancing itself from any cooperation in the real life of the people; which in itself is an eye catcher. However, the script and the acting of the main characters is a great, and I found myself absorbed throughout.Due in no small part to a clear, thoughtful and interesting dialogue.The film about a meeting on the same day between the two real-life musical "legend" who had a part together, seperated.The film captures the essence of life and philosophy of history, which continues to explain the original "split". What is so impressive that the actors give such seemingly realistic images of the characters they play, faults and all, that the viewer at least, were to believe I was a witness to the true events in almost every detail. Great skill of this game is that with insightful writing and great acting the movie is mostly about "the two of us," the speaker can make a great picture. Worthy of at least 8 out of 10.
