Well, I do not think that Trailer Park Boys has a bad story lines, because they kick ass. They just ... conflict with each other <br /> <br /> An example :. Toward the end of the movie, it shows Ricky and Julian say "Patrick Lewis" put the dog down and walk away. Then in the end, it shows Ricky and Julian say they have been in prison for 2 years. In the series pilot series, the first clip they show the same clip of Ricky and Julian yelling at "Patrick Lewis." But in the series, they allegedly only in jail for 18 months. <br /> <br /> In addition, they give us the impression that the film's plot and storyline of the television series connected (due to the cry of the scene between the boys). But some actors portray a completely different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays "Patrick Lewis" in the film, but in this series, he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of those who pay for the destruction of Ricky, and then he plays Sam Losco in the series. <br /> <br /> In addition (again ... I know I have a lot to say), in the film guys to sniff coke instead of hash smoking. The fact that they never actually confirmed that the two storylines are connected in any way, except to shout scene. <br /> <br /> Sorry to keep on shaking.
