As for the Muppet line is, however, is not the best, nor the other is better. It was sold in the direction of the kiddies, but there are some dark, and emotionally upset adult moments, to which parents may not want to expose their children. One of which shows Miss Piggy going to "mail" in a burst zeal which lasts substantially for the duration of that work. <br /> <br /> In addition, however, the story is a progressive, and very interesting. One scene in which Joan Rivers and Miss Piggy to go crazy in a department store is just plain fun! There are other parts of this work, which contain the same level of fun and frivolity. <br /> <br /> I like it very much, and enjoy it still. <br /> <br /> He's rate of 7.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> enemy's :.
