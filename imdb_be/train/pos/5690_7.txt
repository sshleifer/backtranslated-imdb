Just I watched this movie on DVD and thought that the effect was very good, but in all history has left much to be desired. This film has the same texture and appearance of The Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. Hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle; on the underbelly of society, in which the total of their existence on the basis of hardcore drug use, crime, violence, sex, and a complete lack of self-esteem for all or anything, including myself. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore is outstanding in his role as "burned" the former porn star John Holmes. the supporting cast as well. However, it is dark, dark, disturbing and depressing film. The murder was brutal, but the daily life of these people were hard as well. If you are not interested in these murders were or "fan" John Holmes, this is actually not a film to see. If you want to see a documentary drama on the killing, the 1960 Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, starring Scott Wilson and Robert Blake is much better.
