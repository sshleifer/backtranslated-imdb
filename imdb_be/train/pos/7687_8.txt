Jefferson, Good Times was one of those classic American comedies that never aired in the UK, not to mention it in the 1970s- came after decade, from where I was not born yet. <br /> <br /> But, like most fans of the show, I watched a few episodes on you tube, and then, I loved it. <br /> <br /> in a family headed by James Evans and Florida- two parents trying to make ends meet, and who, in spite of the lack of qualifications, to encourage their children, who have their own aspirations in life to fulfill them and take their chances. James was a strict but loving father, who did not dare hesitate to discipline J.J, Michael and Thelma- should they cross the line. While Florida, in contrast was fair, kind- hearted and caring mother and loving wife, who was a lot like James, with regard to their relationship to parenting and family values ​​with the African-American perspective. <br /> <br /> children were just as lively and interesting as the parents: JJ was a novice artist with a blunt face and a crazy sense of humor, which often wear colorful costumes, and whose «DY-NO tick "catchphrase as infectious and acquaintances, as Arnold Jackson« Whatchoo talking '' bout Willis? A variety of moves. Michael was smart, herring, who dreams of becoming a lawyer, while sister Thelma had their dreams and hopes. Her verbal arrows with JJ were mostly fun as love / hate relationship between a brother and sister, who played very well as Mike Evans and Stanislav Bernadette. <br /> <br /> During the season, there were several performances cameos are made primarily with Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and the young Harry Coleman as himself! I prefer the good times over say, The Cosby Show, which was 80 years show, because a) I prefer over the Huxtables Evans family, both in terms of) the characteristics and b), as I felt that it to solve serious and complex social problems in a way that resonates with many viewers. It was a comedy, but it was also a social commentary that is intended to emphasize the working class lives of African-Americans in 1970s America. Cosby Show tried to satisfy a wide audience in the "candy coated" method as Huxtables portrayed as Blacks, who readily assimilated themselves in the top class American culture we associate Whites with, while a good time, in contrast was much more "acute", and he did not hesitate to address topics such as drug abuse and the child's realistic. I actually found that while the Cosby Show might be interesting to look at the time, it was not that a little «sassiness», which has a good time and making it fashionable and not so hot. <br /> <br /> The show was to jump a shark during the last season, as he went after John Amos' character, James died in an accident (in fact, it was known at the time when John quit smoking good times for all. so the death of his character was written as a show). Without John, the show suffered and, unfortunately, has lost much of its charm. <br /> <br /> However, for the sitcom, Good Times ticks all the boxes right. If they have shown that it is in the UK for 80 years. As it is, of course, is how JJ would say, 'DY-NO tick !! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 and a half
