I thought that the Ice Age was a great movie! As a woman of 30 years, without children, I still seem to really enjoy these humorous, witty cartoon. Sid the best character I've seen in a while, it is better than Bartok Anastasia (although he did have a sense of humor, and I do not think that his character can be compared, or even beat), and even more ridiculous than Melman Madagascar. I saw the movie at least 15 times (I have obviously), and I quote from the movie at work (in many cases ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the part where Sid says: "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game" and Sid and Manny continue to find that the protein is trying to tell them about the "Tiger" ... "a pack of wolves, a pack of bears, flocks! fleas, mustache package noses package, the package DERM?, lies, trouble package, the package to beat, bird package, the package flying fish ... "or, however, that part of it is the funniest part about the whole film, although I did get enjoy the humor back, "sloth put on the map" and many other parts as well. Only the animated film, which can be remotely compared to the Ice Age is to "Brother Bear."
