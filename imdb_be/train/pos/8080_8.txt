Well, I'm getting used to after a while to read the comments about these films, which do not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh was the best villain than some of his most famous films. He was stubborn villain, no-apologies villain. For me, it was a breath of fresh air to see him in the role, where his wickedness entirely like crop in some way. <br /> <br /> A child who played Aryan, probably over the head with this cast. There, I think, maybe, the director could have done better. But, frankly, a very big part of this movie was Shernas Patel. She is the unsung heroine, a veteran thespians who overqualified for each of the roles she is offered. But I have to say that I appreciated her contribution to a large extent, it played the wife of Virendra Sahov in. It may be given little to do, but it does with complete conviction. I'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most viewers. <br /> <br /> So if you are in the habit to settle on Bollywood average, you will not get much from this movie. But if you are constantly looking for something more, it can give you some of what you've been missing.
