This movie is a lot of fun. What makes it great especially two things: one is the easiest way to cover the characters stereotypes, with a discussion of their costumes and superpowers. There conquer the seriousness of parody, which is very attractive; second basic sweetness of character and quality of chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves special attention as the object of desire Mr. Furious years. There's a boat full of talent. I understand that some high expectations may have been disappointed, but this film is really fun and kind of sweet.
