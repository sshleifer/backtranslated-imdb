Green eyes is a great movie. In today's context, support our troops, interestingly, the film showed a lack of respect from the soldiers were performing their duties during that period. From a historical point of view, the end of the Vietnam War has left us all with something to remember and learn. Gene was very proud of this film, and he deserves credit he received from writing "Green eyes". I agree, I do not understand why this film is not shown more often or at all. This film is a kind of film that should be shown on television every year, just like the Wizard of Oz. The dedication of one man to his lost son is moving completely. I had another Gene Logans, and I was proud to know him. rocky
