I'm looking forward to see it since I first saw it in the list in its work. Finally I found it yesterday 2/13/02 on the Lifetime Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson comments about the fact that it is "a sweet anecdote 2 cross the road" were dead on. Writers probably should not get a bonus, all other SROs to create a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates the romantic movie is to see him. <br /> <br /> The presence of the screen Natasha so warm and her smile was so electric, not to mention her beauty, that all that is in it is a list of my favorite. Its TV and print interviews, I've seen just how refreshing and well worth looking for. <br /> <br /> God bless her, her family and future efforts. <br /> <br /> This film does not seem to be available in DVD or video, but I would be the first to buy it, and I think others would, too.
