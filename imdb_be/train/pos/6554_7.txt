OK Here is what I say: <br /> <br /> The film was excellent. I'm a big fan of Nancy and I read all the original books 1-56, and I continued to read further. I am now 96. Beware of scoundrels, giving the film a lower grade than it should have. All the evidence points to a great movie! I loved it all. So, Nancy is currently. It is still an old-fashioned as it is in the books! People who have not read more than 5 books complain of Nancy opinion. I read all of them, and I think that Emma is perfect and that Nancy was full. I found the film a ghost. I loved the spectacular car chase and get business cards. I loved the evidence. I decided Mystery of himself! It was really cool. I suggest you go see, because people who complain do not know anything about what a good movie is and B of Nancy Drew. Go it. This may not be Oscar worthy, but its a really good movie.
