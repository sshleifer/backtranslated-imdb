I made this film a blockbuster on a whim .. I like Alan Arkin and cover caught ... I read back and immediately knew that it would be either the best or the worst film I've ever seen ... I think I was lucky. . I laughed from start to finish .. Alan Arkin brings great character of this film. Since then, I bought a used copy of the rent for my collection and see it all the time .. I recommend this film to put loads of people and they all enjoyed it as much as I did ... I see complaints and DVD menu functions .. but it does not detract from the film .. the drive was a writer for Blockbuster exculsivley and that is why they do not allow to skip past the previews .. other than that you should not let the DVD features in deterr you from watching a great movie.
