That's kind of a love story that I really like to watch. And basically, that's for two reasons. First, it concentrates the young people, very young people. People who are still in their teens, and feel love for the first time, or at least think they are. We were all there in our lives, and "Man on the Moon" is a superb reflection on our memory, perhaps adding a few more details and making it more than any of us have experienced. The second reason is that the love triangle. And I believe that in the teenage years, it is the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you think that the characters can actually be in love, or just new to love, they just strongly believe that they, and the tragedy is so, believe it for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> cast of "Man on the Moon 'is full of great talented names. It stars Sam Waterston, who truly versatile actor, is well capable of playing tough district attorney, as well as strict but caring and wise father, in this movie. Also there is Tess Harper, Jason London, and a young, young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young, talented actress, she was fourteen years old, and you think about ten years down the road, she was going to win an Academy Award. All members of the cast pull off great performances and an exciting dialogue with the script, they are amplified in watching real people in real situations. As if it all really happened. This is the kind of movie that I'd like to see come out more often. Love story or not. I like to see movies that make everything look real and not a fake or disbelievable any way.
