Picture Bride has a beautiful appearance in the past Hawaii and the people who lived there at the time. Time, money earned and hours that these people put their lives in order to survive and live, takes an entirely new meaning to the blood, sweat and tears. <br /> <br /> The concept of dating / matchmaking is something like what we are doing today is similar across the network. Only that it is more regular mail. Very slowly snail mail. <br /> <br /> Singing songs on the plantations of labor reminds me of a southern plantation work songs of their death, and future goals. <br /> <br /> The film shows the hardship, as well as soft romantic scenes that Hawaii can bring. As the real estate storm coming and the sudden chaos of rain, then calm.
