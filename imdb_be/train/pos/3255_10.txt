Each scene was collected perfectly.This film was a great cast and crew. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in this, none of them, and will never exist. It has the ability to improve any movie with its amazing talent.This movie was great! I saw this movie, sitting alone on the shelf in the film "Blockbuster" and he called me, I could not resist picking it up and bring it home with me. You can call me a juicy romantic, but this film just touched my heart, let alone made me laugh with pleasure at the same time. Despite the fact that made me cry, I admit, in the end, the whole film just brightened my outlook on life thereafter.I proposed to my horror, action and pure humor movie buff brother, who absolutely loved this film. This is a film with a good sense feeling.It can make you laugh out loud, touch your heart, make you fall in love, and enjoy the time you life.Every deliberately walk past the movie, just be aware that you are consciously making a choice to live and feel it inspires movie.Who knows? What if it really can happen to you? And keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life.
