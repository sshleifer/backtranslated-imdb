It can be 10, if it was not for an entirely predictable and Hollywood-ish script. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time (why not master it may be asked), and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level. Personally, I was struck by Hugh O'Connor, who played Christy Brown in childhood. The very first scene I watched him was very strong. Wow.
