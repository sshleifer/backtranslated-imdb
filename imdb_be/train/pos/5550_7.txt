highlights this function 1917. Honor Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes a clan chieftain after his father's death. On an island off the coast of Scotland, people live a simple life "fishermen." My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film has some beautiful ocean views, and the camera work on the boats is gorgeous. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford this pleasant film. Pickford already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her: a brave young woman has been successful over the misfortune. Pickford whip to lash the lazy villagers to the church is very funny. And the final scene on a sinking ship is very well done. Picford not a big movie, but it's still worth a look. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is a love interest, and it is good as a strapping boy of the island. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers, but I could not identify it either. My copy intersperses many bells and gongs and adds a horrible feeling when the village warning bell rings. Very effective.
