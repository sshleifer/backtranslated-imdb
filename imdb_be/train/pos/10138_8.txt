Well it's about time. I really gave up all hope and all that there was to be an outstanding episode of the entries in this season. While until now has been too much to uniform hohum record, at least, the episode turned out to be good. Its pretty funny that director Rob Schmidt, who only has no bad Wrong Turn to his credit and writer John whose Esposito only scripting care today includes Tale Of The Mummy and night shifts, should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season. The "Right to Die" we are treated to the history of the Cliff and the abbey. At the beginning of the episode talking pairs. Cliff Abbey caught cheating, and he is desperate to get her back. While they say that they get into a car accident where Cliff is left only scratches and bruises, but Abbey are thrown out of the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline, which dripped on her catches her on fire. And this is only the installation of people. Once in the hospital, Cliff should decide the abbey live in this state, without the skin, and only nerve reflexes. There's also a side effect too. Every time she flatlines, Abbey is walking like a ghost, and caused problems for all kinds of people. Hands down this is the best episode of the season and, of course, considered one of the best episodes ever. From the terrible effects of the tight script that threw a few turns I never saw coming and unknown so sensitive you can almost touch it, Right To Die should have the right to live forever.
