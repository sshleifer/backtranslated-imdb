Firstly, I'll be the first to admit that he stuffed quite a bit over-the-top. Toned down, may be less acrobatic would scarecrow made this film a lot less cheese. But overall I think this is one of the best B-movies. Tiffany Shepis absolutely wonderful, not to mention the incredibly beautiful. Although the film is not all naked important factor, there are a few other films in which to view it. But then she gets all the evil-Jar, especially towards the end, as it is engulfed by a scarecrow. In addition, Richard Elfman does a great job as sheriff and as a drunken friend. Yes, it's a low budget B-movie. But of all of them I've seen, this is definitely one of my top favorites.
