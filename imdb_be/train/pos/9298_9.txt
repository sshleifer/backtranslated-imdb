Just one of funiest movies I have ever seen. This is a parody of a life of crime, parodying everything that is Chicago Sun 1930.- There is not really underestimate this film, because the rating is under 5. St. opinion of the masses and the masses hypnotized. Who decides to watch - he will regret, who choose not to watch - not spare more.
