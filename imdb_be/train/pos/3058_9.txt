I bought this a year or more ago for $ 2 (yes, $ 2), left on the shelf for ages, now watch DVD, while holed up with a cold. <br /> <br /> This is a memorable film. Brilliant performance of all participants, especially 6yo boy (about only smile you get in this film). <br /> <br /> The story reminds me, perhaps my favorite movie ever, Grosse Pointe Blank, but it is obvious that it is carefree, it is a heavy heart. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, a clinical and forensic psychologist, a shiver went down my spine when it was revealed the identity of the new contract. Scary stuff! Brilliant work round. <br /> <br /> Pete
