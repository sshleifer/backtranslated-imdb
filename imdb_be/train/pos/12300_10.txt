This version of Anna Christie in German. Greta Garbo plays Anna Christie again, but all the other characters are different actors from the English version. Both were filmed back to back, because Garbo was such a following in Germany. Garbo himself ostensibly in favor of her Anna Christie in this version over the English version. It's a good tale, and a must-see for fans of Garbo.
