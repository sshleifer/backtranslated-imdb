Wow! Wow! Wow! I've never seen, not enlightening documentary about globalization, until I saw the Carnival: MADE IN CHINA. This film has a zero story and combines VÉRITÉ frames with tangible interviews with four young people working in China who live inside the factory compound. They play with toys, rope, and dancing. Nevertheless, the majority of their days and nights consist of work, work and work - but the footage of their work lighting and fascinating to watch. factory owner in China, a surprising discovery, because it will hit home a consequence of globalization, when he "punishes" the worker. Astutely next Mardi Gras beads from China to the carnival, the film shows how a local connection to the global through humor and interesting, compelling images of male and cultures. One of the most interesting parts of the film is cross-cultural introduction of factory workers and Mardi Gras revelers to each other through photography. Here, the film is a full circle and shows how the image may be a point of connection and transformation. The film is never preachy, Sun guilt drive, and allows the point of view of each present. After all, we - the audience - to make our own conclusions about the complexity and globalization of the film.
