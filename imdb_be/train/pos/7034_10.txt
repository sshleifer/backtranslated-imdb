if you add up all the aspects of the film --- dancing, singing, acting --- the only one that stands out as the best in the cast Vanessa Williams ... her dedication, energy and eternal beauty Rosie make a perfect role for her. Never have I never seen someone portraying Rose with so cheerful! singing talent Vanessa perfectly shows all the songs she performs like Rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me! Her dance is so incredible, even if some people say that the choreography was bad --- her dancing skills have been shown better than ever before! I would recommend this version over the '63 only because I believe that, although the long-acting Vanessa ----- great not to mention the fact that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast is very impressive as well (with the exception of Chynna philips ... what in the hell were they thinking when they threw it?) <br /> <br /> in general, I would say that this version is excellent, and I recommend everyone to see this version!
