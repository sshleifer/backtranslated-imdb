Many of the problems many people have in this film is that they seem to think that the story had to be more interesting (without it's based on a true story) or talking against the film, glorifying Che (it's actually It does not do). This film is very close to the final bio ~ d John Anderson Che and gets the right plot. Soderburgh does an excellent job of setting the mood of unraveling the defeat, which was Che Bolivian adventure. You really get the impression of general timidity and embarrassment in Bolvian peasant revolutionary ideas of Che, or the difficulties of its people face hunger and terrain. Sorry to bore focus contested movie fans out there, but that was how it happened. So do not be in this film expecting Rambo shoot Em Up, his real story!
