Forbidden Planet is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF movies. Its influence was felt for more than a decade. Nevertheless, some elements related to the fact, as it is wide screen entertainment was aimed at the mid-fifties the audience, which is now gone timed it quite a bit, and sometimes led walks film will not help. However, forcing the central idea of ​​the story involving ancient, extinct Krell civilization and "monsters from the Id" has not lost its appeal and continues to do this film corresponds to the "must see" movie. What I am mainly interested in saying is that, the current DVD of this movie is awesome. The film never looked that good on home video, and the elements are in dire need of restoration. I hope that will happen soon, and we will get a special edition of the SF classic.
