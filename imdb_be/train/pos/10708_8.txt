John (Ben Chaplin), a single bank employee who lives in a small town near London. While online, it comes into contact with the Belarusian brides agency. He chooses Sofia (Nicole Kidman ?? guy can be a lonely and shy, but definitely has good taste, is not it?), And when they met each other, he realizes that she does not speak in English. Communication between mostly with each other is limited by the floor (again, imagine what a terrible situation for the guy, just some kinky sex with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday, two Russian friends to visit them. Then many surprises will be. I liked this film: first, it is almost impossible to "designated". It's a black comedy, action, thriller movie? I believe that all choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is gorgeous, as usual, and I'm very curious about her Russian: it is she says in Russian in the right emphasis on the fact, or just pretending? Anyway, I found this enjoyable film. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "And Isca Perfeita" ( "The Perfect Accommodation")
