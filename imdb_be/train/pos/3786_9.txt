Ying, a Chinese girl who speaks Czech, invited us to a screening of Czech films (with English subtitles) in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). It was the first time I saw Samotáři (single, 2000), and it was very good <br /> <br /> Just as in many other Czech films, seven central characters seem to have a rather difficult, dirty life. Web shows that this topic has been popular among US movies in the early 1990s. Their relationship is breaking up, which combines and recombine. Another characteristic feature of the Czech films is that none of the characters designed to be universally negative and none of them is constantly a positive character. Also, you can see how the characters try other features, depending on the context; this is a very realistic feature of the psychological analysis of the film. <br /> <br /> Ondrej talented and married a young surgeon who has two daughters. However, you will learn that he only studied neuroscience to prove how much he loves another woman, Hanka. He was so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses like a plumber to get into the house Hanka parents -. The house, which he has repeatedly burned <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hank has a very mixed relationship with their parents. She just decides - by tossing a coin - to break up with Peter, who works in a private radio station. Hanka does not consider the bourgeois life of his parents, as a good example, but it seems quite unsuccessful in creating more favorable conditions. But it is very lithe figure as the type of her boyfriend to go. <br /> <br /> For a while Hank seems to have serious plans to Jakub, innocent addict, memory seems to be quite devastated drugs. Nevertheless, the members of his group report Yaqub that he already has another girlfriend. Hanka disappointed and returned to their parents. <br /> <br /> If Hank and Peter break up, it is organized by Robert, the matchmaker, who also works in a travel agency, where his job is to show the life of ordinary people in the Czech Japanese tourists. Robert - who is also Jakub marijuana - never serious about anything, and he usually sleeps with many women; in the end, his mother dies in the hospital, and he has his own ways of dealing with depression <br /> <br /> Vesna (Slavic word "spring"), who came to Prague from Macedonia works as a barmaid. - and you do not know, she came to the Czech Republic to see his father, or UFOs. It seems pretty embarrassed, but sometimes it helps the other characters have problems <br /> <br /> Peter works in the radio station, and he was the only one who loves his job. - work that he eventually lost. He announces his audience that they parted with Hanka -., Who, as Ondrej learns of news that make him very happy <br /> <br /> In the end, the wife of Ondrej in Helen is always ready to forgive and stabilize their marriage - even after Ondřej asks a magician to make it disappear, so that the Ondřej Hanka can try to capture again. (Magician pay his debt, because he is the brother of the victim important traffic accident - Hank James, and to offer sacrifice to the hospital and Ondřej saves his life.) Lena also works in a travel agency - as a translator - and in the end it must translate some hysterical scenes in the 20 or so Japanese tourists who shoot their films during lunch Hank's parents. <br /> <br /> seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would have been natural if Prague were less than four orders of magnitude. Given the actual size of the Czech capital, it looks a bit unlikely that these events will take place among the seven people, but it is fun.
