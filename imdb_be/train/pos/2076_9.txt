Good Earth is a great movie !!! Everyone must see ... It's tear jerking and very heart warming. It caters to increase the value of education in the persistence, humility and love of family history ... may be related to our life today, especially that poverty is on the doorstep. Way of how we respond to these challenges is very important, and if the person is not strong enough to face such that he could remain helpless and useless. I am very happy about how the characters are justified their roles, even the young actors ... Their emotions captivated audience. The film could have been done in black and white, but the story is so fascinating that you do not want to finish. This makes it really cool! There should be a remake of a very good movie.
