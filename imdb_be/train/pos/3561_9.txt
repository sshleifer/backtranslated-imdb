At least something good came out of a misguided attempt Damon Runyon to sentimental mafia. "Guys and Dolls", seemingly indestructible stage musical, had been captured on film in 1955, Mankiewicz ( "All About Eve"), in the picturesque enjoyable film, which featured an all-star cast, including Vivian Blaine (from the original Broadway show), Jean Simmons (whose character bears an uncanny resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in "Roman holiday") and two-time great leading men, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both of which recently won an Oscar for best Supporting Actor ( «from Here to Eternity» ) and best Actor ( "on the waterfront") and were at the top of St. aoy game. One listen to the singing of Brando's "The success of today to be a lady" speaks volumes about where in the early Dylan got his voice. Stubby Kaye overshadows how nice Nicely Johnson, who brings down the house with "Get you to rock the boat." The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds another page to the gallery of your screen villain gangsters. The film has a bright, cartoonish look, anticipating the pop art in the early 1960s ies. The characters speak in a stylized speech, apparently based on a Yiddish idiom. Although social relationships and gender roles of the film dated, it's all a lot of fun, and even gentle jokes salvation Army is harmless and does not reflect any real hostility to orga Awana religion. Just to see Sinatra and Brando in the film is a good enough reason to see this film, but he has plenty of other attractions to offer during his 149 minutes.
