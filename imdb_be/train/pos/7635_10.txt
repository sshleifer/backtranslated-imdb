I've seen this movie many times, and I must tell you, I enjoyed it every time. Belushi is the pinnacle of the film in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitts so pleasant and are identified with the common man, which you can not help but to take part, as soon as you start watching. The film has a beautiful cast of stars, some of which were large, while others have just started. This is the price as the feeling of a good movie, and that's exactly what it is. This film teaches us that life is not always so bad. Sometimes you just have to look at things from a different perspective, to fully appreciate what you already have. When you're done playing, you'll appreciate the things that you have a lot more and you will also smile. You can not ask for much more from the film, in my opinion, not to mention his hilarious film, and you will never lose interest. Very very underrated film people here <br /> <br /> Evaluation of me. 10 I'm out !!!
