The Big Bad Swim has a low budget indie feeling about it. So many times I start watching independent films, which had very good reviews only to find out that they are pretentious bastard, voted in favor of people who are so blinded by the idea of ​​the film and its potential to be provocative, that they forget that the film is a form of entertainment in the first place. <br /> <br /> I do not know when the big bad swim has any message or a higher meaning or metaphor, if that happens, then I missed it. <br /> <br /> from the get go BBS felt good, it was easy and warm, and the man did not have any serious dramas or content ideas, I just connected with the characters at once. And if, like all good movies end came around, I felt sadness over the loss of this connection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something big or fast or insightful look elsewhere, look for a film that tries to deliver more than is possible. BBS provides a solid, pleasant, a real experience, and I felt rewarded and hungry, watching it.
