I am disappointed by the lack of posts on this amazing and effective little film. Mol, is probably best known for his role as Diego in «Blow» Ted Demme writes, directs and stars. <br /> <br /> I will not give away any plot points, like in the movies (at least for me) it was very interesting without having known anything about it .. If you have a Netflix account, or have access to the video store, who will wear it ... I highly recommend it. It's a crazy, fun, and sometimes very thoughtful creation. <br /> <br /> Direction Moll is * pretty * is impressive and shows a lot of promise. <br /> <br /> unpredictable, with the amazing imagery and a great lead performance speaks beautiful Spanish "No Somos Nadie» (God is in the air), a strange film, you can show your friend. <br /> <br /> see.
