Childbirth: Ralph Nader, Gloria Stein, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain <br /> <br /> Doug :. Once we were very disappointed with the original "Tarzan the ape man", we found among other users and historians that the second film "Tarzan and his Mate," was the best in the series. It's true. I really enjoyed this movie. Weissmuller returns as the titular rock grape, wild animal duels super-hero, and Maureen O'Sullivan reprises her role as his absolutely fantastic lady love Jane (who sports a two-piece outfit for the first and last time here). In his review for «Ape Man» I trod Jane is very good for its obsession with clothes and her continuous cry, but she redeemed herself for me here. Make no mistake: O'Sullivan star of this film, and Jane the most capable character in the entire cast. It acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, it can function perfectly well in the jungle and get along with the animals, and she knows how to keep the honor of angry lions, she of the bullets. She even got her own jungle screaming now. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She completely got his training. Cheeta is quite charming, as well as taking drags on cigarettes Martin. The plot is basically an excuse for Tarzan to fight the most vicious animal of the jungle, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinos. Effects, although it is always visible, much more dynamic and cool and complement the action is good. Oh, and you can not talk about this film without talking about nude swimming scene. All I can say, yes, she is naked. Very interesting things <br /> <br /> Kevin :. Wow. Just wow. When it comes to down and dirty in front of the code of action / adventure, nothing holds a candle "Tarzan and His Mate. The inevitable sequel Tarzan of the Apes is a kick-ass man, violence and risky jungle epic. I doubt there will be another movie Tarzan in the future that takes no prisoners, as it makes one. you would be hard to find a complete scene in the film, which will be code approved or animal rights, approved on this matter. the terrible violence did not even wait for the happy jungle couples to show before she pushes even the border today shnih adventure films. And after the T & J enter into the picture, there are a lot of early morning cuddling and ass naked afternoon swims. See for yourself if you do not believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan most in this film. The the first film, Jane seemed to be walking contradiction, like the authors simply did not know how to reflect a character like this. But here it is a great precursor of kick-butt females later movies. Despite the fact that it is po- still needs to be Tarzan's help in getting her out of most jams She does a lot more than just wait for rescue. Her face is very plausible for a woman who lived (relatively) comfortable in the jungle for years. I watched it with my mum and I enjoyed pointing to her as Jane Tarzan "training" as Jeff Foxworthy put. She totally has a monkey man in her every beck and call. Although there are many dating from optical effects throughout the film, there are many heartbreaking Tarzan battles against predators, which are carried out (mostly) for real. This is a man dressed as a monkey-a much more convincing this time. ** Spoiler ** The film ends as the jungle erupts with shocking animal kingdom orgy of violence that leaves Tarzan and Jane are only two people still breathing. Although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and victorious, I can not help but imagine how this story will appear next safari, which will be heard on the previous heaps of people who went to find Tarzan and Jane, and never heard from again, ** END SPOILER ** One of the things that still bother me, smooth, naked BOD Weissmuller and more stylized hood. In addition, it is pre-code adventure, absolutely not to be missed <br /> <br /> The last movie :. It Happened One Night (1934). Next movie: The Twentieth Century (one thousand nine hundred thirty-four).
