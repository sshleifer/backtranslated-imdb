The real story (held in Kansas City in 1959) about the murder (Perry and Dick, two former prisoners who broke into a remote house on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met). Richard Brooks directed frightening and upsetting book hood of the reasons which led the child to the crime (Are they innate killers?). crime scene very brutal and memorable because of the lack of feelings and the reasons for what we saw. Stunning black-and-white cinematography by Conrand Hall, a beautiful country - the way the score with Quincy Jones, weird performances in the two main roles with Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, and for the first time in the film is a sad commentary on the death penalty in the last minutes before his death, Jones, Hall and Brooks (as a director and as a writer for adapted Screenplay) is an award nominees Academy. Exciting, great director and a frightening one of the best films of the decade
