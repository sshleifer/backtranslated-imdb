This adaptation of the novel MR James' view of the mountain "was first shown on British television in 2005, observed on a small digital channel BBC 4. I saw that it was repeated again on BBC 4, and decided to give it a go, remembering the successful 1970 adaptation of the BBC's other stories of MR James including "Whistle and I'll come to you, my friend" and "communicator". Although not in the same class as these masterpieces, "The view from the mountains," however pleasant and sometimes disturbing drama. <br /> <br /> A historian comes in a small village to look at the collection of the recently deceased collector of antiques. While in rural areas, he sees the abbey, which was destroyed during the hundreds of years. But what does this have in connection with an old pair of binoculars and eerie legend about the ominous name of Gallows Hill? And that makes a dramatic country squire and his servant is aware of the situation? While not terrible in any case, I enjoyed it a little production, and it was while working there were more than 40 minutes, it could be a really great adaptation. As it is, it all feels a bit rushed and a little more exposure to set the mood would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> I put 7 out of 10.
