I saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages to be released here in Canada (so far only in a limited edition). It's worth the wait, and then some. I am a very passionate reader of Margaret Laurence and was pleased to see that this novel was transformed into a film. I actually ended up like the movie better than the novel. I liked that the character of Bram Shipley was a little less sharp, and that seems to be a love story between Hagar and Bram, who made a scene at the end of the life of Bram that much more moving. The loss seemed stronger. Agar has been more sympathetic to the film than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role. It was through Hagar. Christine Horne was brilliant and has a lot of other great things to come I'm sure. Her scene with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I could go on and on, a total of 9 to 10. * Fantastic and can not wait to get out on DVD, should have for my collection!
