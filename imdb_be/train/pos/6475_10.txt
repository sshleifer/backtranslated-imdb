These are just two of the episode 5 of the drama, but I can say that this is one of the best things I've ever seen. It's on TV, the silver screen or even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it's so good that it is almost demoralizing! As a spectator it's so entertaining that I was angry scenes in two weeks, rather than from Monday to Friday. It is clear that all these negatives are actually positives. <br /> <br /> I am a modern man, who had previously rolled from television dramas. Compared with film, television drama always seemed dated, quite tame and tend to get bored! "Five days" really brought the TV drama in the 21st century, so for me at least, it is a change of mind. Go look.
