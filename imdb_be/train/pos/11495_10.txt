We have seen this in a movie theater art in local Montrose area in Houston, Texas. It was a complete surprise, as compared with the record up in the bulletin of the theater, but we were both blown away by the artistry. It was beautifully done, and (apparently) photographed in the Schloss (German name Chateau) somewhere in the center of Munich. It is very obvious study of sexual relations twentyish group of men and women isolated from the constraints of day-to-day. It is a fantasy on more levels than I remember. We came home from a movie and talked and talked until about 4:00 am the next morning. <br /> <br /> In the version we saw was in English (mostly), so there must be at least two versions, as the first reviewer saw in the movie (probably original) the German version. I searched and searched for a version of the movie, but never came up with anything. absolutely I'd love to have a VHS or DVD version of it. It explores the relationship at a fundamental level, as well as an excellent tutorial on how to treat your partner. If anyone knows, the writer / director, please make sure to let him go again, preferably on DVD these days. I can not even imagine, I get tired to look at the open game of actors who are now probably all in their forties. Please, please bring it back.
