Kay Pollak (the man behind the film), this big man, who is trying in various ways to share his philosophy of life. He wrote a bunch of good and well-written books on how to control your feelings and keep your soul happy. Message in most of his books and this movie, that your mind is actually what causes your problems, and that the cause of your anger is unlikely due to the fact that you might think. The basic idea is that you can choose to be happy, but it is hardly ever done. <br /> <br /> In order to see this movie and find out something very important in life, you must keep your mind open and really listen to all the "hidden messages" (or guidelines, to go through life) that most of the parts in this film contains, if you listen and watch. Careful with the ears. <br /> <br /> You will not know the meaning of life, but you learn how to live and get the most out of it ... <br /> <br /> so, while watching, please keep in mind: <br /> <br /> Â«mind is like a parachute, it does not work if it does not open!"
