A Cinderella Story is one of my favorites from Charles Perrault, with Sleeping Beauty, which was also made into a Disney film in 1959; this film is a sweet, inspiring masterpiece from Disney <br /> <br /> The film has a great soundtrack. This one I like in a movie soundtrack is very good, and I also love the song; My favorite song is romantic, "So this is love." I love the mouse from the movie, too, they are cute. My favorite scene after scene of the story, the little birds trying to wake up in the morning Cinderella; I also love when the animal friends of Cinderella (mice and birds) mend the dress Cinderella darling mother, so that she could go to the ball ... until Drizella & Anastasia Sun tore him to pieces, b **** rd!
