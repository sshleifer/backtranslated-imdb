I've always been a supporter of David Lynch and Lynch with this film proved to critics that he has the talent, style and artistic integrity to make movies is unreal aura that he became known in the last decade. As far as the movie G-rated, is pure Lynch style, stimulate and sinks. The film moves at a hypnotic pace and artfully filled with scenes of real emotion and strength. <br /> <br /> cinematography is terrific, as you might expect from the film, Lynch, and transitional assembly sequence is breathtaking. In addition, it is very nice to see a movie where all the characters are friendly, kind people and unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as either "good" or "evil." <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns into a beautiful performance as do the rest of the actors, especially Sissy Spacek in endearing performance as his-aged daugher, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but pivotal role indefinitely. <br /> <br /> In this film, David Lynch proved to critics that he can make a powerful movable film in the same way as he did in the 80's of "Blue Velvet" and "Elephant Man". Critics seem to have lost faith in the last decade after he made such surreal films like "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" and "Lost Highway", but in this film it is revealed that there is a way FWWM and LH and it looks as if the critics finally caught on his last film "Mulholland Drive", given the high praise it has received and Oscar nomination for Lynch. <br /> <br /> «Straight Story» for me one of the most disturbing films I »ever seen. This is the story of a loving family, friendship and kindness of strangers. I highly recommend it.
