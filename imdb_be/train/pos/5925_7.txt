Because of all the negative reviews of this film, I almost did not watch. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was pretty good horror film. Action was not great - except the great Alice Krige - but some of the dialogue ( "Just imagine the dinner.") It was pretty funny <br /> <br /> In general, higher average Stephen King's efforts. - 7/10.
