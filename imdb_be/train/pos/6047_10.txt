The brilliant thing about Withnail & I is that it captures that not long left college and life can go to either side of the time, along with all his other clothes. Freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work at the age of 15/16. I know that some of the broad sheets stuck a knife in the film when it came out in theaters, but I saw him in a crowded home in Hailsham, and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. I grew up in the Forest of Dean and it took me straight to my mushrooming and doping days (there were some great helpers - I do not want to think that all of them so far - probably running the local council). I watched it a few times on DVD and already I see the film as an old friend, who will remain forever as a part of my collection (how can I love this movie and The Dam Busters - do not seem right somehow) I, of course, the edges of the second half of this film, and I think that the social scene interact with the locals brilliantly made. I like the combination of the three main characters and there really are some lovely letters here, along with some very Quotable lines and dare I say a good smattering of integrity. I tried to get the soundtrack, but it was not released (a shame, because this is an unusual man). Someone told me that it was originally a stage of the game, not quite sure how it works, but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the little Shakespearean touches / references that seem to arise throughout the film (also noticed Ref Dylan Thomas, a), and, like all the little gems are always little things to discover, as the final scene gives the go-ahead to EasyRider they they start the next path. Overall, really unpretentious piece of filmmaking (love it!)
