I believe that they were telling the truth all time..U cant trust anything in the wild ... They went through the family hell.Those poor boys too young to understand what is happening around them. But still have to deal with rumors. As well as dealing with losing their younger sister. I can not believe this thing went so long.seems, the jury could not see the truth, even if it bit them on ass.I sympathize with the family, and if I could let them know I hate what happened of them, I do not would.I have no idea what they have been through, I can not even imagine. After watching this movie, I was in tears, and had to check on my little girl in bed ... I think that everyone should look at it.
