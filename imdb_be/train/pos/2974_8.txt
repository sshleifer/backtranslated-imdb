This film is perfectly paced, you never have to wait for the belly laugh, to come up with more than a minute, and there is much more going on than the original premise of the film. For him there is a parody of the traditional local sugary boy-made-good-conquer adversity genre, which is a parody. Do not let anyone tell you that they are trying to get cheap laughs by simply using profanity, - I am sure there are many, but it all depends on the context, entirely gratuitous. I loved this film and it only cost me Â£ 2.99 on DVD, and in terms of entertainment value for the money, it was the best film I've seen this year.
