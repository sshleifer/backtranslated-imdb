"The Straight Story" is a truly beautiful film about an elderly man by the name of Alvin Straight, who is riding his lawn mower across the country to visit his alienation dying brother. But this is only the basic Synapsis ... this film is about so much more than that. It was the last part of Richard Farnworth, before he died, and it is certainly one that he will remember. He's a stubborn old man, not unlike many of the older people that you and I may know. <br /> <br /> Â«Straight Story" is a film that everyone should see at least once in their lives. He reaches down and touch some part of you, at least if you have a heart, he would.
