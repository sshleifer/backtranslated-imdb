Some guys think that the sniper is not good because of the action of it was not good enough. Well, if you consider it as a thriller, this view can be quite fair, because the action of this movive not really interesting. Nevertheless, I believe that it is a psychological drama rather than the effect of each. <br /> <br /> The film is mainly talking about internal two snipers, who certainly had different faces and different experiences. Thomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, looked as if he was a cold-hearted. However, after Beccket showed his day dream Montana, we can clearly see its softness inside. It was a brutal war and a victim of its partners, who have made Beccket become so-called heartless. <br /> <br /> Millar, on the contrary, I was a novice, green hand, and does not even qualify as a sniper. Billy Zane has done well enough to show indecision Millar and fear when he first tried to "put a bullet in the heart of man" (as what is said Beccket). What he thought was actuall a suicide mission, it can be easily achieved, and then he could easily go back and get a reward. <br /> <br /> The two men were very different in their personality, and I think that the movie successfully showed the difference and the impact that they have had with each other due to the difference in their faces. These two snipers quarrel, the suspect each other, and finally come to an understanding of communication and the fact that they have done to help even save another. <br /> <br /> Ivan is not a good action movie but a good psychological.
