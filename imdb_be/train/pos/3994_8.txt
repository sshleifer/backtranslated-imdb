I went to this movie because I was involved, and I would go back just because the audience consisted mostly of elderly people, and I felt out of place. However, the film was very exciting and is not focused on the elderly. The characters were very real and believable, and I found that the discussion of the film, the characters and the plot for a few hours afterwards. There are quite a few exciting scenes there, but they are needed, and help you understand what the situation is much better. Overall, this is a large and valuable film - a bit from the mainstream, but this does not mean that the film can not be used by people who prefer mainstream. This is an exciting and entertaining movie experience.
