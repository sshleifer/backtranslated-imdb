Comparison with the detective, at an earlier stage of the game, which became a movie, obviously, and on my first viewing, I also thought that the detective was better, but Deathtrap has, at least for me, has a lot of repeat visitors to display it than detective . <, Br /> <br /> I bought Deathrap in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart, believing that it was Kane and underrated Reeve and cost $ 6. It was one of the best DVD purchases I could taken. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest secrets that amateur movies always always delighted to discover. And it is well worth repeat viewings. <br /> <br /> Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine played for language performance in Sleuth, I was doubly impressed with Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve, rightly associated with his legendary image of Superman, stole the show that was supposed to be a worthy Oscar performance. I have always felt, Reeve was a type cast an actor who did not get much of a chance to shine outside the Superman films and several other imperfect but entertaining films like somewhere at that time, but this film shows that his potential was actually tapped and put to use, thank God. <br /> <br /> I absolutely relished performance by Michael Caine. He was fighting, magic and manipulative sadist. And watching him work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. In fact, thanks to this movie, which I got in Â«Michael Caine phase" and began to rent as much of his stuff as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> As for the traps, there are lots of juicy dialogue here to fill their "slogans" section. (Unfortunately, much of the dialogue is inherently spoil very exciting story). <br /> <br /> It is indeed very difficult to talk about the film without spoiling the important moments of the plot, which is infinitely more fun to discover on their own. Needless to say, this is a must see. But for me it was the biggest and the most useful buying blind all the time. <br /> <br /> If you often have views. <br /> <br /> And it deserves to sit next to Investigators on your DVD shelf <br /> <br /> I'll leave you with this beautifully written quote from the movie :. "I wonder if it would not be ... well ... just a trifle dreamy me to enter into such a risky and exciting collaboration ... where I could count no sense of moral obligation at all ...".
