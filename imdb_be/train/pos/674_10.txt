While most people watch a movie, this would be of little interest, and many hundreds of films about magic and the occult in one form or another, this one is probably better in many ways. <br /> <br /> Golem from the craft object seems endless interest in the film industry. Most of the films touching it in any way to do so for children (eg "magical board", this piece full of garbage in every way) or take the transcendental elements, like a cheap excuse for cheese special effects or cardboard cut villains (cf. "Warlock"). Most often, the subject comes into hysterical religious context (in different Revelations-oriented films, Antichrist necessarily a supporter of some practices in the style of New Age). Occasionally, the film appears to show at least some experience which remains dit with magic as it is practiced in real life, but the view of occultism in films, at best can be described as allegorical and literal or symbolic, or ... just not quite true. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie again after many years now I have seen it before on the VHS;. it is a dark, moody piece, and after watching it on DVD, I would say, if you have any intention of watching this film, watch it on DVD, do not look at the VHS. <br /> <br /> darkness and gloom are overpowering in VHS, but DVD movie takes on a completely different tone. I think Weir pushed deliberately darker aspects of the style, but if the film turns into a low color environment VHS it goes over the edge. DVD brings the film to life again, and I saw it differently. <br /> <br /> Either way, treating it as if for the first time, I realized that the treatment of magic is very good in this movie. It's hard to get into all the reasons why I do not want to take the time to do it. <br /> <br /> For all of you who are interested, in any case, if you want to see what it is like in real life, this film is just so right on countless levels. <br /> <br /> And for those who are not, you really wasted a lot of time to read this paragraph.
