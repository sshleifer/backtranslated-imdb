I complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees. If enough people do the same, it may be enough to bring this fantastic show back to life !! Just go to the official website, and the rest is quite easy. I do not understand why this show was canceled. What a fantastic show, the actors and the characters. The whole concept of capturing viewing! I am surprised that my favorite show is over after one series. Why is this? Six Degrees is phenomenal, it is better than in many other television programs there! So far I have not heard that they stopped it from a friend, he did not even occurred to me that this could happen.
