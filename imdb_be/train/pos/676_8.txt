"The Last Wave" is much more than the sum of its parts. This is not a disaster movie, not just intelligence in Australian Aboriginal spirituality, and certainly more than a simple judicial drama. Writer / director Peter Weir manages to take these elements to the next level, to carry out a truly effective and reflection film with the same terrible atmosphere, which he gave "Picnic at Hanging Rock" two years ago, that you continue to remember a few years later. <br /> <br /> If the lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is designed to protect Chris Lee (Gulpilil) in connection with the death of native, for which it may or may not be directly responsible, he considers himself not just struggling to get the truth from you, but making sense of what he hears when she comes. As with the natives the belief that there are two worlds - the everyday and the Dreamtime, the truth exists on two completely different levels, with branches more catastrophic than Burton could ever imagine <br /> <br /> No doubt, the reason why . "Picnic at Hanging Rock" is better remembered because of its eternal mystery. We were on the same path, but is forced to seek answers for themselves. In «The Last Wave», we can put everything together at the end of the film. Nevertheless, even with all the information we need to decide how much of it we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond our ordinary reality. <br /> <br /> On the production side, the Weir uses its budget to great effect, gradually building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting, heavy rain, good use of sound. Musical accompaniment is entirely unobtrusive, never trying to be a big deal. Richard Chamberlain managed to convey the puzzled audience, of course, to feel as he tries to solve the mystery. David Gulpilil perfectly draws people trapped between two worlds, wanting to do the right thing, but is afraid because he knows the ending. <br /> <br /> Put all these things together and you have a perfect example of why David Weir is a familiar name in the movie thirty years. Highly recommended.
