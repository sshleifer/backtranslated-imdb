Very pleased! What's not to like? - You got your suburb, you've got your zombie ~ d, you got your family problems, you got your social problems, you got yourself a Fine Retro-1950s, in the style of Flesh Eating Under Held class in the bay uneasy concerned about whether they next meal upper crust. You could not ask for more. <br /> <br /> Starring beautiful. Carrie-Anne Moss is the absolute perfection as debutante social climbing housewife. It was as senseless and criminal conspiratorial. The dream of every scholar. K'sun really great, as the son was just trying to be as normal in this nightmarish existence, and somehow succeed. He is a real screen presence. Very photogenic, and it is natural. Without naming them all, rest of the cast is excellent. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious police officer with a sharpened instincts and little disgust, as if it was his everyday person. Billy Connolly beautiful as FIDO. Excellent actor: I want him to play the lead role in "Braveheart" with Gibson directing. My sense is that it William Wallace would have been closer to the real nature. His Fido fit, yet affordable. Pleasant to the touch. <br /> <br /> In short, a great and marvelous satirical poke in morals, values, social pinnings, feeling, growth, overcoming the difficulties in troubled times, and compensating adjustments impossible conditions. The true reality show.
