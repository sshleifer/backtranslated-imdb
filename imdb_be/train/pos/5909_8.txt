I remember when I was five and my parents thought it was the usual cartoon .... unless bras and bullets started flying. I agree, this movie will make anyone and everyone is upset because he is set to discriminate against anyone, and all .... but the truth is that it's funny as hell, as it is deep. I recommend this to anyone who likes a cult classic. Also try Fritz the cat and The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat. If I Baska Ralph made this film too.It includes a cat, which passes through the hard times with the family, streets, jobs, etc. When I was old enough, I removed all the movies. Since Coonskin title was offensive at that time he was also designated as Street Fighter. Ralph noggin also cool the world, starring a very young Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another cartoon which dealt with the street life of a young man.
