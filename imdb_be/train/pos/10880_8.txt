This is not the worst film ever made, the actors do not apalling and the script and the director is not entirely inappropriate. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie ever made, the actors are not great and the script and the director is not quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> It is somewhere in between. Fun somewhere. A nice, well built somewhere. <br /> <br /> There is no need to say "do not take it seriously," or "so bad its good" or "it was not terrible." None of these remarks are not relevant. <br /> <br /> Cut has atmosphere. This is the atmosphere, which is really very unique and a truly original aspect of the film, who personally is what makes this film for me.
