One of these beautifully intense films that draw us away so close, it ends very quickly! What was left, staring at the screen, like, "No, they did not!" Lol. Good performances all around! Act amazing Emily Blunt is simply outstanding! I knew that it would give a solid, convincing performance gear, selling . royal privileges, and the vulnerability of the young Victoria through out the film in addition, the production is outstanding in every respect. style, content and sensitivity of a great glimpse at the perfect time in the history of BRITIAN I never said through a very personal and touching biography of school age Princess to her aladarannya as Queen, then marry Prince Albert, what ends with the birth of their first of nine children. It was a well-written script and perfect editing. Rupert Friend as long-suffering and sympathized with the young Prince Albert competes to win the attention of the young Queen, than to provide her love for Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), was thrilling to watch. Just as exciting was the link between teenage Victoria and her mother, who was then the rage, like her mother, and king William (which I also did not like mother). Actions and scenes were exciting, very emotional. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone interested in the historical and political situation at that time, and in fact, anyone who loves a compelling true story of romance
