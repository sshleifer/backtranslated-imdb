I saw this film when it was originally released in 1989, I liked it, and I still do now. But now I realize that it is quite "adult" for the G-rated movie, especially with the concept of death and going to heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work well together, and Reynolds singing voice for the dog dumps. There are some good songs, ranging from upbeat ( "Let's Make Music Together") to completely emotional ( "Home to My Heart"). I found the plot is good, although it bogged down once or twice. The final scene of the film Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I have ever seen in animation. The film is worth experiencing.
