Dan, a widowed father of three girls, has his own advice column, which is likely to go into syndication. After his wife died, he took the time to pick up his daughter. Sun Having known no romance in awhile, nothing prepares him for a meeting with a radiant Marie, at the local bookstore in Rhode Island, a small town on the ocean, where he went to celebrate Thanksgiving Day with the rest of his extended family. After loving Marie, at first glance, little cooks it when a beautiful woman is in the family compound. In the end, it is the date of his brother Dan, Mitch. <br /> <br /> It is clear from the start that Dan and Marie made for each other, and even though we feel that the result will be, we are going to a fun ride that Peter Hedges, the director wants to give us. Mr. Hedges, author and script writer on your own, gave us two excellent novels, "What's Eating Gilber grapes" and "Ocean in Iowa," and a great indie, "On April Shards, which he also directed. it's just a coincidence that both films deal with families during the Thanksgiving holidays. <br /> <br /> the best in the film was a natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. Mr. Karel, in fact, getting better all the time. In many ways, he reminds us of Jack Lemmon in his capture of comedy and serious material. What can be said about Ms. Binoche, actress intelligent and bright presence in any movie. She proves she is right to do comedy, telling us about her Marie. <br /> <br /> One sad note is a waste of talent in the film. John Mahoney, Dianne Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Hecht, Emily Blunt, Alison Pill, Amy Ryan, have nothing in common. They simply serve as incidental music for decoration. Dane Cook, who is seen brother Mitch, fares better because he gets to read more lines than others. <br /> <br /> Â«Dan in Real Life," a great movie that will appeal to everyone.
