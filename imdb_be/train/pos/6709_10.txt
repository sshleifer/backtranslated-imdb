The fact that I love this show is that it follows the life of a modern witch, and it's a blast to experience their daily love, humor and adventure. Magic Literature is so diverse, drawing ideas of classical, medieval and modern witchcraft, Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, this show is so much fun and unique, as it allows us to experience a lot of modern witchcraft, seven seasons worth! This show has so many wonderful qualities, and it is a joy to watch Sabrina live their daily lives and deaths "other" area. I would recommend it to any family, because TV's clean, cheerful and enterprising. Classic!
