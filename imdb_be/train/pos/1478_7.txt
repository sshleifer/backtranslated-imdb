I liked this movie, even though halfway through it, I was able to tell who was the secret admirer. <br /> <br /> I also wonder when it was based on a true story, as she told me about the "real" people in the end of the film. I suppose I'll have to explore it, and let me know. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember this happened in what state? I believe that they moved to North Carolina, if I'm not mistaken. <br /> <br /> Of course, the state can be changed to protect the innocent. <br /> <br /> One would have thought that this man could have calculated it as easily as I do. Was he stupid or what?
