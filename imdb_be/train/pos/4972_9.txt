LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000, and I doubt that I will see better this year. This beautiful tragicomedy Belgian director Beno√Æt Mariage installed in the industrial wastelands of Wallonia. Pulvord plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (Lada!) For him. For this son should break the record of opening doors. The fact that the father really wants to be for his son to be someone else, because he never made it further, as a reporter for the local news for the newspaper ironically titled L'Espoir (Hope). Of course, it does not work anything out as planned. This film may be better than Drifting clouds Kaurismaki, although it is more dramatic and darker humor. Just like in the movie, but tons more melancholy than inhibits and ending upbeat without being incredibly happy. absurd humor without making incredible story, and find Mariage superior images in dark settings, which never give artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is acting on Poelvoorde. This famous actor with a brilliant and cult classic C'est ARRIVE Pres DE CHEZ Vous, in which he played a charismatic killer Ben. Since then he has only played two small roles in films that have been released in the Netherlands, because, as he said in an interview that he was not confident in his own abilities and acting all the roles he was offered were reprises the character of Ben. On his return to the leading role in the LCA should not be any doubts over his action. He's just brilliant, like a man stupid and evil enough to put my family in poverty, but smart enough to understand what he did, and tear of remorse about it. You must see.
