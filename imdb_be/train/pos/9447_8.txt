Engrossing drama of four people on a weekend canoing down a remote river. They pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), an unpleasant Bobby (Ned Beatty), and a good guy Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes is fine - there is an incredible sequence of dueling banjos, interesting interaction between the characters and simply stunning widescreen of Zsigmond. Then two hill attacks Ed and Bobby. One of them rapes Bobby ... and the trip turns into a nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's amazing. The scenery is incredibly beautiful but the terrible violence occurs. To be true, rape Beatty never bothered me - I understand very well that this is the time to forge despite the good action. The film also shows how the characters change - Ed felt his pacifism, Lewis becomes weak, Bobbi violates one of the people whom he mocked before and Drew tries to keep yourself healthy. John Boorman direction is also very confident and forests and rivers sounds really help the mood. <br /> <br /> generally works well. Voight just OK in the long run - it was better. Beatty also a CI - but this is his debut in the movie, and he has the guts for making such a risky role. Cox is very good, especially if things start to fall apart. And Reynolds is just great - one of his best works acting EVER! As it was not even nominated for an Oscar eludes me. Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward is very believable as a redneck <br /> <br /> Mighty movie. - not for children. Try to see the uncut version - the TV version butchered. Also, a letter-boxed view you need to capture breathtaking images.
