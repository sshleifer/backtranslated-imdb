I first saw this movie in the early '90s, when it was first released. Room with a view was also recently. Enchanted April, it was so much more to offer! I have found that it is much more real and earthy characters more believable for the fact that "normal". By the end of the movie, I felt the same as I did when I first saw the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, I longed for the characters to find what they are looking for, whether it was the isolation, peace, freedom and love. You get the feeling that the whole of Italy so far away from everything they've ever known, that they are so decadent to risk taking and leaving behind all that monotony and compression. But in the heat of the spring in April, the life of every loosen and unravel (in accordance with the Victorian corsets) and slowly rebuilt to everyone's satisfaction. What a little gem of the film! Why is not more well known?
