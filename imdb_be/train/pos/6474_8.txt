I was totally involved in it and could not wait for each episode. Actions brought to life as emotional to be a missing person in the family, together with the effects it would have on those who are closest. The only problem is that we, as a family was, how fast it was "explained" at the end. We could not hear clearly what was said, and have no idea what part of Gary the whole thing was? Why Kyle to call him, and why he went along with it? By investing in the series for five hours, we felt cheated that only five minutes have been concealed for the conclusion. I asked around and none of my friends who have not seen it was something wiser. Very strange, but maybe we missed something crucial ????
