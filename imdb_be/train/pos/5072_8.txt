Pierce Brosnan is likely to be the only familiar in a new biopic of Richard Attenborough. The rest is for the international audience :. Canadian history and culture of First Nations <br /> <br /> Â«Gray Owl" is the light of a study of how man came to be adopted in the Northern Ontario Ojibway, teaching and preaching environmentalism decades before it became politically correct to do so. The film contains a love story, a moral message, and a man tortured his past. This is torture, though, do not always put into practice with the dramatic impact that it can. <br /> <br /> However, this is a movie that keeps your audience without any violence. He pays great respect Canada's First Nations, and presents them in a dignified manner and not stereotyped. Brosnan performance is slightly stiff, but I suspect that it's just as Lord Attenborough wanted it. <br /> <br /> Thanks to their proud Canadian.
