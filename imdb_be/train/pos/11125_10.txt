What can you say about a show of this magnitude? "The Sopranos" is literally re-TV as we know it. He broke all the rules and set new standards for excellence television. All perfectly, writing, direction and, above all, acting for me. Watching this show you will find yourself, knowing that these characters are not real. Acting tricks you into thinking there's a real Tony Soprano, or any sign. This show is also very versatile. Some people do not watch the show, because it is violence, it is not all about violence, we are talking about business, family, and many deep things, that all depends on what you see as a fan. For me, I do not like when people refer to the show, a show about Mafia. For me it's a show about family. The family, which, through generation, is happening, except black. In general, it is a masterpiece of the show. This is what TV should be. Right here. Complex characters from the amazing acting, great story lines with a brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix the ingredients together? A show that defines the edge and solved in a different way.
