It Raggedy Ann and Andy's film is so adorable. We love to watch Ann and Andy to sing and dance along with the camel with wrinkled tribes. This film is what made the camel with wrinkled tribes so popular, sang his song, "I jerk I love you." If you like Raggedy Ann and Andy watching a movie, and you'll understand why this movie kids love and adults!
