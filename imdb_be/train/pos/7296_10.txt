There is no relationship between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact that both the police series of violent crimes. Profiler looks crisp, classic look Fortier. Profiler sites is quite simple. Fortier The plot is much more complicated ... Fortier looks like the prime suspect when we need to identify the common features ... The main character is weak and a pervert, but there is "clairvoyance". People love to compare, to judge, to evaluate. How about simply enjoy? It's funny that the same people write Fortier looks American, but, on the other hand, claiming that they prefer the American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language or the spirit, but I think this series is more than American English. By the way, the actors are very good and funny. Act not superficial at all ...
