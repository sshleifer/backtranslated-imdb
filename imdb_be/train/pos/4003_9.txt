The woman was left alone after her husband's death, he finds himself attracted to a friend of his son and the handy man. The slightly twisted stories, the woman begins to sleep with a man comfortable in an attempt to revive itself. Twisted part? Homo habilis and her daughter and by the love interest. <br /> <br /> As if this were not strange enough, the mother manages to fall in love with this man, and when her daughter finds out she blames not only its dysfunctional relationship, but her spoiled life to his poor mother. <br /> <br /> While you may think is bad about this woman, however, the film can not display it in a positive light. Beautifully played by Ann Reed, this character has dimension and reflects much emotion. <br /> <br /> A truly brilliant performance and enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
