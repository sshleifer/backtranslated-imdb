I saw this movie in the theater in London in 1975 and has not seen him since. I found it fun. I loved this originality. It is rare that someone is making a movie like this - and it is also sad <br /> <br /> What I mean, I once read a book called «Black Hotel». - and, as a movie fan, I was always "picture" book as a movie Curious "adapt" them, you know, but as I read it, I thought, well, it would make a great movie -.? But of course, he It should be "adjusted." - until the moment when it will have little to do with the book <br /> <br /> But then I thought, why of course, it never can be shown on Sunday afternoon TV? but on condition that have been shown in cinemas to adults who know what it contains, where the damage? The curse has civil liberties were crushed here. direct P must be able to do literally filming «The Black Hotel." <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, film censorship for adults should not be. But unfortunately, while I recognize that intellectual adults, such freedom may be harmless, there will always be those who will not have the rationality to distinguish between fantasy and reality, and which may be incited to commit heinous acts. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult to understand how «La Beta" fall into this category. <br /> <br /> on this appearance in England, the British censor rejected it out of hand. Despite the 69 relaxation needs, taking into account the film theoretical subject bestiality, had passed the censor ANY of it, he would look for a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> But ... in those days, there is an alternative. GLC It was a local city council with the department, who had the authority to transfer the film only in London, where it was deemed to be the audience were more «sopisticated», than those who lived in the wilderness. <br /> <br /> The film was properly presented and composed. However, it later emerged that "advice" consisted of just four people - three who voted, plus a "Chairman". Also in the day, one voter was on sick leave. Thus, the remaining two of the voter and the chairman sat view «La beta." <br /> <br /> One of these voters think like me, that the film was funny and almost encourage a foul on any case. Another lack of imagination and just thought a piece of disgusting. The chairman did not understand, so I decided to err on the side of freedom. <br /> <br /> If the missing voters finally saw the film, they also think that it's disgusting, but it was too late! The film received the «X-London" certificate and is open to a mixed reaction. GLC film censorship board was disbanded soon after! Thus, «La Beta" is open only in London that can be better described as an accident! But I'm glad that it was. That's fine! If you have not seen it, do it. It FANTASY, and as such, it is far less alarming than most of the things that you see in the news these days ...
