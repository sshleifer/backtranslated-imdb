Like a ghost. Good ghost stories from bumps in the night, a voice that can not be explained. Now I see a lot of them. The Special EFX have more grip on today's films several times to find a real gem, you need to turn the clock back to a time when writers and directors really have to use your head to create a really good ghost stories. Now it is one, it is very rare for a pilot episode Ghost Story series called "New House" was one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was sometime in 1972 ... I was only 9, .. but nothing since, even in comparison with him. With all the alteration takes place in Hollywood, someone has to do it alone "as is", without any more special the EFX, than the original. This episode was down right creepy as hell. I was lucky to find it, finally on DVD today, and a very rare and hard to find. 2 The only ghost that was even close to the original "Ghost" and George C. Scott in "Changling". Desire someone will do more ghost stories like these.
