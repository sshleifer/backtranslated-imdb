Playwright Sidney Bruhl (strangely more-top Michael Caine) would kill for the hit game. Enter the young prodigy child (solid Reeve), who has just written a play. Weave in overly hysterical wife of Bruhl (superbly played by Cannon) and the German psychic (very funny Irene Worth), and you've got yourself a surprisingly funny film suspense. <br /> <br /> While not up to the "detective" standards "Deathtrap" nonetheless a very capable, comic twist filled ride of suspense on the basis of the excellent play by Ira Levin. Artists, obviously, have a field day with the material, Kane, in particular, supplying the top lines of expression with an appetite. <br /> <br /> The film loses a little steam halfway through, and the ending is much less fun than a funny one in the original game, but on the whole «Deathtrap» tough, well I acted and suspenseful fun.
