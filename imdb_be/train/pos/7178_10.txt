PUT ME ON CAMERA deceptively cute movie. It is actually a complex look at the psychology of children and offers interesting ideas in the development of adult and artist. On the surface, it is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80s a group of children of the upper class neighborhood. One of the film's director, Darren Stein, had access to the camera and quickly took over as artistic director for all films. Of course, these are some cute kids having fun. But it is also much more. This is a look at some points in time, the children are struggling with a number of complicated issues that we all face in life --- fear, sexual arousal, unrequited love, loneliness and just trying to understand the adult world, which seems to blow up all around us. As we get older, we tend to forget how overwhlelming realities of life were when we were young. <br /> <br /> What makes this film is still in force to watch the young Darren Stein turned into a small general director. It is clear that Darren runs the show and these little movies of his vision, but they all told their friends, their problems, interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion regarding the horrors of adult life. Many children make a home video, but I have never heard or seen children make "small" films about the Holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and inability to fit in and make friends. These children are facing and dealing with some heavy stuff! <br /> <br /> The power of this film is the way to Stein and Shell to pull the various scenes together so tightly operates interviews with children --- are now all adults and are still friends. This adds a new angle to the film. How many of us have stayed in touch with our childhood friends? These guys have. And many of the problems they had to deal is still working two decades between them later. <br /> <br /> Among the conflicts - is a confession hustle shows heart is still broken, it is very normal childhood sexual experience continues to be "sticky" the subject between the two men, some of the current offenses of the dynamics of the relationship and there is still a a member of this team, which is a very responsible and at the center of attention! Which makes sense, as one looks these home movies in progress for several years. Darren Stein is the director. There is no doubt. <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell took turns talking to each other from time to time, and one can not help but imagine the awkwardness will allow us a glimpse into the lives of these young people. This is especially true for Stein, who had gone on to great success in the entertainment industry as a producer, writer and director. From the first moment PUT CAMERA ON ME, we can see the emergence of a gay little boy trying to figure it all out. We also see the artistic side of the mind and those that are not always "good" or "care" --- and it is a bold move for any artist, to share with the audience. <br /> <br /> There are so many significant moment, but the most troubling and difficult times linked with the film, in which we see a Jewish concentration camp victims are tortured and murdered by the Nazis. We discover, through interviews and the story of the Nazi Jewish child play and part of the victim plays a pagan child. It's painful emotional moment that glimpses into the darker side of fear and the way the children are working through the horrors of the adult world, which are outside the understanding of an adult is much less than the child. <br /> <br /> This is much more than some home movies. This documentary captures the pain, beauty, joy and sadness of growing up. Powerful stuff --- and well worth a look! <br /> <br />:
