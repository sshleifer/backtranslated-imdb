The film was good, very interesting. The throw was pretty good, and I second that comment before I mentioned - Glenn Quinn was outstanding and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie. He played selfish "evil" friend of the band and manager brilliantly! <br /> <br /> There are a lot of songs in the performance Â«Beyond gravity" in this film, but it is not really a surprise, considering the film is a production of VH1. However, if the soft rock / pop music is not for someone like this one may also transfer those scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot of the group trying to make it to the top in Los Angeles, but in order to overcome a lot of obstacles on the way is not too original, but very interesting, with some surprising plot twists here and there.
