"Cry in the Dark" is a masterful piece of cinema, driven, and incredibly, though provoking. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who in 1980, the year witnessed a horrible kind of seeing her 3-month-old baby tightly taken out of the tent of his family, while camping on Austrailian hinterland. Azariah (the child) have never seen, and the result of its monstrous disappearance caused a frenzy of life in the world. Meryl Streep makes immaculate justice Lindy role, as she always does. But one thing that helps Â«A Cry in the Dark" will never fall flat is brilliant direction. Truly excited and accurate prognosis for this baffeling case, tears lead to the eyes. The concept is nothing but the terrible, and then you are left with ghosts, but inspiration.
