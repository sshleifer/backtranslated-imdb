Just as the new BSG is not what you expect fans of the original series was, Caprica can not deliver what you expect supporters of the new BSG (for the most part). This is very interesting, if not a few self-involved show, or at least the pilot. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for big thrills CGI (new) BSG, you will be bitterly disappointed. If you like drama, you'll probably find something that you like, and perhaps even identify. <br /> <br /> The plot also consider how the Cylons were developed, why Adama hates them and the origin of monotheistic society, authors also managed to solve "Playing God (a)" the people and the creation or restoration of "human" life. It will be interesting to see how it plays. <br /> <br /> I've found that stretching in some parts and too edifying to others, but overall it was very promising. A small part of me wants to (or hope) there may be some slight hints of BSG there (except for the background, I said), but it probably rolled story too much. As the BSG, I'll have to wait and see if Caprica is growing on me, but it's too early to tell. <br /> <br /> It would be very easy to chalk it up as a failure, when compared with the previous series, but I'm willing to give him a chance. Overall, I thought it was interesting enough to make me look like an actual series before "throwing in the (so-called) towel."
