`Bruce Almighty" will sweep the Academy Awards with a record of 14 wins Oscar! It will surpass' Titanic "as the highest grossing film of all time! illustriousness Jim Carrey is at such a high level that it will announce its presidential candidate in the 2004 playoffs the White House. Almighty then! This fantasy Grandeur will only happen if the creators of the film (including Carrey) will have the power of God. In the same room is a critical component in Cary new laugh riot `Bruce Almighty." Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is so completely obsessed with television is the main anchor, which he keeps God total blame for his own trouble. God of heaven plays Morgan Freeman, Bruce provides a `gift of God" (his power) in order to challenge him if he could do God's work better. It is obvious that Bruce gets `carreyed» out of his new-found blissful abilities and using them selfishly. Curry returned to his usual all-powerful comedic form in `Bruce Almighty." Jennifer Aniston was not `mis.pittiful» Bruce as a friend. Nevertheless, my kudos goes to the Prime Minister of Togo Director Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house to # 2, and showing us the doggone hilarious bathroom scene of all time! `Bruce Almighty" is not the most profound Carrey film, but he's still smiling almighty exhibition `Carreyism»! **** Good
