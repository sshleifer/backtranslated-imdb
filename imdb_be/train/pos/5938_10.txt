Another exquisite taste of what a superhero film should be after Batman: Dead End, which just helps to stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more! This is what a real superhero film should look and feel! Even tough it fanfilm varieties. Attention to detail, character and action, of course, really. Despite the fact that this production of limited resources, it's a shame the big-budget, star-cast, inflated production of "other" related to superhero movies. Here are the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people. Finally, Superman, that actually looks like "super" and looks like the real thing! Batman the way it should be, without grandstanding rubber molded, torn body armor to hide evil for a body of highly paid actors who do not deliver. I just want to make some sensible Warner Bros. Exec gives the OK, to produce a full-length adaptation of this gem. I do not care if he goes to the movie theaters or directly to DVD, I would never get tired of watching. Just the story itself is worth my hard earned dough for it. I hope to take the "bumps" in the Marvel and DC productions look and see what a real pit, a superhero movie should look like. No more Fiasco "Batman and Robin", or the Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these young directors and learn that there should be no reason to "invent" a hero for the film, only to have a "bomb" in the theater. Mr. Collora ... We need more directors like you !!
