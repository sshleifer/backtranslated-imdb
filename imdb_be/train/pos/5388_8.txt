I saw this movie last night at Turner, and I could not stop watching until it was not finished, though I might like to guess what will happen. Farrell was great in his role, and everyone else did a super job. Some of them seemed to stretch the boundaries, but overall, I loved it !! If you get a chance to see it, please! I actually cried a few scenes, but I think if you're a mom, you would. Loretta is beautiful, and I was just in disbelief at the idea of ​​their future unwed mothers there seemed to be ahead of its time. I say, watch it if you can, and not to listen to criticism. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I really liked!
