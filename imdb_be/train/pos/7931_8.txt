Man, if anyone expected a great zombie movie after reading the title, you retard, and deserve to be disappointed. As for me, I was expecting a low budget zombie cheeseball flick-, and that's exactly what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a cool little film. Zombie was exactly as they should be, because all the zombies, just received, so that they only do zombies come to life. Obviously, they did it because it would be very expensive, if they had done a full-on zombie rotted FX. I learned all this, I have no idea how anyone could seriously find fault with this film. This is called "Hood LIVING DEAD» for the love of God! You have to watch "redneck zombies" and any film Uwe Boll really expect it to be great? Of course not! So why are some idiots on IMDb whining like a schoolgirl about this film, I will never understand. Well, yes, there are worse movies out there, so stop saying that it was the worst you've ever seen, because you know that you're full of it! Did you ever watch «ZOMBIEZ» ???? Or "FearDotcom" ????? Or "House Of The Dead" ???? THOSE are among the worst I've ever seen. If you can not see that it's just a low budget zombie film, obviously made by supporters of the zombie movie, then something is wrong with you. I just had fun with it. Not bad from me, and I would also like to see continued.
