My personal feeling is that you can not divorce the film from its political / historical foundations, as well as many (American) reviewers usually do. It's not about growing up on Main Street, USA. It's about growing up in Yugoslavia at the time, when she was torn between East and West. Just as children are torn between Esther and the rest, and Esther is torn between Â«Tovarish Joe" and the guys. There is shame in certain situations, is lost on the audience, which has never lived under Tito. I feel that the film is undervalued, and it's too bad we lost the director. Movies like this freedom make feel more important. This is not just "another Eastern Europe coming of age film" ... is a sensitive image of teenagers walking a fine line, which may ultimately lead them to real freedom.
