It's hard to start this film several ways. Everything is working very well here; casting, acting, screenplay, cinematography and all first-class. For the moviegoer, this movement, violent story of love and human salvation. For a film critic, has a lot of sharp technique and technical merit. There are some tactical mistakes, and, as has already been discussed on the boards, ending lacks realism when one is strictly formal with CIA training angle. Nevertheless, I took the end as much as possible to move due to the fact that instead of conducting a pragmatic approach of a CIA agent, mainly crisis expresses its soul to the limit without considering the consequences. Like Jesus himself, Creasy becomes a superman through his sacrifice, he actually has a pragmatic significance or not. In any case, I appreciated the fact that the crisis spreads to the usual bourgeois morality and simply caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical pursuit of justice, which in fact leads to maturity for themselves and innocent. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is very much worth a look if you are at all attracted to the genre. Great soundtrack, great competence, perfect casting, and tough performances across the board make it the top 100 (or better) film.
