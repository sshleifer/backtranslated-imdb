We stumbled upon the documentary Gray Gardens, last Sunday and got "sucked" without warning. All who entered the room became transfixed on television and the haunting images of Edith and Eddie, who seemed to be living out their lives in almost one big dirty house room on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the table) - and a cat urinates Edith on the bed and her incredible words, "I thrive on it [the smell]." we have not seen the beginning and ask what we saw and how these aristocratic women failed to get in the position they were in. Spellbinding! a must see !!!!
