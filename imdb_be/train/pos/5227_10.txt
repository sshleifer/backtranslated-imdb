The film "Men in White" is certainly one of the funniest, if not funny, comedy movies I have ever watched! (And I looked pretty much!) It's about two garbagemen, which become "Men in White", and then stop the invasion from outer space. It is also a parody of a number of classic films such as "Men in Black," "Star Wars" or "Dr. Streynzhlav". Anyone who says that this movie is shit has something with his head. There are a bunch of funny gags and jokes here and you can really get hurt your mouth from laughing too hard (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - you certainly will not regret it!
