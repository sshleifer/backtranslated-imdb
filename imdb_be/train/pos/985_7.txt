This film resembles in many ways the 'Enemy of the State, "starring Will Smith and Gene Hackman, as we innocent (black) people, conducted by the government' 'of all modern technologies known to man. Usually, when the storyline is copied as the result of a disaster. This does not apply here. Of course, I love all that David Morse does, so maybe it makes comments are not fair, but there were many good things about this film is that. The main Baddy, play Dougie Hutchison, it was brilliant, and the story flowed with excellent additional services, such as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), was nevertheless most annoying part. It's so ridiculous, cracking hoaxes, without causing any sympathy from the audience. Do not start with the fact that the strange thing is that it kind of grows on you (and his followers as well!). I was not expecting much when I shot it, but was surprised with a stout fighter with comedy bits. 7/10
