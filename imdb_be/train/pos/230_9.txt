When I first saw this movie on cable, it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film paints a clear picture of the South and racist views. Most of the plants came from Soll, the old planter that uses a prisoner of work. Soll, which makes this move, its funny Ramblings give us insight in to how the South was then. I believe that if Soll were alive today, he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, his attitude to the little boy who comes to work for him and convicted is not complicated. Despite the fact that it has racist views, he grew to trust some of the prisoners, who are all black. Two convicts he trusts most Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). Conversation between Ben and Soll are the best in the film, they have a real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both, but in large productions, as well as Jose. <br /> <br /> This film should have received more publicity. However, it is on DVD and is worth the money. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
