It's really well made movie. Sumitra Bhave always made smart movie, and it's my favorite movie of her. This film should have won the National Award and would be my choice to represent India at the Oscars. This is at least a thousand times better than «Shaaws», which is going to the Oscars, India, this year. <br /> <br /> it's such a pity that information about it (and all the other Indian films) on the IMDb is not enough, and sometimes even wrong. Amrapurkar plays a very important character in this film, and he was not even enrolled in these pages. The rest of the cast and crew also not mentioned. Awards and a nomination for this film do not give even if Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film. There was not even a single vote cast for «Doghi». <br /> <br /> «Doghi» is not a film in Hindi. This Marathi, and luckily escapes the sequence of song and dance, not to get lost in the brilliant glamor and obsessed designer ware. This is real life, emotional story, which is made with a rare understanding and respect. <br /> <br /> «Doghi», which roughly translates as "two women" is the story of two sisters, Gaur and Krishna. It's actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave would not venture into a plurality of sub areas, and this makes it a very difficult film to direct. The entire film is in a nondescript remote village in Maharashtra and the screen rarely venture far from home two female protagonists. Many aesthetic approaches in this. HN <br /> <br /> The film opens and we get to know the entire house, which is preparing for the wedding of Gaur. Krishna Gaur and his father is a hardworking farmer, the house is full and happy; There is nothing to reproach in their simple life. However, on the eve of the wedding to be her husband Gaur met with a fatal accident. Gaur father can not bear the tragic news and suffers the brunt. Without a strong, working body of the house could be unraveled, but the mother Gaur shoulders the responsibility. It works, how and when it can, but can not make ends meet. But her life so far, it's easier than Gaur. Prejudices that people half-heartedly trying to forget, to do evil Gaur successes are rare. She is an outcast from society. <br /> <br /> mother Gaur wrote to his brother. Desperate to help, she accepts his proposal. It takes Gaur from Mumbai, where it is made to work in brothels. Gaur sends home the money she earns, and improve their conditions. Gaur gives her life with that of her family. <br /> <br /> However, if Gaur returns home for the wedding of Krishna, her mother did not come out to meet her. It does not allow Krishna by her side and does not allow the guests Gaur. She loves Gaur, but fears for the life of Krishna. This violates Gaur completely, and she decides to go back to your miserable life. But Krishna runs and keeps Gaur. She begs his beloved sister back. Krishna promises to stand her. It promises that they will look at the world ?? together. <br /> <br /> There's nothing that does not need in this film. All necessary and sufficient. Gaur goes to Mumbai, but what she does there never said ?? subtle dialogues tell us that there is to know. It's just the bare story that is profound in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> «Doghi» meets cinema. He respects the subject it handles. He respects his audience ?? he does not think that they have the mental capacity to four years ago. <br /> <br /> In the first act the course. wonderful direction ?? in default carry the story forward in such a way no words could have. The script has been well studied. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a good movie have to love «Doghi».
