If you want to watch a movie and feel good watching it, the movie Tigerland for you. I love this film, from top to bottom. Fabulous scenes of the film look so real; it's almost like a documentary about what happened in real life, but with the drama. Boy, I tell you ... the real drama they are actually real "fighting" in one scene (get the DVD to listen to his comments is not obvious). I see this film as a bunch of desperate young people who are trying to escape from the ill-fated destiny, watching Saving Private Ryan, I have to assess what is "unfortunate fate" is and to know exactly how the men in the film feel, I see this film as a cross between «Stand By Me» and «Saving Private Ryan." What do people do when they are with a situation that "work" in real life? Some people go crazy, some people cry, some people over fist, others do drugs, some casually sleeping with prostitutes ruthlessly trying to eradicate the sense of love of his life, some people try to drink the pain, some jump off buildings or bridges, some feel guilty and others feel so much suffering, what makes them so ill that fall apart - physically. This film has all the desperate emotions rolled into one ball. But do not get me wrong, it does not suppress the film, it is realistic, it is very very humorous film, daring and funny Bozz (Character Collins) covers it all, and on top of that there are about 5 female actresses in the movies; I'll give you to understand that for them there! With dialogue, war / action sequence, a picture perfect scene with the appropriate music; this film has it all, as I have already said, from the top down. I do not know why Tigerland strongly for loans. The best thing about ownership of the film is that it is written on the cover in big bold letter "Best Film of the Year", and it absolutely does not drop anything other than that. Keep the rare gems that come to Hollywood, 10/10.
