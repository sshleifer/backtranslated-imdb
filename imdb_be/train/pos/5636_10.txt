In «Brave New Girl,» Holly originally from a small town in Texas, singing "The Yellow Rose of Texas" in the local contest and gets to go to college prestigious Arts in Philadelphia. From there, the film turns into a colorful history of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. He was full of great singing and acting and the characters that kept him moving at a very good pace. The action was, of course, beautiful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsay Hong was outstanding, and Nick Roth camera work was really well done, and I was very pleased with the outcome (it seems a continuation may be created). Kudos to the director and all the others who participated in this production. Quite a gem in the film archives.
