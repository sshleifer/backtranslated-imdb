It's early Sirk melodrama, shot in black and white, a slight film, but demonstrates the talent of the German director in raising tired storylines into something resembling art. Set in the 1910s, Barbara Stanwyck is a woman who has sinned by abandoning her husband and small town family to lure the Chicago scene. She never failed to fulfill its ambitions, and is drawn back into the city, she left on an impatient letter from his daughter informing her that she, too, took a fancy to the theater (production of high school, that is). Back in the old town, she once again encounters a small-minded, and have to deal with her eldest daughter, hostile, confused (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and ex-lover. The plot is nothing new, but Sirk has set itself apart by creating significant compositions, with each frame carefully shot, and he was immeasurable, having Stanwyck as his leading lady. It works crisp 76 minutes, and it's just as well, because the material does not really have legs to walk on.
