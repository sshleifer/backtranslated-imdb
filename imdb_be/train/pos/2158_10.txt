I do not like "inflation-class", but I just had to give it a 10. I can not think of anything I did not like about it. I saw him last night and woke up thinking about it today. I am sure that the Hollywood remake, someone told me, with J Lo and Richard Gere will be great, but the original Japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking for me, I'm hard-pressed to think of any way that could be improved, or sets it to change to a different culture. <br /> <br /> stories that I found worth watching, and sealing a fist fight or a gun to go off or something like that! Imagine that! <br /> <br /> All the characters seem well developed ... even recurring characters had a good character-development and enjoyable to operate, and the cast seemed very handy. <br /> <br /> It is always difficult to find a good movie-musical in our time, and maybe it's not quite qualify (there is a lot to learn to dance, but do not sing), but I really think that Gene Kelly and others, who defended the place to dance in our lives would have thought so very much this movie and the role of dance in helping to tell the story of a middle aged man, successful with his family in Japan, was looking for something ... he does not know what it was. <br /> <br /> to a team of people in Japan who have contributed to this film, thanks for creating and doing it.
