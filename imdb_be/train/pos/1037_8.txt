"Wrong-mason is often the person who left something undone, not always the one who did something." - Emperor Marcus Aurelius <br /> <br /> DVD release of "Watch on the Rhine" could not come at a better time. It restores our main Lillian Hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by means of Dashiell Hammett (audio comments Hellman scientist Bernard F. Dick confirms his authorship). It is a fine work of Bette Davis, who took a muted minor role for a long time after she became queen horses for many Warner Bros .. It is equally important that reminds us of the fact that World War II was the goal. <br /> <br /> Of course, you say that we need it. We have heard that Cary Grant preaching in «Destination Tokyo" (1943) about the Japanese Bushido boys and their knives. We watched the boots stomping the living hills "The Sound of Music" (1965). We made a trip to England heartless occupied by Germany «It Happened Here» (1966). But, in truth, we still need the dissemination of messages. <br /> <br /> I have a 81-year-old friend who cursed regularly Franklin Roosevelt. He feels that F indulged in the US to a foreign fight we did not need, and therefore, the cause of the death of his beloved cousin. He called his demonization of leaders Union and trivializing war two, Patrick Buchanan. <br /> <br /> The political Aglyan pany has recently released a thick book heavy with a detailed study, which claims that Adolf Hitler would put any further threat in Poland, Europe and in the world if only the Third Reich was transferred to the free city of Danzig in 1939, Buchanan believes that if these selfish Poles Sun faced Nazis, drawing recklessly interfere with Great Britain and France vertiginously altruistic, no war would engulf the West. He believes that without the rigors of Total War, no one in Germany would not have built the gas chambers in order to provide a final solution to the Jewish question. <br /> <br /> Some commentators on this site believe that the "look" sag under the weight of stale propaganda. Maybe. However, neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seems to get the point of the film: Some people are hurt and kill in order to seize the lands of others, goods and freedom; such men dominated the axis of the state and "enough" does not appear in their vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Paul Lucas earned Oscar, he won. He and Betty Davis delivered a convincing passion in his images of refugees, fighting with oppressors. They provide emotional punch in the intellectual case for leaving aside, for the active down torturers and murderers. Bernard Dick said that Hellman did not care for Lukas as a man, because he was apolitical. Of course, as he saw the bloody Hungarian "dictatorship of the proletariat" firsthand Bela Kun replace outdated empire, and then on the right to overthrow the tyranny of Admiral Horthy. <br /> <br /> In a perfect cameo roles added by Hammett's play, Henry Daniel pointedly reflects the Wehrmacht officer class that despises brown shirt he serves. His background Fili Ramme, of course, are with Field Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the 20 July plot against Hitler. In April 1940, however, he incites pragmatic Nazi, although he insulted Herr Blecher «Butcher" and despises the Romanian aristocrat Tecla de Brancovis for trying to peddle information on the leader of the underground. <br /> <br /> Tech, poor, and perhaps cuckold, he wants cash and visa to return to Europe, where he can recover fragments of life, which is isolated from the strange empire of the Great War and a global economic depression. He has no political beliefs, no remorse, trading freedom fighter for the future. Mercury Theater alumnus George Kuluris gives the burnt Case Old World cynicism edge desperate threat. <br /> <br /> Lucille Watson gives an attractive hostess viability of setting man domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way - but who does not adequately assess her children and their achievements outside the home, she controls. She and her son's pale binding office belong to the American version of the background Ramme-x and privileged kind of de Brancovis'. However, the family did not see the devastation and never will be. They are physical people who could silently propel evil simply not against it. <br /> <br /> This mother and son can easily make a choice that will display that tolerance to National Socialism and Fascism, which thrives today in my friend, and Pandit Buchanan. "Watch on the Rhine" has a period of manicured look. His dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage, but not all the time fresh sounds from the street. Nevertheless, the film Hellman and Hammett has intestines based on force. Viewers still need to hear and heed his call to arms against the grabbers inexorably on the march.
