Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, viewing it on video has a lot of nostalgia for me. At the age of 15 years, it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great musicals of MGM Technicolor. Now I could have most interested in thinking about the future career of the leading players. Although Sinatra did a few minor films shortly after his appearance after Dorsey days as a solo singer, it was his first major film appearance. As another viewer said, it seems almost to be a warm-up of the city. Sinatra may have had to work at it, but his dance with Kelly is right, and he will do better in their next pairing. However, watching his body, it is easy to see why he was caricatured as beans. Who would have thought that within ten years, he won an Academy Award for the action, and continue to play a lot of roles, as a tough detective and a leader in the battle. Although the identity and Gene Kelly dancing dominated the film, his charming performance could not imagine that he would become one of the main creative force, almost a cult figure for MGM musicals, where he developed a style of dance that is complementary to Fred Astaire. Finally, it was amazing to see the rosy Dean Stockwell, and remember that he would later play "thrill" killer of coercion, based on Leopold-Loeb murder 1920s. Additional Notes: One reviewer assessed Betty Garrett activity as Sinatra's love interest. Later, she played against him in the city, but Pamela Britton was featured in the film.
