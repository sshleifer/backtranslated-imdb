Jeff Wincott not only Hunk, he can kick some ass! This movie has some of the best martial arts movements that I have seen in a very long time. Okay, so maybe Brigitte Nielsen is not the first person I hired to play a ruthless politician, she did a great job nontheless! And let's not forget that Wincott have a partner in this film played the martial arts expert / stuntwoman Karen Shepherd. So it is not Cynthia, who cares? It is just as good, if not better! (Just check out her fight at the end of the film, one word: Oh !!). My suggestion would be to buy the film as soon as possible, because if you have not seen it, you really are missing out on some big action martial arts.
