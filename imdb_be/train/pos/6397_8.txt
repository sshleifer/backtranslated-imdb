I gave it a rating of 8 stars. History may be justified about 3/4 of the way into the picture, but performance remained strong throughout. "Men of Honor" was changed from «Navy Diver» clear. Anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces are likely to believe that "honor" is the right word to use in the title.
