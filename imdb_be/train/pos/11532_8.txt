Well, it was one of those films that I caught at random, and it was good enough for me to write when he came the next time ... If, like me, you like the 80's horror films that branched out a bit from the norm (ie, not just a general glut of sequels), then I think you can enjoy it. If a bad guy in the end turns into a man, he is not exactly what I expected! In general, I would not go out of my way for this, but if you like this genre, then watch it when it comes up and you have half an hour to kill, I think. I would give it a 6.5 out of 10.
