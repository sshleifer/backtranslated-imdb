History and music (George Gershwin!) Lovely as the Levant, Guetary, Foch, and, of course, Kelly. One thing is missing, and that is a good thing leading lady. I'm sorry, Leslie Caron bothers me. Anyway, in spite of it, the story moves along nicely with the well-known (and well deserved) Ballet. About colors, dazzling reds, blues, greens and yellows. We musn't forget beige as well. ; ) I just love the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (completely black and white costumes) and all so brilliant ballet <br /> <br /> So I guess I'm trying to say is this :. Please, by all means see it and enjoy it, because, although it is not the best, it's amazing. But be sure not to forget that the other Gene Kelly musical with 20-year-old girl who was catapulted to fame only after that.
