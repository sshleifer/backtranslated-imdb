Meteorite falls from the sky, and awakens a plesiosaur, which has long been used to terrorize the area around the crater lake. As a monster eats the locals are trying to find away to kill the monster. <br /> <br /> The last attempt to send the old horror and science fiction movies like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass have views are controversial, if you have movies like Crater Lake Monster for screening. This kind of film that parodies the films and to send only this is the real deal. It's all these films strive to be the only language in the cheek, and a lot more fun because of it. It's a real drive-a-kind film, which had the unfortunate success comes just as Star Wars changed the way we look at the special effects. Monster, a combination of motion and the stop heads in actual size, magically Fancy animal. The filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and his mess. Of course it is clear that its all fake, but not movies about suspension of disbelief? In fact, I think it's a really cool monsters, which it has. <br /> <br /> I like this film in the budget CD with low kind of way. If you want a real disc into a real monster movie look no further. This would be ideal for dual or triple function with the same films the monster of the lake (marsh creek, etc.)
