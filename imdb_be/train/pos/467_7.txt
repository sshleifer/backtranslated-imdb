This film is one of the few quality films in 2000 and is definitely one of my best. The script is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> photo film perfectly, as applicable both Turturro and Watson. Turturro defined gives his best performance to date, proving it's worth a lot more than we thought. Watson also performs brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The story of phenomenal players (Turturro), who is also a very eccentric in their daily lives. The film is presented in an entirely linear time, with several flashbacks of childhood puddle. Through them, the complex nature puddle described. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say, but suggest this movie to anyone.
