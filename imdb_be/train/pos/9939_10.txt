This is a series of the cartoon, where most of the action takes place in the human body, where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I will not try to explain it in more detail, you just have to see it for yourself: you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember watching it as a kid in the 80s (with Swedish voices). I talked to several people who were children in the 80s, and they loved it too! I must admit that education-part episodes sun to reach me on a conscious level, but in general the idea of ​​raising children while they have a great time of fun. Recently I've seen a few episodes; There is humor and heart in it, it is difficult to find in other children's programs at the moment. <br /> <br /> 5.5
