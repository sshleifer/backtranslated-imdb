One word can describe this film, and it's amazing. I wrote this film one day, because it was the Japanese animation, and it was old, so I thought it would be interesting. Well, it's a film about a young boy who travels across the universe to get the metal body, so that he could take revenge. Along the way he meets a very colorful characters and must ultimately decide whether he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you are a fan of animation / sci-fi, you can check it out.
