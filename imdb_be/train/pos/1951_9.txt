Single mother (Diane Keaton) finds herself working several jobs with the minimum wage. When she was fired, she felt that she was not able to support his sons (Seater and Colin Roberts), the latter of which asthma. She then goes to his friend and begins selling drugs. Quite quickly she is interested in drugs that it sells. Her life comes crashing down, especially her children, and it was her eldest son, to know the truth, and threatened to leave her. Then she tries to redeem himself with the help of their children, but it can protect your family against the drug lords, who she worked? <br /> <br /> Wow! This lifetime video some of the best acting I've ever seen! Diane Keaton overacts much, and her character comes off as crazy, but she was very persuasive. It is much better suited for drama than comedy. However, the best performance in the film comes from Seater, who plays her eldest son. It is ideal as a responsible son who is still young, but trying to be an adult in the family. Its effect was especially great in the scene where he confronts his mother about drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the youngest son, is also doing a great job. <br /> <br /> A film worth seeing, especially because of the actions of Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
