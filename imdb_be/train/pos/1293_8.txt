This is a great little film about loneliness for one person. Philippe Harel Notre Heros bit like an amalgam of Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver, Inspector Clouseau (his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (as Peter Sellers). He is single does not yet have a clue how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, it actually does not make any effort <br /> <br /> It is stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom ! -. his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same dire straits still, at least makes a bold effort to surpass the outstretched virginhood (he is 28 and admits that he has never been sex) <br /> <br /> Very good external boom Paris and Rouen, where two program people are traveling on business. They try various night clubs and places, but all to no avail. My theory is that they are trying to wrong place - they are more or less a night club "Youth"; they should try to type that has the elderly, more of their own age. <br /> <br /> Harel increasingly becomes isolated and does little De Niro efforts, both in the taxi, calling his friend / colleague to go and hit some guy who pulled a pretty girl in a nightclub. <br /> <br /> It is worth a look.
