"I like cheap perfume is better, it's not so long ..." - prisoner character Ralph Meeker (Lawson) said about this character, Helen, Barbara Stanwyck, in the end, he gets a whiff of fragrance that she chose w / husband in Tijuana ...! This line cracked me, and it seemed like a metaphor for this film - which is cheap rather than expensive as cheap perfume likes a person who has a way with 2 x 4 is the best person to have around in the long run! I agree with some of the other comments posted about attraction to Helen Lawson. Although her story declares that she wants Lawson to be put away, it seems to attract to their fiery nature, and passion, which he began it would likely not wash away with the tide!
