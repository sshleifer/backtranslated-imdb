David Aames rich handsome guy who lives in New York. If it is "sleeping partner" Julie Gianni gets very jealous when David falls in love with the Spanish beauty of Sofia, she received David into his car and tells him that he's the only guy she loves and wants to be with, but seeing as he's in love Sophia, she decides to commit suicide with David in the car with her, leading to the bridge. David is experiencing a crash, but it remains a disfigured face. Then he was accused of the murder of Julie. The thing is, David does not know what is real and what is not, as it keeps having these strange dreams (most of which are actually nightmares.) And retrospection, some of which simply does not make sense to him. Everything will soon come back to him, though, as he begins to find out the truth. <br /> <br /> Well, there's an all-star cast here, including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor, who all give good performances in the film. In the film, they have postponed different things about where the characters, like happiness, sadness, anger, etc. very well. There's also a cameo in the film by the brilliant Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky did well, another interesting and original film that will leave you talking a lot about it after he had finished. This is not just a thriller, but it's a real psychological thriller. Trailer for the movie is really good, but the film is so different from what it can be made to be. It was directed very well, and there were some really great scenes here. In general, a nice film that should be really pay attention too. They sure make a lot of "they're dead, but the one who is dead" movies lately.
