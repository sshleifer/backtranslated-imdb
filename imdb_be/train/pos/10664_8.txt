Does anyone else cry tears of joy when they see this film? I love it! One of my top 10 movies of all time. It just makes me feel good. I watch the closing of the serial number with all the actors more and more and more !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is a baby movie, IMHO! I've never seen the game, but I am angry when I read reviews that say the game was better than the movie. Two, like apples and oranges. The manufacturing process of the film rarely deliver the finished product, which is true original work. I believe that it is only out of fear of social alienation that many well-known works, adapted to the screen has not changed more than they do. This is a very good film, it's very nice. That's all you need to know!
