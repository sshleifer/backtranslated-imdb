Unusual horror film filled with famous people, but stolen Christina Raines (later TV "Flamingo Road"), as a beautiful but somewhat erratic pattern with masking smile, which is slated to pay for her suicide attempt, guarding the gates to hell! Scene with Raines modeling very well captured the mood music is accomplished, Deborah Raffin magical as friend Christina, but if Raines is moving to a spooky Brooklyn Heights brownstone (populated blind priest on the top floor), things are really starting to cook, Neighbors, including the fabulously wicked Burgess Meredith and kinky couple Sylvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, is a devilish lot, and Eli Wallach is great fun, as the wily detective police. The film is almost cross-pollination "Rosemary's Baby" and «The Exorcist» - but what a combination! Based on the bestselling book by Jeffrey Konvtsa, "Guardian" is a fascinating frightening, full of shocks brought by well-directed by Michael Winner, who mounts thoughtfully pessimistic finale with skill. *** 1/2 ****
