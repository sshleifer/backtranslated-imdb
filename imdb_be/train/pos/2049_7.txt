This movie is pretty bad, but I give him credit for at least trying to provide some response to his principles. There are some great moments in the film, and the dialogue has a lot of things as well. <br /> <br /> The aerial assault sequence, perhaps the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> I think I really like the idea that the length of the veteran will go to fellow veteran. Of course, this is not all that well done, but the room is not really bad. <br /> <br /> Tom
