The best time is one of the biggest sleepers of all time. Setting Sun imposes patience, development of resistance, many intertwined relationship with love set, jokes and bits of all the work and all the ridiculous. There is a lot of sentimentality. Kurt Russell plays Reno Hightower put in one of his best performances, and Robin Williams plays Jack Dundee sure-footed as ever. The cast also includes a lot of great fans. Jack's wife is played by Jack Palance's daughter, who is beautiful, as the wife of Renault, which is a great comedian. I can not tell you how many times I have watched this movie many times I enjoyed it, and how often I wish more people could see it.
