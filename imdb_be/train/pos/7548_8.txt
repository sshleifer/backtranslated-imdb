Short, but long enough, Cat Soup journey very wild looking. One day, I was just searching though my list of on-demand through a section of anime and bumped into him, and took a look. I spent all the time mostly sat with my jaw Agapov. All this time I thought was either vacant, had a fleeting one that shouted «TURN IT OFF !!!». But I did not. And in fact, I'm glad that I did. <br /> <br /> Animation stunning. Very artistic, odd and dark. I personally liked his amazing animation, but seemingly vacant story behind it is equally convincing for yourself <br /> <br /> The young boy. - Well, the cat - walking in search of the soul of his sister. The first part of it is ill in bed, and soon paid a visit from a kind of death. Her soul is divided in half. One boy came into the cat while the other half is lost. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the film a little lost to me, to be honest. I expect that they will come back, and the world ... perhaps slowly falling apart? Maybe her lack of response of the soul behind it, for the rest of the film contains the different stages which in the world. Firstly, there is a giant flood, and beside it dries in a bleak desert, and then it stops (due to the fact that there is a God or fate, as you will see). Then I guess they find the soul sister in the form of an orange flower. After that, the whole world disappears. Haha, did not get, but it shivers down your spine every time. <br /> <br /> Despite this seemingly random scenes, I'm sure there is a deep meaning behind it, if you watch it enough, and do some research. Personally, I like the hypnotic things like this, and would like to spend time doing that simply to understand it. But for some people it's probably not their cup of tea. He comes off as very disturbing, so if you like your anime straight forward, this is not the film for you. If you have an open mind, however, I highly recommend this film.
