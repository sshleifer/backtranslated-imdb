I just finished watching 139 minutes version (wide) with some friends, and we were amazed. I will not repeat what others have to say. The fact that the filmmakers do with the concept of an unexpected and pleasant. Huge battle tiring. After that, we were stunned to find there was still about 30 minutes left to go, but that does not prevent us from being fully involved and entertained. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that almost destroyed it and it was terrible music / songs. Blues, Country / Folk and rock songs do not belong here, and every time they are used, we all broke out in laughter. It's disgusting. You have been warned, but the story of speaking keeps you grounded. <br /> <br /> There are some great moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many uses of silence and slow pictures that work well. I would really like to delete the music, but alas. <br /> <br /> Look it up. It's fun, it's different, and it will lead you to places you did not expect, and that is very refreshing.
