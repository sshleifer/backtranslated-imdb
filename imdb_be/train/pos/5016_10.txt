This film is one of my favorites. It is difficult to explain why. Maybe it's the innocence of Corin Nemec and his awkwardness paired with daring Cheryl Pollak, but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack. In addition, some of the characters have a little line or a movement or moments that funny in and of themselves. Finally, the story is one that always draws my deepest, and the last scene so bitter. In general, I love this film; it is ideal for a night out sticky, sentimental girls.
