Not knowing what the film was about, I checked it out in the video store, and after seeing it, I enjoyed it. Few saw the multi-genre film from director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and characters. As a supporter of Glen Healdy, I was struck by her British accent. The only exception to this was the end of the movie. Nevertheless, it is worth a rental.
