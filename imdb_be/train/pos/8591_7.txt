It was a pretty decent film. This film is good to just sit and watch and be entertained. Just a typical Hollywood film. This film has never won an Oscar or something, and just do not deserve it, but I thought it was pretty good. It's kind of like the show 24, but is mounted in the film format. If you like all we have to stop the terrorists from the assassination of the President like a movie, then you will enjoy this flick. I personally believe that the plot was made too much, but Sentinel does add a little twist with a mole in the Secret Service. In general, this film will leave your jaw on the floor, or to change their lives, but who says that every film should be such as to be good?
