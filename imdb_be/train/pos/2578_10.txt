Superman and the Mole Men, quite probably, tough Adventures of Superman ever. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent sent Silsbee, house deep in the world of oil well. While some radioactive supposedly people come through the oil well and explore the city. Jeff Corey and many other citizens are trying to get rid of the invading mole men. Superman can change the way people in time to save the man Molln? Superman can warn people in time of radioactive hazard Molln men bring? <br /> <br /> In my view, Superman and the Mole Men are very intelligent, well-written and well-acted film. Even if we only get to see Superman fly once for a short time, it still makes a great adventure Superman. A must see for anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Stars
