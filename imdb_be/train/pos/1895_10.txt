I watched it over the Christmas period, I do not know why, but it reminds me of Christmas, so I watched it, so we are. <br /> <br /> Arthur movie I watch all the way with a big goofy smile on his face and his mixture of special performances, great music and a fun script crackles with wit and charm that causes it. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore makes a character that could very well be the hated very easy (the spoiled, rich, lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself), but transforms it into the one you love. Liza Minnelli great as Linda Morolla queens waitress who manages to remove the hard / soft on the inside lady Arthur almost gives my world. John Gielgud gets all the juicy line and polishes them with gusto. <br /> <br /> I can see Arthur again and again, and it always makes me feel good, check it out if you need a lift of his great movie.
