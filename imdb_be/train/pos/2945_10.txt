I watched this film several times in the 90th year and nearly split my sides laughing every time. I love Eddie Murphy, as an actor, but some things still stand. He's so funny. Even RS team finds it fun. It should look, and even better if you have a boyfriend or girlfriend in for a drink. Take off Michael Jackson as he, if you close your eyes, you are sure that it is his singing. What he describes the true to life, and you seriously need to have a sense of humor bypass, when you thought it was not funny. It has a local video shops do not sell the video anymore, but I'd like to get my hands on a copy to show the husband and the boy, when they are old enough to appreciate the humor. In any case, it is highly recommended, I hope you like it.
