With all the "adults" hints in today's family film it is nice to see that, where you do not have to worry about that and can simply sit back and enjoy a family with children. Yes, this movie may have some swearing (there is a time when Knox vows, but they do not let you hear the full speech), but for the most part of this movie is really clean as they come (and this is including movies from back in the day ). Not only that, it is very nice, one of my favorites, and just a wonderful friendly and interesting film to watch with the family. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have against this film is that it is too short, and I would like to, can be some of the more memorable parts that are in it, I will not mention them, because I do not want any spoilers here. <br /> <br /> All in all beautifully done and a great movie to watch; so go out and get a child to make cookies, and watch this movie!
