While the film does feel a bit long at times, it is well worth it. Gordon sends in a style that reminds you of Vonnegut writing styles. Ruthless, thoughtful, ironic, nimble, and dark, this is a film that will stay with you for a long time, begging answers to impossible. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin all incredible. Sheryl Lee is great as well, in a role that will remind us of her fans Lynch Laura / Maddy days. Do not miss it!
