Looking at Quo Vadis in my local video store, I found this version of 1985 that looked interesting. Wow! It was amazing! Very kind -quirky Ken Russell film, stylized, very artistic, and, of course, "different." Nero was introduced not so much the embodiment of evil, but as a stupid, frustration emperor who would prefer to have a circus career. He probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of "leading" is the empire was not much fun, and wondering what he wanted. Klause Maria Bandaur had a great time with this role and played in all it's worth . Thus, Nero persecuted the Christians with a vengeance, one of the many who made this day one of his assistants murmuring:. "no one will ever understand that we are just defending ourselves." He got it right.
