Going to see Seven Pounds I was not precisely sure what to think, because the previews were a lot of open, to realize that the film was indeed. Thus, during the first 20 minutes or so you are completely lost in the story, they do not have any idea about what is happening, and you think, Tim, who says that Ben is just a big asshole. All this comes to an end when the "turn", so to speak, will be solved in the last minute of the movie. Basically Tim (Will Smith) is alarmed and visited by a large accident he had made in bringing an end to the seven peoples' lives. He therefore decides to frame of seven new people who need help badly, he who gives his life for his turn. <br /> <br /> To act this film great, I feel entirely blacksmith, regardless of the fact that part of it seems to make an impression. Dawson Rosary, for me it's one of her best films, in addition to the eye of an eagle, which I think up there to. She was in some bad something good, but it is put in the film. Other actors, such as wood Harrelson, have a very small role, and not a large enough role to grasp the character. While casting the film is still good. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely not what I expected, and, of course, much more slowly, which I had hoped. The film, however, was still pretty good. Nothing opens until the last 5 minutes of the film, and not all will fall into place. Until now, it just seems pointless love story. Final thought seven pounds = seven stars.
