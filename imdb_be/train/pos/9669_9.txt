After reading the original game, I thought it would be much more difficult to adapt to the screen than it turned out. Donal McCann put in a great performance as a one-time public Gard, supplanted antagonist, which is shown open at its extrovert screen (but invisible for others) alterego- Private Gar. Eamon Kelly also plays a great "half-wit", whose inability to convey his feelings matched only Gar. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a rental if you can find it. (Perhaps not available outside of Ireland and Great Britain)
