Eglimata (= crime) story about the little crimes every day people make that in a crazy scenario could lead to an absolute disaster.One most elegant Greek series ever! Actors like Kathy and Mary Konstadinou Kavogianni showed a completely new dimension to themselves and talent and gave us incredible moments of "unclean" viewer laughing.Every, seemed to recognize the bad side of yourself in one of the characters, or at least part of their own, they they want. Actors of all ages who have played more and more smaller received the same large space in heart.My personal favorites Greek audience (except for the first two I mentioned) are Vasilis Haralambopoulos, Atinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis, but so many wonderful actors were past some episodes from time to time. Anyone who understands the worldwide Greek must find a way to watch this series, despite the fact that it was more than 5 years, he has been on Greece TV.in they keep repeating sequence (Ant1) at every opportunity there in the summer or at the beginning of the zone in the second half of the day will never forget .We'll Eglimata or any of the casting crew!
