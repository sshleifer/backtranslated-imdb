If you want a meaningless action, hot chicks, and a post-apocalyptic view of Seattle, this is the show for you! <br /> <br /> Dark Angel concept is nothing new (in fact, there is controversy over whether James Cameron about stole the idea from the book), but I spend an hour to watch it every Tuesday from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba smoking and friends Max »(original Cindy, Kendra) just as hot. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are the best, but the dialogue between the original Cindy and Max should be a little better (slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone who lives in the suburbs wrote). <, Br /> <br /> on my view, Dark Angel is a great fan of glee filled all actions can ask, but if you are looking for a hard-hit, award drama is playing «The West Wing» or something.
