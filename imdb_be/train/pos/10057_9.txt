I was going to sleep with my gf last night, and while it cleans your teeth, I turned the TV until I came across this Chinese film called King of Masks. At first I thought it would be a kung fu movie, so I started to watch it, and then immediately seized me, and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble. It was such a great actor, because so little. Maybe the fact that he was Chinese, so English was dubbed made it harder for me to say ... but it really seemed to be in nature at all. I felt so bad for the girl as she tried to please her "boss", but simply turned rotten. lol. Even when she brings him another grandchild, just so that he can pass his art ... it turns out that the child was kidnapped, so he gets arrested and within 5 days to live. lol ... whatever it touches in an effort to be nice to her grandfather, just unpleasant. <br /> <br /> In the end, he sees a lot of love to her and teach her the art of masks ... which just so friendly after all the mishaps in the movie. <br /> <br /> determined gem, and quite original. <br /> <br /> Scott
