There have been many film and television productions of Jane Eyre, each with different aspects to recommend them, but I suspect that this is one that people will continue to be open and falling for several decades is now. It's just a classic (and offers a lot more history than others). Timothy Dalton quite in his element as Rochester, rarely missing the mark; its performance is surprisingly agile and colorful, while never straying too far from the dark complexities of nature. Jane Clark ZILy more cerebral than otherworldly, but it makes an excellent foil for Dalton (in which case it rises above it!) The nuances of her performance comes across better on second viewing (once you have absorbed the shock of charisma Dalton). There are some technical flaws and a couple of moments where production values ​​could be better; although it has largely been manufacturing top-of-the-line Standards Air Force at that time. But, it is the performances, which are a real pleasure. Do not miss it!
