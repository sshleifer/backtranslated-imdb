I have voted 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story that I could see in a while. The animation is amazing. The work of each and every landscape was beautiful. Flower Lighting for not standard fare artistry. I was amazed. Going for beauty on the screen, you are immersed in the storyline, which is both timeless and at the same turn fresh. Character development is short until the Touchstone moments exactly what you need to key in the viewer to what and why, and how the character came to the place where they stand. I am impressed with the whole business, and I think that is a must see for the entire family.
