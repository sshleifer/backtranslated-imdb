Braveheart Mel Gibson's film has been effectively carried out, but it left a sour taste in the mouth. Rob Roy, on the contrary, a little less polished, but the best film away. It is a historical film that combines the timeless themes with actual historical values, while Braveheart put gross and unpleasant comtemporary luster to the ancient history. What makes this film is the casting. Liam Neeson plays the hero, as he basically served (in diluted fashion) in the Phantom Menace. Heroic character, but it is neither the greatest fighter and not the demon lover. Lovely yet a man, he commands the screen. Against him set selection is equally human opponents, including Cunningham Tim Roth, reverse, but brilliant and morally bankrupt Laird John Hurt in. In addition to praise Jessica Lange and pragmatic wife robes: as strong and noble, but 300 years of the modern heroine, just as it should be. It's not the most original film you will see, but he has the courage of his own convictions, as well as strong performances that you care.
