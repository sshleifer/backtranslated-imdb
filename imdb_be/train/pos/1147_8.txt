Large foam may go down as one of the single most underrated movies ever. <br /> <br /> And the star, unselfish cast who knew precisely where the film was and the role they played in it. While all hammed it was not one-upmanship. Klein showed wit and great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to drive a funny conversation while someone says, I could just go on. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this film by!
