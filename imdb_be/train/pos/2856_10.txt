This is one of the movies that get better every time you see them. He packed so many original and unconventional ideas that you can always find a new part. As well as in subsequent films Saba (as I have not seen "Unlucky Monkey" yet, but the rest of them are great) failure, chance and humanity play big roles. Cutting and Montage creative and artistic, without the film being "art" picture, but a very exciting one. When comparing his "Run Lola Run" You have to keep in mind that "Dangan Ranna 'was made a few years ago and was shown on German television in 1997 ... so it is more likely that it served as inspiration for the film Tom Tykwer, and not vice versa. In addition to other reviews, I have to add that I like acting and ending very much. This movie is a lot of fun in many ways, and it is possible to deliver the message without being annoying or pretentious.
