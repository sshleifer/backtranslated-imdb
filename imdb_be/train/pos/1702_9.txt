If you have any problems, hoping you can give this film a low rating. But you just have to understand this film was not made to please everyone, <br /> <br /> just a man with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> For those people, a great movie! He plays the old sci-fi movies and radio shows are long gone, most of the witches, where B-rating itself. Spaceballs along the lines and Airplane 2, you may need to stretch your imagination a bit to get the joke, but it's well worth it.
