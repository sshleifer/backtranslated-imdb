This is the cartoon, which was to win instead of Country Cousin. Visually well done and much more interesting and memorable. Worth a look just for the music alone! Although there are elements that undoubtably will bruise the feelings of some of these days, a cartoon has to give a little perspective. This is more than sixty years, and it is, after all, just a cartoon. I am disabled, and if I was as a hyper-sensitive people who are looking at things like this cartoon and offended, I would long ago have curled up in a fetal position and disappeared. Sometimes you need to illuminate, put his head back and swim! Caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and there was almost never terribly flattering. Bing Crosby reportedly hated it when it was used on more than one occasion. * SIGH *
