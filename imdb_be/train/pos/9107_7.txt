Several story lines intertwined here around a variety of female characters. Shoes, they are an indication of their troubled lives. All transformed at the end of the film. Adele (Antonia San Juan) leads brothel; Her daughter, Anita (Mónica Cervera) is lagging and has a limited life. Leire (Najwa Nimri) is a shoe designer with problems and losing her boyfriend; Maricarmen (Vicky Peña) lost her husband and now educates children from his ex-wife of the dead. Isabel (Angel Malin) is sad rich woman. <br /> <br /> Other symbols are used to connect the five main female characters. In speaking, not all distributed at the beginning: Some connections are surprisingly late in the movie, and that adds to the experience. Shine theme brought to extremes: for example, if Leire as a shoe designer and works in a shoe store, where she steals her shoes collapses, it breaks one of his heels <br /> <br /> In the editing of small compounds. made between scenes. A phone rings, cigarette burns, song, etc. are used to connect and fast cuts. Frequent changes of the storyline keeps it from sad or achievements TV levels. This greatly music initiative to set the tone and atmosphere. The city of Madrid and Lisbon are the backdrop for the story, and the boom of the cities, which are used for the expansion history of the characters. One of the most moving pictures while Anita, who does the same walk every day, is expanding its course and limited life of relative calm her street to a busy road: As space constraint visually translated well done. As in most Spanish films are many stories done visually, using soap as history, as a simple background. There is a poetic ending, which is somewhat romantic and sentimental, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> As Ramon Salazar is too much in love with his own material, he long. Some scenes of kitsch and soap level, including actions (love Adele's life, Dr. Isabella). Shine theme is exaggerated and weak metaphor. <br /> <br /> It is often compared to Magnolia, because the structure is the same. But they are different. Magnolia more technically competent, but somewhat mechanically. This is more of an opportunity to translate the emotions and the atmosphere visually. Seeing this, you tend to go directly to the new film city: Madrid.
