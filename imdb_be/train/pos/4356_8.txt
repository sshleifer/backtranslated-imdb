"It's about my Folks» came as a surprise. We did not have any idea of ​​what to expect. The film is directed by Raymond DeFelitta, and based on the game screen by one of its stars, Paul Reiser, was a pleasant time in the movie. Although the film is predictable, and we know that the result will be, it is a journey of discovery, where Ben learns of his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, Ben sees his father for what he really is, not a mythical figure in his in the head. <br /> <br /> film seems a car for its star, Peter Falk, and he runs away with the film, as expected. Mr. Falk, one of the nicest actors working in film in this era and in previous years, is an actor of such a scale, it should be considered. Sam Kleinman, a remote father to Ben, he is a man who clearly misunderstood, not only Ben, but a whole family, and his wife of forty-seven years. <br /> <br /> When Muriel clan matriarch Kleinmann, escapes, everything goes into a panic, because this woman who had a strong family figure is very important to keep everything together. Not knowing where she's gone, Sam appears in the house of Ben confused as he feels abandoned, suddenly, the woman he married and was faithful all these years. <br /> <br /> Ben, the younger son takes his father on a trip to look for a house that he wants to buy, so he could get his own family from Manhattan to the country. The trip gives grounds for Ben to get closer to his father in ways he never knew about, because the old always projected figure of alienation to his youngest son. Along the way, the father and son realize how much they love each other, and how old was misunderstood by his children. Love Sam Muriel covers many years they knew each other; they seem to be inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk wonderful in the film. He does an excellent Sam Kleinman, a man who suddenly realizes that his life could change for the worse. Mr. Falk light as an old man, and there's never a false move in his human interpretation, which the whole world is crumbling beneath him. <br /> <br /> Not being a supporter of Paul Reiser, we must recognize that, as Ben Kleinman, he's right. Ben and his father discover how much in common they both have their love for Muriel, a mother who sacrificed his life to save his family. Olympia Dukakis is visible only at the end of the film. She makes good contribution as the current mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with great style .. <br /> <br /> The film has a beautiful view through cinema Dan Gillham and beautiful scores Steven Argila. In the end, the film shows a great team effort between its director Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser, who wrote it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is clearly aimed at an older audience, it should appeal to anyone.
