I've been wanting to see this movie, being a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time, but McCallum talent shines through the juvie role. Thank God for Turner Classic, which aired the show last week. I can imagine that there were many problems with the children after the war, especially with the way it was during the 1950s. Some of the boys a little scary. I certainly would not want to meet them on a well lit street, much less dark. There were some good ideas about feelings arsonist, and, or, as they call it, a firefly.
