We tend to forget that the master / slave context of past centuries lead to a manicured estates, working on large groups of enslaved people, and a lot of money for white owners. This will lead to a group of people who are caught in the middle -. Offspring as a result of the slave-owners interferring with their slaves <br /> <br /> Some of these children have simply become more slaves, and others were free but free ... and color, which then meant nothing, but compared to the big number of their dog <br /> <br /> and the class is formed around these descendants -. born de Color libre or free people of color - this class has been able, to some extent, to own property, to rise over the dead to the educated and to achieve a comparative advantage. That is, they were not slaves, but they continue to be used to a certain extent. <br /> <br /> Most women live as mistresses in the white owners of plantations and rich people have created in their own homes, with benefits, pay school fees for their children and a kind of aristocracy, depending on the respectability they chose to impose on members of their families. In essence, they were prostitution, to ensure their own well-being, as well as the relative independence of the work -. The agreement called pla√ßage <br /> <br /> Feast of All Saints beautifully written story of the children of one such woman, the result was such an agreement with a local gentleman, and people who have touched their lives, in both negative and positive. Tale was a revelation for me, a New Zealander, with no real black / white lines of the concept, not to mention the fact that the gray area in the middle where the genus de Couleur Libre trod carefully. <br /> <br /> a very three-dimensional characters, and have been well made in this adaptation of the novel by Anne Rice. Details are well cast, the costumes are gorgeous, and brutal way of a line drawn from the blur made more distinct conflicts of the protagonist to pass. Gens de Couleur Nga could not marry whites, slaves could not help himself, and white, even cute, could not look at the economic reality makes directly to a person whom they depended. <br /> <br /> I recommend this story as a novel and miniseries, all, of course. If you can not handle the truth, you will crawl and cower through some parts, as one after another injustice meted out to those colors, like their white oppressors and their own people. Keep in mind that this is nothing more than a reality, and this story is an absorbing way to learn about it. <br /> <br /> I know it may seem callous, but this miniseries like to entertain me and captured me, despite the sour taste I found in my mouth for what happened, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Careful. If you do not read the period, because there is a lesson to be learned from it all.
