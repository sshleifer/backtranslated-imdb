It was a movie of Eddie Robinson hundred and first and his last, and he died of cancer nine days after the shooting was completed. All that makes it a key scene in the film all the more acute. <br /> <br /> While some of the hair and clothing styles are a little dated (as noted video game shown in the film), but the subject of the film is largely out of time. Heston said he wanted to make a film for some time, because he really believed in the danger of overpopulation. <br /> <br /> Some of the things that make this film a classic. History solid. <br /> <br /> Valid first grade, especially the interaction between Heston and Robinson, with good performances also Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> Music is absolutely committed, Mixing Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky combined with pastoral visual elements make for some truly moving scenes. This is the icing on the cake for the film. <br /> <br /> And the topic (or "points") of the film is an important one. Yes, this is a film about the overpopulation, but a more important note, it is a cautionary tale of what can go wrong with the leadership of the Man of Earth. It's in the subtext you'll find the real message of the film. Pay attention to what Saul says about "the old days" of the past (which is our present), and note how Thorn is unable to comprehend that says Sol. <br /> <br /> This film is one of my best sci-fi films of all time.
