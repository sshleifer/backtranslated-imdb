I must admit that Holly was not on my watch list for the Edinburgh Festival. However, after the artistic director of the festival is specially recommended this film to an audience of over 200 people before the screening of another film, I decided to go to see him. Wow! <br /> <br /> This film deals with a very complex problem of child prostitution and does so without any compromise. I found that tears several times during the film and laugh at others. Talking about the emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> lead actor (Thuy Nguyny) is Vietnamese for beginners (who was only 14 at the time of filming), and had to deal with this incredibly complex and difficult role. She reminded me of Keisha Castle-Hughes in Whale Rider, but the role is much more demanding, it must play a child prostitute. Chances are that she will win many awards. <br /> <br /> The main story about a girl who was sold into prostitution by her family and held as a sex slave in a brothel in Cambodia. She meets an American (played by Ron Livingston in a strong dramatic role that we are not used to seeing from him), who, after some time decides to help her with it. By that time, however, it is sold again, and he's going to look for it around Cambodia. The story unfolds and twisted, and the audience can never predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> action was strong across the board with a very interesting international gypsum. Udo Kier (very convincing as a sex tourist) Leduayny (touching as a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of his last films). Asian cast was also excellent. <br /> <br /> Although the film deals with this difficult topic focuses on successfully tells the fascinating story of the powerful. It was filmed in Cambodia (some scenes in real operating brothels), which adds to the feeling that you almost see a documentary. It seems that DP uses a lot of handheld camera and close-up and in general it made you feel like you are right there as part of the story. <br /> <br /> After the viewing, I listened to other members of the audience as they left, and it seemed that they were all amazed. This is not an easy film to watch, and I applaud the filmmakers, that does not make «Hollywood Film». <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best movie I've seen at the Edinburgh Film Festival. A view shared by my husband and a few other friends.
