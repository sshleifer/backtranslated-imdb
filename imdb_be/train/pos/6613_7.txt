Very unique Sci-Fi animation film, and to be honest, I love the uniqueness, regardless of the manner in which it seeks to be, for better or worse. This French film is quite interesting to see part of the innovative technique as «Waking Life» I recently watched. <br /> <br /> I've left a lot of time to get used to black and white style, but in the end, I love it, sketchlike image really fancy! Contractual future world is a symbol of the ultimate goal of the human race, that I love him very much. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot is perfect for Sci-Fi, not so intriguing, but it is normal, as the products of some of Hollywood giant conspiracy of human eternity, in a bit of a cliché, and twisted the end is not so convincing, some development just too simple and bland, and the whole movie is too long. <br /> <br /> so I think I m just in love with this style of film shows, others are not so good. <br /> <br /> On the eternity of life, I think that most people have come to unanimousness, we do not want eternity, because to bear the meaning of life, we honor our lives, because they are limited by and large, when everyone can live forever, therefore, world peace will be a disaster and chaos. Leaving the one you love hard and heart-rending, but it is also a way to show our life is genuine and all the emotions do their lives and make the world a colorful and vibrant.
