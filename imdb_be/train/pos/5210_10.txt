Its a shame that it did not receive screen credit, it will certainly do a better job in the movie is a girl on the cross, the best part of the movie .He had a much greater impact than Avril, or just about anyone else in the film, she almost made S / M look like fun! It was really a plausible / Model S M, which frightened her situation. Despite the fact that they seem to be really messed up, something dreamy feeling of looking bad guy, the sets were very well built, but they just kind of skim the surface of what was filmed. This is one film were both cuts must be made available. It seems that they left for a lot of what has been removed, and almost all the really dark things that would have made the movie much more crazy. Its kind of like they did not reach the mark they were going on during filming. That was taken to the R rating, probably, NC-17 or X, but this is what it would take did not get to make a movie that they way it should be.
