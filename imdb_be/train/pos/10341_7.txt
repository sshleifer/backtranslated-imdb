The present situation is a farce comedy squeal mid-70s, this film was a hit for 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I am constantly surprised by some comedy movies which are more releases one week, and then turn into zeros: high anxiety, cheap detective, black bird, DO NOT LOOK NOW WE REMOVE AT .......... and does not have a profile at all today. NORMAN comedy was the month when the 1976 and everything seemed to see him, laugh at him, and then never mention it ever again. Known to be videotaped and sent to the movies, the experiment at a time, NORMAN is hoarse politically incorrect closet slamming farce that Farrell Brothers should look for a recast of today. If they had done it in the first place, there would be no complaints about his detention and any pan. It's very funny and so very rude and funny all wrong. Just as it should be. In fact, as the groovy 1976 film with all these horror flowers and clothing it is actually working better today.
