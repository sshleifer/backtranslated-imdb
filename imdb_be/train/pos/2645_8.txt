Many films have not captured my attention as this one has. You see, I would like to see this movie again for more than twenty five years. The one and only time I saw it was a teenager who may have been the year it was released, 1977. <br /> <br /> What I remember from the film is that it has affected the profound contained emotion so deep that there is an overwhelming desire to see it again. The intrigue of this film gives the human element of the father / son searches and search necessarily affect every human soul who watches it. Why this film was not removed from the memory and shows how often, as well as many other films at depth, I do not know <br /> <br /> PS :. Received a copy of the film, and after watching it again was pleased to see that my memory held true. The rating reflects the content of the film. I would like to see this movie on DVD, as we see it used in the 1977 production of a videotape taken from the overall quality.
