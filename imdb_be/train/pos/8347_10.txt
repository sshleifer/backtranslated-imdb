Maybe I'm too generous with the rating ... but I just love this movie! I've seen it so many times, but every time I see her, I fall in love with him all over again. It's just a romantic comedy, with what great or monumentous, what's going on. But I'm very romantic and the film * is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Matthau's so funny. Scientists make me laugh so much ... I would definitely recommend this movie for those who have not seen it. It is so clean, a good movie - and those are rare now so my 20-year-old brother loves this film, too, so it's not just a chick flick. ;-) I recommend, if you want to laugh, or if you just lonely and need to * watch * novel, if you yourself can not participate in one. This is good, "the UN!
