*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is without a doubt the best film by Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made, and even with an amazing script of the film is enhanced a great performance Schygulla. The film begins with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Louitsh) just to get married, as bombs continue to fall and Hermann exported in the last days of the war, and now Maria and her mother and sister have to make ends meet, in order to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club that caters to American soldiers, and she meets a black soldier of the army named Bill (Greg Eagles), and they begin to see each other on a regular basis. Maria learns that her husband Herman died in the war, so it becomes a very serious with Bill. But one day while getting intimate with Bill they see Germany at the door. He is not dead, and when he enters the room brawl occurs and Maria smashes a bottle over Bill's head, and he dies. Hermann takes the blame, and he was sentenced to a lengthy term in prison, as Mary tells him that she will succeed at something and get it. The war ended, and Germany must recover and one day on the train Mary meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desna), who is a successful businessman in the textile industry, and she uses her charms to get the job done. Mary is going to do well, and rises through the ranks and become the mistress of Charles. She tells him that she would never marry him, but he was in love with her. Hermann gets out of prison, but it goes to Canada to try and get all that Mary did, as it was closed. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> One day Karl dies and leaves Mary almost everything in his will, and Mary buys his own home. Then Herman finally comes home to his wife, and they are ready to start it a marriage, even if they had been married for some time. But Mary leaves the gas on the stove and the house blows up with both of them are still in it. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this movie that it's one of those movies that can be studied and talked about for long lengths. As with all films, Fassbinder's use of color is used in a very interesting way. As the film begins tons of brown and gray to represent the war torn Germany, as well as Maria starts to become successful they are changing the bright rich colors like red and white. Restructuring in Germany with all the sounds of construction are used only as a backdrop and the movie stays focused on the exploits of Mary. Fassbinder really wanted to restore sounds to remind us of what happened in Germany at the time. Schygulla has never been better, and its performance is key to the success of this film. With less of the actress it would be just another interesting film, but Schygulla is so strong that her performance in this film raises the elite status. Schygulla Mary shows very determined and intelligent, but at the same time, she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She did not hesitate and make her feel guilty and Fassbinder wanted to show Mary as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla was not nominated for an Oscar, but she gave a lot of work that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Emku. I've heard a lot about the end of the movie, and it has to do with whether intentionally left Mary on gas. Later, in the bathroom is water on her wrist, and she seems to be bored. This is just a guess, and if you think I'm wrong, please email me. I think she was too excited to be the home of Hermann and left it on accidentally (remember her dress to wear for no reason?). Then, when the will is read it ITS at the time that she learns that Carl Herman and friends without her knowledge, and I think she felt that all she did was in vain. That is the reason for the bathroom scene. So, if the house explodes ITS accident. But I think the reason Fassbinder, which has an ending like this, to show that anyone who would sell his soul to have business life. Fassbinder was fascinated by the survivors, but he was also incredibly hot. According to him, Maria can not have both. Fascinating film.
