I watched it with my whole family, as a 9-year-old in 1964 on our black and white TV. I remember my father, saying that "this is how it happened - Adam and Eve." I vividly remember the scene when Adam finds Eve, her eyes blackened. I asked my father why her eyes were black, and he said, because she was tired and hungry. After not seen this episode in 45 years, I still remember it vividly - TV transmission back and forth from their home planet, scene bombs shook the headquarters, with the final stage two coming from Adam and Eve his bag next, it can not be theatrical work of art, but it certainly left an impression on me all these years.
