It's a good show, and I find it amusing. Finally, the bad Latin types of stereo over! ¡Gracias, Señor Lopez! I love this show, and I just started watching it for about three months ago. The whole concept of the Latin TV show family really struck me. I am surprised by the fact that, finally, Latinos have a good chance to be on television. This show is probably one of the best that I've seen, it's funny, touching, touchy, and pleasant.
