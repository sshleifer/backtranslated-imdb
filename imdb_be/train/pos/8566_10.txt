I really like 101 Dalmations, when he was released in 1996, is now 5 years later I went up to 102 Dalmatians in 2001, I thought it was fantastic, but I think 101 is better, because I think that it is more funnier, more humor, and that the film was based on the same story, that version of the cartoon (one hundred and one Dalmations (1961) I wonder if there are plans for 103 Dalmations. I hope that, maybe yes, maybe no we all Dalmation fans should know when it will be 103 dalmations future.
