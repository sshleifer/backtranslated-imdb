I like the presentation - I have read Bleak House, and I know that it is so hard to imagine the whole book, as it should be, and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit that they made a very good show with step by Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigg, and I could see the pain Lady Deadlock, even within the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think she is the best woman Dedlki ... I do not know who could have done better Zharndis, but I'm okay with Mr. Elliott. It is not so easy to book these long Dickens - Oliver Twist will be easier - it's long, and if you do not take care of all the legal situations it may be tedious or boring. I think that this presentation is not enough entertainment is boring. I just loved Mr. Smallweed - it can be fun. There is always a child - Joe breaks your heart here ... I think we should be allowed to judge for yourself ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that I loved the show. Maybe, if I read the book again, as I usually do, after watching the film, maybe I can be more critical. At the same time - I think it was a good presentation.
