This film was the best movie I have ever seen. Being LDS I highly recommend this film, because you can feel a deeper understanding of the life of Joseph Smith. Although the film was not made of well-known actors and a great life-changing film, which can be enjoyed and appreciated all. I saw this movie with my family, and I can attest that we all had a change of heart. This film allows people to understand exactly how hard life of the prophet and how much sadness he faced. After I saw this film, there was not a single dry eye in the room. Everyone was moved by what they had seen, and I'm not the same as I saw him. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
