I read the book in the 5th grade, and now after a few years, I have seen the film. There are a few differences: <br /> <br /> 1.Billy oringinally was suppose to eat 15 worms in 15 days rather than 10 worms in one day at 7:00 pm <br /> <br /> 2.Billy. suppose to get $ 30 after he had eaten all the worms. In the movie, after all Billy eats worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe believes forge some of the worms, but in the film, it is not quite. <br /> <br /> Although there are variations, this film is one that kids will enjoy.
