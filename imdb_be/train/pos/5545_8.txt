**** Includes SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of horror movies now for decades. Just when I think I've seen all the great men still pops up to surprise me. I've never seen this movie before. It was a pleasure, off the beaten path, too ... not only the way to a swamp ferry. Here was a horror film made in the 1940s that dared to try something very different. Pretty girl (gulp) a fearless for changes and saves people, including the man she loves, from the monster! How's this for a twist. This girl was the complete opposite of the majority of women in the movies of the time, do not yell at his own shadow, not fainting from fright, not stumbling sheet how it works. This gal is not afraid to live alone in a secluded hut away from the rest of the village. Not only that, but the place was on a misty swamp rumored to be haunted. Heck, she even takes a nap on the marsh grass outdoors ... as the regular version 1940 Ripley. None snake, alligator or ghostly Strangler did not dare to disturb the girl. Books in the early feminist films should be sure to include it misses work. <br /> <br /> See if you are a fan, as I am one of those wonderfully atmospheric film classic B / W horror, they made only in the 30s and 40s. And be sure to wear a cast iron turtle neck for protection.
