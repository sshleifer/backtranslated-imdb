This film has scenes that come to me at strange times - is an intensive scene with Mr. Muckerji told Mrs. Melandez, someone he spoke with witnesses girls displaced women window that matches its description --- is one that rides - she constantly refers to him by name in a Greek accent --- "g-MuckerjiÂ» - and when it detects Bowyer has just taken poison and gives her one last slam on the side of the head before she dies --- his enthusiasm! "The fools - fools - my whole life ..." etc. etc. - you get point..I should buy this. I love to play DEA Seymour - he usually plays a rotund foreign sultan or chief of police and appeared in Casablanca and a lot of great photos.
