This film is a replica of the television series on the Indian television channel Doordarshan, which was passed in at least 15 years ago. The series was known as the «gubbarre», which means balloons. Each episode was a new short story. History is a great and original much sweeter and "convincing" Abhay Doel doing a good job, but it does not fit the role of a "normal" guys and the "third class" (as he calls himself in the film). In fact, Shayan Munshi hair cut short, and without clothes designer role Abhays be installed Shayan but just does not have the talent to pull it out. <br /> <br /> I would suggest watching the series, if it is available. It's the same story for running around with friends mother and initial introduction, except. Act was much better from television actors than the "stars." <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie is a flop because the director was trying to stretch to half an hour (or 45 minutes), the story of 2+ hours. Therefore, he should get draggy. Even nasal singing sensation of the song could not be filled. <br /> <br /> This movie is good for a lazy Sunday afternoon, and it's really refreshing, if you have not watched the original TV series. The script and the end of the show was much better <br /> <br /> ##### spoilers AHEAD ######### ##### spoilers AHEAD ######## # ### ## sPOILERS ahead ######### ##### ######### ##### spoilers front spoilers ahead ######### THe end of the original series was much stronger, as the hero he dumps the girl even thought she was ready to marry him. He knows, and tell her that he wants to be "given" and never helped with this intention. Director or script writing somehow could not capture the original ending in this film. The original ending would have bought tears to the eyes of the girls and boys would have swung in agreement. Deliver just was not right. <br /> <br /> But I personally think that it is pathetic copy. No credit shall not be granted to the director / screenwriter. History of the country and is one of the most famous authors of the new class Int he Premchand Munshi. I'm not sure if this is the history of Munshi Premchand, but many of the other stories he Int series has several Munshi Premchand and other great writers of Hindi stories.
