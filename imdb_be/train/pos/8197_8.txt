**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** Fair <br /> <br /> * Poor <br /> <br /> `Go Ahead, make my day! Â»<br /> <br /> The fourth painting in the series directed by Eastwood himself (who is rumored to direct the majority of Magnum Force) and it returns a violent society from the first two films. However, the film still does not have enough power and plausibility. This film was released in the early 80s', while Regan and Young Republicans. The premise of a raped woman taking revenge on her rapist does not apply at this time. This story would have been better for the Enforcer, which actually would have made a good film. What Ambush story was needed, both on Wall Street, but Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> rating: 3 stars
