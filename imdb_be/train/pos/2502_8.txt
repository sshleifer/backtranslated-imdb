This movie surprised me! Do not ever heard, I was not expecting much of Hyde to Gackt! Therefore, I would like to see this movie because someone mentioned that the film contains some significant scenes in the style of John Woo! I'm usually very careful when it is claimed! There is only one John Woo and til this day was not a single director who approaches its luster when it comes to the action! The fact that the «Moon Child» will play the vampire has convinced me even more! How can you go wrong with a gun vampires glow! It sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed in this film that the pace was much slower! He takes the time to set the mood! This film contains some interesting scenes of Hong Kong style action! But «Moon Child» no fighter! It is a drama about friendship and loyalty! The focus is on the characters and their relationship to each other! The pop singers Hyde and Gackt doing a good job at work and very believable as friends! The only problem I had ! to the scene a couple of times the film seems to skip a few years, without explaining what happened and why they had to skip Example: If one of the gang members die (very dramatic moment) Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) drinking the blood of one of the attackers! Without warning the film and explaining jumping 9 nine years, most of the friends are no longer together! In addition, without proper explanation son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) must kill each other, I know that this is done in order to add some serious drama! With the actors is very effective, but sometimes it feels forced! Apart from the weaknesses in the plot of this film has an atmosphere and smoothness that makes it hard not to like this movie! difficult to explain why this movie is excellent! But it's easy! The overall experience you get moving and sincere!
