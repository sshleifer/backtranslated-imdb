This film is an amazing work of simplification. Pleasant from start to finish is so boring, yet uplifting at the same time. Performances in Miranda Otto (oh, how she deserves much more recognition!) And George del Hoya beautiful and almost painful to watch as two tortured souls come to understand each other. The supporting cast of workers to the letter of the Office of the Dead of the different bits in them self as one of Alice's suffering, I could not help but feel a little sorry. There is one particular scene, I could watch over and over again (and I have!) It's such a shame that movies like they do not get recognition, and thus lead them futher in the public eye for more people to get enjoy. I cried, laughed, and I sighed. I recommend this movie to anyone.
