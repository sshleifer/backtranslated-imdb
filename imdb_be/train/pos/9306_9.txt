The world a scary place. But this film is a farce and it's fun. And if you do not like it ... you do not get it ... and if you do not get ... it does not matter. It's up to you if you want to play together. Every actor in this fun. It's just a joke. And that's good enough for me. Gabriel Byrne is priceless. Byrne and Paul ANC makes my way, as a "Wiki" puts it, "... the best version ever." Well ... it's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad. I had been warned against seeing it, but I'm sure glad I did ...
