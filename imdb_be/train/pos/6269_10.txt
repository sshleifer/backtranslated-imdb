A pleasant surprise! I expected that a further reduction of the line: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such overhyped film. Perhaps the reason so few approved of this new type of fare Bruckheimer. Clever dialogue instead of energetic jokes, decent background / motivation instead of shaking the n-sleep patterns, and when she came chasing you really yearned for him. Fanboys waiting bitter Armageddon: stay away. This one is for more intelligent fan action. He did not even find me so little Jolie appeared.
