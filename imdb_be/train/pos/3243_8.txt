Remember the early days of Pay Per View? I do, and I can almost remember the number that you were call actually make a movie on your TV As a child, we always like to rent a playboy, but it really means to call someone from the PPV and asked to rent it. And then you get the nerve to do it and watch your four o'clock soft rod angle is not crap. Why I bring this up because this film was also on the PPV. And I remember almost every scene, which was in the superstructure. I was at the game over the last few years to get all the great movies that I used to see as a child, and it was one of them. It is one that, if it is difficult to eliminate. All star cast tries to make a perfect pot bust, but it does not work properly. There are a lot of falsification of bank capers, which are good, and this one should fall into this category. It has enough action and laughs to keep it. check it out if you can!
