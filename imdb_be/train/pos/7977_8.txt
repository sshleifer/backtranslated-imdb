In principle, the film may be one of the most charming names, made by either of the two Scots (Ridley and Tony). Let's do it right, the film deserves its hype as one of the most stylish action / thriller ever made. <br /> <br /> When it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scott really make a perfect duo. And this film, and Deja Vu are the best thriller you can expect. Washington did get very comfortable in the shaky cameras and perform every scene in the film. It could easily be associated with the emotions of the character, so are all the murders on the road. This is a success that they have created a super-dark city of Mexico with a lot of shit going on. It might be easy to see the degree of corruption depicted in the man on fire. I do not know what to think of Mexicans, when they watch it ...... <br /> <br /> Well, let's look to the truth in his eyes again. This is one of the best in the genre Death Wish, but he also suffered from a wide number of violence. It's a bit annoying that they justify the actions of vigilance, making a film is very realistic and let Denzel Washington to play a "missing sheep" type of tragic hero. In the end, they even had a shot at his captor's own pool, like a documentary. I checked on the IMDb, the film was based on real events, this ...... So this is for your consideration, if you will also find the theme of the film is a bit out of tune. <br /> <br /> In the end I hope no one will take this movie for real. <br /> <br /> 8/10 for art direction / editing / cinema / Denzel Washington.
