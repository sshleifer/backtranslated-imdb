Why this film is not in the top 250? This movie looks amazingly fresh even 56 years after its production, but it could be done only in the aftermath of W.W.II because of the proximity of death perception. People were more aware that life can be ended in one unexpected moment. And what happens after life? I liked the scene at the end of the court and all the people of all countries have gathered. Phlegmatic Judge (Abraham Soufer-typical British judge-), Dr. Reeves (Roger Livesey) defended Peter Carter (David Niven) and June (Kim Hunter) against US Attorney Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey, I-there are reasons why it is American) . It's all so creative! Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this wonderful film, which is a real "tour de force". Message of the film is clear: the law of the universe is the most important, but on the ground nothing beyond the love between people. The way in which it is told a beautiful story is much more interesting than any Hollywood film could ever make.
