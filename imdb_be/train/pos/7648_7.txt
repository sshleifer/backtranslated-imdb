I admit I have a weakness for alternative history stories from this wonderful life on Groundhog Day at 12:01. Among these great men is a little gem. It's pretty hard to get through the MR. DESTINY without nodding appreciation to every member of the cast, a good-hearted killer James Belushi in Courteney Cox. This film lacks gravitas and scale to make it a great film, but it's okay to cheer-on a rainy day. It is also a great inexpensive date of hire.
