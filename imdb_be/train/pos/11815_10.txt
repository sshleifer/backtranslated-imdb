At the time I write this, I see more than 15 000 votes he has a 5.8 rating. What's wrong with this picture. Personally, I give it a 10. I can see 7 at the lowest possible or 8 when it was valued by people who see this film for what it is. This is a film based on the comic book hero. This film has won more than his share of awards. Won 3 Oscars. Another 5 wins and 26 nominations .... immediately tells me that it is better than 5.8. Some great action of some very good actors, some great special effects and in my opinion, will, if not already a classic for years to come. If you are looking for pure entertainment sure to check out Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times. Al Pacino as big as Big Boy Caprice.
