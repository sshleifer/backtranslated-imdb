Well, here's what I think of Jack Frost. I looked at the box morphing for video and I thought that it looks interesting. I take it and I take it home. Boy, I was right, it's interesting. They put a serial killer spirits in a dream, in the walking corpses and in everyday machines. But this must be the most unique place to host the spirit of a serial killer. Snowman inside of the body. I liked all the friendly snowman landscape picture clogging, pot holder, snow globe, etc. I like the actor who played Jack, he put some fun into a killer is not exactly seen as Freddy KRUGGER. This is exactly, I said it. FREDDY KRUGGER. This is the level of "cool." I want some of puppet effects were better mouth movement might fit better. But I'm fine, that to a small budget. The cast does a great job, there are some big liners and discouraged to do any hardcore horror fan jump. All and all, a great story, good effects, good dialogue and good throw. Give Frost ... 9 STAR
