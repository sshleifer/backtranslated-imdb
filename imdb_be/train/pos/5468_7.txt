I saw hand't restored, or any version for that matter, «Baby Face» Barbara Stanwyck, until I caught him on that one. What a great movie! In a nutshell Lilya lives in the Speakeasy, she was a wreck of her own father, since she was 14! Then it even explodes and he killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone are responsible for her black maid chica, played very well Theresa Harris. Lily went to the big city (New York) retreated use your floor to get to the top. She does it in great style! <br /> <br /> she seduces plump clerk to get in on the ground floor and continues to go through a person as having a candy! One throws his bride and kills him next to his father-in-law, as well as Lily sugar daddy, and then committed suicide! Lily just blinks! Stanwyck is terrific as a girl who does not really know what love is. <br /> <br /> Then, in Paris, she falls in Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but if he is in deep financial paths, she bolts. Almost half a million free Chico, she realizes that she loved the court! Lily races to find him, but it will be too late? <br /> <br /> This is about the code of Hollywood at its best. Stanwyck huge and appearance of the music in the film is perfect. It reminded me of the «Original Sin» Angelina Jolie, another unjustly ignored Flick with immoral women, those who did not like the films of ultra-romantic inclinations, will not, as a baby face is better, those with faith in sex, love and power, will love it. It is highly recommended! Look!
