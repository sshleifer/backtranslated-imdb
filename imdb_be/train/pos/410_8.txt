I rented this film as a DVD, without knowing anything about it, part of the winter marathon to watch a movie every night. After a couple of horrible American films action adventure (Ballistic, Daredevil, the cradle of life) Zhu soldiers hit me like a brilliantly original filmmaking. The history of this is complete nonsense, but I found the film sincerity, warmth and well- complete lack of irony, refreshing, and the film looks spectacular. Of course, the special effects are not technically perfect, as produced in Hollywood, but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color, composition and movement than realism, and so many shots are breathtaking. In one shot, two of superhuman characters stand on the rocky spiers of rock, a huge moon rising in front of them, the image perfectly balanced three elements. In another, the princess-warrior spiers of heaven for her sword glows like a rocket heat ray. And the colors explode from shot to shot, used to express emotions, not to represent reality. <br /> <br /> symbols have the same ease and immediacy comic characters without offering greater depth in itself, but with reference to archtypes that resonates more deeply. Physically, some of the actors wonderfully beautiful. They play their roles straight, without irony and wickedness, and so believable. <br /> <br /> the most amazing of all, despite the clumsiness of the plot and the characterization of thin, I was very close to tears at the end, moved by a great simplicity of actors and wildly original, good-hearted vision of the director. <br /> <br />
