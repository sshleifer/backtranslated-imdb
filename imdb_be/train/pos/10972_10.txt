I only saw it recently, but I knew about it for years and have always been intrigued by its name. Now she belongs to me, as one of my favorite movies. It is difficult to describe the incredible object Maysles discovered, but it all works fine. It has so many memorable images and moments when you feel that infringe on the very private world. I fell in love with this film and the characters in it. It's as if the filmmakers captivates viewers and drew us into the wonderful world of the eccentric Beales, the true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere, and I have found that it is a pity that I could be there with all of this, my cooking corn on the cob on my nightstand. It has an atmosphere of sadness that pervades everywhere. Fall from greatness to this once-respected family. Money gone, but their mannerisms were, as well as their beauty. He drew me from the first frame, and long after the film is finished, I wondered about their fate. I wonder that if I walked along the beach East Hampton, I could still hear the voice of the old Eddie at night and see the silhouette of Little Eddie dancing in the window of a thick hanging vines. Unforgettable.
