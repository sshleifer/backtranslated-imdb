Me and my girlfriend, by Annette, watched it together, and we both comment. <br /> <br /> And we really enjoyed watching it, even if it took some liberties with the work of Charles Dickens. Many of Dickens works somewhat dark and sad (including Oliver Twist), but this film has changed. It was fun, colorful (both visually and musically), and the characters were more careless <br /> <br /> TRAVIS :. As a rule, I do not care much for music and dance movies, but music in this production were bright and vibrant, and the choreography was strange <br /> <br /> Annette :. It really says a lot coming from Travis. I can not stress how really good dance numbers were. You can say, for example, that these guys really worked hard to get procedures to perfection <br /> <br /> Travis :. Three actors really stood IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed) and slick dodger (Jack Wild). Man, Oliver Reed can really make a good villain. This is one scene where you see his eyes through the mail slot gave me chills on the back ... strange. And this guy, Jack Wild was the perfect Artful Dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when she was killed). She can sing, too! Kudos to the actor's department of their choice there. I hated Oliver Twist small tho. He was too whiny and faint-hearted, for my taste. (I'm wishing Bill Sykes would drop him in the mud during the chase scene.) And they had him sing or <br /> <br /> ANNETTE :. Acting was really excellent. In addition to the three stars Travis mentioned, I felt Ron Moody (Fezhin) did a great job. He was so funny, and at the same time slightly sinister, too. Supporting actors were great. Harry Secombe very well carried him Mr. Bumble role. And he has a beautiful voice. I saw Mr. Secombe act in another film called "Dev", where he played an opera singer with pleasant results. Talented Harry Secombe was in a lot more movies <br /> <br /> Travis :. As I have already said, the story is not quite accurate for a book, but IMO it was more durable. This film was not boring, or, as some seem to musicals. And continuously made you move to the right along with the characters. Melodies do not detract from the story or put you to sleep too long <br /> <br /> ANNETTE :. Any music video, which completely Travis hours should be a rare find. And this is one rare find indeed. It is very easy to watch a production that brings the viewer smoothly and pleasantly to the end. On that day, when all the films seem effects, combined with beautiful faces, it was a refreshing interlude. <br /> <br /> Our combined rating of 8.5 is 10. (We round up to 9 in this case.) <br /> <br /> TRAVIS :. I rated this 7 mainly because Oliver Twist child (Mark L.) annoyed me, and his song was torture my overly sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was an outstanding film <br /> <br /> Annette :. My score is 10. Movies do not get much better than this. And you can tell, everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was ... a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Please do not miss this one ... even if you normally do not like musicals. It really is a rare treat.
