The film was not so great. The book is better. But the film is not so bad. It was interesting to say the least. The site was quite unknown to me, to keep watch, even though I would not say I was really interested in the film. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr. are both quite magnificent to keep you watching :) They have some lovely scenes that must turn to romance. Overall I would give the film 7 or 8. It was not bad, just a little short story wise.
