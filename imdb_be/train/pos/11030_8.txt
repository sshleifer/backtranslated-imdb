Watching climber makes me nostalgic for the early '90s, a time when virtually every new action film could be described as "Die Hard in / with." Cliffhanger is «Die Hard on the mountain", and very well, because it is. <br /> <br /> But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege, which are worthy hardy clones on their own terms, with an attached climber doses feeling of many militants and includes breathtaking scenery, which in its immensity They threaten to overwhelm and humiliate the conflicts of people who are fighting and dying among the peaks. <br /> <br /> A few years earlier than other films like A Simple Plan and Fargo dramatized crime and on snowy locations murder Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin recognized visual impact by comparing the brutal violence and a grim struggle for survival against the cold and indifferent nature . <br /> <br /> opening sequence has already received considerable praise, all of which he deserves: it allows you to forget the intensity of the artificial camera and actors and just believe what we are seeing is actually happening. even Harlin shot falling stuffed animal, powerfully effective, but still threatens to become too much of a joke (and which he repeated in the Deep Blue Sea), or a funny expression on his face Ralph Waite, can darken the sequence of power. <br /> <br /> the next impressive set-side is a gunfight and theft on board the aircraft. As written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin, the audience immersed in the action initially not knowing which agents are involved in the theft, and which are not: the bloody double cross unexpectedly. As noted by Roger Ebert, a stuntman who made the transfer in mid-air between the planes deserves special recognition. <br /> <br /> Later, during an avalanche sequence is one of the terrorists / thieves who will actually fall as snow wall carries him down the mountain. As far as I know, no one was killed in the making of this film (a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some of the tricks), so obviously fictitious used for a shot. But the shot is impressive, because we are left wondering how Harlin (or more likely, one of the second unit directors) knew exactly where to put the camera. <br /> <br /> I'll take Sly Stallone is my action hero any day of the week, because it is one of the few movie stars I've ever seen, who are absolutely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain and at the same time, really feel the pain. The role of Gabe Walker really complements existing power Stallone: ​​it plays an older, more vulnerable species action hero, giving a clear low-key performance as a mountain rescuer, who must redeem himself <br /> <br /> In contrast. Many of today's post-Matrix, comic inspired action hero, Stallone Walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without a paranormal or high capacity computer. In Cliffhanger, the hero nearly freezes to death, and his clothes are starting to show more tears when he barely escaped a dangerous situation after another. He shudders when he hit and bleed when he is cut, especially in the cavern sequence when he takes Rocky will beat in the style of one of the villains crazy dog. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that in a very heinous villains really contribute to the effectiveness of the film, when I first saw this film as a teenager, I was rooting for the good guys every step of the way, waiting for the other bad guy will bite the dust ( or, more precisely, ice); at one point I actually cheered as one of the most low-key characters in the film deservedly suffered a violent death. <br /> <br /> The British accent is unconvincing Lithgow, from time to time a model airplane or helicopter models of the film, but it is fundamentally a good actor, and one of the few who can read perfectly silly dialogue: in one scene, looking on their hostages Stallone and Rucker, trying to decide which tasks to give them, in fact, he says: "you, you stay here, bring it! "Even the best actor like Anthony Hopkins may have had problems with this line. <br /> <br /> Even if Cliffhanger sometimes throws up confidence in the side, it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show. <Br /> <br /> at the beginning of the film, for example, Li openly says one of his men. "Pension [Stallone], when it goes down," None of this criminal mastermind would not have made this mistake, even unconsciously, his negligence allows Rucker shout a warning to Sly on a rock and it precipitates a thrilling tug of war between Stallone and the bad guys and who are trying to pull him down a rope tied to his leg. <br /> <br /> Lithgow could give him an order for a more subtle means, but the sequence may not be as much fun to watch, if it were not given an opportunity to openly quit Rucker call the arrogance of her kidnapper. <br /> <br /> Made very much in the style of Saturday matinee serial or (sometimes) a western, rock climber is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that undermined the smaller film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the obvious pain model airplanes mentioned above, the weak points include several scenes shot on indoor sets with cheap really fake snow, as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves, which seem to be unnecessary in the narrative already futuristic. Finally, the decision Harlin to shoot some scenes of death in slow motion seems pointless, because the technician does not contribute anything to the scenes. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Stallone is too old for action movies, because his character in the film seems so reliable that will inevitably wonder what he will be like years later. But maybe that's the best climber stands on its own for all time, without continuing: there is enough of a tired and outdated movie franchise already. Was an unofficial sequel who called himself Vertical Limit: compared with clinker, rock climber rely on Top 250 list <br /> <br /> Rating IMDB in :. 8 (. Very good, especially considering most of the other films Stallone)
