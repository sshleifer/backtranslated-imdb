If you're not in the mood for more than an hour of the film than the film would give you some variation. What I love is the constant surprises. It's not only once that you want one or more of the short film in the "New York I Love You" to be still. So, some of the short films makes you wonder some of them are very short, some of them more, some of them has its specific purposes, some of them not. <br /> <br /> Most of the story presents the sad side of the capital. It shows a lot of different nationality backgrounds. Many of this, to make it feel the same, where I had once gone to the capital and in other countries throughout the year, where it has a lot of people have come from different countries. This film explore the many types of things that you might like to know, but for all the characters, it's a new thing. Maybe some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just to experience something new, to meet new people; feel dreamy, sad, but kind of sad you are looking for, because it's just boring you were in your own home. You can experience it again, watching it.
