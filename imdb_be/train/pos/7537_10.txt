Contrary to what those who hate Christianity, 700 Club gives real answers, and inspiration. It also provides a reliable news, comments and other logical point of view, than what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS thinks best. Unlike other programs that provide social and faith-related comments, those who are 700 Club offers help to those who need it, such as feeding the hungry Blessing operations, providing medical care to people living in poor communities and give hope to those who are in need of hope. It's not exactly hate. If the 700 Club offends you, I suggest taking the remote control and turn on your TV. I do the same thing when I find CNN Headline News or on the issue, the program, which I find offensive or biased. What I find offensive the way that ABC Family inserts a disclaimer that the views of the 700 clubs does not reflect the ABC Family.
