I loved this movie ever since his debut in 1981! I lost, how many times I've seen it! He will never be able to make me laugh and cheer me up when I'm feeling down. Three wire is fantastic and the script is priceless, and you will not get nostalgic hearing songs? I think I am quoting this film without realizing it. I basically know the whole script, so if someone is watching it for the first time I have constrained to say something about how ridiculous the next line. I can not even narrow it down, though, the character of Sir John, probably gets the most memorable of them. The famous "I'll alert the media" when Arthur expresses its intention to take a bath is still invaluable, but the list really is endless. Scenes on Arthur soon to be groom's father's house is a cry, in particular, its interaction with the elk. Do yourself a favor and see this movie!
