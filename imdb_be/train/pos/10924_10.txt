I saw this movie kung fu when I was a kid, and I thought it was so cool! Now I'm 26 years old and my boyfriend is on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We got a case of jam, and watched this classic! He has lost none of its original kung fu cool! If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movie, a must see ... DVD-available. I believe that this film is also called «Pick Your Poison». <br /> <br /> Look for it soon!
