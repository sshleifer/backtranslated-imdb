This movie is a lot of fun. The actors really make the movie go the distance though. Without revealing the plot, I would describe it as a new Princess Bride cult, which must withstand the test of time. You can see a whole other side of Robert De Niro in the film! (It is worth the price of admission just for that!) All the elements have on an adventure to romance and comedy is. <br /> <br /> People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did!) Good special effects can be scary for the little ones. A good date movie. Great for some escapism. <br /> <br /> It is worth to A. (I hope he does well at the box office)
