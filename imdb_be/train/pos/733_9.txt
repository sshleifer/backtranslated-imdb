How can you go wrong with an awesome Ramones? What crime, two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the joke about Dennis Leary great musicians who die in fires in the kitchen while useless to live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> The school rock and roll tells the story of a group of disenfranchised children who are struggling against the introduction of their dismal high school. This is a very silly thing, but there is optimism in this regard, that is refreshing (even if they refer to undermining the building). Who knew that it would actually be a problem for students around the world? School of rock 'n' roll is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music has value, and that it can make a difference in the wider society. It is full of children who know the authorities do not have the right answers. Most likely, the rock 'n' roll is the only thing that they can trust. <br /> <br /> But most importantly, it is pure exploitation. <br /> <br /> Take none of it seriously. Just go and have a good time. If it's not something that the secular school life was like in the seventies, it was supposed to be.
