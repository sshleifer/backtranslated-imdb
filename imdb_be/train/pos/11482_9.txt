This film is, in fact, shot on handheld camera actors in it. In a sense, in other respects mockumentary video diary from the killers to account fully in the "Columbine" style attack. Despite the fact that this film does not answer all the important questions that will give you an idea of ​​how easy it was to get away with. Through the film, you have shown how the actors cut illegally shot gun made pipe bombs and came up with a plan of action for the "zero day". Actors (if you can call it that) were brilliant, they obviously learned from there own life, but at no stage did I find them really works (the Tom Cruise must try). The use of video surveillance and 911 operator in the end was a genius, but I'm not sure if we needed the very last scene. Overall though a really good movie on a very tough subject.
