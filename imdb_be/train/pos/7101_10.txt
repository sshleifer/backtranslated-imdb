Contrary to popular belief, the name, to me, at least not so bad. In fact. I consider it as a favored movie of all time. Welding stories was not built very well, when you consider the differences between the series, however, despite all this, you can look it up completely happy. For the film of its day, the scene is well built and remain symbols consistently believable. <br /> <br /> The sound / audio track is a personal favorite of mine. Almost all of my right sound effect, and many of the voices of characters costumes are much better than they are now badly cast overwrite US colleague. Perfect synchronization in each frame. I had a few problems with the casting for the "foreign" voices (please excuse the crude name, it's been a while since I've seen it). Otherwise, however, the cast seemed to be perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in heroes of this film. Dubs is often the subject I rarely agree with from so long ago. I loved the OSD by then, but the casting often allows the series down. <br /> <br /> At this point, I would like to add that it was one of the first anime I've seen in my life. It has a historical significance for me, but even after seeing the original MEGAZONE 23, he remained strong and looked in my collection. <br /> <br /> As far as I know the name has only ever made it to the United States in Texas. Personally, I think it's a great shame. If the correct audience was the subject of it, I think, the Robotech movie would be accepted and not tarnished for years. I have been to Anime every day of my life, and all I showed this film thought that it was beautiful to collect the title. <br /> <br /> Watching the film after its individual components will allow the viewer to notice the obvious plot holes between shows. However, without seeing the original audience would have noticed. Since the animation is the same style, there was no reason to doubt it back in the day. In the UK was very limited access to the anime. Laser discs were the most productive media. Personally, I like the way Charles had the balls to at least push the genre. I'm going to Harmony does not mean to put up the money for this series to get publicity. <br /> <br /> Despite a few nagging bugs people have with this movie, eighties feel to it keeps me in love. If you look MEGAZONE 23 Now his original Japanese audio dubbing or new, I believe you will be sorely disappointed OSD. Cast mentally to the original soundtrack Bubblegum Crisis Dub imagine new eighties audio E.V.E. <br /> <br /> Speaking of all this. The popularity of this film is now likely down to its rarity in the open market. Personally, he has created a collection for me. I'll scour the world the goods of the three components that have done this, and if I ever meet with Carl Macek, bad shake hands with him for the efforts and buy him a pint or a box for me in the anime.
