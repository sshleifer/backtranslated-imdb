Being an otaku with Robotech times, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite anime of all time. Whereas, when it was made, high quality animation. There are no loops and sequences in which art is reduced in quality. Although the latest episode in black and white, it does not detract from the pleasure of watching a movie. Despite what has been described as "juicy" should be kept in mind that women do not react in the same way that men do. Since the main female character, it should be obvious that it does not necessarily refer to the "macho" play in order to win the respect of his colleagues. Seiryuu for Noricum, by the way, also played in the ruler Rummy 1/2. Norik as 3-dimensional cartoon may receive; Her face reflects the essence of the energetic girl who seems, at first glance, quite helpless, but in the end managed by the power of his will. The only complaint I have is that the mechanical looked somewhat like a teddy bear. Even Gunbuster uses a fairly dubious «Homing Laser» and «Buster Shield» (which is nothing more than to have a car wrapped around a giant velvety cloak themselves in the true style of Dracula) technology. I doubt that the scene was supposed to be funny, but it cracked me. But overall, I would rank the Gunbuster 20 best anime of all time.
