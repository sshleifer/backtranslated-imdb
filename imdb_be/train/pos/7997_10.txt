This is definitely one of the best films made and did not leave me disappointed at all. Soundtrack with finely handcrafted camera shot was exquisite. Always chances movie will not keep those belief, as well as others, but I felt that the rhythm of this time and it was excellent. Dakota Fanning is fast becoming a staple in the film, which require the child to the old soul of the person, and it never disappointed me with their talent. As for Mr. Washington and, of course, Christopher Walken they both exceed the challenge that shows the darkest side of humanity trying to move toward the light.
