I just watched the first series on DVD, but I would like to summarize Soprano Shakespearean plot with Tarantino as a script. Series as well as Goodfellas and Casino, and is almost as good as The Godfather (it does not "10"), and is much better than all the efforts of Guy Ritchie. Despite the fact that there is a lot of action, some of them are pretty bloody, history nature of the initiative. Even some of the secondary characters contribute great storylines; for example a priest relationship (or lack thereof) with Carmilla restaurateur and his wife, and Christopher and his idiot friend (which is not very long (and Darwin Award nominees?)) <br /> <br /> In addition to the plot, script and acting, other reasons I liked it; <br /> <br /> 1. It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with sauce tomatoey. 2. Music. 3. This shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.
