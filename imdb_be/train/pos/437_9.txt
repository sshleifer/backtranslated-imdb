Enchanted April appears the symphonic poem, impressionist painting, a masterpiece to send a message with a few words. He was one of my 10 favorite movies, so he left. I continue to wait, though less patiently, because the film will be released in DVD format. Perhaps I am not alone. <br /> <br /> If Amazon parent company's results are correct, there are many people who want this title on DVD. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of the film in their libraries. Throw spectacular, cinematography and direction perfectly. The film is definitely a keeper. Many of them have already been asked. Please add our names to the list.
