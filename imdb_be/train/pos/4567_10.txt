My left leg is an outstanding epic film explaining the life and times of Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy, severe disability and only the use of his left leg, but he was cocky, he was able to become an artist and a writer against all odds <br /> <br /> I seen this movie many times, and every time I see it, I believe it is equally brilliantly every time.I wonder how this amazing film to win for best picture Oscer this massacre Academy awards. Jim Shirdan for me one of the greatest directors in the world.The script, music and everything else is perfect in this film. As the film goes on, you almost feel like your in a brown household all occurs.Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker strange as Cristies parents and Fiona Shaw is equally brilliant as Dr. Eileen Cole, who helps Christy on his fights disobedience. <, Br /> <br /> Irish film industry noted a number of his name before my left foot.My left foot was the beginning of a wonderful period in the Irish film. movies are so powerful and vivid, such as a field, weeping games, in the name of his father and Michael Collins followed has left foot.these Irish films have been regarded so highly in the world and was nominated for several Oscers and won some miraculous period for the Irish film.My left leg is a powerful outstanding film. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis plays a crippled Christy Brown as good and excellent, and the same goes for Hugh O Conner, who plays the young Christy.To me these two appearances, two of the best ever movie productions especially speech Daniel Day-Lewis, who I would consider it as high as Anthony Hopkins in silence of the lambs. Daniel Day-Lewis proved in his career that he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> This beautiful masterpiece in the cinema to see it!
