Peter Falk is a diverse and experienced actor. The film is well written and the acting seems real life. For all lovers of Columbo is a great piece of work. Because it shows that the talent of Peter Falk is. He does not play the detective he plays a retired salesman of carpets. By the time the credits start to role, you already want to watch it again. An interesting part of the film is that the message will be applied to each person who watches it; the depth of its relevance would be the only thing that changes. It's a shame that liberals in Hollywood only contribute to the brain and skin, because it is a type of film that people should be proud of in the business. It will be a great movie to become a living stage of the game.
