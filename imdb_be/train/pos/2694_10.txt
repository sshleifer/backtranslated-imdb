Garde à Vue has to be seen several times in order to understand the sub-sections which it contains. If you are not used to verbalize French film based on the conversation and the battle of wits, not the actions, not even trying to watch it. You will receive only the longing to death, and reassured the opinion that French films are not for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is verbose film, in fact, based on dialogues (written by Audiard, by the way), and again cut the curtain of appearances. <br /> <br /> Why maestro Martin (Serrault) prefer to be excessively charged to be a child killer, and not tell the truth? Because at the time of the murder, he was 18 years old girl, with whom he has an 8-year sexual relationship. His wife knows that she is jealous of him, and he prefers to be performed (in 1980 in France, there was still the death penalty), but without revealing the only "pure and innocent" aspect of his miserable life.
