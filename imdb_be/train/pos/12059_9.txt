I love ghost stories in general, but I especially love the cold, atmospheric and elegantly terrible British ghost stories style period. This one qualifies on all counts. A naive young lawyer ( "lawyer" in Britspeak) is sent to a small village near the sea to settle an old estate of the deceased woman. It's 1920, a time when many middle-class Britons go on holiday to the sea for the "health". Well, I think that there is nothing "healthy" on the village Crythin Gifford, horrible clunky website elderly women, brooding Victorian manor, located on the outskirts of the mist, wrapped in salt marshes. If the lawyer saves the life of a little girl (none of the locals would not help endangered full - you'll learn why later in the film), he unwittingly takes on the evil spirit of anger, the woman in black. She did not membranous, translucent ghost, but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil. The viewer only sees it several times, but you feel its evil presence in every frame. As the camera creeps to a lawyer when he reads through legal documents, you expect to see a woman in black at any time. If a lawyer comes into the strait generator to turn on the electricity to the terrible old house, the camera creeps to it, and you think that it pops up there too. In anticipation of Women in Black to show this nail bitingly suspenseful. We have already seen many of the elements of this story before (in a locked room that no one enters the fog, naive outsider who ignores the warnings of local residents), but the director somehow manages to combine them all in a completely new sounding and convincing ghost story. Be careful with a friend, so that you can have someone to warm up to grab a woman's waiting time in the black. ,,
