I was totally impressed "Waitress» Shelley Adrienne (2007). This film only confirms what has been seen from this film. Adrienne was an extremely talented writer and director, original and unique artist. She was able to show the suffering of everyday life with absurd humor i this warm optimistic and humanistic tendencies. Eli Sheedy steals this film with a stunning performance as a woman who fell over the edge. Male lead Reg Rogers, looking like Judd Nelson, fine. There is also a large cameo Ben Verina. The song at the end of the film «Bastard Song," written by Adrienne can stand as its optimistic eulogy: <br /> <br /> "This is the world of suffering, <br /> <br /> In the sea of ​​pain, <br /> <br / > no matter how much sun you bring, <br /> <br /> you are a massive rain ... <br /> <br /> Do not let heartless get you down, <br /> <br /> do not greet heartless to your door, <br /> <br /> do not live among the heartless "
