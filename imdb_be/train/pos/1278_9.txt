«The Last Big Thing» is an excellent satirical film that sarcastically whips pop culture to the point of his own humorous desctruction. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh / I sympathize. This brings me to the introduction to the characters I liked better ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a man in his late 30's / early 40's, which creates a pop culture driven editorial magazine called «The Next Big Thing». The fact is, this magazine does not really exist, and it's just an excuse to get close with the actors Simon interrogating them, just bitch-slap them silly, insulting their purchase path in pop culture. His live in girlfriend, Darla, also writes the magazine (which is real), which mainly deals with her and Simon, as well as her and her father. Darrell is a truly loving (or loathable) character, depending on how you view it muffled neurotic behavior. Magda prostitute character I liked best. Brent is a flat character from not much to him as it Tedra, music, video Queen bunch of B-rated rock bands. However, these characters weave together a very interesting website. And this film all the questions the motivations that people for what they do and why they do it. His great movie, and I invite you to see if you are in the indie / arthouse crowd. Mark my words! <br /> <br />
