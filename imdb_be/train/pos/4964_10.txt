I really love this show! I've always loved the show in 1990 on the space of the Spirit! This show was fun, and I can not believe why Adult Swim Cartoon Network would take such amusing show like this on the air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. Shaw Marriage (from the Space Ghost cartoons, SGCC and Cartoon Planet), who lives his life every day with his mom and dad and his best friend, who loves to look a lot, Zorak! My favorite episodes was the one where Zorak get it really good singing voice, and then his voice does not give him the money that Zorak did sing at all. Another episode I like the one where marriage and Zorak not done their homework, and then they come back from Sunday to Friday, and they're just goofing off, and then they return to the day of homework have been invented, and then, when they return to the real home the job does not exist! Another episode I like the one where Dad Brak and their neighbor, Thundercleese robot continues to receive this agrument, and then they are eaten by a giant worm. Another episode I liked was the one where Zorak does stand a bully, and then some new guy took over his position. I also love many other episodes! One thing that never fails to make me laugh when Zorak getting beaten up, blown up and all-powerful!
