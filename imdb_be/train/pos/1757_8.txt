The key to the 40-Year-Old Virgin is not only the fact that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, and the manner in which Steve Carell presents it as a single entity. In the genre of rough "comedy", which was a typical example of his lack of humor and engaging characters, 40-Year-Old Virgin offers colorful and intelligent, heartfelt script, which does not use his character as the butt of cruel jokes. This is Andy's still a virgin is not so much a joke in forty years, in fact, as a curiosity. <br /> <br /> Karel veteran Ferrell in Anchorman team and ex-Daily Show castmember, uses the concept of the film to expand your character ?? we get to understand why Andy, as he is. It's the little things that make this film work. If Andy employee at an electronics store asks him what he has done for the weekend, Andy describes his unsuccessful efforts at cooking. If Andy rides a bicycle to work, he signals his turns. He does not just decorate your house with figurines ?? He paints them and talking to them, and shows that some of the really old belonged to him since childhood. At comedy did not even bother to focus on these things. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simplistic ?? naparnitsa shortstop Andy know that he was never a sex and they make it a personal quest to them to get him in bed with a woman. It's child's idea and the film makes no attempt to hide his youth <br /> <br /> Friends of Andy are in addition to his neurotic character :. David (Paul Rudd) broke up with his girlfriend of more than two years ago, but still obsessed with it, Jay (Romany Malco) is a philandering womanizer and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattoo sexaholic. Their attempt at getting Andy to respond bag many times, and every time out Andy feels less and less optimistic. <br /> <br /> Finally, Andy meets a single mother Trichet (played by Catherine Keener) and, much to the chagrin of his anxious friends, who claim that the mother is not necessary, he falls in love with her. They begin a relationship and agree to postpone sex for twenty days ?? Trichet did not know that Andy is still a virgin. <br /> <br /> 40-Year-Old Virgin director Judd Apatow, the man who made Anchorman and cablemen, and began a short cult TV show Freaks and Geeks. Apatow is known for his unique sense of humor, and the script ?? co Karel ?? It offers a lot. <br /> <br /> However, in the end, the most interesting and (really weird) aspect of The 40-Year-Old Virgin is its permanence. By now you're probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from critics, and even I was surprised by the warm reception. But after watching the film, it is easy to see why. We like Andy. We take care of it. He's not just some kind of a cardboard cutout sex comedy cliches ?? he is a real, living, breathing people. His neurotic traits combine the best of Woody Allen with childish naivete. His friends were not unpleasant jerks and his novel rapid and slides. It strikes a chord with the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this is not a perfect movie, and, of course, contains some rather crude sexual humor and innuendo, it does not offend in the extent that the other elements of the genre, perhaps because that we have an attachment to the people on the screen. The best sex comedy work this way ?? from risky business at American Pie ?? and this is the main difference between something like 40-Year-Old Virgin and 40 days and 40 nights.
