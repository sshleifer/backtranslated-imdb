One reviewer said that, it seems, no matter what actually Wells says or does, it moves you. I agree. He was and remains a unique force in the film. More than a triple threat who could act, write and direct, he was a genius uniquely suited to the film. It is possible to consider, at an early age, he would be an artist. This film certainly reinforces this impression. A musician, an actor of the theater, Shakespeare's heir? It's hard to say, but I am very grateful that his time cam with the film and he had captured on film. I like the accent. I like the face, size, style, and mind games. I love all his movies, and wish there were more. I especially love how other actors interacted with him in the movie. Many have never been better, or at least something different with him, because he was of the firm there. Even toward the end, when its beauty was destroyed, possibly by his own intentions, it was impossible to ignore, and he made every scene he was in Rita was a gorgeous blonde. - Lana Turner look alike, but perhaps even more beautiful, and even then the eye is Wells and one wants another minute, another film, another hour in his company. That's why we all wish we could come to the lost scraps cut from his films, because we know, we all know that is not part of it are not worthy of our time. Watch it and be grateful for the chance.
