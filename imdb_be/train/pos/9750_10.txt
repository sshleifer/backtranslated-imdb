So, George, it's feel good movie. A little romance, great music, beautiful scenery, comedy, (great food fight), and a little Bittersweet taste are the ingredients So, George. Any movie lover will enjoy this film. Those who require a massive special effects, you should look elsewhere. Most of us need a little get away now and then, and how better to do this than with a feast for the eyes, ears and heart? You must see!
