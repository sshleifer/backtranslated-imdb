This film was very enjoyable, although you only like it if: - you hate going to the dentist, but are not afraid of the movie, where one of them goes beserk - do you love horror movies <br /> <br /> I especially liked the fact that some attention has been paid to clarifying the rough actions of the protagonist. The fact that he completely get clarity (especially in the mouth), and then catches his wife, who provides some oral pleasure to a man covered with mud-pool is quite plausible reason to go overboard. <br /> <br /> liked, I give it an 8.
