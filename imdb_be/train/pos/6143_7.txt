I do not consider this film in 1971 and was very entertained by this great product created by Walt Disney Studios, and great animation creations. Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price) played a prominent role of women, who took a course in witchcraft and was a student who began to fly on a broom and fly was a lot of difficulties. Rosehip found a lot of tricks and was able to make the bed a trip to various parts of the world. However Eglantine missed her final exams to become an accomplished witch. Mr. Emerlius Brown (David Tomlinson) was a man who sold Rosehip this course in witchcraft, and he tries to help her in every possible way to find a solution. Rosehip has a purpose of its madness, and that is to stop the Nazis from evading England. Great family entertainment, and we need more movies like this today.
