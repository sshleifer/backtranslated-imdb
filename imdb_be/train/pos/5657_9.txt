I remember watching American Gothic, when it first went on the air, it occurred to me lately, all I could remember was the same guy appeared in Midnight Caller, Gary Cole, I do not watch much TV, but I watched American Gothic, I purchased the full series on DVD this week, and it's still as good as before, it is one of the best series in history, so I do not watch a lot of TV, because it's just garbage, which is included for Derren Brown, except it's all Reality TV or soaps, such as lubricants, Big Brother, etc. I dakuchyv with this, I got a full series American Gothic for 16.97 Â£ form Asda website, this is the cheapest I can find it.
