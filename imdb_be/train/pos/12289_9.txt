First of all, I would like to note that I have not read the book, so there was no chance I would be disappointed in that aspect. The main drawback I noticed was a historical piece, with multiple cars, trains, clothing, etc. I think, don owned at the time. <br /> <br /> *** Perhaps spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> technical aspect of the film is not in order, do not boast about anything. But the actions, I think it was terrific. I have no experience in action, I still can not believe how people can consider it terribly! Maybe they saw only two films (one day) and the other was very good indeed! <br /> <br /> I especially loved Jeremy Irons, and really knew his character, someone crept up the social ladder to the very hard work, and then fight with those who will take the job of his life from him, but he gets so involved in this fight, he does not understand the reasons for no longer on his side, and he ends up routed, disappointed. Irons made it so believable, I sympathize with the character, despite his cruelty. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder as well as a romantic young women who are involved in the revolutionary ideals of his boyfriend (Banderas he had underdeveloped part, I think), and Glenn Close was also very good . Meryl Streep has an average performance, it was not bad, just not up to the standards of other subjects. Watch for Miguel Guillermo, a great Portuguese actor, between so many stars. <br /> <br /> In contrast to modern films, there is only interpretation, only the people matter, but at the same time, it is not pretensious film too worried about trying to be an intellectual. The best proof that I really liked, I write a review after 7 years.
