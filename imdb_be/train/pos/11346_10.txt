I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and regularly talented Jack Wild and now my daughter Jack adoring fans Wild too. This film is exactly what films should be: fun and interesting. This film is not limited to any children. A lot of the dialogue is aimed at adults and Witchiepoo performance is that you do not want to miss. The music in this film is suitable Jack Wild and Mama Cass beautiful. And as Jack Wild fan, I would never miss the chance to see him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the hard life that Jack is doing this film even more remarkable, especially when he sings the opening of «If I Could». This leads me to make a pause in adoration of love to him for the wonderful memories of childhood provided to me, I now turn to my children. Let's go to the islands of life where there is friendship and fun! And to keep the memory alive Jack Wild, passing Pufnstuff others.
