This, obviously, the second remake of the film, being filmed previously in 1911 and 1918. And in many ways it reminds me of the later film Yankee in Oxford. Both films are vain blow-hard, which comes in one of the best schools in the world, and how, ultimately, to show a blow-hard slowly learn to work in a team and decency. In this film, William Haines was "Tom Brown" and his main rival, "Bob" plays Francis X. Bushman. And, in a supporting role Jack Pickford - always remember, brother of Mary. Of these three Pickford comes off best as a sympathetic loser who becomes a friend of Tom - he actually has some decent scenes, and dramatic moment just before the big game! All standard clich√©s and have the film because it was done so many times and so offers few surprises. . Nevertheless, it is a pleasant and enjoyable film viewing <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the best silent film in college, try Freshman Harold Lloyd - this is a football scene opened more fun and Harold are much more attractive and responsive than annoying Tom Brown. Freshman, probably the best college you can find a picture of the era. Another reason why BROWN Harvard is smaller picture that William Haines again and again and again (e.g., a smart and WESTPOINT-SET, among others) played basically the same unpleasant and lofty character with the same storyline - and if you "saw one of these movies, you've seen them all. Well done, but certainly not original! And, because it is just a rehash of his other films, who gives the film a score of 10 is strongly recommended that these other films. <br /> <br /> 4/25 / 08 == I just checked it and saw this short film was the highest rated movie on IMDb 1920 !! We are talking about over-rated! There are dozens and dozens of the best films - like the film to be # 1, you can only guess.
