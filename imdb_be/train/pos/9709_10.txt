I clicked on the first LOG accident one night when washing TV: since I never missed an episode <br /> <br /> This is a very strange sense of humor, something between a social commentary brass eye, Quick show perfectly. one-liners and an amazing story, which seems to be developing every week, never go anywhere. The best example of this was a special material Hilary Briss in - what was that all about <br /> <br /> humor will not appeal to all ?. Some would say that it's just too bad, and it's easy to see where they come. However, give it a try. If you do not like it, do not look, but if you like what you'll be very glad you took my advice.
