For a long time it seemed that all the good Canadian actors headed south of the border, and (I'm guessing), all second grade are filled with the upper slots and left waste for sex comedies. <br /> <br /> This film was a real surprise: in spite of the amazing stories that are typical of a farce, the actors seemed to be trying to put something in their nature and the fact that we, the audience, got back was almost true suspension of belief . If the extras from video attacked the police evict you almost believe that this is possible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of some of the best sex farces (Canadian or otherwise), you should definitely seek this out. And the big surprise, the sex farce is also loaded with some very good naked.
