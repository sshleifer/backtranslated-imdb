This is a very funny movie! I have no idea whether this translates well into other languages ​​or not. Nevertheless, I think that people all over the world can identify with «Frank» and his thoughts to some degree! These thoughts are very interesting and the women will also enjoy this film, I'm sure! <br /> <br /> All the actors worked well, and this film could have been a huge hit all over the world, when it was made in England or the United States. But for those of you who are lucky enough to understand, Swedish, you are in for a treat! <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended.
