Paul Lucas played the Russian intelligentsia, making his living as a waiter in a <br /> <br /> «Grand Slam» director Dieterle (1933). It's surprisingly funny satire creation celebrity. The waiter and the restaurant cloakroom Russian plays Loretta Young began to love America as partners of the bridge, which does not cause a quarrel. With the help of journalist and writer ghost «Speed» McCann (wonderfully calm Frank McHugh), they began to go advertising <br /> <br /> for "Stanislavsky system", "system" of trading independently feels like <br /> <br /> (as the bids are not rational, there is no reason to reproach about their stupidity). <br /> <br /> fight displaced bridge guru Cedric Van Dorn (sounds close to Goren, no? I suspect that the choice of a character name "Stanislavsky," was also a slam on the other type of system), bloated charlatan played very well, Ferdinand Gottschalk, broadcast on radio stations across the United States as a prize-fight by Roscoe Karns (another big fast-talking comedian calm 1930). <br /> <br /> Bridge players even roped area, although the audience <br /> <br /> over them, unlike in boxing "ring". <br /> <br /> a wide variety of types of American comedy ahead of Preston Sturges, although for the manufacture of a celebrity, "Grand Slam" most calls to mind two of the best movies of the same (in the code) era with Lee Tracy to play fast-talking < br /> <br /> publicists: «the Half-Naked Truth" and "bomb", but the "Grand Slam" has its <br /> <br /> moments, especially for those who played bridge with serious point <br /> <br /> counters. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young was already a clothes horse. (For me, her face seems a bit long <br /> <br /> and the horse too. The concept of a particular era of beauty, I think ...) The film <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all but drops Glenda Farrell, who plays forgetful <br /> <br /> friend Maka.
