Clean family oriented movie. I laughed, I cried ... I loved it. I was worried I would not be able to see Steve Carell as anything but stupid Michael out of the office. Boy, I was wrong. It should win an Oscar for his work. I will definitely buy it on DVD, when it comes out. My husband enjoyed it and he's not in the movie of the "type". I saw it with 2 other couples in the 30-year-old range, and we all agreed it was the best film we've seen for a long time and, of course, clean. Only one curse word! I do not know why it was PG13. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, drama, romance, and much more!
