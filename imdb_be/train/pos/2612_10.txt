This is a film that was very well done. I've heard mixed reviews while he was waiting in the production and its release! Greetings to the director and all the actors. supporting cast gave Mendez that she needs to take it to the top. Like everyone else here said, the last part of the film riveting. Katie Cassidy did an amazing job with his character, as she had not done a lot of work, if the film was made. She has quite a career ahead of her. I was amazed by its performance. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, questioned my values ​​and priorities in life, and I am a better person for it! Great communication lies within the film. Release it, so that everyone can enjoy!
