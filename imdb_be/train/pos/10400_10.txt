Probably the best science fiction film ever made. Rich color, spectacular sets, arrhythmia, spot Miklos Rosza score, which is ideal for each scene and mood. Duties excellently, and that would be rigid and pretentious in lesser hands, but there is a poetic dialogue skillfully, sensitively told (the humor is subtle and beautiful as well). <br /> <br /> The undoubted Spielberg and Lucas were delighted with it. Along with «The Four Feathers» (1939), one of the two best movies released Alexander Korda and London Films --- and one of the best movies ever. <br /> <br /> True, compelling classic!
