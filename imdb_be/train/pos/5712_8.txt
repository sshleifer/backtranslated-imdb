This is one big unstoppable cheerful- and technically made the film! <br /> <br /> The film features some of the greatest looking sets you'll ever see "30-film, despite the fact that it is all too obvious that they are sets, not a real place place . Often, when the character will fall or shake jamb too aggressive, the whole set, obviously, would be to move. <br /> <br /> The best moments of the film was silent, more old-fashioned, slapstick kind of moments. This shows that the real heart of Rene Clair was a silent film-making. Overall a really great sense of humor in this film. Also, of course, the musical moments were more than great. This is a very nice light and easy pleasant early French music. Although the best moments of quiet moments, it does not mean that the film is filled with some great humorous dialogue that gets very well made protagonists, who all seemed to be the actors of the scene to me that in this case worked extremely well for a film of its overall style and pleasant atmosphere nya-cares. Not surprisingly, it does not work so well, because this movie is actually based on a play by George Berry. <br /> <br /> This is a technical really great movie, also with excellent innovative camcorder works in it and some really great editing that create some fast going and nice to see nice sequence. There's never a dull moment in this film! <br /> <br /> Ren√© Clair was so clever director who knew how to build and plan the comic moments in films. This is a very creative made a film that, despite its simplicity, yet all the time feel like a completely original and masterfully constructed a film that never seizes to entertain. <br /> <br /> In the last half hour especially memorable fun without spoiling too much, and in fact, among the greatest and most creative moments in the beginning of the comedy film. <br /> <br /> the movie is filled with some really nice characters, which, of course, all very silly and stereotyped and obviously cast because of their appearance. All this adds to the pleasant atmosphere and easy comic wit film. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable movies you'll ever see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
