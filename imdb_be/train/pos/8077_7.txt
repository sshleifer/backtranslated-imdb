The film is made for a modern audience. The masses get to see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and of course the sensual scenes as well. It's not exactly a film that could feel comfortable playing with the entire family. It is not for the eyes of children. I had to fast forward quite a lot of scenes. <br /> <br /> If it's just entertainment you are looking for, then this film has it all. Catchy songs. Generous production, I should add. <br /> <br /> However, the film's message is universal. It focuses on the idea of ​​karma. That is, if you do well, you'll get a good one. And if you do evil, you will receive evil. The fruit of good works well, while the fruit of evil is evil. <br /> <br /> In real life, this is not always true. It is well known that most people do not get justice in this world. While it is true that some evil people meet with a vicious end, there are many of those who fled. And then, there are many people who are doing well, and yet in exchange they meet with a sad ending. <br /> <br /> If you do not care about the message, and all that you want, this escape from mundane reality, this film is an artist in order.
