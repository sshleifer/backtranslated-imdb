I started watching this movie, not expecting anything, just another movie to watch, but from the first twenty minutes, the artwork and the main character, which is mysterious, not to say a lot, in fact I have in this film. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie, it was dark, beautifully acted and very touching. It's a little slow, but the dive was complete. The guide was a strange, letting us know bits bits of history that leads to the conviction of Joe and his life behind bars. The music was very big and very well included in the scene. The ending was unexpected with a twist I did not see coming. This is not the kind of film we see often.
