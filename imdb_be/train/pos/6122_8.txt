this film is absolutely hilarious. In principle, the plot revolves around a serial killer be somehow turned into a snowman after a B-film chemical accident. Then he goes to the city and begins to terrorize the local population. him to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him. its done on a tiny budget, and it certainly shows, but the great thing about this film, he knows that his garbage. improvisation of Styrofoam and polystyrene, imitating the snowman Giants are classic, and it's obviously going to - it is one of the few films that has its own budget as its main selling point. along with comic stickiness, there are some other great comedy moments - listening to right at the beginning of Voice over by Pope scaring their children to death, and the most ridiculous rape scene ever committed to film. fantastic sticky fun
