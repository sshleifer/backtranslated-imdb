They probably might miss some from the very beginning - I do not know why it starts in the Asian part of Turkey. If it was because from the Mediterranean Sea, they could get closer to the start of the modern day Lebanon. <br /> <br /> One of cameras and crews to reach Bakhtyari knee, is the beginning of an amazing 48 day trip. 50,000 people from about 250 thousand goats, camels, cattle, horses, and make it an amazing journey through what seems to be a very fast-moving river Karun. They used rafts, which are kept afloat by inflating goat skins - you can see where the head and legs have been removed. Another "bank" of cancer was very cool - I believe about 60 degrees rise <br /> <br /> Just watching it was incredible, but there was much more .. In order to get to the pasture, they also had to cross the great mountain, which was about 4 feet of snow, if not more. Being able to go up to the mountain was pretty strange in itself, but they (and all animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! So, barefoot. <br /> <br /> One of the drawbacks of this documentary were some of the inter-titles to the poor attempt at humor. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary with the silent era or the incredible difficulties that this nation is not only the face, but also to win. It's just an incredible document little-known group of people who are facing all kinds of problems.
