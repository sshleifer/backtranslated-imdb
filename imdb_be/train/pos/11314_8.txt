Wow! Kind of movie you can watch ten times and still admire its nuances. Absolutely incredible! If it was a debut film Visconti, I shudder to think what would happen if he got better from film to film. The only other one I saw him (as of this writing) is a Death in Venice - which was absolutely incredible: more visually dazzling than Ossessione (Obsession). One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, but his story was not as involving as Ossessione. If you click on the "miscellaneous" on this page of links, there is footage from the film at these sites. They will not really pay tribute to the movie experience: such graceful movements of the camera, such beautiful compositions, such prominent figures such wonderful characters, so much the history of the first film, adapted from James M Cain's "The Postman Always Rings Twice" <br />. <br /> I can not believe it was made in the 43, eight years before Brando was to be introduced in the world of realistic action Streetcar Named desire (1951). Actors in this can not be used in the method of the method, that is, they can not be really I feel it yourself (I did do not know about) -.! but they are one of the best, most current and realistic representations of this date to the movies In addition, eight years ago, A Streetcar Named Desire brought a new sensibility to the screen, Ossessione was electrifyingly sensuous most sensitive, from the very beginning movie! Yes, I want to be superlative, but Ossessione was simply stunning. <br /> <br /> the reason Ossessione causes no influence Trams did what was done in fascist Italy and Mussolini banned and re-cut in the United States. American audiences have not seen the full glory of up to 59, eight years after Trams <br /> <br /> I will not talk about it anymore. - just I write to tell you it is one of the best, most beautiful and exciting movies I've ever seen, and tell you to go out and see it! Like another reviewer, I'm going to buy it as soon as I can find it!
