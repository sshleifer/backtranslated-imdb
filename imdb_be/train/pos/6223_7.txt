With a modern sensibility, it is sometimes difficult to watch old movies. It's frustrating to watch the stereotypical librarian wallflower should remove my glasses and become a beautiful and stupid to beat people. Especially a small and non-human. He's obviously a player (I would not trust him to remain faithful to her), who does not want to settle, who only looks at the dull attractive women and always calls them "child" (ick!). Even after it is completely changing its appearance and life for him, he just goes to her after he (presumably) is rejected by another woman, and learns that Kony had spent all their money renovating the boat with him. I would like it to become at it, rather than pathetic chasing him! His sudden transformation was completely unrealistic for a few minutes, and does not work for me. <br /> <br /> In addition to this scene, I did like the film. As you do not like sailors to dance with each other? (You can tell that they were from San Francisco ....; D) «dress rehearsal» dance was great, watching Ginger Rogers purposefully get in and out of the "right steps" was great. The last dance scene "music person," with beautiful costumes and lots of art deco was beautiful. And I really liked it, "We saw the sea" (although they use it a few too many times, as if they understood that it was their best song). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot was a bit weak, like most musicals (IMO) - and the songs were okay, but dance is worth watching the movie on. I wish they could have shown some shots from San Francisco, since it was a movie was supposedly set. <br /> <br /> It is also strange to see such a carefree naval film with the knowledge that Hitler had already done at the same time. I have to try to suspend all knowledge, to immerse yourself in the fantasy land folded.
