Like most movies of Eleanor Powell, this one plays along flimsy plots. For some reason - Oh, this is due! - it has been selected for the transport of magnetic mines to Cuba. Good guys and bad guys are competing for me and who is who gets confusing. But, as always, dancing Powell is an excellent and well worth the price of admission. And in this one Lara plays a cowardly lion, causing the warm memories of Technicolor film 1939 fringe benefit of hearing a young Frank, with that beautiful voice and skinny vulnerabilities, he gave it a wise guy persona later. In addition, a great drummer Buddy Rich, is an excellent time reflects his virtuosity. Look in particular for its unique duo with trumpet man Dorsey, Ziggy Elman. I say 'unique', perhaps out of ignorance, but I do not know of any other shock / tube sequence as on film or recording. This movie is fun. Even stupid person Skelton relatively restrained. Powell once again shows that it is the biggest film dancer ever.
