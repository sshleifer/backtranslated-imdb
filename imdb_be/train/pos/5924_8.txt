Wow! There is one thing I can say about this film. Personally, I'm one of those people who love cats, so it would be great down to the movie, but I loved him like cats bred with each their revenge in the end. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, but I have to admit that it was, because I found Brian Krause, who played Charles Brady very very exciting, I think, the lust got the better of me while watching this film. <br /> <br /> There was one thing I was disappointed. I watched Charmed before and Brian Krause is married Holly Marie Combs, his kiss scene was Suitable Sleepwalkers, but very poorly compared to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I do not know if this is because Krause and crests have great chemistry or maybe more, it is a little bit more, it was the only disappointment in the movie, but I think it was made for Brian Krause in those tight ass jeans he was wearing in the film. <br /> <br /> If you want to use to see Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs heavenly husband and her father of your son, the big surprise with this film, it was nothing like this corner boy. Although now that I think about it, it would be great to see the character on Krause Charmed does evil makes it something like it was in the Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that the music was GREAT in this movie too!
