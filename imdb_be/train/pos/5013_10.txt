Barbra singing standards from room to room, full of musicians, including a segment where it is a little girl again, everything ends fine version of her signature song, (while) ... "People". <br /> <br /> ACT II .... musical tour Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra sings songs..it poverty is better than it sounds ... <br /> <br /> ACT III. .... the best part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some great songs like ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again", & A "Funny Girl" medley .... <br /> <br /> in general, most of the history of television, made by one of the greatest performers in the world!
