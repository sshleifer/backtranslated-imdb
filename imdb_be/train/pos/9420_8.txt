The man in the white suit is one of the finest comedies that Ealing studies done so well in the '40s and' 50s. The plot of this one is a man who invents a fabric or stained, no breaks. Of course, this is a major breakthrough in the world of textiles. However, all is not as easy as it would threaten the fabric of life of many people, including fabric manufacturers, labor woolen mill, and even old women, making it the laundry every week. The man in the white suit a film about scientific achievements, and so that they do not always help; the old woman says at one point in the film, "Why cant you just leave things the scientists alone?Â» <br /> <br /> How much of Ealing comedies, this one star Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness fantastic actor; He has the ability to light up the screen of his presence (and he does in this film, in the literal sense), but he also managed to reflect their hero down to earth and believable way. He fittingly awful in this film, and it captures just the right atmosphere for his character; smart and ambitious, but a bit naive scientist. Along with Guinness, man in a white suit also features Joan Greenwood, deep voiced actress who co-starred with Guinness in just magically "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, a man who would go on to get itself the role of Alfred in the Batman movie. Action in the film is not always great, but it is always decent, and it fits into the film. <br /> <br /> The man in the white suit is an intelligent, thinking and witty comedy with a moral. Comedy is not always obvious, and it does not always work, but the film did not mean that the film, which causes belly laughs, so it's forgivable. I recommend this film, mainly for anyone who is a supporter of the film.
