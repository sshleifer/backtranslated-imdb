I continue to watch this movie over and over and over again. I have to watch it at least once a week. I am from Africa and look at this film taught me something I did not even know about Africa. Denzil movies are all full of lessons for people of walks of life. I wish he was my own brother. In addition, I have seen and love the Masai Mississippi. Which is concerned about the situation. When Denzel was trying to catch his brother at work, he reminds me of a teenager, when my brother was always crazy to me about me busy all the time. My brother was always looking after my old father, and he wants to see me the same way too. By the way, where is Denzel get with African accent in the film Cry Freedom? I first saw this film in Africa, and I did not know at the time that Denzel was an American until I moved here.
