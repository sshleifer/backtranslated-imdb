This is another control it-like-it-is, Madhur Bhandarkar film. I do not know why he has this obsession to show Child moth *** ion and g * concepts to the Indian film audience, but I find some of these scenes is really disgusting! What is new? This is a good piece to put together Bhandarkar, where it shows the history of the entertainment reporter played the leading lady in the famous film, Mr. and Mrs. Iyer. What makes this movie different, that it also covers the history of the people that it interacts with the reporter or with friends, for example, her roomies, colleagues, movie stars, models, and other rich features in the Entertainment page number 3. her newspaper <br /> <br /> A notable: it's another good performance from Mrs. Iyer. She probably noticed on this role. It makes selective role, but the light in them. It significantly de-hidden and less beautiful in this film. But then, entertainment reporters should not overshadow the people they cover, is not it? Verdict: Madhur came up with another good film that brings the social problems in the focus of attention is very beautiful. Nevertheless, the film loses focus, and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> He is trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people? or he is trying to show us life entertainment reporter and contrast that with real life crime reporter? He's trying to tell us how the government and the rich control the media? or he tries to illustrate the problem with child abuse and g * the people. Other concepts were born include an unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with the directors and co-stars if they want to get into Bollywood. <br /> <br /> In addition, he speaks about how the flight assistants are tired of their work after a while and turn to extreme measures by marrying a lot of elderly people, etc. He also talks about poor women and spoiled children of rich families. <br /> <br /> it was good for me .. but it may be too complicated for the average movie-goer, who just wants to relieve stress from daily work
