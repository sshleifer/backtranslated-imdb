Girlfight, like cooking your grandmother's food: the same old recipe you've tried a million times before, but somehow turns into something fresh and new. Try to explain the history of people who have never seen it before: the young woman from the wrong side of the tracks trying to improve their situation, taking boxing while dealing with a bitter, obstructive father and her growing attraction to a male opponent, Watch them roll their eyes at lines clich√©s, and they are right: it * is * a template. Nevertheless, I was mesmerized by how the film works well because of the often excellent operation and dialogue and tangible direction, which makes it "new". I avoided it in the movie, because it looked like shit, but does not make the same mistake I did. Definiately worth seeing.
