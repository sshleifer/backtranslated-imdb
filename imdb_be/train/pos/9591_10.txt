Excellent documentry. I personally remember that growing up in New York in the early 80s. This film is for those who were not around during this time period.This shows one African American Gay Underclass felt it was only them, but the love and camadrie you see is real. People are real and unfortunately few of them are still alive, as it is written. The balls are still held, but not to the extent that they were in the nineteen eighties. This time is gone forever. This is a good pre "homo thug" movie. If Queens were very proud to be extroverts. Goodbye Storyville is another era is gone, but the whole city is much documented film!
