I do not know whether to recommend this film to "Tetsuo" fans or not. Why the "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily point out some things about this film as a very obvious "Tetsuo" rip-off - off. The concept is similar to editing the same frantic and fast. - it's good, because, apart from making the film more dynamic, it hides some of the shortcomings caused by the low-budget and other factors <br /> <br /> There are a lot more gore less eroticism and, in the case of «Meatball Machine", the transformation of human in essence, that it is partially machine (sound familiar?), entitled «Necroborg» (very original) caused little slimy aliens. <br /> <br /> These slippery small scale of the space actually used by man as a vessel for its gladiatorial games, they play with each other. They clog up the body, somehow manages to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it, that pull them, seemingly out of nowhere, and turn it into a killing machine that targets other Necroborgs. Their goal is to defeat the other foreigner who is in another Necroborg, rip it from the corpse and eat it. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot sounds a little silly, and I was not expecting much, but in the end I really enjoyed this film. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a low-budget film, but it is still relatively decent. Do not expect much from the actors, they are mostly not very good, but it can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere and gore, some strange situations, and as a film directed and edited. Although the story is not very original, it has a certain charm. - for me, at least <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
