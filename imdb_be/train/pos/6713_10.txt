I liked that the TV show, because it was his own thing a girl who is on her sixteenth birthday discovers that she is a witch and her, she lives with her aunt in the house, and they're both witches as well. Well, it took her about a few weeks of getting used to. When she used her power for the first time it was so funny, because it turned an enemy into a pineapple. She had to turn back the clock and repeat daily. This series is really cool, and it is a typical teen series, but it wore thin when she moved out of their houses and apartments with colleagues college friends, and then it got sad and I stopped watching.I loved her aunt, they were so funny and the second It was really ditzy. I loved Valerie, and I hated enemy Sabrina Libby she was ugly.
