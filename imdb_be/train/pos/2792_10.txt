I love this movie. This is a great film that combines the English and Indian culture with feminist issues such as such as girls who want to play sports that were previously reserved for men. It shows how the struggle of the Indian man who wants to break out of its cultural barriers, and women who want to move beyond gender limitations found in the sport, especially in England at the time. I feel that the cultural struggle are clearer than other issues. <br /> <br /> Unlike other comments, I do not think that this film is nothing like Dirty Dancing or any other such chick flick. This step is favored by many types of people, men and women, young and old alike.
