I was really shocked at how the film is more than 60 years can make an impression on me. This has long been almost two hours, there is absolutely no stars in it have subtitles, but still interesting and exciting to watch. What struck me was basically the realism of the film. You can almost feel the cold ice, because you could see that the real storms. It is a relief to the world as a CGI-ourdays. I wonder how much work it has to be for Van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to remove it. Now, who wants to talk about "Titanic" more? This is a great film with a great message, and I would recommend it to future director to see how large and realistic movies can be, if they are directed only to the realism instead of visual effects.
