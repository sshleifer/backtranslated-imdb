<br /> <br /> If you want to rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, even though it's funny, if you do not get the reference, as a straight comedy. <br /> <br /> I have not seen much of the much hyped CB4, but what I saw was not my heart that this little Stormer is. <br /> <br /> did not hear from the people involved, so that is a surprise. The film is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is not a bad thing, and I think a lot of dialogue, while valuable in Tap funnier here, probably because I am more rap than rock theses days, so my own opinion makes the clouds that point. <br /> <br /> rap funny as hell, and it is basically a place links to most of the film, not all of them are in your face, which means the physical comedy and one-liners take precedence over the ups. <br /> <br /> Great fun, a double look if there ever was a film.
