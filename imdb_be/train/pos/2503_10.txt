I am very picky about movies that I see. I heard about Moon Child accidentally. I was a supporter of L'Arc En Ciel for some time and the fan Gackt and Mizer only recently. <br /> <br /> In the end I found that the film had to be re-released, and took him without another thought. <br /> <br /> Being as critical as I am about movies, I recognize that the action scenes can be somewhat sentimental at times ... but they are also designed to be as another user suggested, is the quintessence of calm before the storm, quoting Harry Oldman with Leon ... without going into spoilers, the film hit me very hard, because you understand that the border of friendship and boundless, as is often said, true friendship and loyalty, as marriage is until death do you part. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt give performances that showcase why they make such a depth to their lyrics, their passion for music takes place on the big screen and in the process he creates a model film that will reach the soul and causes a reaction emotionally. <br /> <br /> After watching the film for the first time, I realized that it is likely to remain in the rotation, as May is a collection. I want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current trend in Hollywood movies ... it takes a completely new direction with the use of classical elements of Yakuza films and how can you go wrong with a cameo with Ryo Ishibashi with "Audition" by Takashi Miike, and "The suicide Club" fame? <br /> <br /> Man..I just can not say enough about this movie, but I will stop here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
