After not seen the movie before (and not being able to stand Matt Damon), I did not want to watch The Bourne Ultimatum, when we asked to see him as a reel of film studies. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a movie with Damon in it can be enjoyable. <br /> <br /> A quick fight scene, crazy chase on motorcycles and more explosions were what threw you off your seat at TBU. The near-misses between Bourne and the CIA kept you on your toes and thoroughly entertained. <br /> <br /> However, a few things that really grated cheese mine. <br /> <br /> First of all, the fact that the film was just a series of Bourne, the CIA, the Bourne, the CIA, the Bourne, the CIA. This sequence had repeated and ultimately boring. Although Damon did keep us entertained and always seemed to be one step ahead of the CIA, I was getting a little annoyed with the constant Bourne survival. He crashed the car and left, as if he is knocked or something! . Very surreal <br /> <br /> And secondly (inevitable) - wobbly CAMERA. It was so shaky that it was quite noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see him in my class (even tutors) Seasick. We were told the teachers that if we ever used that in the film we have done in the classroom, it will automatically be wrong, and we were told to use a tripod. Fair enough, if Greengrass wanted to make it look as if we were there to see Damon and Stiles holding talks, but of course, we would not be shaking his head, that much! <br /> <br /> But all TBU is an enjoyable film and worth a look. But I do not think it was the best film of the year, despite an entertaining piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
