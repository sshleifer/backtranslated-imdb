Assessment of only 5, because it is a film that could use more action and direction (or, at least, the music!). However, to achieve Walt Whitman, he deserves to 10. The previous poster called cheesy movie, but I think it's a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees. The filmmakers were clearly more interested in getting the stories out there than to have a brilliant feature film in Hollywood. And for that, I welcome them - the fact that it is not the main reflects the life of Whitman as well. This film is a documentary longer than for action. To be fascinated by a story like this, if you rarely hear of these types of stories that form the current Mental Health Day is the most important. I found it a very pleasant view of history.
