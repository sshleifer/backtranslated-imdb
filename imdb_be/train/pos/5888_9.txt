I was able to watch the film in its entirety and was deeply moved by it. I was not sure whether it's a comedy or drama - these were elements of both. Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper, and both looked great - our way of 60-year-old woman, of course, changed since Aunt Bee! They are bright, beautiful, sexy! The only flaw in this film was the fact that there was absolutely no mention of the other characters or "MTM" or "Genesis" shows from the 1970's. I would have thought that since it was established in New York (where he was set to "Rod"), that at least some mention would have been made with her sister Brenda or Kavner would appear, of course, if it was even in the Big Apple. <br /> <br /> I hope that ABC will make this series and return to guest appearances all the old impression of the show. By the way, that CBS does this meeting, or eventually the series? It was not this network, which carried "MTM" and "Rod" show?
