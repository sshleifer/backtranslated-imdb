Since I am so interested in lake monsters I really dug this movie. This film is worth seeing. If you want to so bad they are good kinds of films to check it. The effect is really good, but just think of "Lost." Initially, I watched this movie in the early '90s, maybe more like 89/90 on the local channel monster show called «Morgus Presents». I do not scare me, but I was 8 and the entire B felt more A. Years later, I saw it on DVD at a local Circuit City and bought it immediately, so that I can give it a 9 because he has a personal point in my heart there with The monster squad and gremlins. B good movie fun for all ages.
