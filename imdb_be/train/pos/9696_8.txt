I am not a supporter of new films, but this one was very nice to look at. Adults and children can watch together - how unusual! My aunt liked it, too. It was the laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a talking parrot. It reminded me of a favorite, The Wizard of Oz. Hero, Paulie, an intelligent parrot, separated from their homes and families, and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always keeping in mind its decision to find his friend, Marie. Highly recommended.
