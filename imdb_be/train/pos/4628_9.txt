One of the best parts of Sundance is to see movies that you would otherwise almost certainly miss. If you are not a true art house devotees, you probably will not catch a lot of documentaries. Only a handful get any known distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare in jail a powerful documentary about the dramatic production group in Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in Lagrange, Kentucky. Each year, a group of prisoners to present Shakespeare's plays. Director Hank Rogerson and his team follow the troupe as a separate option, interpret, rehearse and ultimately executed. <br /> <br /> The film is full of interesting discoveries for those of us who are not exposed to the prison environment, despite the labels we know them (the convict, criminal, murderer, etc.), we soon began to appreciate and respect these people as thinking human feeling. By happy coincidence, the game selected for the year filming was a storm, with a penetrating focus on an apology and atonement. Actors all grapple with the importance of play in their lives, finding patterns and parallels with their character and sense of drama. <br /> <br /> For the documentary, as well as books, the best thing that can be a hope that we are going through something that changes our lives. Shakespeare behind bars was a personal discovery for me. "O brave new world that has such creatures in it."
