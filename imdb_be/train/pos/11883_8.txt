I saw this movie about a week ago and still continue to think about it. I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I found the characters very believable and cute almost to a fault. As in real life, although sometimes people are disappointing, as was the case with Leo, who, even though I loved his character, I could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex, even if fully aware of their HIV -Status. I was also disappointed with Leo for the rejection medication available for it, and the terrible way he treated Marcel, when he decided to send him back home on the train. I think this film is shown in a very real way, why the number of HIV infections among young gay men. This is no way to beat the gay (I'm gay), and the film is very well could be done about a young straight man who makes a bad choice, and do not seem to know about the consequences for themselves and others. Only part of the movie, I could not understand why the (gay friendly) families do not want to include in Marseille in Leo disease to the point, not allowing him to go to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest message from this film is that gay or straight There are no unprotected sex!
