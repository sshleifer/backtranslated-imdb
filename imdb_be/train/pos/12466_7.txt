If the first film by Jean Renoir's "Majhdhaar" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the river, the life of the peasantry, that it will continue to explore, it only seems fitting that his second for the movie for the most part of the rich and privileged, upper classes and those who are trying to claw his way up. Place the characters from the first two films together, and you have the seeds of his great "Grand Illusion" and "rules of the game." It is beautifully filmed, with a restless camera to take full advantage of surprisingly large apartments and backstage areas that dominate the interior of the film and the acting, though often overloaded offer some great moments, and, in particular, by Werner Kraus Muffat. But glamorous and hot Ms. Hessling, which at first glance it seems as if she can give Louise Brooks a run for her money in vampishness, never goes beyond a single note, selfish whore pattern. Perhaps this is part of the problem with the script, which seems to basically go on the high points, and hurt feelings; entirely read the novel, I do not really whether the elections were well done or not clear. <br /> <br /> However, the distinction between mens Nan well drawn, and I particularly liked the relationship between Muffat and Vandeuvres Jean Angelo - tragic understanding that each seems to have its ultimate destiny, and their sympathy for each other, especially in a scene at the bottom of a huge staircase, where Vandeuvres warns Muffat, and we are surprised when violence breaks - this and other pieces of knowledge about the absurdity of idle rich help give the film the depth it has. <br /> <br /> Far from it the greatest achievement, and for me, probably just shy in the overall standings with Â«Whirlpool of Fate", it's still worth a look for fans of Renoir or those who are interested in silent films as a whole .
