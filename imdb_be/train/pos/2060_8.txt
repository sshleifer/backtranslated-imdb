This film is not your typical horror movie. It has a few campy humor and scenes of death, which can be kind of comical. I personally liked the film because of its off-beat humor. It's definitely not a super horror movie, which is good if you do not want to be scared and paranoid then. I liked the performance at the village boys and Lester ... very believable. I think I'm going to dye your hair red, like this girl in Scarecrow- very cool! Anyway, in general, is the rent for the sweet humor and not a typical experience of horror.
