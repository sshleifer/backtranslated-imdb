The feeling of this movie was amazing. Adam Sandler speech was very inspiring. As he played really was a tremendous effort and gentle character, he took his ability to the edge and really worked part. His character was really interesting. I can see that I was reading the script for this film and not be half interested in the part made me like Sandler. For someone who plays mainly comic roles, he pulled off a major role with the fact that it seemed his own quirks and input. I especially liked the scene in which Adam and symbols Don rode a scooter around town. I agree with the point, because it seemed Don witnessed one thing Adam does to get away from it all. With its video games, music and many other things that he does, to keep him from thinking about the past, riding a scooter with his headphones, it seemed like an escape from his thoughts. This movie is definitely worth watching.
