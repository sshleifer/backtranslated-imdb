After reading tons of good reviews about this movie I decided to take it for a spin (I bought it on DVD, so that "spin" pun ... I jerk). The beginning was all that I hoped the perfect set up (along with some quotes that I heard on different albums Wu-Tang), which should be a good film. But the story I heard, was so great, was so predictable. Every time I saw a symbol (except Lizard) I guessed that he Venom. Plus, only a cool character gets killed in the middle of the film. Thus, the plot was not very good, but at least there was some good kung fu is not it? Wrong. Fights were very short and few and far between. Offering a variety of styles were pretty cool, but I want the fights were over. I'm hoping to see a lizard running and do some crazy COULD on the walls, but it never happened. I was hoping to see a centipede to do some hard fast I could, but it did not happen. I was hoping to see the Scorpio in the film more than 7 full minutes, but it did not happen. In short, not much happens. Fights are all quite common. Do not be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot, it does not mean it's good.
