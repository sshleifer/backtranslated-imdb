One of the best, if not the best rock'n'roll movies ever. And it's not just mindless fun. There really was a lot of clever jokes in it. Of course, I love the Ramones. But with all the "anarchy" and "I hate school" that the film does not take itself too seriously, which is what great about it. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw the film in the spring of 1980, and I saw it again recently. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, it made me kind of nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film does not take itself that seriously and not pretentious like so many other teens rate the seventies, eighties and nineties. And to say that this is not dirty or anything disgusting. Only rated PG. This is a rare film in this category. Great religious and truly an incredible time capsule.
