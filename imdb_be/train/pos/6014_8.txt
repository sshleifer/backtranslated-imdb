All the reviews here about how much FE lacks plot, wooden acting, orgy scene makes no sense, and so on, all miss the point. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest. This film, shot in the turbulent times of the late 1960s and early 1970s in Los Angeles. This film is designed for watching as your are H-I-G-H out of your mind on some psychedelic drugs. <br /> <br /> find some kidney and smoke up, or get a mild acid from entering. Seriously, these are straight and sober review IP to miss the point. You can not get anything out of this movie literally mood. <br /> <br /> As long as you have not watched this film on the big screen (which I'm happy that I did three times in the 1990s, when the ZP was quite rare) tripping, you have no idea what this film is. <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching not intoxicated, you can at least estimate the ending, when the shit explodes in a great soundtrack rework Pink Floyd on "Careful with that Ax, Eugene", "entered the number 51, your time is up. "
