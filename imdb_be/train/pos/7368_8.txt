I think that in this film the team did a very good job they had with disabilities. Only 300,000 and Â£ 7 weeks to write, film and edit the whole thing, I think, is an achievement in itself. Although this film is not for the masses (as a young innocent girl is killed, is a homo-eroticism is part of the story), I think this film is a heartbreaking tragedy and more deeply involved in the stories you get more sadness you feel. to a greater extent with respect to Heaton because of the love he feels, but never returned. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite British films, which I enjoyed very much and will look again. I think it's a shame that this film is not very well heard at all.
