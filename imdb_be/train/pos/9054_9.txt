"October Sky» is a film that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid images, and lift your spirit. Tale of homers Hikogo and his dream of creating a missile, it seems so simple at first, especially when the film is set in the mining town where the future is as clear as coal piles at the mine. But Homer can not follow in the footsteps of his father. With the support of Miss Riley (friendly teacher), the staff of his father and his friends, Homer tries to make his dream a reality. <br /> <br /> However, as with any precision the history of life, there are many stops along the way. Directed by Joe Johnston immerses us in the coal mines, where we have seen the disastrous fettered miner hunched under a rock ceiling. With lighted helmets and bent posture they resembled alien insectoid more than people in the dark. Hacking coughs miners and blackened faces were a constant reminder of the dangers the miners faced in their work. <br /> <br /> Contrast grim burden on mine are Homer images and missile launches his friend. Under the blue sky a cup, missiles placed on the pillow and started into the stratosphere ... And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees the moon for the first time. <br /> <br /> However, what makes the film so endearing relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classical tempered man ... but he has a soft side as well. We can see that he really loves his son, in spite of many arguments. The love and support of Miss Riley is obvious as well. Best of all, the film is inconvenient. He does not connect all in a good nose. He picks you, picks you up. He keeps the air of reality, which plays an important role in a film like this. <br /> <br /> This film can be regarded as a complete work. First, I was disappointed that the film does not continue to Homer's life. I do not want it to end. Then I realized ... that's what makes a good movie with a man. If he has done his job, you do not want it to end. And just performs "October Sky».
