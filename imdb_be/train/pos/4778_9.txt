Like his early masterpiece "The Elephant Man" Lynch proves his detractors that he can tell a straight, simple story, without losing their artistic touch. This is the true story of a retired elderly people (masterfully played by Richard Farnsworth), who decides to go on a tractor through several states pay last visit to his former brother, who is now on the verge of death. Beautiful score from Badalamenti, a beautiful picture of rural life (love these air cornfields arrows), and a hand clever director who shows the basic humanity of man, this is a beautiful piece of film life. Its extremely slow pace can soothe some of the audience to sleep, but those who stay for a trip will be well rewarded in the end.
