Conrad Hall went out with a bang. Great photographer of the film ended his brilliant career with this film before you go. He did himself proud, as it is one of the most beautiful crime films you will ever see. <br /> <br /> Of course, acting is not bad, if you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman plays the wire! Number of actions are just, too: not too much; not too little <br /> <br. /> None of the characters here, to be honest, is not the "good guys" as Hanks is a professional hit men for the city of Newman's boss. only redemptive quality Hanks does not want his young son is got a killer like him, even though he teaches him how to be a man of rest in the looting! Yes? <br /> <br /> As well as the acting and as interesting as the history, the real star of the film cameraman hall that draws the scene after beautiful scene with his lens. His work is just amazing.
