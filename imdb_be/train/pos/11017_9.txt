The film is set to be better than the average action movie, and in this respect they succeeded.This film was exciting cinematography distinguishing breathtaking mountain snow and height, is very suitable to put Stallone in a good performance as well, exciting plot and a great performance from his main villain becouse it is really shocking you with their evil ways.The cinema does not occupy permanently a large screen play.The becouse weak story and the story calls for this film that Stallone extra special person, just like Rambo or Rocky and because Bond characters.They decided to ennoble the character Stallone in this one, which is good, but given the style of the story, in the agitation weakens factor.Also, dialogue was cheesy and casually condescending at times.The scenario should have been more realistic and less «Talky ».Another weak point was unrealistic filmmakers shooting scenes.The should be more careful how they hadled shooting hits and misses.They should continue the quality of the scenes shot in the sequence capture the plane at the beginning of movie.Instead, they decided to dilute a lot of shooting sequences ( ala «A-Team» teleseryya l), as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops.This movie had a lot of all-time great action sequences potential.Crisper, better dialogue, and more Rambo / style of Rocky emotions / definition of Stallone would take this film to a higher level.I know it is not fault.I sense Stallone film director wanted to soften the character Stallone and trying to steal the film, taking the credit for his side, not all that well, if not for his cinematographer.Sill good movie, though ........
