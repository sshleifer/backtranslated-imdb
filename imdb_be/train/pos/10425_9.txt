Large Caruso was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records in Radio City Music Hall in the year when the majority of «movergoers» were staying at home, watching their new Motorola TV 7 ". Almost all of the recent film distribution figures are incorrect --- because they can not handle inflation is obvious today $ 10 films will dominate in 1951 the value of 90S to $ 1.60 in Radio City, .. 44c to 75C first run in Loew's Palace in Washington, DC, or 35C up to 50C in the vicinity of the runs. What is important is the number of people who react to the picture, not Nia adjusted box office "media spin." genius of the Great Caruso, the filmmakers took great part of the real life of Enrico Caruso (actually not a great story anyway) and threw it in the trash. Instead, 90% of the focus of the film was on the music. So , MGM gave us the best live opera singer Mario Lanza makes the music of the best ever historical opera singer Enrico Caruso. the result was a great movie. LANZA sorry to throw my life and career is far from over-eating. Too fat to play in the Student PRINCE, Edmund Purdue took his place --- voice Lanza in duplicate at, and previously nice and fat Lanets pictured in the advertisement. If you want to see the Great Caruso, it's almost always on eBay for $ 2.00 or less. Do not be put off by the low cost, since it only reflects the easy accessibility of copies, not the quality of the film.
