It's like Murder, She Wrote, it is one of those shows that, after a busy day at school, I sit down in front of a TV and watch. Why? Because I really enjoy it, and it's a shame it's not on the air anymore. Dick Van Dyke surprising as Dr. Mark Sloan, a physician who has become a detective, who, along with his son, decides to murder. He joined largely unknown, but very competent supporting cast, namely, his real-life son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that every number of his changing hairstyles. I also loved Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I especially liked Michael Tucci, Norman, and was puzzled as he suddenly disappeared. This show is so interesting, with great guest stars, it's a little obvious, since Colombo, but in each episode, something always have to chuckle about. In conclusion, a large series, with two fingers up and 10/10. Bethany Cox
