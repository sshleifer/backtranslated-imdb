This is a great "small" film. I say "little" because it is not a hundred cannon fire or a dozen explosions in the film by John Woo. Great performances, Roy Scheider and three "bad guys." Frankenheimer, it seems more luck with small productions these days. The film is very easy to watch, the story more yarn than the washing machine - instead of everything that's going around and around, it seems that things get worse, as the plot thickens. A great final, very positive. I have never read a book Elmore Leonard, but he can not be very different from the film, because it feels like I'm watching a movie in the Elmore Leonard.
