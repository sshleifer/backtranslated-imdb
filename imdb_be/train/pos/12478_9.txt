What a wonderful heart warming telefilm. The story tells about a little five year old girl, who lost her dad, and believes that it is impossible to cope with. Her mother is also very upset ..only miracle can facilitate their unhappiness.Which all viewers hoping to materialize. Samantha Mathis is brilliant as the mother of a little girl, since she was a nurse in "Jack and Sarah" is worth a look if you like Samantha Mathis and happy; year a tear-jerking movie! Ellen Burstyn is, as always, a great grandmother in this competition and superbly acted film. Ferland (small five years) the most magical and convincing the young actress. The film is based on a true story, which makes it so touching. "Mermaid" a tribute to the milk of human kindness, which illustrates the clear and still all around us in this complex world we live in. "Mermaid" gives us all hope that understanding, there are many wonderful people in the world with a lot of love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland UK
