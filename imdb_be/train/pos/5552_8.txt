I waited until July 4 to write this, because. ,, Good. ,, Because it just feels good to do it in this day. <br /> <br /> In 1924, D.W. Griffith needed a hit, he did not have one big since the Orphan of the Storm (1921). He worked steadily, but since then, his films have been smaller in size, and could not get into the right chord with the audience. He was planning a film about Patrick Henry when he contacted members of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), who asked when he can expand his ideas to cover the vast majority of the American Revolution. This film is the result. By the time he finished, he had a history of 14 drum lesson and were not signs of Patrick Henry, anywhere. <br /> <br /> We all know the history of the Revolutionary War, but fell in love with Griffith threw Tory aristocrat Nancy Montague (Carol Dempster, the leading lady for Griffith for many years) in the history of love with the Patriot farmer Nathan (Neil Hamilton). Complicating matters is the fact that Nancy's father hates Nathan. ,, And not just Nathan, he hates all rebel. It does not help the case when, during the exchange of fire in the streets of Lexington who jostles hands Nathan causing it to discharge his gun and accidentally hit dad Nancy! <br /> <br /> Paralelling love story is (mostly true, but partially decorated) history Captain Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore), a renegade British officer, who feels that he owes allegiance to no one. With thousands of Indians form the Six Nations on his side, he hopes to quell the colonists and become a monarch of their own empire. <br /> <br /> The comparisons with the Birth of a Nation (1915), are inevitable. Montague family may just as well be from Cameron's previous film while Nathan Stoneman could be part of the family. The sequence of the Battle of Bunker Hill set is very similar to the scene in Birth of a Nation with the attacking army, redcoats in this case, to storm a trench filled with Patriots. The only thing missing Henry Walthall charge of no man's land fill flag down the barrel of a gun. Surprisingly enough battle scenes in America, it seems, is not enough energy in the action scenes of birth and did not attract the audience. Something is clearly not enough. This is not a sphere, G.W. Cinematography "BillyÂ» Bitzer is good enough. Maybe we do not have enough. ,, I dare say. ,, Sincerity? <br /> <br /> brutality captain. Butler and his men are well emphasized, although much of this is happening in a risky or off-screen. Do not expect any heads to be cut in the near distance, as we saw in Intolerance (1916). In one of the scenes in the second Butler team captain Hare (Louis Wolhiem) chisel eye captive colonists. We are only seeing the beginning of the act, the rest of the camera focuses on the face of the Rabbit, he obviously has a good time doing it. Lionel worked with Griffith on and off since 1912. The story goes that he went to Griffith for work and DW, knowing the reputation of his famous family, he said: ". I did not hire a stage actor," To which Lionel said, "I'm nothing like sir! "He is doing very well and is quite believable villain. Louis Wolhiem appeared with his older brother Lionel John three times; in Sherlock Holmes and DR. Jackie and MR. HYDE (two in 1920), and then to brown (1927). As captain of his wild Hare vigilant eyes and disheveled hair, not only to label him as a villain, but to make you think that he is completely crazy also. <br /> <br /> Neil Hamilton later remarked that America was his first time riding and "I was scared to death.". He is very good at hiding their dissatisfaction, although we can assume that he was quite the rider of the shooting time was over. Mr. Griffith was very much in love with Carol Dempster and at one point asked her to marry him. She refused, and soon left her joint-stock company, then its star status gradually weakened. <br /> <br /> Speaking of horses, one randomly funny moment, which was to be unprepared came while driving image of Paul Revere. It rides on a horse right on the family porch to announce "To arms! The regulars are coming! "But as he tries to leave the horse can not negotiate steps back and stumbles spilling the rider to the ground! I wonder Griffith did not even take it. <br /> <br /> So America is a classic? YES! Do not wait for July 4 to see it, it is a pleasure at any time.
