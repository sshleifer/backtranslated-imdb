Another run of South Park coming to an end. It was not so strong episode, as I had hoped, but Night of the Living homeless finisher was stronger then the Stanley Cup, DPT, Bloody Mary, or the Day of the Exaltation. He still can not hold a candle to the Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks, but some episodes may be. <br /> <br /> Night of the Living Homeless parody of the zombie genre, done in a way only South Park will think with. Instead of flesh eating zombies, subjects are homeless that request changes and seem to survive from it. <br /> <br /> Randy and the other inhabitants are closed at the community center, but this time on the roof, where they can inspect the scene. Especially funny when one member learns that his house disappears and becomes homeless, leaving Randy Sun no choice but to shoot him. <br /> <br /> At the same time, four boys set out to solve the problem with the whole story of the capture of the homeless is trying to convey a message, but being seriously uninspired. South Park is in the best days, when he's funny. Matt and Trey played safe this week, and really not a critic of the homeless problem just laughed at him. <br /> <br /> The striking point of the episode is when a scientist was shot in an attempt to avoid homelessness, This is the first time a suicide at South Park is going wrong, and we are seeing a poor man to miss his brain, and then try to shoot a lot of time, until he dies painfully. The other is inspired by South Park moment. <br /> <br /> In general, the episode was funny, but refrained from denying that large real comment about the homeless and paste directly from zombies chip. The ending is somewhat funny, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Now we have to wait until October for the next batch of episodes. It's a long way to go but South Park should be applauded for it to work. The show seemed to be out of steam in the last season, but now he's back in full form.
