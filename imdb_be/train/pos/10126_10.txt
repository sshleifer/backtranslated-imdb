Much has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true film "Miike," and I thought it was some kind of description may be a cliché. But, like all clichés, it is based on truth. All trademark Miike here, violence, black humor, homosexuality, a taboo testing and difficult to like the central character. Of Shinjuku, however, one of the most well-educated Miike movies. He says in an interview that if he ever did it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think he means that the film has a truly exciting energy and raw edge that seems so fresh that even though he might grab more visually or technically complicated movie, he could not repeat the better the purity of the film. <br /> <br /> As expected, violence is very visceral, gushing blood and sand are complemented by beating a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face. (Only Miike film would let you get away with an offer like this.) The film has a fantastic pace, as opposed to living or dead, which begins and ends hard and dips in the middle. Dead or Alive also has to deal with similar problems, Miike is clearly concerned about the relationship between the Japanese and the Chinese in the postwar period and this exhilarating object is treated well here, the central character really comes to life when you begin to understand their past. <br /> <br /> I can not sing enough Shinjuku. I do not want to give away too much. It Miike, before he started using CGI, to revive his films and almost resembles something like Sonatina China. The central characters are beautifully realized and final turn ensures that once the film is finished you will clap his work again it all.
