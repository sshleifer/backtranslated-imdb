Great Spotted film Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) likes to roll the dice and illegal crap game. Blonde loves Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him if he gives bones. He decides on one last game, when Sky Masterson (Brando!) Which puts a great deal, is in town. He puts the sky, he can not get a mission worker Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons), to go with him to Havana. ! It may seem strange, but the short story as a movie <br /> <br /> It's a real mixed bag - there's some great stuff here. The songs are all good and the dancing is incredible. The real show stopper in the muck at the end of the game. Brando also really good here - it may seem strange to think of him singing and dancing, but he pulls it off. I have to admit, seeing the big, bulky Brando pull some difficult dance moves were a lot of fun! Sinatra also pretty good and Blaine just fine, as well as his long-suffering girlfriend. Her songs and dances specific moments here <br /> <br /> Now for the bad parts. - Gene Simmons is a great actress, but she stayed with gray colorless role and can not do with it. The film is too long at 150 minutes - scene between Brando and Simmons really drag-and had to be cut. In addition, most of the characters speak in a very precise English - Contractions are never used. Maybe he's trying to be funny, coming from the mouth of the gangsters, but I found it jarring and threw me out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is worth catching for the songs and dances, but the length of it is to get to you after a while. I give it a 7.
