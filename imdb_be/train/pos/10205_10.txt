Rented the accident, it was for the movie box that I thought I was filming, did not find until I got home, watched it anyway. Absolutely fantastic! great movie, and one of the top three of my favorite of all time, I recommend it to everyone! <br /> <br /> Stories are nice and easy to follow, it can be easy to confuse, but the actors and the director are doing a great job of keeping it together. <br /> <br /> actors themselves are fantastic, showing great character and does a terrific job. <br /> <br /> I have to find a copy somewhere ...........
