Antwone FISHER unbalanced story of a young US Navy sailor. His concerns led him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his problems stem from his childhood parenting. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to shed a tear or two. The film may ignite the coldest heart. I loved the story, which is transformed from something so very awful to happen to anyone in a positive ending. Antwone FISHER powerful film, the most important thing for forgiveness. Other important questions that you will get thinking are child abuse, adoption and foster care. <br /> <br /> Oscar winner Denzel Washington is doing a poor job in his directorial debut. There were many scenes that I enjoyed watching. These included the start (a dream of a little boy ?? check out the giant size of the pancakes!) And end (the dream turned into reality), which is perfectly connected with the story. <br /> <br /> Another great scene was when the doctor called Antwone to look for his family to find answers to their questions about his family, abandoned him. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene was when a young man, at last, in front of his mother and her reaction to it. Priceless. <br /> <br /> All of the actors presented their part well. <br /> <br /> In addition to the director's duties, Mr. Washington continues to show why he received the Academy Award and successful in all his acting roles. He had a strong presence in this film. <br /> <br /> The actor Derek Luke showed why he was right on the part of Antwone Fisher. He portrayed a very real and heart tugging operation. <br /> <br /> Joy Bryant, who played the role of Cheryl, love interest Antwone, in resembled a sunbeam on the screen. Chemistry flowed well between romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, who played the role of Mrs. Tate, despicable character, deserves special mention. <br /> <br /> While we see her only for a few minutes, the actress who played the mother, Fischer praised the performance. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see Antwone fisher.
