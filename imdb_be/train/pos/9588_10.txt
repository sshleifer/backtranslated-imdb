If Paris is Burning went out, I totally rejected it. I was not altogether Madonna and vogueing phenomenon. I thought that it would be foolish and mannerisms. How wrong I was about that movie. I watched it after the movie was over ten years, and I ran out and bought it. He took me back to a time and place of joy and excitement. I felt as if I knew all the characters personally. In the 80 years it was spectacular, and the film captures the essence of gay culture. What a great job! I went online and found out that some of the original members of the shed doing now, but I could not find them all. If any one has any information about any of the members of the casts, please let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they do another documentary. I loved it
