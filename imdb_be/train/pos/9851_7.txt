Shrek, who? Well, imagine Shrek Ice Age. Remember the end of Shrek? As a consequence you do. Now imagine that Shrek turns into a human, and thus makes the princess. Get it?

Strong one-liners, some social commentary, that children do not understand that the good guys win. And one more thing: Scrat. By the way, how do you all know that his name is Scrat? 7/10
