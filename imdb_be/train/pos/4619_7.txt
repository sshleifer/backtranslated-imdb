Firstly, I'm a big fan of '80s movies, and O'Connell, as well. So yesterday, I went to a local book / movie store and found a VHS copy. I read the back, and it sounded good and for $ 3.99 it was a good deal. So I took it home and put it in the VCR. Which is a sweet movie! At my age now, I'm more movies like last night, or St. Elmo's fire, but so far I can remember, what it was like to be 15/16, and in love with an older guy, and etc. We have all these little breaks when we are younger. And if that does not work, we have a broken heart, and we think that we will never get over it. But of course we do. Many times. This is something sweet quality that I really got from this film. Sense of "Ohhh! I remember when something like that happened to me ... "all over it. Characters interesting and well developed. I recommend it to anyone who loves 80s films, films for teenagers, in particular, or for those who just want to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives.
