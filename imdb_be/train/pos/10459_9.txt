I did not expect that so influenced this film depicting the family as well as the one you would expect to be living in the neighborhood. They are ordinary people of flesh and blood, not like a typical Hollywood fare. They too face a common problem - a debilitating illness. But the storyline captures the heart with a powerful lesson. Casting, script, direction and acting flow with the wave that draws the viewer deep into history. Give this film his attention, and his message is truly inspiring.
