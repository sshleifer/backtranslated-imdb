I can admit that the scenario is not very good, and that he has some slow parts, but you all the critics of the film have to learn to have fun. First of all, great performances (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria. Michael Douglas proves that he is still there, and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character, as a cheating wife. Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, play a dynamic duet, and adding them to the pot incredible talent. Secondly, this film is the most fun I've had in years, Theodore. its simple and easy if you want to go to the movies, and there is a lot of fun to see the guard.
