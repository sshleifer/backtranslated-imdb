I really liked this film I have seen, the original classic a few times, but could not remember any details. I think this film is much better than his cartoon is not so black and white as that. I especially liked the way they made the Grinch so full of character and gave a reason why he was the way he was, the villain in the film was not the actual Grinch but major, very different from the original cartoon. Jim Carrey was perfect for the part, all in all a great film made for children and adults.
