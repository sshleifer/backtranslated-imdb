Big rock candy is awesome. I watched when I was a kid, and still to this day. (Senior in high school). I could imagine the sky, that is what it will look like. I wish I could live in a big rock candy mountain, where candy grows on trees. Zach Hyman is Profs, and my best friend. little Bunny Foo Foo's is the man. it's so fuzzy and colorful, I dream about it at night. in fact, a friend of mine who 18 recently watched it for the first time and absolutely loved it. I recommend to people of all ages to watch this movie. I have a huge party this weekend with all your friends to see this incredible film. we are going to order a pizza and watch teddy bears giggle. I find myself watching the clouds and wishing I was that little girl who received a visit. thank you. Goodbye.
