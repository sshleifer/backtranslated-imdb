I have not read anything but good things about this film, and finally had the opportunity to watch it at the end of last night, and it was everything I expected it to be and more.This way to correct a horror movie should think be.I that the reason it was so terrible it was, because it was so real. Phantom of the assessments were ideal for the installation of dark mood.I liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed the rest of the movie played out.It is very easy to follow and understand, unlike some of the films that are too complicated.The special effects are very good.I would like to see horror movies more like this one.This easily one of my favorite's.A realistic thunder and lightning storm to establish a good atmosphere for this movie.Other that she had all the elements of a good horror film film needs.I very I recommend this movie for those who can appreciate a good horror film that draws entirely punches.I will add it to my collection.The DVD has some nice features.
