In my opinion, this should be one of the best performances in the Barbara Stanwyck. She was one of the few actors then and now, who can say more with a look than to the entire dialog page. And I was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored movie, with additional 4 minutes of additional footage. It is a pity that the film is so short. Lilly young woman, barely holding it together to work for her father in his illegal Speakeasy. Her only connection to what her good friend, Chico, played superbly Teresa Harris. Although Chico black (and white women to be best friends with a black woman in the 30-ies it was controversial as the subject of the film), and Lily is not that they are in a special relationship. And it's not sexy. Only 2 women stuck or pushed in a situation beyond their control. After Lily's father dies and she does not know what she would do, she said, that she has the power to go out and get what she wants. Yes, it is immoral, but it is the whole point of this film. Then "they" had to go out and destroy the last few minutes. So, up until the last minutes of the film, it's not a great movie and worth watching. "Lesson" from the film is still as valid today as it was then, and I'm sure that will happen in 100 years. Women, it's terrible that Lily does in order to get what she wants, but it works. Men, take note.
