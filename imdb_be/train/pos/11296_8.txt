I had a personal interest in this film. When I was 17, and just out of high school I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of a laborer and OD Union carriers. At the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier) told me to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes, etc. within one or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning waiting for the bus, and about 20 of us headed south toward San Diego. There just is not enough, we stopped at a military base called or Ca or Callan Camp Hahn. Once we were bunked in, we went to the north a few miles to Camp Pendleton, the big Marine base. There, on the shore, we began to build what was to be an island base of the Japanese Pacific. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which includes a water tank, cannon trenches, sand bags trenches and accommodations. All this was at a very high salary, sometimes the "golden time", which was three times our regular hourly rate. Our food was also first rate = prime rib for dinner, etc. -., Which was weird, because it was during the war, and it is very difficult to get good meat at home <br /> <br /> After the work was finished, I waited impatiently for the film will be released, which is about eight or ten months later. Then I was looking forward to, after two hours of the film, to my hands, finally came out on the screen. Then it was not more than three or four minutes (maybe less) characters in the film in base dive and blast it to smithereens. A bit disappointing, but it is still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment, I enjoyed the film and had not seen him since. Later I learned that this film has been guaranteed by the government, and Fox was paid cost plus basis, which may have to pay for our extravagant and way of life there. Bob Weverka
