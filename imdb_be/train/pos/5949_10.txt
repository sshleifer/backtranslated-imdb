Hello again, I have to comment on this remarkable, exciting and believable tale of romance and intrigue. Music is beautiful and memorable. Very nice colorful film. Another movie I liked, and later was a tall Society with Bing Crosby. Great music. Thank you for your attention, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
