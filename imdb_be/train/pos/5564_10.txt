Best Cheech and Chong movie so far !! Of all the Cheech and Chong is the most certain of the best so far. I think I've seen them all a dozen times at least, and I love them all. But this is definitely the best. Compared to other this one covers a variety of topics and gives a lot of good laughs. Part of the text is still part of our language today, 25 years later. I hope that they can make another one day, because they are still great humorists. I have heard that they are writing a new script, so who knows ... I think these guys are the only ones who have succeeded in creating a worthy films in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft has never watched one of them ...
