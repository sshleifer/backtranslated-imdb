Homicide: The Movie was good wound to the well-written, well directed and well acted series. Loose ends were tied, they were not properly taken into account at the end of last season. The entire series, and especially the movie, when life, as a look at life (and death) in Baltimore, culturally unique city with an extremely high speed murder. May desire for the series began long before he moved to Baltimore, but as soon as I felt life here for myself, I realized how real it was. And the film, of course, has kept this spirit. Of course, I miss new episodes of the original series, but I am very grateful to NBC and producer and threw for giving us one last look at the dark side of Charm City.
