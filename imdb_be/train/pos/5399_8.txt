Gosha last great film of the 1960s. Resolute stylist with a great sense of purpose in their films, Ghosh, together with Shintaro Katz (of Zatoichi fame) to produce this scathing indictment of mindless nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> «Tenchu» (the heavenly court) is the word that the Emperor loyalists screaming and killing enemies or 'traitors' case. Katsu accompanies naive loyalty to his character "to the manipulative politics in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone who questioned the policy stated "traitor" and becomes the target killing. <br /> <br /> One of the best films ever made at many frames incredible compositions of form, color and light. The fight scenes are often very bloody and brutal. Blood becomes a part of the color palette Gosh uses for their images. Wonderful and disturbing. While personal story easy to follow, the historical background is complex and while the main lesson of history for this time in Japan, it would be very useful, you can fight through the film without him. Several shortcomings of the film are the musical track, the length and time of the time the scenery chewing Katsu. He has drunk scene, making their way over the top for the movie, but is actually a very accurate portrayal of a drunk. <br /> <br /> Downbeat, but one of the biggest chambara films.
