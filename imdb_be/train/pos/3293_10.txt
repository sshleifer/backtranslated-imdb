Rafite, lyrics Kaifu Bhopal and not to mention the movie pictures, when sailing boat out on the black background and bright star. The other would have to be "Roads of Love". Pakeezah was the last film Mina Kumar, before she died, and her amount of time it took you can see on the screen. In each of the songs, which are filmed, she looks young, but after that it does not. But one actor who has not changed in its appearance, was the late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with her, especially her legs, after he accidentally falls into her train cabin, and saw them, he leaves a note with a description of how they beautiful. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakeezah beautiful romantic story, which, if at all possible, should be seen on the big screen just for movie pictures and songs.
