Pinjar Mr. Dwivedi strange film. It is certainly very great, and the best since 2003. There is a very good performance in it. Dwivedi knows that he can get to the fertile Urmila. she is in a never seen before. one true great performance. with her fine actor Manoj Bazhpai, which showed that Bollywood he Bhiku Mhatre. The film is about a girl (Urmila) living in the Pre-partition Pakistan. she Livin Punjabi family in a small town. she was kidnapped by a Muslim man in the composition of what is happening outside-years kind of combat Punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and turns as marriage Urmila is due in a few days. This film is really a very good movie. The storyline is hard with an amazing script. All performances as Lillet Dhabi, Isha Koppikar (and believ habit, but it can do the same, except on the Yus Dancin Khallas), Kulbushen Harbanda and more. These sets of pre-partition Pakistan, suits, movie, audio, background score add to the positive aspects. from the beginning to the end I stuck to the R u'r seat with the question What's next? this movie is not worth JUS Watchin, but deserves to be part of your collection of movies. the final scene of the end of the film. I would suggest that all of these No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-No-Deal-To-Pagal-Hai crowd to watch this amazing film. My rating: 10/10.
