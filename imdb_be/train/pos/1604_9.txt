I am very surprised that this film did not receive a higher rating on IMDB. This is one of those films that could easily get from someone else, but for the romantic comedy «Moonstruck» really in a class by itself. This installation and ethnic charm of the things people seem to take for granted. Only one casting makes this an almost perfect film. Several films in the 1980s were just as good as the «Moonstruck» and it is also fun. **** to *****
