it is one of the funniest movies I've seen. it was that rough moments, but they were full of charm. Altmanesque this scenario, the brilliant physical humor, relaxed and friendly were nice to look at, and a slice of life, most of us can relate to. and I can say with a measure of fairness that I feared for nipple..i Steve Karel really was. Not surprisingly, this good-natured, quiet comedy that, in fact, love, and many relationships that we could be on the road. Catherine Keener was terrific as Trichet, and all the friends of Steve Carell had flaws, but expensive, and so much fun. the idea that they suspect that Karel was a serial killer amusing metaphor forty-year-old virgin. but the simple truth is that he wanted to be his first love. original, charming and very funny. Highly recommended.
