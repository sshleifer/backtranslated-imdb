When I first got my the N64, when I was five or six, I fell in love with her, and my first game was Super Mario 64.And I loved it! Schedule was a great time for him, a good story, excellent courses and above all, the best music I've heard in a Nintendo game. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the story completely, but I think that Princess Peach has been kidnapped by Bowser, and Mario must rescue her.The object game to get 120 stars from the curses in castle.Each was about five or six challnges, to get stars.There secert are part of the castle, where you can get more stars.But course, you beat Bowser. * I think that there are three levels to beat Bowser * Will begin with characters.Mario is the main character and get tips from the frog, so he's basically one of your only alliances.I heard that Luigi and Yoshite in the game the direction of the main villain is end.The Bowser, and there are plenty of other characters like Boo and Goomba.The characters are really great. <br /> <br /> Next, as the graph? People say that the gameplay is more important than the graphics, and I agree with it completely.But large plot, there is a large graphics.Especially for him time.I have a whole bunch of other Nintendo games, such as 007 and their schedules entirely compared with super Mario.Bright colors, great effects and strange sound effects.I graphics found in watercourses good.Next very much in the world, Bowser, this is the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Now, music.This my favorite part game.Growing up when I played it at a young age, I'd love to leave the game for the whole night, so that the music put me music sleep.Especially with Jolly roger Bay, which was peaceful and wonderful.There others that are too large, especially in once again, worlds Bowser are the ones that stick with me the most, and my favorite. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite past time as the gamer develops, and I love the game gets .tak 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) the GO to play this game!
