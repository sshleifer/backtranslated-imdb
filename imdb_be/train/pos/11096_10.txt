Based on the Elmore Leonard, it's tough and smart fighter. History: business man blackmailed some 3 offenders. Roy Schieder does a great job as the lead character and special credit must go John Glover, who plays a kind of mischievous psychopath. I should note that villains characters are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare for an action movie. also it has some beautiful and sexy women - the most typical are Kelly Preston, as a young character for BATE in Schieder. Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance, like a prostitute, who is linked to three blackmailers. I am pleased to say that Ann-Margaret still has not lost - this lady is a real baby. Do not look at the speed of the film. I really do not know what the public and some critics against the film, but my suggestion is to ignore them and see it really exciting and underrated film. You will enjoy it, it's a promise. Recommended A +.
