24 is the best TV show !!!!! This is an incredible show with incredible uncertainty, different plots and unforgettable characters. And the first episode all my best proof. Because it's only the first episode, only an introduction, and you hooked from the plot and continuous turns. <br /> <br /> Jack Bauer is a federal agent who is assigned to protect Senator David Palmer, he can not trust anyone, because people CTU may be involved. And if this event happened to his daughter: Kimberly runs away from home for a party. But ... <br /> <br /> At the end of the episode you want to watch more, and more and more. <br /> <br /> This is only the first of the party, and it's great.
