FREDDY went from scared funny, this 6th game in a series of nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's been 2 years, and in fact 11, because the film takes place in 2001.And Freddy killed every last kid on Elm Street, but one John Doe (Jacobb of Part 5, even the doe the film gives a hint on what it is), in which he uses to attract more children to come to the elm street.Not only makes FREDDY gets his wishes, but he also gets his daughter back to Ely street.When she learns that happening, she and the other children decide to kill Freddy once and all.We can also see some of the terrible backgrounds for Freddy. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalaev that was contected a nightmare series for a long time by now.Many people hate this movie, but I liked it.It was trying to deduce that makes it FREDDY wisecrackes ... COMDEY and makes the series more funny than scary .so this film really hurts comdey speak.It is not wrost in the series, part 2 still holds it. <br /> <br />
