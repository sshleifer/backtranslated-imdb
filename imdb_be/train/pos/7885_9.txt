First of all, I have to start this comment by saying that I am a big fan Nightmare on Elm Street. I think this is the biggest horror series ever. For me, Freddy Boogeyman! Of course, Dead Freddie, who was trying to be the last chapter if this amazing movie. It does not have the same atmosphere than the previous films. Freddy has a lot of screen time. Some people think that this makes it less scary, I agree. And this, in my opinion, it is in this. This film exists, so we can know, of Freddy a little better who he was, who he was, how he became the man of our dreams obsessive. For some people, it's bad, it's better if we never know, because it's scarier not know why evil is evil. Obviously, these people do not like Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. To truly enjoy this, you have to see things differently. This is not about a strange guy hiding in the bushes waiting for your dreams to scare the hell out of you. It was the first, and it was awesome. Over the years, Freddie to kill more and more people, and no one could get rid of him forever. Now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of the scope of Freddy terror. In addition to the story about the past Freddy, I also really liked the atmosphere of the film. No more children in Springwood, only adults crazy. The nightmarish scenes everything is fine. The soundtrack is amazing, especially the opening song called "" I'm Awake Now "Â» by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare horror masterpiece, and I can not believe that this is so undervalued. Maybe it is wrong, or if I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch. She has a lot of scary moments and funny moments, too, and a lot of cameo! Get ready for something else, and you can not be disappointed.
