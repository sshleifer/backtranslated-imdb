This is a pretty decent example of film noir. Installation in the early 50s with the Communists are trying to steal the secrets of weapons from the US government. <br /> <br /> Widmark is suave hustler without irritation. It gives a pretty decent performance, but there is no listing of it. It is interesting that he was not only an anti-hero, but for most of the film, unsympathetic antihero. It's not very normal. Jean Peters gave a so-so performance as a prostitute with a heart of gold. It's a great character actress Thelma Ritter light as a stool pigeon. <br /> <br /> The plot has had its fair share of twists and turns, jokes and tough talk. There is a fight scene at the end of the film (in the metro), which was pretty rough and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think noir fans (like me) will enjoy this film. For non-noir viewers, it may seem a bit dated, and the whole thing is a bit exaggerated Commie.
