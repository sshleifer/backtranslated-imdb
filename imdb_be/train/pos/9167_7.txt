This, in my opinion, much better than any of the 1990 versions of 2, but it is not all that good. He feels on, probably because it is, but it does not stand up well in comparison with other parts of the BBC period of the 1980s, such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> The length of this adaptation allows a much better adaptation of the book than any of the versions in the 2 to 90, and John Rivers St, at least covered, though not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but the actress playing Jane was too old. There is certainly possible for the television adaptation of the length, which has more than Chervonets spent on it.
