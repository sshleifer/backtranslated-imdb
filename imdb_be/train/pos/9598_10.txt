I tracked a trip two years ago on the Internet - now I have seen the movie !! What a ride! And that journey finally found Darius Weems! Such a courageous, wise, funny and talented spirit! And what a crew! To listen to Darius laughing matter in the water in Panama City, to see his anxious to be too close to the alligators in Louisiana, the surprise in his eyes when he was riding in a hot air balloon, rafting excitement a few rapids, the rate to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and phone calls home, and as always - boys will be boys. This film should be seen by all - young and old alike. Darius and his mother was a model of strength and courage. And the crew members is a testament to the young generation of the heart. They got a new wheelchair Darius; They documented problems of accessibility; they took Darius the trip of his life; and they touched many, many lives. Way to increase awareness of the MDDE and stimulate research funding, this film will help to achieve the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for MDDA.
