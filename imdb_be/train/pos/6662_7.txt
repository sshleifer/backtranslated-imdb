Gandhi my father well-made film. It perfectly reflects the life of Gandhi's eldest son Harilal. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand on his own, his failures, his ego .. Akshay Khanna fully justifies the role of Harilal. Only he did not, did everything well in the role they played. Darsi Zhariuol Gandhiji is the best screen I have ever seen. But I will destroy the three points as there were a few drawbacks. <br /> <br /> The first film was about fifteen or twenty minutes longer than it should. Secondly, the film need more research into the character of Harilal in. Where the character looks incomplete. In addition, his relationship with his brother was not specified. There was no mention of any other child Gandizhey in the whole film. I believe that the nature of how Harilal must be at least having some differences of his brothers, as well as taking into account the nature of selfish Harilal. <br /> <br /> In any case, despite some shortcomings, I liked the movie. Recommended ...
