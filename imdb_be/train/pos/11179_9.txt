"Pet Sematary" is successful in two main situations. Firstly, it is a terrible horror film. Those that simply are not produced in these days. Secondly, it is emotional, intelligent film as a whole. So if you are looking for a chill, scares, horror and visually stunning setting, great acting, dialongs and terrible consequences; is a movie that you are looking for. Classic now and really a must see for any fan of Horror. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best adaptation to any of the King's novels. Events feel a bit rushed compared to the novel, but it does not mean that this is an underrated film is not complete Horror / Drama achievement. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is widely regarded as a very emotional and bloody time. The film captures the same sense, mainly because there is a great character development and you can feel the love relationship between its members. Then, when all seems to be happiness (technically happy because the name "Pet Sematary" does not offer appiness!) The tragic event changes the atmosphere of the film, now it turns very dark. The film has eerie feeling from the opening credits, but after Gage killed the movie is sad, gray, horrible. Dealing with the loss of a child is a son that could destroy the entire family life, and "Pet Sematary" proves this dramatically. <br /> <br /> The legend behind the Pet Sematary is a myth that no one wants to experience, but the sadness and despair lead emotionally shattered father to give him a chance. Sadly, the legend come true and the child Gage comes back from the dead. Previous meeting with descriptions pet cemetery was a tragedy, but this time it is something much, much worse. What happened to our family lives of all American? Pascow can prevent this tragedy? What a surreal nightmare? <br /> <br /> See "Pet Sematary", to watch one of the most touching, emotional horror movies lately. You will not regret. It works very well, although I did not dig the actor who portrayed his father. He did not seem bothered enough if the situation, asked him to despair. But that's just my opinion. Dennis Crosby really put performance and worked perfectly as a noble and tender mother. Gage was a strange child, even in their terrible parts. * Shiver *. In general, this is a great classic of all times and disturbing film that touches people's deepest fears ... the loss of someone you love, the dead come back to life, and a sense of despair. <br /> <br /> Something of course ... I do not want to be buried in a Pet Sematary !!
