1939 is generally recognized as the greatest year in the history of Hollywood, with more classic films released, than in any other, and John Ford directed three of the best, "Stagecoach", "Drums Along the Mohawk", and this wonderful tribute frontier days young backwoods lawyer destined eventually save the Union, "young Mr. Lincoln". <br /> <br /> with the world plunged into a war that America is afraid, but I knew that it would be drawn into the Abraham Lincoln was much on the minds of people, in 1939, someone who faced the same dilemma in their own life and won. On Broadway, the award-winning Robert E. Sherwood "Abe Lincoln in Illinois", with Raymond Massa physically dead-in the figure, played to packed houses (it will be removed in 1940). Carl Sandburg continued his epic biography, "Abraham Lincoln: The War Years" was published, and quickly became a bestseller. President Roosevelt often calls Lincoln in speeches, and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, became the most popular landmark in the city (the fact that Frank Capra made a good use of "Goes to Washington Mr. Smith" in). <, Br /> <br /> All of this was not lost on Zanuck, in the 20th Century Fox; as soon as he read the script Lamar Trotta in the early days of Lincoln as a lawyer, he appointed his "prestige" Production and appointed John Ford direct and Henry Fonda, to star. <br /> <br /> Fonda Sun want to play Lincoln; he felt that he could not do justice to the "Big liberator", and feared that the poor performance could damage his career. Even test removes makeup, in which he was struck by how it will look like Lincoln, he did not change his mind. According to the Foundation, John Ford, whom he had never worked with, cursing him royally, at its first meeting, and explained that he was not drawing Lincoln Legends, and the young «jackanape» country lawyer faces his first trial for murder, humiliated, Fonda took on the role. (John Ford offered another scenario of events, but the result was the same!) Obviously, they found chemistry together that worked, as almost all of their mating will produce "classic". <br /> <br /> In contrast to the introverted, melancholy, racked Lincoln «Abe Lincoln in Illinois," Ford's vision that shy but handsome young lawyer who made friends easily, and by his mother that he had lost, too young (as a result due to the pioneering mother who becomes an important part of the story). Injustice annoys him, and he says "common sense" to quell the violence, alternating with doses of humor. Both spectacle plays (unregistered) relationship with Ann Rutledge Lincoln; in the version of the Ford, a couple truly in love and committed to each other. After her death, Lincoln would often visit her grave, to share his life with her "spirit" (Ford theme will continue in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"). <br /> <br /> And murder is central to the film, and shows great talent and a star director. Fonda cleverly depicts Lincoln's inexperience, but seriously the belief in justice tempered with mercy, and Ford emphasizes the gap between the big city "intelligentsia" (represented by the pompous D. Donald Meek and his slippery "adviser", Stephen A. Douglas, who plays a young Milburn Stone ), and informal, usually bending sense of Lincoln country. With Ford «regular» Ward Bond as a key witness, the court at the same time unconventional and riveting. <br /> <br /> With the closing of the film, Lincoln walks away in the turbulent region, and its fate (for the purpose of dissolving the statue at the Lincoln Memorial), the audience could take comfort in the film's message that if the cause is just, good to finally win. <br /> <br /> «Young Mr. Lincoln" is a really great movie with an amazing year!
