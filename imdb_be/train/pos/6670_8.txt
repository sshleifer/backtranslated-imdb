There are many problems with Mystery Men. First of all, there are too many characters for each of them difficult or even interesting personalities should be given. Special effects detract from the story, and not so special. Paul Rubens lost in a pathetic, juvenile role as a character who just farts and says in inaudible accent. <br /> <br /> Currently, the decent part. William H. Mays, three heavenly words, and his performance as a shoveler is a perfect step. Sphinx is an extremely funny character who is only the mysterious and simply regurgitates the traditional mystical sayings. Ben Stiller is very funny as well, showing a weak character, trying to turn it into the big leagues of superheroes. All the characters are doing, and this is an area which I found ironic Particuarly. This is because all the actors are Indie film actors are trying to turn it to the big leagues of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> To be honest, so I thought that he was not on hand, America doesn "t get the irony. <br /> <br /> In general, I really liked the movie, but I feel that it would work better if more effort were put into the script, instead, CGI landscapes and unnecessary effects.
