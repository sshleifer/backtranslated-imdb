Say what you will about sentimentality. One beauty of the film is that it is not pro-American. This is the morality of some Americans called to the high end, and they went up on the ground. It inspires, because it is a noble goal people. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the most interesting part of the movie is to educate Fanny and David Farrelly (mother and brother Bette Davis). Fanny says, "We squeezed out of the magnolia." <br /> <br /> In today's political climate, which led to the president who shamelessly lied to us and used 9/11 to withdraw the worst human characteristics, we have sunk to the level of the 9/11 killers seek murderous vengeance. It can not all be blamed on Bush - in the end, we let him guide us in this direction, and even re-elected him after his lies were exposed. . Now, with good reason, we Americans are reviled around the world <br /> <br /> Today, we look at the film with a new understanding: What is the coming to power of the Nazis in Germany was not due to a defect in the German character but a lack of people, allowing us to rationalize all that will meet our commit immoral and disgusting acts. I'm not comparing Bush Adolf Hitler. But I show how a leader can whip us into a frenzy of fear, hatred, and hyper-nationalism do disgusting things. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for its own agrandizement, no matter how immoral, like most leaders of our country, those who support them and those who buried their heads in the sand so deep that they can not even be bothered to vote. <, Br /> <br /> film as the clock on the Rhine reminds us that we once aspired to be - a force for the betterment of mankind. - and that we have it, we again aim for high goals <br /> <br /> Jeff
