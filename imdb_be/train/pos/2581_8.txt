People are too hard on the film. Sometimes we need to just sit back and enjoy the story without trying to "revise" it. <br /> <br /> All of this comes together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger, but the goal is still going down. Then the fun begins, as all of it as "going down." <br /> <br /> Just think of JFK and all people involved in any way with his murder, broken lives and questionable ways, and you'll appreciate what is meant in this film. <br /> <br /> I think it's a great interpretation of what is likely to happen. While EXACT storyline has not been performed (retroactively here after reading Jim Maar «Crossfire»), but this is what is meant by that is of interest. <br /> <br /> I would like to receive a copy of this review it again. In the light of what is known today, Domino Principle on the right.
