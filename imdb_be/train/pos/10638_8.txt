When I think about this movie, all the adjectives that come to mind, one way or another connected with the physical consolidation of peace. Texture, smell, color, that, as I think that this film should be evaluated from the point of view. See rich gold tones, surround young concubine asleep by the fireplace, or severe Turkish bath and let it flood your senses impressions of spices, coarse cloth, smooth skin, aromatic oils, flickering fire, the rustle of satin. Not only to watch and listen, to be absorbed, let the voice of the narrator is buzzing mesmerize you.
