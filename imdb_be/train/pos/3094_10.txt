This is the best and most original shows seen in recent years. The more I look, the more I fell in love with her. The cast is excellent, a record high. I personally like each sign. Nevertheless, there is a favorite character of all, as there is a good mix of people and backgrounds as well as in real life. I believe that ABC did bear a writer, actor and the potential audience of the show to cancel so fast and not advertise it enough and did not give him a real chance to get a following. There are so few shows I watch more TV as the most terrible. This show, my view was right up there with my favorite Gray's Anatomy, and brothers and sisters. In fact, I think that the same audience of brothers and sisters will love this show, if they even knew about it. Why always the loser shows that get so much extra time and winning the show with great potential always get dumped once. I'm so tired of reality shows I do not watch any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for the show, and then hire a great actor, the show was very promising. A recent episode was one of the best yet as everyone started to really get into their parts and make the show so real. Please watch this video show on ABC, and let ABC know what you want to show it back. Please sign the online petition ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
