Just a comment on the New Orleans accent ... <br /> <br /> An earlier reviewer noted: "This film could be shot in New York, or another large northern city, because it gives us characters that they say more like a «broklynese», than, perhaps, a southern accent could be heard in this part of the country ". There was also another comment along these lines from the English reviewer. <br /> <br /> A lot of people in New Orleans do, in fact, the sound of «broklynese». I never found out why. (This is referred to in "Collusion Dunces' by John Kennedy Toole.) I always appreciate movies that take place in New Orleans, which include this detail, as this one did. Too often, it's just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent.
