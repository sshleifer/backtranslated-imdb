The director and two stars LAURA (1944) had again agreed to this solid policier: Dana Andrews, the son of a criminal, becomes a cop to cut all ties with the past, but can not keep their ancestral violent ways to check in during the interrogation of suspects and, one night, he comes too far away; Gene Tierney is the former wife of his victim, decorated war hero who became associated with the city's leading racketeers and Andrews No. 1 nemesis, Gary Merrill (who himself was a protégé Andrews SNR.)! As usual with Preminger, it is a well-crafted film with a notable sequence of the opening credits and lively good cast that also includes Karl Malden (in Andrews' operating above), Tom Tully (as a motor-mouth dad taxi driver Tierney), and Neville Brand ( as the chief bandit Merrill), with considerable support also comes from Craig Stevens (as the mucosa, the wife of the victim of the beat), Bert Freed (as Andrews nice partners) and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrews stern outgoing above), was already warned last to or corrected, Andrews panics and adopts Stevens for Nek lkih hours after his murder, to put the police on (in this case) is wrong tracks Merrill; However, after Tully becomes the prime suspect (still Andrews and Tierney romantically involved), a police officer is himself in the den Merrill fully intending to get confronted with, and "frame" racketeer for his own murder! It is obvious that the main character is a complex character and Andrews rises to the challenge with the characteristic of the first course, which is usually complemented Fox noir style of the house.
