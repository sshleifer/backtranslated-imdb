** Warning Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best 90's movies. It was an amazing achievement for everyone involved, especially Liam action Nissan, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones wrote a beautiful portrait of honor and shame that a man may be on his own. But alas ... <br /> <br /> it constantly and unjustly received than "Braveheart." These are two very different films, probably just like the fact that they are both about the Scots in historical Scotland. However, this comparison is often bothers me, because it seems almost to suggest that the "Braveheart" a better film than "Rob Roy." I like "Braveheart" a lot, but the idea of ​​comparing it with the "Rob Roy" is a bit offensive to me. Speaking quite simply, I like "Braveheart", but it is a pale shadow of how much I love "Rob Roy." Here are my specific reasons ... <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" real people <br /> <br /> Let's face it, William Wallace in "Braveheart" is not a real person. He's a legend, martyr, larger than life nose. Because of this image, he is also a great man who never did wrong, and basically showing his countrymen Scot in the cherished land. When he finally does fail, it's not his fault. It looks like Jesus, he betrayed the very people whom he trusted most. He even goes through the worst torture because he wanted freedom so much. <br /> <br /> Figure Wallace is very well done and effective. But it certainly does not inspire or intrigue me. I think people ambiguity is much greater than the human boxing excellence. That's why "The Last Temptation of Christ" best film than the "King of Kings", and it is also one of the reasons why I think that "Rob Roy" is better than "Braveheart." Rob Roy can be a hero and brave, but he is far from perfect. He makes a few mistakes, which have affected the lives of many of their loved ones. Now sure, having no false claims against the Duke of Argyll was an act of generosity and courage, but it is also an act of selfishness and self-focus. Let us not forget that the family that he claimed to protect homeless driven to the end of the movie because of this act. But Rob did everything I could, and it was everything you could ask him. <br /> <br /> Rob's wife, Mary, is also normal, ambigious people. Let us begin with the way she looks in this film. Sure, she's beautiful, but she is not wearing makeup, and it basically allows its natural beauty to show. Compare this with the two lovers (or one, depending on your perspective) William Wallace in "Braveheart." Now these two ladies hot, but it is unlikely indicitive women looked at the time (especially the layman). Maybe not a fair comparison, but it's another example of how attempts to Rob Roy for accuracy are much more effective. <br /> <br /> During the "Rob Roy," Mary live with his vicious rape vile carrion, Cunningham, she feels compelled to say to Rob her fight, but not because she knows that Rob must avenge her rape . This revenge, of course, means the death of Rob and Mary are not ready for such a sacrifice. <br /> <br /> villains in "Rob Roy" are just as compelling. Although the enemies in "Braveheart" well written, they are hardly original. Robert Bruce, a man as brave and cowardly, suffering from moral decisions, all of which are familiar in the fictional kingdom. Should he accept his claim as King of Scotland, and he shall give Wallace, in order to ensure the safety of his name? Bruce is the most ambigious character in "Braveheart", but by Brutus in "Julius Caesar" in Fred's «The Godfather Part II", these types of characters almost original. Longshanks, although a convincing villain in his own right, a very one-dimensional. He is an epidemic evil tyrant and his path stands in direct contrast to the heroic Wallace. <br /> <br /> «Rob Roy" has three villains are great in their faultfinding. First of all, let's start with the Marquis of Montrose. He is a man who is so get your self-esteem that he wants an innocent person suffers because of this. "Look, I do not mocked," is his favorite word it "factor". He is a man receive power, upset that a man of great noble bearing, like the Duke of Argyll can be considered a great providency his. He shamefully selfish and dangerous. He is an evil aristocrat, but in such a way as to make it unique. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are accomplices in "Rob Roy," as well as the direct attackers Roy. Callarn so cunning in its cowardace, it is almost comical. He will do everything to maintain the goodwill of the Marquis, which includes Backstabbing and tricks. Cunningham is a strong character that he seems to have been raised to do everything he can to get the status and love of the Marquis. He needs a father, whether he knows enough that the Marquis of his real father. Therefore, when the opportunity to gain wealth comes from Callarn, he grabs him by not even questioning it. It is very similar to the evil of modern man, so self centered and vain, that he does not care about the consequences of their actions on others. <br /> <br /> Many have criticized the work of Tim Roth in the film, as a replay. I'm talking garbage. It is clear that Cunningham is not just evil, but also a psychopath throughout the film. In a world where man and his stepson could pass shooting random people for fun, it's too much of Cunningham incredible character? We live in a society where people seem to have reduced the value of human life. "Rob Roy" simply teaches us that the only circumstances that diminished the value has changed. This problem throughout human history, that the vanity of the human heart would not allow the capacity for compassion. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that good will win, but the snake will always exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Another sign, which I find fascinating is the Duke of Argyll. He is a true aristocrat, and its values ​​of honesty and civility in direct conflict with the Marquis. He appreciated the courage of Rob Roy and Mary, and has a direct nuisance to the Marquis and his factor. It gives hope to the world for people power. Hopefully, people like the Marquis, are the exception rather than the rule <br /> <br /> -. The final duel in "Rob Roy" is more exciting, then 10 of the fight scenes in "Braveheart» <br /> <. br /> One thing I'm tired of people say this to me, that the "Braveheart" is the best movie of the battle scenes. First of all, the battle scenes are hardly original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator," Hollywood has a long tradition of historical European martial scenes. "Braveheart" is one of the best battle scenes ever caught on film, but they suffer from one major problem. These action scenes have no context for the struggle for freedom, except. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong, fights hardly original either. In fact, there are probably 10 times more movies with fights, as it is with the battle scenes. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy beauty to behold. This is one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. Let me explain why ... <br /> <br /> First of all, fighting style and bearing of the two characters in this game to describe the characters perfectly. Cunningham effette and dangerous, Rob Roy is a strong and courageous. Cunningham uses the fencing sword, and Rob uses his sword. Cunningham is struggling with fast tricky movements, while the style of Roy's fight is more obvious. <br /> <br /> Total film, from a deliberately slow first half of the exciting second half, leading to this moment. It is powerful stuff, and it's clear that the robes must destroy this menacing evil that plagued his entire world. When Rob finally gets the upper hand (in the literal and figurative sense) is one of the greatest moments in the history of cinema. Rob wins, because he has to live longer, and his honor is more powerful than the 10 Cunningham. The use of music is absolutely frightening in that scene. Well preferred against the real evil is more powerful than me to see the man get gutting the only way he can shout "Freedom!". But wait, maybe it's just me <br /> <br /> -. "Rob Roy" is more realistic than "Braveheart» <br /> <br /> I do not know what people in the aristocracy or the Scots say, people in "Rob Roy," but I feel that it is obvious attempt to capture their speech patterns. I feel that many people get bored "Rob Roy," just because they can not understand what the characters are saying. If so, then read some Shakesphere, or put on close subtitles. "Rob Roy" is actually one of the greatest written 90s movies. Many of the dialogue in the film smart, but maybe you should watch the movie a couple of times to figure it out. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the dialogue in "Braveheart" is unlikely to be very interesting. Of course, what do you expect when the protagonist played by Scot Australian? It is a legend, and clearly did not attempt to capture it time. The film takes place over several centuries before the "Rob Roy," and yet they are saying, as people today. Thus, the reason why many people like it better. Audiences today are becoming more lazy, and they do not want to take the time or patience to understand things that are challenging. Therefore, as in many epic films, they expect to see a well-known villains speak English accent while characters speak in their native language, not too far from our American language. Of course, it is clear that Wallace Scottish, but in addition to sound like Scotty from Star Trek and a couple of "Yes" to confirm with the Scots in this film fit into the Hollywood tradition, we believe that the Scots should sound. <, Br /> <br /> Thus, these descriptions show that "Rob Roy" the best movie than "Braveheart"? Hardly. But if it proves one thing, it shows that it is hardly known that "Braveheart" a better film than "Rob Roy." Simply put, "Rob Roy" is a movie that has themes that are very important in the modern world. "Braveheart" is a film about the legend that inspires, but hardly realistic. You can decide what you think is better ... <br /> <br /> Class - A Score - 9
