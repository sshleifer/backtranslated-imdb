I think that this film is so good because Seyker wrote. and of course, Andrew Davis directed this ... Shia Lebouf provides high performance for his first film ... the plot is very cool and interesting ... has humor, heart rate ... and it is very similar to the ..I find this book the film to be at least a little sad ... I absolutely loved it ... and I urge everyone to read book..all around this film very well together and carefully ... two pretty good for me in every way
