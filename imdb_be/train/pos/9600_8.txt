This film is a touching story of adventure, adopted 15-year-old Darius Weems. Darius has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and even a non-curable disease that took the life of his brother at the age of nineteen years and is the number one killer of children in the United States. He and a few close friends travel across the country to Los Angeles in order to get his wheelchair customized on MTV, Pimp My Ride, one of his favorite shows. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The gang head west for a trip that all the participants will never forget. Darius gets a ride on a boat for the first time to ride a hot air balloon floating in the ocean and visit the attractions, he always wanted to see, such as the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection with the material. They do not make any money from sales of $ 20 DVDs. $ 17 goes to the study of disease and $ 3 goes to make more copies. The film won over 25 awards at festivals, and I agree with the quote provided by the film Variety, Â«Some stir the heart."
