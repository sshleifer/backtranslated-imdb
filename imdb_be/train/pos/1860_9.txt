I went to Antone Fisher, not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised. The current work on the Derek Luke was outstanding and the storyline was perfect. Of course, Denzel Washington made his usual fine job acting and direction. It makes you realize that people with mental health problems can help, and this film is an excellent example of this. Do not miss it.
