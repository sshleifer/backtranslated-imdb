Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors in this country ever had, showed that he was equally at home with movies. With "Panic on the streets," Mr. Kazan gives us an early version of what would come later, perhaps with its main part, "On the waterfront" although both films share only water option, as they are different visions of the various items. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan shot on location in New Orleans. Daniel Fuchs adaptation of the stories Edna and Edward Anhalt, who are the backbone of the film, is remarkable in that it takes us to the place, no tourist dared to see while visiting «The Big Easy». One of the biggest advantages of this film is an excellent black-and-white cinematography by Joseph MacDonald, who shows in New Orleans at its best. In addition, music by Alfred Newman and Billie Holiday song gives the proceedings a nice touch. <br /> <br /> This movie could be filmed in New York or another big city of North, because it gives us the characters speak more as a «broklynese», than, perhaps, a Southern accent could be heard in this part of the country. <br /> <br /> One comes clear in the film, Jack Palance, debuting on the screen, the screen glows every time one sees it. He was so strong! At the same time, this cool guy shows his gentle side, when he goes to see his sick partner, unknown to him, struck a fatal disease. Black, comforting the man caresses his sweaty face and hands are working on the sebaceous hair dying selflessly. Characteristic also is the fact that Mr. and Mr. Palance Mostel likely to do their own stunts, something so refreshing, because both actors make it seem real. <br /> <br /> The film is also a normal side with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the film. We see a family man painting furniture with his young son. Later, he and his wife are discussing, as it seems that they can not make ends meet from his wages, then, that many families have to deal with on a daily basis. Widmark playing a normal person is not as effective as when the actor plays a more artful and intense people. Bel Geddes as a wife, it sounds as if it is a suburban woman from the state of Connecticut. <br /> <br /> The film is enjoyable thanks to the direction of Kazan and the excellent cast, working in cinema.
