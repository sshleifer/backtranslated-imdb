Loved it, but still have nightmares about the hotel manager.The movie, was presented well, with the choice of actors, who carry out their role in the writing. Many of the scenes captured the imagination and created a nail biting. Progression situations were skilfully written, making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on something that I thought I might be obvious. It is a pity that there should be commercials.I told many friends to watch for further demonstrations, and of course I'll be watching the movie again.I enjoyed the scenery and felt that this added to the conspiracy and intrigue. Spouses heated discussions (or should I say, the fighting?) Were very realistic.The initial situation is common, but the escalation in the history presented, fortunately, it not.I want to thank everyone who participated in this great entertainment film. Thank you! I look forward to the next film --- when? Whidbey
