Most of the feedback I have heard regarding Meatballs machine was rather mixed. The pair even say that they think "it sucked." Well, to those people I say, get the f @ ckin presentation and go f @ ck yourself. It was a very interesting film. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical bugs that attack and somehow transforms its hosts in the Gwar-suit, looking, deathbots called Necroborgs. In the end, you will know that these mechanical errors also attach little parasite on you, which can then control their actions because of the hot wiring your nervous system. Unfortunately, for the love of two young people looking for a single, they come crossed with a mechanical error, and before you know it the transformation taking place and blood is splashing. Is there a way to stop the transformation? It may be a way to stop this threat to mechanical errors? Why Necroborgs war with each other? There are two desperate singles get to express their feelings for each other and do the nasty? Only one way to find out. <br /> <br /> Going into Meatball Machine, I was kind of cautious because of mixed reactions, but it turned out to be a big surprise. Several unanswered questions, some average of the current at the time and a little confusing ending only weak point I can think of. Anime feel to it, the parasites become little characters themselves, and even the budget feel depressed, this film hits the right mark much more than it misses. With the ever-evolving story that is interesting enough to keep yourself asking questions across mixed with cool make-up effects and blood spatter, it is one flick lovers Bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / spray fan should check out. 8 cleaned 10
