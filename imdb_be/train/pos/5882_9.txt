In Mexico, the film was only shown in PAYTV. life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, is a true example of a good German, and especially, a good man. Conversations between the character and Tukur Nazi prosecutor is specially interesting. The true war of ideas: two different Germans, and with faith in the faith. Bonhoeffer was a very complicated man: a man, a freedom fighter, a friend, a priest and a great intellectual; Tukur is outstanding as Bonhoeffer. I recommend this movie a lot, especially in these difficult times for our planet. In Mexico, we do not know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer life and heritage, it is a lot of work to rescue the forgotten hero.
