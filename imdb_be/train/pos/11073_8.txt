I never knew about the film, to cause such a discussion in my life. Believe me when I say that this film will eventually be remembered as a permanent classic. I waited in anticipation of the film, as I used to love as a card, money .... and vagina, but after some of the negative reviews I thought I would be very disappointed. I absolutely loved this movie and I can not wait to see him again. This film is completely different from the two aforementioned Ritchie's films, as well as much better. I have a selection of his favorite directors, but none of them took a step as large as Guy Ritchie just done with this film. I believe that he took the film to a new level of solutions (I know that most people will laugh at this comment guaging reaction to this film, but I believe that time will show me correctly). This film is very complicated and led for much longer than 2 hours or so of working time, as I could not stop thinking about it or trying to single things together. Now I got a pretty good look at everything that happens in this movie (some answers from the endless hours thinking, reading some of the responses from the other person to take on the film) and now can not wait until Sunday, when I see him again. I just hope that people go to a movie with an open mind, and they will, we hope, will be rewarded, as I and many others have been.
