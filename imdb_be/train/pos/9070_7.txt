He started slowly after a great animated screensaver, as a director had a bunch of characters and school development. After the bet on, though, the film picks up the pace as the race against the clock to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm. We had a good chance on the way home to discuss some things with our son :. bullies, helping others, mind over matter, if you do not want to do something <br /> <br /> Of particular note is the girl playing Erica (ARC): Hallie Eisenberg. Director sneaks like her suddenly, and when it is on the screen, it is captivating. She's one of those "Hey, she looks familiar" face, and then I remembered that she was a little girl, that Pepsi signs about 8 years ago. She, too, was «Paulie», the film about the parrots, who is trying to find its way home. <br /> <br /> Ms. Eisenberg made a lot of television and movies played in '99 -00, but then was not seen much in the next few years. She is now 14, and grows up to be a beautiful woman. Her smile is really warms up the screen. If she can get a few good roles she could have a good career (or better?) Than Osment, three more names for the child actor, but, I hope, without some of the problems that Osment has been lately. <br /> <br /> Anywhozitz, in my 8 years old son, who has just finished reading the story, the film does not seem to follow the book all that well, but it was not interesting nonetheless. The ending of the film, it seemed like a great setting for some sequels (How to Eat Boiled Slugs? Style snails baby?), Which may not be such a bad thing. It was nice to take the family to the movies and do not have to worry about language, violence or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Another aspect of the film was good respect / fear born mainly Mr. burdock (templates). Movies are now, as a rule, the figures show adult authority like clowns. While it does have one particular dull scene, he led the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin gets some work.
