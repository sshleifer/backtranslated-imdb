<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately, not lately. Nevertheless, engraved in my memory has never left me, there is a scene in which Mickey Rooney - "Killer Mears" knows that he should be executed, and it is getting closer to the moment of truth, he dances, and cries and laughs he fluctuating from hesteria euphoria and runs the gambit of emotions ever. I have never seen such a brilliant performance of any actor living or dead, past or present. That's when I know that Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was and is a great actor of genius. Nevertheless, I have all this, my opinion is his thinking, of course, I have to be alone in this view for many years. About 15 years or so, after I saw the film for the last time on TV, I happened to read an old Q & A section of Los Angeles Times. The question was put Laurence Olivier, and the question was: "Mr. Olivier You are considered one of the greatest actors of all time, which is then whether you consider to be one of the greatest actors of" His answer was, "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney," I was shocked, but not surprised. I immediately flashed back to his "killer Mears," and I felt very good, I saw this great ability to him, and now that, in my view supported by another whose work I have admired .. Later, of course, was, "Bill "and many other great moments with Mickey Rooney. The film,« The Last Mile »should razglya Azzano all current students. To be honest, I can not remember much about the film after all these years, but Mr Rooney in it, will never leave me. If anyone out there remembers this film as well, as I am? I would be interested to hear from you. For this etched in my heart, I gave him another 10 times on his face execution.
