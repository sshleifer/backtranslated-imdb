As already noted, I checked it after Siskel and Ebert listed this as one of the top 10 films of the year. What a gift. Then I went out to buy it, just so that I could borrow it. <br /> <br /> The best quote? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is on top of his cab. If the cell is peering down, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I scared you." Yoakum shoves a gun in the face of the Cage, "it looks like I'm afraid of?" Great little humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. <br /> <br /> There really was a sense of satisfaction from it. Permanent sighting "Welcome to Red Rock» sign is moan and shake their heads smiling. Music created hunting, terrible quality of the film, which is reminiscent of the "Twin Peaks". In contrast to the "Twin Peaks", although it does not spoil things too far in the country who are in need of "top" itself. <br /> <br /> I admit, watching the credits of 15-20 times. You can see that they were in Yoakum "thousands of miles from Nowhere» (excellent), elected to play like a freight train curved around down to the desert floor. , With the snow-capped mountains in the distance. It was unbelievable, crop fluids. In addition, I have never seen a better combination of image and sound on film. In addition, it fits perfectly into the story.
