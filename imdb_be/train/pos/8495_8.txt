Way, way back in the 1980s, long before, the NAFTA was designed and corporations have begun to shed its national identity, the United States and Japan in the throat of each other race in the world production. Remember, sayings like "Union For!," "The Japanese are taking the country through" and "Americans are lazy? <br /> <br /> In the Reagan era wound down and corporations edged towards the global market, directed by Ron Howard made one of several trips to the comedy genre with his 1986 smash "Gung Ho", which has attracted more than $ 36 million box office in the United States. Although obsolete in many ways, the story of Howard insincere face cultures in the workplace continues to offer the bitter truth for the industrial life today. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), the automakers union representative with Hadleyville, a small, depressed town in the foothills of Pennsylvania. Stevenson was invited to visit the Asan Motor Company in Tokyo (by analogy with the the actual Toyota), who is considering an operation in the United States: an empty factory with hundreds of city residents to work and the city bordering on collapse, Asan decides to move and Stevenson hired as a liaison between the officials of the company and the workers on the assembly line <br /.. > <br /> 112 minutes «Gung Ho» humorous look at these two ba s, with their strengths and weaknesses are equally considered: on the one hand, the American workforce that values ​​its traditions, but it is often caught in a frenzy of honor and syndicalism, on the other hand, the Japanese workers who are extremely dedicated to their work is not yet enough personal satisfaction and self-esteem. In Stevenson, we find the American working class figure average intelligence with skills for communication between people through misunderstandings. With the survival of jobs their employees and most Hadleyville line, Stevenson shows a nice guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance, but his mind will drown him in big trouble. In addition, responding to the Assan head, we see the delicate balance between Stevenson and his colleagues, union members, many of whom he grew up with. This includes Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro) and Paul (Clint Howard, Ron's brother). <br /> <br /> The Japanese cast is headed by Hedda Watanabe, aka "Sixteen Candles". "and" volunteers Watanabe plays Kazihiro, director of the plant, which is down on his luck, and begins to feel sympathy for the American life. He was always overshadowed by the Site (Sab Shimono), nephew of director Hasan, who was desperately trying to take his place in the hierarchy. Although, given a light touch, these symbols fare very well convey the idea of ​​the Japanese working culture. <br /> <br /> on the Hunt Stevenson dominant scenario, Michael Keaton should give good results etc. this film to work. "Gung Ho is really a slam-dunk success Keaton, who also teamed with Ron Howard in 1994« The Paper ». He made this film during a series of light roles, which included «Mr. Mom '' Beetle Juice 'and' The Dream Team ', before venturing into the' Batman, '' One Good Cop 'and' My Life '. It's also hard not to like the performance of Hedda Watanabe as a strange man who is the first Japanese tape shame before teaming up with Stevenson, to make the car factory cohesive unit. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast TOPA- expression, including Wendt, Turturro, Shimono and cox Yamomura like Asan CEO Sakamoto. Mimi Rogers delivers a romantic interest as Audrey, the girlfriend Hunt. Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz and Babalu Mandela came together to write a solid Gung Ho. Music, received the BMI Film Music Award, was written by Thomas Newman. Gung Ho soundtrack songs are wall-to-wall 80s, including "Do not get me wrong,» «Tuff Enuff,» and «Working Class Man». <br /> <br /> The success of "Gung Ho" in fact led to the fragility of the television series on ABC. While the more impressive as social commentary twenty years ago, a film by Ron Howard still has its comic value. It is available on DVD as part of Paramount Widescreen Collection and slightly inferior. Audio options are presented in English 5.1 surround, English Dolby Surround, French and "dub", but subtitles in English. There are no extras, not even a theatrical trailer. On the plus side, the digital transmission Paramount pretty good, with a small amount of grain after the opening credits and high quality sound. Although a few extra it would be useful - especially that "Gung Ho was a box office success - there is little to complain about the film presentation itself <br /> <br /> *** 4.
