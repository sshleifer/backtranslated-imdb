Does anyone know the exact quote on "time and love," George Ede aka, Father Fitzpatrick in motion, it should have been you? He talked to Charlie and Annna in the church when they left? If not, I'll have to make a film. It was a great movie. I also loved Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I met my true love alone (I have the second half), and although I had the experience to meet him when I was least expecting it, I was not prepared for this kind of emotional relationship . <br /> <br /> Altho, we do not get married, I was not mature enough to give as much as I thought I would. I've got to calm down and took my love for granted, and he survived for 7 years. <br /> <br /> In the end he went away with insult, but we are still hurt and angry and at a loss about how it turned out. I had some very hard lessons to learn, and now we have each other 3 years. <br /> <br /> This film means a lot, because I am still waiting on the reconciliation with my friend and only true love. Now I can appreciate that the various feelings inside me and quotation parents Fitzpatrick rang true for me. <br /> <br /> I know when he had cured enough to trust me again, we will remarry. <br /> <br /> not ever complacent and accept the true love get! It was a hard lesson of my life. <br /> <br /> In addition, the music in this film and touched OUTSTANDING! This film DEEP and spiritually uplifting. True love is not worth the wait when it's meant to be, it will, no matter what it will be! Nothing is impossible, even if it is for another time! Thank you!
