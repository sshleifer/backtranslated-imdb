Nothing revolutionary here; just perfect, elegant, restrained film. <br /> <br /> GARDE A VUE limited almost exclusively to the gray police station, and basically the same interrogation, but the director Claude Miller (who made a great film this sweet disease, among others) intercalated spare glimpses of external tables in minimalist locale scenography. holding Miller, especially in the early stages, breathtaking, and wonderful treatment, so the inner core staging makes for interesting viewing. <br /> <br /> Ventura is very rich, as usual, changing the legitimate nature of that, on paper, it's a cliché: a concise, sober, weary detective to investigate the killings. Ventura lives a role that makes it absolutely plausible, even if the script allows us to virtually no access to its inner workings; the film ends at the moment, it seems that he will be forced to confront his failure for the first time. <br /> <br /> Michelle Cerro equal to the task, suspected child killer, who shrewdly spars with one thinking Flick. Exchange between them more often than not pregnant tension and aura constantly changing playing field for battle drain. character Serrault is alternately plaintive arrogant and cunning, and deplorable; then .... <br /> <br /> «message» of GARDE A VUE, if one were to look for one, is a condemnation of police methodology and the type of pressure that make police overly zealous in, if necessary, similar cases at the expense of justice. For most of its length, although the film is bright, if not more than the incarnation of how to turn a potentially hypnotic script binding set a disturbing drama ultimate cinematic economy. <br /> <br />
