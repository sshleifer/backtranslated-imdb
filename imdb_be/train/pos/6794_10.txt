I have read through most of the comments posted here and all I can say is that most of these posters has serious problems in life. This show, unlike most of the game show, it was fun. Mr. Shatner, whose diamond in all that he does, again became a hit show. He really bubbly personality shines like a lighthouse, where ever he goes. He is fun and makes you smile and that's exactly what the show is doing well. Dancers and issues round-about fashion, they represented only add to the appeal of the show. And despite the fact that there is a lot of money at stake, it's fun. Pressure (stress) that exist in the majority of game shows is not there. Several people who posted messages complained how long the waist with dancers and selected issues, and as a millionaire does not have a similar time wasters. All I can tell you that most of you missed the whole concept. The idea is to have FUN & play. There's something for everyone. Qustions, to test your knowledge, eye candy (dancers), suspense, perfectly cheerful personality Mr. Shatner ... well, if not bully the guy up, I feel bad for you; and if that's not enough, you can get RICH! I really miss the show. Of all the games shows that have ever been on, and be open enough, I hate game shows, this is one I really liked and really miss. The only other game show I ever loved was Match Game.
