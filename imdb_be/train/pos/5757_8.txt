This film can only take place in 1970 !! This is an amazing action movie in a small California town workers. Kinda mill or plant shutdown, so suddenly rampant misbehavior occurs on the streets! The townsfolk are tired! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent), travels to another city to recruit his brother, Aaron, played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vietnam Vet, who looks and acts a little ?? balance. He hangs out with a bunch of other surly Vietnam vet. They come to the city to clear it (they are substituted for), but by their good deeds, they are actually running gambling houses, asking for protection money, etc .. !!! It takes a while for people to catch, and in the biblical Cain and Abel showdown, Vincent has to take on his older brother. There's an interesting blue-collar cheap atmosphere of this film, which makes it interesting (note the rooster fights that stage!). Vincent almost too Angel in the role ?? he thinks so highly of his brother, he can not understand his commission of the offense he is charged in. He finally comes to life ?? his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, brutally shot in the back and he is beaten at his home. Kris Kristofferson is creepily effective as Aaron. He coolly denies any wrong doing, and even gentle cooing and talking to the young daughter of Vincent (she refers to it as Â«Uncle Aaron"), even if it threatens the life of her father, smiling all the time! Vincent Kristofferson and have good contrast chemistry with each other. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance, as "salon" the girl who attracts the attention of Aaron. It's a good 70-action movie, if you can find it !! It is not available on DVD yet ??
