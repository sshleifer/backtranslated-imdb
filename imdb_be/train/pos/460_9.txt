This is a great new series of crimes that combine three old stable supporters of British television (Dennis Waterman, James Bola and Alun Armstrong), as the retired detectives returned to help clean up the old case, under the leadership of the younger, career-oriented Amanda Redman. Three brisk, annoying old police make a brilliant team, using twenty years old methods of detection by the police, which has come a long way since then on - sometimes with the effect, at other times, to the dismay of his senior officers. Three drawn sympathetic, warts and all. There are excellent comic scenes and some very moving one, how each of the three must come to terms with aging and the legacy of its past. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first six-part series (we promised some more in the next year), each of the characters developed. Widower James Bola can not come to terms with the untimely death of his wife. Lothar Dennis Waterman learn to accept his role grandfather. And even obsessive Alun Armstrong helps her new friends to fight the demons of his past - and continue to take the medicine! While Amanda Redman encountered all too familiar conflict between having a life and career. Storylines were interesting, if rather strongly dependent on the wonders of DNA testing. But this interaction is the top four British actor, who made a series of unmissable.
