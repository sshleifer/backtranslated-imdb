I do not know, "Largo Winch" in the comics (or a graphic novel? I really do not know), but I must admit that the rumors about the agent / hero of the film, I expected quite something else than what I actually there. <br /> <br /> while it was stunning to see this in the first place, it was a pleasure to watch this step together. You could never tell exactly where it will go (some twists are predictable, but in general, you can never say for sure whether it was eventually happens). More than stellar performance by a lead actor and a very good supporting actors make it pleasant hours. Not as action packed as some might hope for or expect a film like this, but a very good mixture.
