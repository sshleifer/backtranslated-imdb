When Dick Tracy was in black and white, my father was not religious. Giving new meaning to the concept of color in movies, we offer a unique experience around the world of comics, and this is one of the few films that have succeeded in this, thanks to the serious scenario, a good direction, great performances (Al Pacino strange), and the most most importantly a powerful combination of cinematography, art direction and costume design. Using only the basic colors, the experience is quite different from anything we've seen before. And there is also quite successful Hommage all gangster movie genre, Pratically dead from modern cinema. In general, I see this film as a new attempt and a touch of originality to the film, which is largely based on the old and already seen formulas. 7 10.
