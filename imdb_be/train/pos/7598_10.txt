«Lost», «24», «Carnivale», «Desperate Housewives" ... the list goes on and on. This and a lot of other high-quality shows and proves that we are in the middle of the golden age in the history of television. «Lost» pure genius. Incredible layers of personal and psychologically viable, history, highlighted by a sublime cinematography (incredibly, to use this word in the description of a TV show), score killers, great performances and editing. Anyone who does not hooked on it, missing one of the most important artistic expressions in television ever. It may have its problems viewing only one episode a week, but the DVD format is really incredible way to look at it. I hope they keep it up (as I'm sure they do).
