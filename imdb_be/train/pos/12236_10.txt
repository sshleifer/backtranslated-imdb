I saw this film in 1959, when I was 11 years old at the drive-in theater with my family. <br /> <br /> Way back then, I thought it was very funny. ,, Although I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this amazing film so excited! I saw him this morning, "Turner South." As I watched, I was absolutely convulsed with laughter! "Matching Game" is a unique classic using the past century. If you are too young to have experienced a magical period in history, which produced the film, I feel very sorry. There is no way you can watch a movie like this and understand how they can (even today) to put such a beautiful piece of heaven in the "old-timers" like me. <br /> <br /> Having said that, all I can do is to respectfully request that the young people refrain from commenting on films like "Mating Game". <br /> <br /> Films, as was done for the generation that preceded the current group of his people. And as such, these films speak a completely different language than any of you can understand. <br /> <br /> In other words ?? If you do not understand the film addressing the problem, please do not limit yourself by offering comments that ?? open ?? It does not make sense.
