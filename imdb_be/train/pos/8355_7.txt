The film has a clear (albeit pointless and rude) mankind in its entire border corruption - prompt / lyrical score points to the comic side of his misadventures, and even when they are at their most gangster (as terrorizing a woman on the train), half-pathetic vulnerability is not lies not far (Dever sucks on her breasts as a child). Blier cuts from where Depardieu may be about to rape Dever, so we are never sure how to read clearly evident homoerotic aspect of their relationship - in any case, this incident is the beginning of their relative humanization (so that the film can certainly be read as of gay, although he can probably be interpreted as a pro-whatever you want). The film abounds with unwanted scenes and points of sexual politics, and probably best taken as a general cartoons on the weaknesses of both sexes, making fun of all the concepts of sensitivity and integrity, and the many points of possible strikes profundity on the basis that if you burn off enough shots, some of them linked to strike.
