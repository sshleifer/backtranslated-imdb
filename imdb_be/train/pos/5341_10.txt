Carol'S JOURNEY nice to look at for many reasons. Act Clara Lago, just amazing for someone so young, and she is one of those special actors who can say a lot of talk with facial expressions. Director Imanol Urbibe is tight and controlled film without a break in continuity, thus promoting the site at a steady pace with enough suspense to keep one wondering what's nest stage will bring. Scenario Angel Garcia Roldan is speaking of stories in the best case, that is, as it seems, when the main aim of the film in the end. The plot is unpredictable, but the events as they unravel quite logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film if to tell the story of the civil war in Spain, how it affected people. This was the main event of the 20th century, there is still little Americans know about it. In fact, in 40 years of teaching at the university, I counted about one student per semester, which even heard of it, much less anyone who could say anything comprehensive about it - and the vast majority of students were merit scholars, each of who says to a wealth of censorship in American education. So, in one way, this film is a good way to start studying this event, meaning that if one thread is pulled a lot of history collapsed. Evaluation of the film, therefore, in direct proportion to the amount of their knowledge. To view this film in another film coming of age film completely miss. Elbow Index Left considers seven aspects film-- action, production sets, character development, plot, dialogue and continuity of movie and virtuosity - on a scale of 10 is very good, 5 for medium and 1 for those who need help. Carol'S JOURNEY above average on all counts, except for the dialogue, which is estimated as average. AH average for this film is 9.3, raised to 10 if equated to scale IMDb. I highly recommend this movie for all ages.
