I loved this movie! I'm biased, seeing as I'm a big fan of Disney, but I really enjoyed. The action takes off running at the beginning of the film, and just keeps going! This is slightly different for Disney, they do not spend so much time on character development (my husband pointed it out), and there are no musical numbers. This is strictly an adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, whether young or old.
