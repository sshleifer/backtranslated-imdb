George and Kim traveling with their young son Miles to a remote cabin in upstate New York when their car hits a deer and swerves ditch.But, that seems to be just the beginning of the occurrence of misery is appalling way, where myth becomes reality and greedy spirit, half animal, half man Wendy to haunt a small town ... "Wendy's" Larry Fessenden is a reflection of horror film that often newcomers in this gloomy family drama.The actions are great, the characters are well developed and there are some to UCWC frosty moments.The subtle glimpses Wendy handled effectively and it is never clear what is real and the imaginary, or even if the story takes place entirely in Miles head.Overall Â«Wendy" my first contact with the work of Larry Fessenden and do not, of course will last.Give this film a chance, if you do not mind watching something unconventional.8 10.
