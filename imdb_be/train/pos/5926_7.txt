Sleepwalkers beings that drain the life force is completely out of people to survive ... but they can only use virgin (this does not explain why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one of those who has to feed his mother Mary (Alice Krige). He goes behind a cute Tanya (MÃ¤dchen Amick). Will it run? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this is a great horror film. Developing rapidly, a lot of blood and gore and good sense of humor. There are many references to the joke (once referred to Castle Rock) for horror fans. Krause also excellent (who would have thought that he could act after "Return to the Blue Lagoon"), as Kirge and AMICO. But I think this movie is annoying. <br /> <br /> It was written by Stephen King and his screen annoyingly vague. The Sleepwalkers never fully explained. Where are they? Why do they call it? Why son to feed his mother? Why do cats hate them and can kill them? What are their credentials after all (at one point Krause makes the car solution and the color and style change!)? Why do they need to be fed the vitality of nations? Why should it only be a virgin? Why son has sex with his mom? None of them does not explain the story of leaving confusing. It is really too bad, because these issues aside, this is a great horror film. Beautiful make-up and special effects, too. <br /> <br /> Quickly, the mountain and lots of fun. If only the script were better. It is also quite obvious sex scene between Krause and Krige was edited (you can tell) to get ranked R. I can only give it 7.
