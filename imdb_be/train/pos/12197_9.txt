It can be good, it was the final film noir of all time, not in Columbia Studios to cut out as much of the original Orson Welles. What we are left with a flawed but brilliant film, showing the preferred Wells talents as an actor / director and Rita Hayworth as a serious dramatic talent. <br /> <br /> Â«The Lady from Shanghai" is a film noir in this very intricate and hiss. Wells, with uneven emphasis reflects Michael O'Hara, a journeyman Irish, who, after a fateful encounter with a seductive, dangerous Elsa Bannister (Hayworth, in a great performance) finds himself almost makes taking a job as a crew member on her i (Everett Sloane ) yacht her crippled husband. Elsa, or "rose", as Michael likes to call it, plays an innocent, defenseless doll is very good, ensnaring O'Hara in its network. As fans of spending not a secret thing in the sea, a partner at Arthur Bannister in his law firm, George Grisby (Glenn Anders) comes on board. He was a strange, unreliable indicator that offers Michael a unique proposal: he will receive $ 5,000 to help Grisby of falsifying death Grisby, so it looks like murder. The plan for Michael to enter the technicality, and run in the sun with Elsa. But things do not go according to plan. <br /> <br /> Hayworth supplies us with one of the best Fatal beauty of all time in a very ambiguous figure. Sometimes she seems really vulnerable and childlike, others brutal, tired and difficult. Always she brilliantly beautiful, whether it is the situation for it to be dripping wet in a swimsuit or in black, waving a gun. Hayworth beautifully photographed here, and it is a far cry from his famous role of "Gilda". Her then-husband Orson Welles cut off her trademark auburn locks dyed blonde crop (anger Columbia boss Harry Cohn). It was a great marketing ploy, and he changed suits her changed attitude perfectly. It is not a pretty rock, that "Gilda" is here-instead it is predatory, black-hearted woman who sees the murder as a very useful option. <br /> <br /> The pairing Welles and Hayworth comes at a time when the couple had enormous difficulties in their marriage. They divorced after the film was made, so it is also a curiosity for the provision of some kind in a complex relationship. They are disgusting, not romantic, lovers of this, so it is difficult to assess, not if they had a real chemistry on screen. Of course, every meeting potent and full of unbridled sexuality, with Wells as a "scapegoat" (he even admitted it himself in the movie!) And Rita as double crossing baby. <br /> <br /> Wells character typical noir "tramp" with not a lot of sense. Wells voiceover is used, O'Hara did not use his brain is very "glad to think about it (Elsa). Wells used to play smart, charismatic guys, so that his place here as a close Michael unusual and very interesting. In fact, Wells was an actor of fine talent, and he pulls it well. <br /> <br /> Everett Sloane suitably slippery as Hayworth crippled husband. I wonder why he hires Michael. it is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically, so why did he invite "threat" on board? One explanation could be that Michael provides a "service" to his wife that Bannister is not in its crippled condition. There is, of course, that theory with a large number of consequences for the conduct of Elsa, before she met her husband (she was some kind of prostitute?) and Grisby knowledge of the most intimate secrets of Bannister now hinted at in a few scenes. <br /> <br /> This mixed, confusing film with a plot that eventually spoiled. We are more interested in a love triangle than the murder plot, as well as most noir. Wells gives us many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches, including the rightly famous "Hall of Mirrors" menopause. This beautiful scene, one end of which can almost eliminate the shortcomings earlier in the film and raise it to greatness. This is a fun house scene is visually stunning, with Dahl as painted feel to the set (apparently, Orson painted them myself). Subtle visual images are used throughout the film Welles enhances the story and make it a meditation experience. <br /> <br /> The dialogue scorching and intricate, beautifully delivered, alternately husky low voice of Rita and helpless, shrill little girl's voice. Hayworth proves its capabilities in this acting, and proves that she is the ultimate rock with a "noir". Sorry (only a small one, but Rita was a brilliant dancer), what she has done so many wonderful sparkling and still often forgotten musicals for Colombia in the 40s instead of dark-themed noir as it is. She was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show their talent. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
