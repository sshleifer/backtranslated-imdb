Another great foreign film that thoroughly trounces an endless crop of crud emanating from Hollywood! This is a story of life and living. No, definitely not the perfect little life so often portrayed in a completely artificial Hollywood films, but real life is complete with real characters each strengths and weaknesses as well as real people in our lives and ourselves. <br /> <br /> dynamics of all these lives, bound within the walls of the bath, and in particular his age owner, great, touching and very thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Sit down, relax, and shall be made in a simple and beautiful life. There is real wisdom to see this movie, if you just open yourself up to it. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
