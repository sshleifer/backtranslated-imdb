This movie was awesome. It is an inspiring part of the movie. Characters are fully developed through the truth, in which the director Lucy Walker brings to the film. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for that special film which shows humanity in the human condition. Lucy Wlaker shows the beauty of the landscape. This film is an example of the true identity of man against nature, and sometimes man against man. Inner turmoil and triumph huge in their area. Subject as Tiebtans look blindness as a sign of demons interesting. This film sheds light on a particular culture, which has never been demonstrated. Lucy Walker gave Erik Weihenmayer voice, though he usually was not heard. Thank you Lucy for being right for your Vison as a filmmaker.
