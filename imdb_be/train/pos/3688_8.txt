Magnificent film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. The film also cast some of the great actors of our time, not only from France but from everywhere <br /> <br /> My favorite segments :. <br /> <br /> 14 th District: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, arrives in Paris to learn French and to make sense of my life <br /> <br /> Montmartre :. there was probably not the best way to start this film than with this segment on a romantic Paris <. br /> <br /> Loin du 16ème: the image of Paris that we are more aware of after the riots in CITES. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time taking care of someone else's child (she was a nanny) than her own <br /> <br /> Quartier Latin :. So much fun to see Gerard Depardieu as «tenancier de bar" with Gena Rowlands and Gazzara discussing their divorce <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel :. Do not tell me that you do not like the mimes <br /> <br /> The Tuileries: such a pleasure to see Steve Bush as a tourist, which makes a high contact (a no- no) with the girl in the subway <br /> <br / > Parc Monceau :. Nick Nolte big. Ludivine Sagnier, too. <br /> <br /> I spend 3 days in Paris in 2004, and this movie makes me want to go back! <br /> <br /> We saw in Barcelona (the other big city), in Verdi, 18 May 2007 <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
