I watched the show 10 years ago and loved it !!! It is currently available to DVD and watched the series, and is waiting for the scenes that I knew were in the show (when Lucas confronts Gail in his house) and I realized that was missing - suddenly I was watching seduction without lead up. Then I went on line to check out all the BIOS stars and came across a comment on the show, which is fine. Thank you !!!!! But it seems that some kind of conflict. Some comments state "Strangler number 19, the triangle 20, when the other had them differently. Also potato Boy 5 and 6 dead world were eliminated as well. Can someone clarify ?????
