Italian surprise experienced film for its time. Terrific shot, with lighting effects that really elevated this early gem that shows clearly Reginald Barker to be a director equal a pioneer in D.W. Griffith and MAURICE Tourneur. How Thomas Ince control exerted over the production of hard to understand, but this film still has extraordinary strength. Simple story of an Italian immigrant, struggles to save his family to live in New York, is very touching. Themes of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness is quite relevant today. Using close-up is outstanding and the performance of the power plant of George Beba electrifies. What we need now is a really good print is transferred DVD, so that we can truly appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema.
