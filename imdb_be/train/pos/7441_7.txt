Personally, I despise Jerry Springer Show, however, I found the "arena", to be the funniest movie I've seen this year. Endless satire Jerry Springer "guests" from the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the film. Despite the short scene in which Jerry Springer makes a feeble attempt to justify their existence, I would definitely recommend this movie for pure entertainment value.
