20 of 10 This is really a wonderful story about the military evacuated and mean carpenter Tom Oakley. Boy (William Beech) is housed with Tom, and see immediately that he has a serious problem, if he wets his bed for the first night. William illiterate and frightened, but somehow the two find solace in each other's loneliness. It turns out that William has talent as an artist, and we see the talent of Tom choirmaster in a funny version of Jerusalem. William became friends with Zachary Wrench, a young Jewish man also from London and together with the two Tom and Zechariah, he finally learn to read and write, and to feel part of this small close knit community. Just as he calms down, William recalled to London by his mother, and it is here that we see why he was so fucked up. His mother is clearly mentally ill, and when Tom did not hear from William, he was going to London to see him. He finally finds him holding his dead sister, where he was tied in the cellar. After a period in hospital, Tom realizes that he has to steal it and take it home with you. The culmination of a bitter-sweet end when William said he should be taken of Tom, while at the same time learning his best friend Zahar was killed in an air raid in London. For me, one of the most touching scenes were when Tom spoke with an official from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. <br /> <br /> I like "IM, Ani, for what it's worth, I think he likes me too.Â» <br /> <br /> He's just not getting better, it is not so?
