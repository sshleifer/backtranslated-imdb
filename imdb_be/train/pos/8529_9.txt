I came across this movie on TV and could not turn it off. Peter Sellers plays the bad guy who falls in love with a very warm and lovely Goldie Hawn (who would not be?). Thus, the character Gold keeps himself from the very beginning of the film and the end is unconventional, even today. This film gave me a different angle in human relations, and I found it very funny. Peter Sellers role was hard to sell, but I think he pulls it off well.
