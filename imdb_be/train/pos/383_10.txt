This film captured my heart from the very beginning, when he heard the first notes of Quincy Jones, or see the beautiful color with purple flowers in the meadows. It's really a film to cry and die ...! The entire cast gives the best performance in the film I've seen in recent years, and Spielberg really surpassed himself! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh my!), Danny Glover and others, all of them give us your best, and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg Celie, she gives it to her insecurity and feelings of inferiority, which is necessary for the character, and we are growing with it, we are stronger, together with it, throughout the film, and we are happy with it. Margaret Avery beautiful as Shug Avery, even if it is at its most arrogant, and shows us that the "sinners", in fact, "is the soul too." Always helpful, charming Danny Glover is doing an amazing job to ensure that people hate it and very good music (I would say, sir) Quincy Jones adds even more beauty of this magnificent film! Photography, music, film director and musician makes this beautiful, soulful film in the experience of a lifetime. You do not want to miss it! "System" ... remember my name ... "
