All dogs go to heaven one of the best films I've ever seen. I first saw it when I was 3. Now I'm 12 and I rented it, it makes me think about things, and this brings so many memories, it was "days". I love music, I love it when Charlie arrives in Heaven, I love the song, "Let me be surprised." I love Charlie looks and his voice, Burt Reynolds was able to play only the voice of Charlie's great. I love this film, the first of them is the best choice because it is so original and beautiful. It really bring back memories that no one can describe, not even me. If only I could go back to those days. I love the characters. If so, the memories come back, when I was 12, imagine how I feel when I'm like 19, I hope that I will be able to watch it when I'm older. When I first saw it, I never knew what I really look at it and feel this way, I hope he will be available for viewing. I'm so glad that this film was made, and a strange idea came to the mind and heart. On a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a perfect 10. It's an amazing film. It's so hard to explain the feeling when I get older, and when I have children, I hope they can experience this feeling.
