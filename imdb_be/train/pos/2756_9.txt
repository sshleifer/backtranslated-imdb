I picked this movie up is based on a short story and quotes critics on the back of the box. I'm not big in foreign films, and did not know what to expect. I do not really care for any subtitle. But I absolutely loved it! It has a simple, attractive quality that leaves you feeling good about life. I found myself laughing out loud several times. I would recommend this picture to anyone, even those who hate foreign films with subtitles. This one makes it worth the effort.
