In my opinion, it is absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, my stepmother (voice Lucille La Verne) was really diabolical. You have to see the film if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that it has made a lot of housekeeping, Cinderella (voice of Ilene Stanley) was a very beautiful lady. For me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before we wrap this up, I would like to say that everyone involved in this film is very well made. Now, in conclusion, I would highly recommend this absolutely romantic masterpiece Disney all of you who have not seen it. You are in a good time to go to the video store to rent or buy, kick back with a friend and watch it.
