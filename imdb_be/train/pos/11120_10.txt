Wow. I loved the whole series, and I'm shocked comments of people who thought that ended badly. Maybe it's a little bit varied in seasons 4 and 5, while the rest is better than anything else on TV. But 6 and 6b were particularly interesting permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular of the first three seasons. <br /> <br /> 6B started with a gloomy mood and always insightful Janice tight in the family - the thoughts filled with rows of knowing Tony penchant for sitting and watching. Anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series do not know, Tony. Melfi discomfort of psychiatric research and its reference to the illusory sentiment sociopath for pets and animals dates back to the first episode of the series, for example, with a panic attack on Tony ducks, leaving its pool and resonates with Phil "wave bye- bye" before the line grandchildren coup de caress the final episode (so as not to fall into the black humor Chase). <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I'll just add that I thought the final show - starting with the opening of Vanilla Fudge strains to deliver ironic predict ( «You Keep Me Hangin 'On") to the terminal moments when Tony goes out back into complacency with his family in tow or explosions from each other as SUV AJ or head phyla were very, very perfect. The best TV ever. <br /> <br /> It is very good in a dying medium pathological delivering "jack-off fantasies» AJ pokes fun (and then, he quickly subsides). The tip of pork pies g Chase.
