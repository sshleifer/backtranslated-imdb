Pierce Brosnan took a last Martini and returns to the abominable self-parody, as aging Boozy foul-mouthed assassin Julian Noble, which has a particular fondness for teenage girls, bullfighting and sticky clothes. While working in Mexico he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a straight face suburban Denver business man, who is in town to make it a lot-a-life time in the hotel bar. Despite very different personalities, and crude oil and obscure remarks Julian, they become friends. <br /> <br /> In many ways, it made projections Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, directed by Richard Shepard showed that he did not write a movie with Pierce Brosnan in mind, but I can hardly imagine it without him. He is a real talent for comedy and can be more than just James Bond or Cold War spies. The scene in which the two meet in a glossy bar (gorgeous sets and beautifully photographed) is really a bravura piece of acting. The scene lasts about fifteen minutes, and although it is likely to carefully script, two actors largely improvising, but they manage to perfect! It feels almost like a new standard in the screen action. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel MEAN STEETS improvising and adding one of the thinnest basis of many genre cliches and own typecasting actors (Brosnan James Bond, in particular), and you've got one of the finest pairings in recent Hollywood, <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story wears thin after a while. An hour later, the film just runs out of steam. Nevertheless, I can not put a finger on it exactly, I really enjoyed it very much. It just feels very fresh and original, with some creative use of sets and lighting, as well as some hints on Suzuki Seydyun and Jean-Pierre Melville. The other characters are not given much to do, but this film does offer something new, in this respect, it is possible with almost no effort at all mixing traditional genres in a rather fascinating parody. So interesting. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
