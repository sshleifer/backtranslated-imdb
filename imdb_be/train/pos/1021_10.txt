The first and second seasons started staggered with good episodes sandwiched between the average and sometimes resorted to formulaic stories. But as soon as he began to create the universe in which it exists, and began to develop his characters more, it has become much more fun and interesting. <br /> <br /> The main reason for this is the success of his show of four people: Richard Dean Anderson, Deluiz Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullen. dry sense of humor makes Richard to show much better directing Peter perfectly and makes any episode so much more interesting, and Joe and Paul never make a funny, interesting episode together. <br /> <br /> Once you realize that the show and learn about character, I doubt that you do not like the show. For those who get into the show, I suggest that episodes of «The Other Side», good serious episode, and "window of opportunity", an episode of the classic comic relief.
