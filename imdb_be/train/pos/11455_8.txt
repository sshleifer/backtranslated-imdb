This German documentary in English, on the Scottish environmental sculptor named Andy Goldsworthy. He makes art from objects that he finds in nature. For example, at the beginning of the film we see that it takes icicles section and "glue" them together with a small amount of moisture in the serpentine shape that seems to be constantly going through the vertical rock. <br /> <br /> Of course, pieces of ice are melting, but transience is a part of most of the works in Goldsworthy. He goes to a website and get a feel for it, thinking intuitively what to do that day. He says there is a "dialogue" with stones and other materials with which he works, trying to work * with *, and not against them. This may be stones or flowers, or leaves, or sticks. The sculpture can last for a few minutes or years, or maybe even long enough to finish and photographed. The work seems to be more a process than a goal. <br /> <br /> The film, and the work is beautiful, inspiring and makes you wonder. It moves quite slowly, which is suitable for the material, but you must be sure to go if you had a good night's sleep. But do not go if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Search the web for some of the other pages of Andy Goldsworthy, or read about it in the local sculpture of Stanford University. There are also several books available with pictures of his sculptures <br /> <br /> My thoughts :. Skip reading this part, if you want to find what this film means completely independent from each other for you. I remember a few ideas that occurred to me while watching the movie, I thought I would share some of what you read. Firstly, the transitional nature of much of the work of Andy Goldsworthy reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life. We are born, we live, and in the end we die. It's natural, and it is also a natural part of the art. <br /> <br Goldsworthy /> In other thought was to be awed with how Goldsworthy has managed to combine his passion and his work so thoroughly in his life. Most of us have a job, which is carried in the best case, the life that we hardly notice the alive and the passion that we have really great to spend more time, even if we think that they are. Andy Goldsworthy managed to create an amalgam of all these aspects of his life, which looks like it works very well, and nourishing for him and the people around him. Wow. <br /> <br /> seen on 8/28/2002.
