I would give this show ten out of ten, if it was not for fart jokes. You people are so damn sensitive it is meaningless! So quick to point out the "racism" show and jokes, however, so too quickly tell funny sexist, pig-headed shit like "good spirit, some of these other shows make these jokes are much better because at least they have a hot woman. " So disgusting. Abortion joke is good because, really, who takes the abortion seriously anyway? At least I'm not boring * son. I heard that riba McIntyre and Sarah Silverman are teaming up to make a film about a sister who takes a trip together. It's about the movie of the year!
