It was one of the DVD, I recently bought a set of six under the name «Frenchfilm», to refresh our French to our planned holiday in the beautiful Provence this year. So far, as well as to improve our French, we have significantly strengthened our assessment of the French cinema. <br /> <br /> What a breath of fresh air in the stale, predictable, boring, Bang Wallop nonsense accidents while coming out of Hollywood, which is a good example for the writers, actors, directors and filmmakers to follow. It was so stimulating and see two identified characters in the lead roles, and without them being glossy magazine cover figure. <br /> <br /> Another thing I liked about this movie was the slow nature of the plot and build, who kept you guessing how it was all going to end. Is there really well in this selfish bandit, who always treats his seemingly naive benefactor to the type of neglect, which will reflect the ex-con? Will our sexual dissatisfaction poor half deaf character manifest itself in answer to her dreams and situations that fate gave her? The viewer is intrigued by these questions and answers actors unravel slowly and clearly as they face the events that challenge and to shape their feelings for each other. <br /> <br /> After you have seen this film, I can see it again. I have yet to develop a psychological motive directed at the support site as an officer of parole and some of the subtle nuances of the camera is worth a second look. The plot is really asking a little imagination when our hero gets the chance to help our heroine abuse and congested in the office. You will also need to be broad-minded faith in her shiny lips and reading as part of the action falls into place. But if you go along for the exciting ride on the example of French cinema in the best case, you will leave more than satisfied. Four stars out of five for me.
