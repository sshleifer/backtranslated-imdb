I agree with many of the negative reviews posted here, for reasons I will not go into the future. But this series is a powerful and compelling because talented cast really captures the dark truth of Hitler's world. <br /> <br /> Peter Stormare is ideal as Ernst Rohm, leader of the hard Brownshirt. Every scene he has with Hitler explosive! Hitler was so angry he dominates everything, but aggravated, primitive Rohm - and he obviously dripping Rohm precisely for this reason. Interaction between Carlisle Stormare and lights the way for Hitler savored brutality Rohm, but later donated it for political reasons. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone is in the good performance of both Raubal convicted niece of Hitler and of his inexpressible perversion. Without revealing any sexual dirt directly, Jena Malone plays out the full horror of the slow extinction of the spirit of a young girl. He uses her eyes and voice to offer all the horror that is visited by millions in the coming years. And it is brilliant! Zoe Telford almost corresponds Jena Malone with her portrayal of Eva Braun. Eva is clearly ill, tough and heartless - but at the same time, almost pitifully dependent on its curved tenderness Adolf. Interrupted lovemaking scene between them (referring to the spine tingling truth huge self-loathing of Hitler) is both scary and sexy. <br /> <br /> Lee Schrieber gives extremely good as a performance as Puoe Hanfstaengel, characterless people -O-city that seduced with promises of wealth and power of Hitler. While cattle as Rohm just likes the idea of ​​crushing skulls under the boots, the character Schrieber is one of many Germans taking Nazi violence but could not resist a quick and easy way to money and power. His limp fawning over Hitler soon loses his respect for his wife, he played with style and sensuality stunning and the royal Julianna Margulies. They provide a true portrait of marriage and infidelity. <br /> <br /> These performances wearing the mini-series forward, easily overcoming the shortcomings in the random scenarios. There is one exception. Unfortunately, the acting chops Modine simply not up to snuff. His noble chump-Haid journalist destroys every scene, he has - the viewer can hardly expect a brown shirt Remy stomp that smug, righteous look ignorant offensive, corn-tortilla low-rent Hollywood golden boy personality. But the story still works <br /> <br /> At the present time in relation to factual inaccuracies scenario. - perversion and brutality of Hitler are in a bright, exciting drama. But on the battlefield record Corporal Hitler was highly distorted. As if afraid that the audience can not cope with the idea of ​​evil and courage in one person, the authors make Hitler look like a whining coward who "begged" for the Iron Cross. It was as if someone in the army of the Kaiser could get a medal just whining about it! The film makes it look as if Hitler was a coward in the trenches when he was a fearless warrior. They also believe his friends despised him, when in fact he was widely admired officers and men alike. Disappointing that the mini-series successfully so well in presenting Hitler as a monster in honest ways - but they just could not resist a cheap shot <br /> <br /> In general, however, Hitler .: RISE evil is a soaring success is highlighted by strong performances.
