In fact, I have never bought into the metal was satanic and so on, but this film is partly played on this idea. Although, of course, is not a movie to take seriously or estimate is very high, it really serves its purpose in that it has a good time while he plays. History has a metal strip to burn in their hotel, one of his fans have a dream of this effect and the rim starts to go on the destruction spree from beyond the grave. So yes, a bit of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" story going on here. Presented Freddie never clung to the girl in the car earlier. There was another film with a heavy metal band in it, but it was very different, the way he played, as it was a group that took over the city view of children and make them wisely. This one has just one fan of the band kind of helps killer spirit first and then trying to stop him. Gruesome nothing in it, I do not remember all that many massacres. Frankly, the scene I remember most the scene of a girl wearing headphones and then be molested some creature incarnation of the band. Nothing great, but a good time filler.
