Not that many movies really exploited the fear of going to the dentist, that many people have. Those who are in the profession, there are some really Scary looking tools. Give writer Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon, and Charles Finch for maximum cosmetic You are a-squirm in your seat shock value of their premises. <br /> <br /> Burns, in the beautiful nuances of execution, Alan Feinstone, dedicated to the dentist, someone jumps off the train tracks in the early stages. Unbalanced obsessive-compulsive, he begins to dwell on thoughts of decay, even thought there is no where as well equate corruption decay of society as a whole. Seeing his unfaithful wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) to get it to their pool boy, he decides to punish her. At the same time he is under pressure from the insinuating I.R.S. Agent (Earl Boen, best known as Dr. Zilberman "Terminator" of the franchise) to do a favor in exchange for the agent to maintain his mouth shut about the financial affairs in Feinstone. Feinstone begins to perceive everything around him as decayed, anyway, and it goes on the spree killing as a police detective Gibbs (always welcome Ken Fori) picks up his trail. <br /> <br /> Director of the Union clearly has a lot of fun with the script. This allows for some really unpleasant and surprisingly entertaining gore scenes that make the same as creating sympathy for the victims, how exciting the audience. The script gives the character Feinstone some fine lines of dialogue and in general is quite tricky and fun, with large doses of humor pitch (for example, ordering Feinstone victim "to get your tongue out of the way!"). Brooke and I.R.S. Agent figure particularly effective scenes of torture. Effects makeup for the most part pretty good. And the film does an excellent job of keeping it moving forward, and Feinstone, with its relentless pursuit of excellence, switched with respect professional upset killer in record time. <br /> <br /> Fauré, always cool and fun to watch, rather wasted in the detective role of standard-issue, but there are some fun watching Boen play a role in a sack of shit handle. Hoffman and Christy Sauls provide a very attractive eye candy. And the glory of Mark Ruffalo can be seen in a small supporting role. But it's all very Bernsny show as he plunges his teeth (forgive me for using this expression) in its drains leading part of the general conviction. <br /> <br /> «Dentist" is one of the more original and interesting horror films to come out of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> 8/10
