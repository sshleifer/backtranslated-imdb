Spacecamp my favorite movie. This is a big story, and inspire others. <br /> <br /> act was excellent and my wife and I went to Leo Thompson Cabaret years later due to her work in film. Unfortunately, what the Challenger accident delayed and painful movie. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger accident goes up. I knew that one of the astronauts Challenger off and on since childhood on the Carnegie Mellon campus, where my father went to school; I also know a close friend of the deceased pilot. <br /> <br /> I was a technical inspection in the last year of the National BSO for the Boy Scouts of astronomy badge of honor, and I still find it a great movie Spacecamp recommend Scout makes space-related badge I teach. <br /> <br /> I ran again at the end of an astronaut as an adult and has been following the schedule of engineering education, we put together when the Challenger exploded. I wound up sitting in with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible", going through things after the accident at Astrotech shareholders meeting by chance, as a result, so I'm a lot closer to the accident, and any resemblance cinema. I'm sure I was a good student and graduated from a degree in four years, oddly enough, on the recommendation of the engineer Rockwell, who told them not to fly Challenger in 1986 and who later built the Endeavor.
