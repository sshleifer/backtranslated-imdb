Dark Angel cross between Huxley's Brave New World and love Percy in ruins - drawing is not very distant future, as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order, in the worst sense of the word. After one swallow the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a stop on the "pulse", it provides entertainment landscape for the study of personality and the relationship between the two main characters - Max (Dark Angel / bike messenger) and Logan (rich rebel) . It seems uneven, possibly the result of different authors, but held together by a vibrant, beautiful and charming Jessica Alba, who seems to be as strong and corn still vulnerable and sensitive. I think that Fox has done it again.
