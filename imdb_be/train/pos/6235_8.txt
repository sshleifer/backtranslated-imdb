This is one of the best films of Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers, or at least one of my favorites. Most A-R movie has great dancing, but juicy romance stories. It is still courting corniness, but not as pronounced as other movies. <br /> <br /> In this film, there is not only the big dance, but charming character and a lot of good songs. Music is a central theme here is nice, the addition of a solo Rogers crane. She was not only a super dancer, but a very beautiful woman and one with a huge figure. She dances with Fred, of course, and they are always fun to watch a couple on the dance floor. <br /> <br /> Growing up in the 1950s, there is a "Ozzy & Harriet" on television, it was a real hit for the first time I saw it, to see such a young Harriet Hilliard. Not surprisingly, than Ozzy fell on this beauty. Despite the fact that it was that short early 30s hairstyle, I recognized her voice immediately. In addition, in this film the rapid emergence of Grable and Lucille Ball, but I must admit that I am still with Ball. I can not find it, but I know that she is here <br /> <br /> Aster, for some nasty chewing gum in the first third of the film, with the exception that was interesting to watch and Randolph Scott. - at best westerns - nice, well <br /> <br /> It's just a nice, feel-good movie and a good, if you want to enjoy the great talent Astaire and Rogers ..
