Several years ago, I did follow the soaps on TV. So I was curious about this film, and I was rewarded because of his stay. It is a marvelous spoof soap, jealousy, uncertainty about the usual actors, and all sorts of outstanding incidents. But most of all - an amazing cast and an incredible script. How does someone get all these top-notch actor playing such a stupid movie like? And how did this little film to get a writer to write the perfect line? I've never heard anyone talk about this movie or even acknowledge having heard about it, but that's fine, and I highly recommend seeing it. Sometimes I throw it, making cleaning and eventually sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and enjoying all the beautiful thing. Many congratulations to all those who made it.
