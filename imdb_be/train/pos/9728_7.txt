I'm a big fan of Simon Pegg and watched a lot of his movies so far, and none of them have ceased to make me laugh. Also, do not How to Lose Friends & Alienate people. <br /> <br /> This film is, in fact, a good man, how to write people off. However, he has an innate set of ethics, which prevents him from doing something that might just make it known. But in the end, it ends up making them a culture of life. <br /> <br /> The film is well-tinted with humor, romance, good acting and a little lap dance. Its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends.
