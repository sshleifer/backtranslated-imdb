Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and features James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This film was James Stewart and Kim Novak in his second on-screen pairing (after Alfred Hitchcock classic Vertigo, released earlier in the year). It was the last film of Stewart as a romantic lead, as he was considered too old at the age of 50 years old to play like that part anymore. The film is about a witch, played by Kim Novak, who is committed to mortal played James Stewart. She fascinates him and he falls head over heels in love with her. I enjoyed the movie and its actors. This film was then weak success, which was nominated for a Golden Globe for best comedy film. GimmeClassics
