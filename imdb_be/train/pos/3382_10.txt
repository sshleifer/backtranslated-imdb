It's not often I have the feeling of a movie it may be visionary. But it is clear that this film is the seed of apprehension. <br /> <br /> We should not, as a rule, and the alarmists see Armageddon in something because it seems to respond to our emotions of the moment. But, do not we talk about this in "1984"? If James Orwell known on the Internet is becoming a reality long after 1984; In fact it was in 1994; he could have reconsidered to write his story of how he did it. Rear rewarded. <br /> <br /> It does not matter. What really matters is that we often consider themselves superior to our surroundings, but actually become emotional about the "love apple" when necessity knocks at our door. A picture of herself as an adult. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the time line will be for us, I know that we have not seen the beginning of another. <br /> <br />
