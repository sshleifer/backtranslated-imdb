I must admit that I did not expect so much going on in this film in my view Japenese class movies, but this film really blew me away. The director does an excellent job of following through with the title of his film, really painting a picture of madness. I think the fact that this film holds back adds to the similarity of madness, helping the viewer the experience of the inner world of the characters, not the world outside of your mind. This film only added to my feelings about foreign silent films against America, that foreign films are much harder to implement your mind and make you think, and do not follow a fluffy movie always has a happy ending, the exercise of the imagination is very small.
