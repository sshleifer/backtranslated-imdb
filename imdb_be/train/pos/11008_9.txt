You'll notice the stars I gave this great film that "... before you see it for the first time," we have in mind. I had never heard of this movie happened through this because this week (and last) was very slow rental experience (not very big coming in). I do not know how this film slipped past me I love Lucy Liu and North is too large. However, it was done. <br /> <br /> This film is an amazing example of what to do if you do not have a big budget. It was just the right amount of plot and dialogue to make it a very interesting and keep the audience in the dark; just enough. The whole movie you (the viewer), trying to figure out a lot of areas of twists and turns. I would give this film 10/10, but some of the shots were quite false views. I do not believe that against this movie too much, but I do not think he deserves the highest score. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think it's very underrated as a serious talent. Nevermind her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her role seriously and does not rely on her looks to guide it through the rocker complex emotions. And it may seem cold and lifeless, even if it is necessary as well. <br /> <br /> North is doing very well in the first place, as a completely geeky corporate rat, ready to run through any maze to prove himself. However, as it changes throughout the film, it's like night and day. I know that some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law, and the other contenders to become the next James Bond will hate me for this, but Northam b / may / must match the bill. He was courteous and cultured. He has a great voice and posture Bond. I think it can also be cold when the situation calls for it, but rather down to earth as well. <br /> <br /> Great film, of course, the movie-lover recommends it to be seen at least once, if you like corporate espionage films.
