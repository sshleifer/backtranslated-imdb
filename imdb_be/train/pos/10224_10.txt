... and I mean it. If not literally (in the end, I have not seen every movie ever created!), At least apparently, among them, much as I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? Typically it from IMDb: Movies are sometimes very high (for example, a piece of Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap called «Oldboy») can be really bad. But rarely film worth watching is actually rated at 6. This film is very much worth seeing there. Shame. <br /> <br /> However, I give him 10 in protest. The film is not perfect. Its true rating should be 8 or 9. It has some disadvantages acting (especially Belafonte), the script hangs around sometimes. However, what we have here is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, Czech Jan Kadar, directing two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved, larger than life Mostel and sublime Kaminsky in the current / poetic / moral force tour de. Couple in Heaven! It is true that this film, little flaws of each other, not to indulge average audience, but those who are interested in watching a great (while, again, is not beyond criticism) film incomparable director who gave us "Shop on Main Street "(best film ever about the Holocaust) should not miss it just because some stupid IMDb rating system decides that« American Beauty »rather than« The Angel Levine ». <br /> <br /> it is not.
