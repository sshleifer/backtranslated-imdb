This show has all the typical characters in a comedy: a good man, an idiot, a pervert, a rich girl ... but it is set to 70s. This is the only difference that it has with other TV comedy. I do not know how you like this show. His humor is pathetic! I mean, the joke is so direct ... Typical dialogue is as follows: Â«Fez :. Oh, Jackie I want sex with you (audience laughter) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert (audience laughter) Fez .: Oh, yes I do. (Audience applause and applause) "It's not funny. I think that if there were no such laughs (I do not know what you call it in English, sorry) will not laugh at all. This is not an intellectual comedy, is an insult to the public. I, like most American comedies, but it's not good. I would give it a 4 out of 10. (sorry for my bad english again.)
