I'm not a big fan of martial arts movies, but video store was almost empty, and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4, and I got it for free, if the other movies I rented, anyway, I rented it. I absolutely loved it, my neighbor and I (22-year-old biochemistry and accounting students) held a half-hour after the film is making strange noises kung fu and throwing shurikens beermat alone. I can not explain it (well, maybe a little bit of tequila). I have never enjoyed Bruce Lee, skinny guy kicked a big guy, knocking him down, pushing a guy, etc. The film ends. Think Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.
