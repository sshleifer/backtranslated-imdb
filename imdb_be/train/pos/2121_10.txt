This is a great movie that superbly acted all players. It will make you laugh, and it will make you cry. The very end of the movie makes me sweat every time. If you want to see a great movie, this is it. Jimmy Stewert delivers amazingly clever idea and Frank Morgan, Mr Matuschek mesmerizing. Morgan variety of character none other than as a country. William Tracy, like Pepi is a terrific comic and movie delivers some of the most important lines and projections. Felix Bressart provides excellent performance as a Perovitch, Stone bumbling store employee who has ambition in life is to please the fact that it works. This is a simple story about how employees can become close and how two people who have a great hostility towards each other, fall in love, though unusual circumstances.
