I was strangely impressed by this film. It contains the basic elements of depression, sadness, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams, and communication. It was not just a brilliant musician, collapse, but it was about a man caught in grief, trying sharply, to find solace within their music. He finds a companion, which comes with its own problems. Claire and ten were able to give each one of friendship and love, but more importantly for the conclusion of the events that have shaped their lives for the worse. <br /> <br /> Des unlikely character by today's standards a rock star. Nevertheless, he has a musical genius. It also has an event in his past that made him stagnation, while all just go to the ruins around him. His attention makes it really Whale Music fact it becomes an obsession for him. <br /> <br /> Claire is a child who Streetwise need a place to stay. She finds a hidden talent, being in the company of ten. She also finds a common friend who accepts it. She learns to trust him for a certain period of time. <br /> <br /> The two find love with each other. Nha scary, sex soaked kind passion, and love where friendship and understanding means more. For two people who have suffered, they gain the trust together.
