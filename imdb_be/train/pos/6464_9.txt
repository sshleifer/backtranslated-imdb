Wow, I loved this movie! We are talking about a normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Excellent! We are talking about things all face in life. You have to do something with enthusiasm. But some people do not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who are the opinions of others, and "what will the neighbors think that" it is important to stick to their hearts. Do not let the opinion of no stop you from fulfilling your dreams and passion. I loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people, it might be my family. not a great beauty, but people do not fall in love for the movie.
