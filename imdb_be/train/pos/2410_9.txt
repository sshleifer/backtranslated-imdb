This film is one of the most provocative Jesus films I've ever seen. He does not seek to tell the whole story, but only to reflect the expression interprets the last day of Jesus Christ. This dark witty, playful and serious loyal elements of the Jewish tradition and modern biblical interpretation. Judah is much more common than in other figures, instead of the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine, but grossly mistaken man trying to stray in their enthusiasm. Jesus Chris Saranden is playful and serious, faithful and perfect - very human and charming. The final dialogue done and thought is a kind of small talk that two strong men can do when they have just committed a crime. I would watch this movie again and recommend it to others.
