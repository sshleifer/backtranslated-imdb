I never saw it when I was a kid, so it could be seen with fresh eyes. I've never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter. In addition, the idea of ​​Christopher Walken singing and dancing made me curious. Special FX is cheesy and mediocre singing and dancing. But the big story. My daughter was thrilled. I loved watching Walken in the role, thinking about what the future holds for him. It is very amusing to see him dancing! And if the songs were not great, at least, they were not over-produced Disney's saccharine sweetness. Eater scene in the beginning was a little scary for her, and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end, but it was mostly benign. Interestingly, we read "Puss in Boots" recently, and I asked about the implausibility of the plot. But staying true to almost every aspect of action Walken made it believable. Great fun. I watched it with my daughter.
