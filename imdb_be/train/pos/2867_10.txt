I lost my father at a very young age.So young in fact that I have no recollection of him.Over years I have learned a lot about him. One of the things that he loved Westerns and watch Bonanza every Sunday evening was an absolute ritual for him.I, I remember, the rear end of the series run, having been 8 years old when the show ceased production in 1973. watching this show for years somehow make me closer to my long lost father.It has all the necessary elements to make the show successful, laughter, tears, your seat suspense edge, and even anger you times.My most vivid memory initial start-up show, shortly after the death of our beloved "Hoss" Cartwright, Dan Blocker.One particular episode and at the end of the final credits, flashed a picture Blocker, and disappeared into the black, and I can also recall my older sister with a break in her eyes the type of this.I remember it as if yesterday.On it was on behalf of my late father, who is not here to tell ourselves that we love Bonanza.Long live Cartwrights,
