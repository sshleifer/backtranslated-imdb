The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media obsolete. The idea of ​​his artistic project to expose a funny culture, we swam in. Naturally, the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. He attacks stand up comics (croak, croak, croak), rock bands, models, blockbuster Hollywood movies, and the risks in many other environments. In the end, he finds himself in the sights of weapons he had set in motion. The film is five years and the ring more closely every day. This is the best description of the post-punk anger I've ever seen. This is also one of my top 10 favorite movies.
