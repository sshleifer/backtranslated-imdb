It is very true to the original manga of the same name, also known as (Tramps Like Us in U.S), but it still can be used, even if you have not read the manga. It's a different kind of tail, showing a strong and independent woman, which causes pain in the same way as everyone else. However, because of the external force, she is afraid to show their inner feelings and, therefore, let those around her to hurt her with his blunt comments. The only one who really appears her and who she can be at ease with her new pet ... person ... Momo. If you want something different than the usual boring stuff with some excellent J-Dorama (Japanese AMD) actors / resses it is definitely a series to watch ... and read!
