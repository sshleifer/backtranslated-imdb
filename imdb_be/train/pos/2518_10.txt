It is, in all categories, the best movie I have ever seen. Forget Hollywood - their films are always sucked - it's art! History Lunar child begins with Kei - Japanese vampire who hates what he has become and lives in denial. His desire for the ultimate death leads him to Mallepa, where refugees from several Asian countries. Here he meets Shaw, an orphan who lives in the street. <br /> <br /> Hence, the film is an intense experience, which is based on visual and emotional part of the film. It has everything; you laugh, you cry, you're angry, excited, sad, happy ... Never movie touched me the way to make this film. And the actors strange - I've never heard anyone speak so many languages ​​without it sounding weird. Much praise editor for creating this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> A final comment on this brilliant film, is that the star Gackt (ex-vocalist of Malice Mizer) and Hyde (vocalist of L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel) in different roles as Sho and Kei. I'm surprised at how Gackt can change their manner of speech and action, depending on how old he is acting out. <br /> <br /> This is a must see. If you never see any movies, see Moon Child, Crow (Brandon Lee), and the recently released masterpiece Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. All the original language, of course!
