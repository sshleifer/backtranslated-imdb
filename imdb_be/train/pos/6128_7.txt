Yes, it's B- grade horror. But, at least, producers, directors, cast and is not intended for this movie manna from heaven. The plot is banal, psychotic serial killer on track to meet splashed with acid genetic turns it into a snowman. Aka Snowman Frost then goes to kill the excitement, to find a small town sheriff who finally arrested him. With a limited budget the crew had to do with the limited special effects, much of the money seems to be spent on a snowman costume. Particullary complex shots guided cartoons or pan to the side shots (shots when the camera moves away to hide details). <br /> <br /> This is a film without any child and should not be confused with the Disney movie of the same name. If you do not let the kids watch a PG-13 movie alone than parents should not allow their children to watch this movie. This film has two claims to fame. 1. beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) made her first major film role. The scene in which Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth worth watching more than once. 2. This movie has the worst snowman joke ever. The joke is so bad that the director credited joke teller in the credit list.
