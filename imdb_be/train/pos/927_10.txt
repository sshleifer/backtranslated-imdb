"Father Pride» was one of those good shows that, unfortunately, does not have a very long service life. And it's very sad, especially when you consider that almost all the time, even the worst show on the air (think in "The Simple Life") I admit that there is a lot to do with this show and "The Simpsons," but, in spite of the similarity , the show has its own merits. Animation just adequate, entirely unbelievable, but it is good .The best are the characters. All the animals are very cute and funny, and even Siegfried and Roy have had their moments. The music was good, I liked it a lot of songs. <br /> <br /> Even if the show is not very original, I think it was a lot of atentsyynyh .like «Mission Hill» show, which is not very well known, but I really liked it, it was not satisfied that he deserves. What a shame.
