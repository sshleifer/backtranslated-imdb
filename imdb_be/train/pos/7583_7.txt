The last chapter of the trilogy Hanzo Razor provides a worthy closing of this fascinating samuraisploitation series. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the style is pretty much the same thing, perhaps because of Katz, acting as producer, in addition to the titular antihero. <br /> <br /> Hanzo discloses a female ghost guarding the treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. Of course, be Hanzo Hanzo, he was not deterred by the fact that she is a ghost, so he goes to rape ... um, interrogate it using the familiar rotating the device in the network. The plot takes through a series of blind monks who also DoubleTime in loansharks, corrupt officials, unscrupulous wives and required hack and slash. Hanzo senior officer in Onishi, and his two servants, provide typical comedic note, and, as a rule, it is quite common. <br /> <br /> Much less confusing and easier to stick to than the first (which is everywhere and some confusion), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (perhaps the best in Hanzo series), but still interesting and worth on its own merits. Included with the trademark sequences of training, mandatory rape, swordfights and aims to explore the mystery of Hanzo, it will eventually meet a fan.
