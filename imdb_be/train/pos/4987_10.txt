While I like EE «Doc» book Smith and David A. Kyles Lensman book, anime, which loosly based on books, quite a bit of fun and innovative fair. <br /> <br /> Although the story may seem familiar Sci-Fi / Fantasy buffs, for example, some child on an isolated planet legacy of mystical forces and avenge the death of his family, it's pretty exciting one nonetheless. In addition, Lensman was the first animated film to use a hand-drawn and CG animation all at once. Sure, it may look a little dated now, but it is still innovation. If it was not Lensman, neither the things that would never have happened (I personally think looks better computer graphics animation that live action.) <br /> <br /> It is a pity that they only released it on DVD / VCD in several countries in the Worls (mainly in formats that are completely alien and different). I just want them to be released movies and TV series Lensman on DVD / VCD in any part of the world, not just the parts. <br /> <br /> P.S. Worsel rules! I just think it's so strange and neat looking, as well.
