Deliriously romantic comedy with interweaving storylines that MeSH nice and actors who bounce off lines from each other with precise comedic time, a feat which is wonderful. If spineless groom Cher asks her to help him reconcile with his ex, moody younger brother, no one could have dreamed of the consequences that follow. Opera symbolism Catholic church denominations, love bites and falling snow ... «Moonstruck» eternal and smooth. It takes about 15 minutes to image the rhythm push in (there early sequence and grandfather and his dog in the cemetery that is a little rough, and the next scene with Cosmo and an elderly man at the gate, which seems dull), but a patchwork plot is intertwined with deft skill and a shaky tone of the film and kooky spirit are contagious. *** 1/2 ****
