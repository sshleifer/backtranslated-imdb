This is my favorite classic. It was filmed just west of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when I was 13, in 1957, and released the following year. Then in 1970, I was running the same district as a rookie patrolman PA. I've always liked to check the different places where they were taken off the scene. I knew that Downingtown Diner owner well, and he had a traffic signal front said all passing motorists, it was a "house of the bunch." The stage was in Phoenixville, close to Valley Forge Park and it still shows movies today!
