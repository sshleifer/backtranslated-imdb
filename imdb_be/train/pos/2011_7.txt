If you have never considered this film as an old actor and veteran of the time, this film is for you. Seeing Frank Sinatra when he was very young and very thin with sunken cheeks and a beautiful voice, who sang some great old songs. Michelle Morgan (Millie Pico) gave an excellent performance with a lot of dance and musical numbers. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake) gave a great supporting role along with Victor Borg (Victor Sir Fitzroy Victoria), who conducted the classical piano and slapstick comedy, as he did in his career. It is not great music, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
