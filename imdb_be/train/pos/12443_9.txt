I enjoyed this film. It was a joy to see the version as close to the vision of Peter O'Donnell. <br /> <br /> A number of people did not like the film, but it should be seen in the context of the origin of the story that it is. The film uses a flashback to show young Modesty and events that shaped her into the woman she has become. By the network. Before Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> The pace is a bit slow, and my taste is not enough voltage is developed these days the scene. However, it is only permissible to get a precise version <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you'll enjoy it, even with its flaws, if you just want action flick with chases - forget it .. < br /> <br /> he has a sense of being the first franchise, but since I've never seen that this contributed in any place, I suspect that there will be more to adhere to. Unfortunately.
