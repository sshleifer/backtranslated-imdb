I loved this movie! I'm a real fan of Tom Hanks, and I have always been impressed with all of his work. From its dramatic roles like Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Philadelphia. For him, the role of the cheerful like A League of Their Own, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Big & certainly Toy Story. But in this film Hanks not only a great actor that illuminates the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, up and coming stars, which shows great promise in Hollywood co-stars as Hanks's son and does not deliver anything short with a great performance. He is certainly someone to watch over his entire career, I believe that he would do great things. Paul Newman, as always delivers a brilliant performance on the screen. He's really a legend. We can not forget that the people who do not have such a big role in the film, but nevertheless helped to make it big. Beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, who in the performance of Carolina Bastard Out & Single White Female, I will never forget her kindness brings to the screen as the wife of Hank in the film, and does an excellent job. Liam Aiken another treasure found in the film. He does such a great job with such a small role, and his role in Lehman Snickets and Sweet November, and I dreamed of Africa, he gives a great performance.
