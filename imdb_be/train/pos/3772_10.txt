Bill and Ted bogus journey is perhaps the most beautiful film I've ever watched. Although the action and scenery, etc. poor, who cares. The storyline is brilliant and jokes and words that they come up with more great ideas are great as well. I recommend everyone to see this classic. The best part, obviously, when they "Melvin 'death, I popped in for 10 minutes and skip the next part of the film. This is much better than the first, which was great as well. Perhaps the funniest movie of all time !!!!! I think the best part of the movie but when Bill and Ted shout well and play lead guitar, it was fun. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, to withdraw the third film !!
