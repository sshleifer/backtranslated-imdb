I saw this film at the International Film Festival of Brussels. I also met with the director of the film. I heard that Ed Wood wrote a history of 10 years! I'm sure he thought it would be his masterpiece. - his triumph <br /> <br /> Well, if you take this movie seriously is really one of the worst movie you've ever seen (as Mr. Wood did.) And it's cool. A big joke, I woke up early the day I died, that he was not even trying to be a decent movie. <br /> <br /> This makes the film is very, very good. The script is full of nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. The role of Billy Zane is absolutely great. You see, it's either high or low art ... trash. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
