This film is unique as it is missing ...... A Different Story only that, he shows how from the need to survive or to keep, you can find the ability to love, if you have an open heart and an open mind. I first saw it on the cable at the end of the 70s, and it really shows the limitations of the gay community at the time. I believe that this film was ahead of its time in that shows a piece of obscure life. It's really a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now portrayed as an extended family. This film should be available on DVD / VHS, so that not only extra ordinary performances Meg Foster and Perry King can be recognized, but to show how far we have come and still have to go to where relationships are concerned.
