This is definitely one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. This is a real smoothie anyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will put you into the unknown. <br /> <br /> In general, that Homeward Bound three pets that are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They do not know what's going on, and wanting desperately to go home, they run away from the farm and try to find her way home through the desert. <br /> <br /> This is one of the latest movies, which starred Don Ameche. He provided the voice of the shadow of the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Also starring in the film was Sally Field's voice providing Sassy, ​​the Himalayan cat. But seriously, this movie is all about, a chance! Voiced by Michael J. Fox (my favorite actor), the chance to basically everything you would expect from a dog, cute, playful, energetic and blunt, and every time I crack up when watching this movie, this is due to chance; it's like a comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This film is also very boring at times. It sometimes reminds people of the time they were by themselves, or when they lose their pets <br /> <br /> One scene, which always puts me in limbo is a scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound. Especially I feel shocked at the part where the probability of getting his neck caught in the fence and almost did not make it. The film had other moments of anxiety, but no I do not think more disturbing than one. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great family film. If you like this movie, you will probably enjoy the sequel too. I give this film a solid 9 out of 10!
