It was great. When I saw the Japanese version first, it was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It was not blood and guts, it was awful, atmospheric and scary. When the ghost of his mother lent over the bed in the Japanese version, I almost had a heart attack ... I was concerned that the US version will be diluted, and that would be terrible Buffy the dark nuances of the original version. I should not have worried. The creators of this film wisely kept the same Japanese people who were associated with the original film in his hands, and gave the direction of the film to the same person. They also set it in Japan in the same location in the same building. In fact, the Japanese director tried to remake the same movie as it was in the original, the only difference is the cast of American actors. It's actually become a benefit, as it added an element of "Strangers in a Strange Land", to the general dismay. Not only that, they are being persecuted absolutely terrible and relentless ghost, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign country, difficult to integrate into society. He only added to the general alarm, built-in movie, and I thought it was a great touch. <br /> <br Buffy /> actually does a very good job. She looks vulnerable and can convey your own good. There are no comments on reasonable herring, which are so common in American horror films, or one liners, which distract from the overall darkness and horror characters of the situation. In fact, it was easily as good as a ring, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I hope that the future of the American horror follows more closely the Japanese new wave of terror began with the incredible success of Ringu. We finally films that can actually be attributed to the "horror" category !! 8/10
