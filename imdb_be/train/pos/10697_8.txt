Modern, original, romantic story. <br /> <br /> It is a good game, both actors Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman does a good job of imitating a Russian accent. Ben Chaplin as well as a shy, dull clerk. For men (and some women): Ms. Kidman looks fantastic and very helpful. I forgot what a beautiful woman she is. Not hard to imagine that John falls in love with her. Some twists and turns in the history of good for the unknown. Although I was hoping for a happy ending, the last part of the film was quite a surprise to me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: Huit point.
