The best way for me to describe Europe, which is high on the list of my favorite movies is the exclamation came from a companion after the movie ended: "I do not know, movies can be done like this." Completely original in its visual style, it is one of the best examples of what a movie can be. It is so far from the style of "master and coverage" pictures as you can get; perfect integration of multiple layers of images, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice-overs, performance, editing, lighting, etc ... are all equal, no preferred. In spite of the "dialogue" myopia of Hollywood, the movie is not about dialogue, nor is it about the beautiful light, action or music. This works best when all the elements are equally wherever Mixing these elements, in the order, or the combination in which they are presented, will communicate the idea. Reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element, and the film has no significance. "Europe" is what cinema should strive to be.
