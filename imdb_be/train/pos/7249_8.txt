It's hard for me to appoint a "fair" amount of stars in this film, but I stopped at 8 because of its high cost of production and the fact that it was in 1968, an innovative approach to the war movie. Remember, too, that I have not seen him since 1969. But it was to make a strong impression. <br /> <br /> Long dying day should be one of the most prominent anti-war films ever made. This is achieved simply by drawing in very realistic terms the action of a handful of soldiers in the North-West Europe in 1944-45. No film before it showed the war at the infantry squad with a lot of hard parts, and all cold indifferent manner that allows actions speak for themselves. There's no preaching or sentimentality nor comic, no complicated scripts. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is a subtlety. Partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters come across as flat, familiar clich√©s. As "entertainment", the film does not do it, even though he clearly did not intend to "entertain". He had to slug you over the head with grief and horror of World War II and modern warfare in general. That was twenty years ago and thirty platoon before Saving Private Ryan, both of which are much more "watchable" movies. There are flat and generally unpleasant characters, no actual plot, but really unpleasant images (including those that may be the first vomit on the screen in theater history) makes the film difficult to sit through, although it is only 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So, 10 stars for the production and realism, 4 stars for the feelings you will have when it is finished, the bonus star for the fact that his heart was in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> As Carl Foreman undervalued "victors" in the same gloomy, but more interesting and the food for the film thinking, dying a long day does not seem to be on the DVD. Why not? Both films were on the cable several times.
