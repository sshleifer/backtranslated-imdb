Artistically speaking, this is a great movie - film, music and costumes are gorgeous. In fact, this film is more beautiful than the director himself Kurosawa. In this case, he just wrote the film, as was done a few years after his death. <br /> <br /> So, as far as writing goes, the dialogue was well written and the story, at times, was interesting. However, the story was also very upset uninvolving still in some sense - after all, this is the story of a group of women working in the brothel. It is interesting that, while prostitution was seen as much more acceptable business in Japan, women still long for a better life. . It reminds me of the movie Streets of Shame, Shame though Street characters are much less cute and more than one-dimensional <br /> <br /> So, overall it gets a 7 - mainly because all but writing. It's too bad that the weakest link in this film is the story of the great Kurasawa.
