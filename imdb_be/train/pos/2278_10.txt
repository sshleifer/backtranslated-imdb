Mother Night is one of my favorite novels, and going to see it, I was expecting a huge disappointment. Instead, I got a movie that shows the well-irony, humor, elequence, and above all the crushing sadness Vonnegut novel. <br /> <br /> This, of course, is best Nolte Tents today. He fixes the damage and selfloathing Howard Cambell Junior series of fine intonation of his speech to hold back tears of his eyes. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is Absolutly fun as George Kraft. Sherryl Lee wanders in its detachment from reality, as the young lover in Campbell. John Goodman is understated and more effective as "Blue Fairy". <br /> <br /> Campbell in this story Pinnocioesque with Cambell is trying to be the hero of his own ideal, and unwittingly becomes the ideal tragic Willian mature and vibrant look to what we, as a people. And besides, it is one of the most deeply romantic movies that I have ever encountered. Campbell is the epitome of how foolish and wise love. And in films sastifyingly painful conclusion, he finally learns what it means to be a real boy, like his Blue Fairy gives him his desire. And he understands that ... well, watch the movie and you'll see. <br /> <br /> Mother Night without a doubt, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. This is a wonderful poetic story that digs deep into our emotions and completely loyal to his original author.
