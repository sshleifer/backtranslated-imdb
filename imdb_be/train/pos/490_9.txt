Obsession comes in many varieties, and there for various reasons; for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder, but for others it can be a means of survival. Lack of education, coupled with the inability of even the most basic needs of daily life and basic social requirements, can make even the genius enthusiastically embrace what provides personal comfort zone. And in extreme cases, the object of this fun can be expressed fury, control the man until what began as a means of survival becomes very impetus of his death, and, as we find in 'Puddle Protection ", directed by Marleen Gorris, a high level of intelligence does not guarantee a satisfactory solution to the problem, and in fact, may actually aggravate the situation. Obsession, it seems, has no prejudices or preferences; In addition, it does not give quarter. <br /> <br /> In Italy, at a resort in the 1920s, Puddle (John Turturro) is one of the many who gathered there on the chess tournament, the winner of which will be world Champion. Puddle master of the game, but he is vulnerable in that chess has long ceased to be a game with him; rather, it is his obsession that one thing discovered as a child, he had seen it, though its full absurdity in what seemed to be, in all areas of life, and let him deal with the thin disenfranchisements his next of kin. So Puddle genius with an Achilles' heel, and blemishes that may have only one person knows and understands, and, moreover, understands can be used for his own personal gain in the same tournament. This man Valentin (Stuart Wilson), a former teacher Puddle, who, after an absence of several years, suddenly appeared and made himself known puddle. <br /> <br /> Valentine incoming, confusion presence puddle, and once life threatens to overwhelm him again. Not only that, he's going to face a formidable opponent in the tournament, Turati (Fabio Sartor), against which in the previous match he came out of a draw after fourteen hours, but he is also trying to solve a new element in his life-- his feelings for a young woman, he had just met at the resort, Natalia (Emily Watson). And a genius, although it can be, dark clouds are gathering over him, that just can push even deeper into the puddle of an obsession, which was the saving grace, and the curse of his life. <br /> <br /> In order to tell the story of Puddle, Gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal elements of his childhood, that very quickly led to his obsession with chess. And, as its origin is found, it gives an idea that allows viewers to better understand who Puddle and how he got to this point in his life. For the scenes of his childhood, Gorris textures with their corresponding dark atmosphere and a keen sense of anticipation, which carries on in, and is the basis of the present, a more pastoral setting of the resort. Transitions through which she weaves together the past with this beautifully crafted, and with the pace Gorris sets, making for riveting, yet unrushed presentation, which works very well. It also underestimate the threat, resulting in the presence Valentine, concentrating on the drama, and not unknown, which ultimately serves to increase the overall impact of the film, which makes tragedy Luzhina more believable and anxious. <br /> <br /> The only element that makes this film so memorable, however, it affects the performance of John Turturro. For the film to work, Puddle must be absolutely plausible; one false or insincere point would be disastrous, as if the viewer of the story immediately. This does not happen, however, and the film really works because it creates a puddle Turturro perfectly honest, true life. It captures the genius puddle, as well as its shortcomings, and represents his character in conditions which are extremely eloquent and very real. This performance is equal, if not superior, drawing Geoffrey Rush David Helfgott in `Shine. And if you compare his work here with other characters he created, from Sid Līdz in `Crazy characters Pete in` O Brother Where Art Thou? Al Fountain `Box Moonlight», you know that the incredible range Turturro has as an actor, and that an outstanding artist, he really is. <br /> <br /> As Natalia, Emily Watson is excellent, as well, turning into quite a restrained performance, through which it develops and introduces her character quite nicely. Although it should be more output refers to the puddle, Watson was able to do this introspective way, it is quite effective. Most importantly, because of the detail it brings to her work, she makes her relationship with accelerated Puddle plausible and gives the overall credibility of the story. You have but to look at Watson's eyes to know that the feelings it conveyed real. This is a stunning bit of work from a talented and gifted actor. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stassard), Peter Blythe (Ilia), Orla Brady (Anna), Mark Tandy (Luzhin's father), Kelly Hunter (Mother puddle), Alexander Hunting (Young puddle) and Luigi Petrucci (Santucci). Well crafted and delivered, `puddle protection" is an emotionally involving film, presented with cautious sympathy, which causes a feeling of sadness and possibly a reflection of the brutality of man to man. We do not need a movie, of course, tell us that the cruelty of the world; but we are well served by the medium film, when he reminds us that we must never forget, as we all have the ability to effect positive change and to make a difference in the lives of those around us. I rate this one 9/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
