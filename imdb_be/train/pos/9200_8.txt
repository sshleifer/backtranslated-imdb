I have read countless posts about this game to be so similar to Max Payne, when I played it for the first time I thought it was a little weird arcade-like game with a desire to plagiarism style Max Payne (not just bullet -time) . Therefore, when I played for a few hours, I realized how much fun it is! and how different from the «Max Payne», but time is a bit like a bullet, but I think it fits differently in the style of the game. This game is non-stop action - a mix between shooting and fight'em up as fun as a big fan of Max Payne, I have to say that the story line DTR entirely beside the grandeur of Max Payne, schedule a little average and some of the levels look the same, but if you want a little more, that the "bullet time" you should definitely enjoy this game.
