Ironically for a game is not available on film or video so long levers and MAN is almost always available on the scene for many years since its debut in 1894 - in no small part because it has to age as well as solid satyr Camping heroism and the business of war. Each time, when the world plunged into strife, levers and MAN, seems to soar as ever more timely and relevant. <br /> <br /> This is a game that is converted Oscar Straus (leaving out the very best ideas Shaw) in the successful operetta chocolate SOLDIERS (if Hollywood was * that * they came out of the last vestiges of the show, and not have to pay him for the rights - it was, by the time the winner of the Oscar in its own right). While the show has always been the best of his ideas and dialogue rather than his bare patches in ARMS AND MEN plot sequins, as well as the master controls a happy ending for all concerned. <br /> <br /> Young Ryan (Helena Bonham Carter), officer and daughter of the richest man in the city, engaged to a dashing officer in the Bulgarian cavalry, and all seems well until in the mud of the Swiss mercenary (Pip Torrens), on the other hand rises its drain running from the battle, where his army was routed. As usual satire show, nothing as it seems at first glance, and social conventions were standing on his head in the light of a - not a very simple reason. There are no "good guys" and "bad guys", just people from different classes, which are prepared according to the best of their wits - just like life is just better - and, of course, with Shaw, wit finely honed from all stakeholders <. br /> <br /> earlier (1932) version of the motion picture (from his own script Shaw) to this most traditional and traditionally funny satire stage show, and one of the first to make it a hit on this side of the Atlantic, which has long been among the missing. The show does not sell silk screen rights to his play - only licensed them for 5 periods of the year, and it turned out that with a booming sound technology, making one thousand nine hundred thirty-two movies look primitive a few years later, the show did not renew the license to show for it So, we are in debt for the BBC finally put his version of one thousand nine hundred eighty-seven broadcast in the DVD box with nine other sparkling games. (A little sad, Pygmalion, which many believe Shaw is better off at least well on this set in the production with Lynn Redgrave and James Villiers.) <br /> <br /> Even in a pair, as it is on DVD, with less impressive one act, one destiny, levers and mAN makes a real treasure. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter continued, after cutting its teeth on the role of a TV program as it is, the main film career that will bring a lot of viewers this early role. They should not be disappointed, as Ms. Carter gives an idea in accordance with the layered Innocent audience expects from her, but from a somewhat pedestrian direction of James Cellan Jones (and despite the equally beautiful and well-observed physical production of the Air Force), a mischievous fire in the role (and its indignation underestimated in the last act) is bent on only about 80% of its potential. <br /> <br /> The same can be said about the real star of the piece, Pip Torrens, and Bluntschli «Switzer.» It is a beautiful, eye-catching performance, but does not extend beyond the physical comedy implicit in the beginning of the scene where the young soldier almost sleep, despite the danger of death. <br /> <br /> These reservations, although it is a solid production of the beautiful game transferred to the small screen with aplomb. He deserves to be seen widely, and, ideally, help is still alive big remake with style and zest recent remake Ideal HUSBAND screen Wilde. * Almost any * Arms and the Man should be welcome, and with a lot of success, we may even eventually get to see the original version of 1932. "To one or other surfaces, these products will delight anyone who loves a good show.
