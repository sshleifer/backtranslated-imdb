In general, I like something light and fun, so that the film should not be addressed to me. But he grabbed me from the start. Story selection and problems in the family, it seems obvious, but it raises the question over and over again: "What if it was my family is my choice" I cried and laughed when they did, because I really felt that people involved felt. It was in places hard to watch, but it is more difficult to look away. The story is true, and life is sometimes difficult to watch! This shows that the filmmakers can do without sex, violence and special effects: a good story good story in itself. The best and most unpredictable stories all true. Like real life, you do not really know what's going on, and why people do what they do!
