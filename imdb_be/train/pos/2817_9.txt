This review is for the extended cut of the film. <br /> <br /> The first time I watched the Dragon Lord, when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I've always loved this movie, and you can read some of the more positive reviews about it, to get a general idea. <br /> <br /> That being said. I have always found the story a bit confusing. The film, after all, a love story. And it always seemed strange that the love story should end with 20 minutes of fight scenes. <br /> <br /> Well, in the extended version is no longer the case. Old "original" version starts from a huge barrel height / rugby as a sequence, which is a new end sequence in the extended version. Opening sequence is a Dragon (Jackie Chan) is hanging around his house and pretending to be learning and pronouncing every time his father around. <br /> <br /> Other sequenced it was also a shift in the extended or renewed section and the story makes a lot more sense when you look at it. Walking is also better and overall it just works better. It's more like a love story and leave you asking questions about why it ends so abruptly and hard as the regular version does. <br /> <br /> I suggest to anyone who is a Hong Kong movie, or just plain fanatic Jackie Chan to capture expanded version and see the movie as it was originally intended. (Or at least I think it was meant to be. Otherwise, why would they do this and change some scenes) When I was done playing, I felt like I was watching a whole new Jackie Chan film, although the majority of the sequences were the same.
