Shyness, I just watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. This is a story that any father or brother may refer to a brother ... a little "wild", another brother of the typical oldest child. Craig Sheffer little too objective, like a big brother, but Pete weird and Skerritt perfectly cast as father. Fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana is absolutely breathtaking ... I had no idea that fly fishing can be so attractive. The film closely follows the book, from just a few modifications to make it more suitable for the film format. Unlike most books in history, a movie, it's one measures up. This is the perfect movie for those who want a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional film.
