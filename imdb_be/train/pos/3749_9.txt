I laughed a lot watching it. It's funny short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness. simple symbols, but their simplicity stylization adds humor. The dialogue is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow weird. There's Max, who apparently led a miserable life. And there's Edward, who is not sure that the life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, mad boss Edward. Especially it has a short role, but unforgettable. Especially recommended for those who like silly humor. And you can find it on the internet now, that's a bonus! I'm a fan of cartoons and Jason can not wait to see what he comes out on the other.
