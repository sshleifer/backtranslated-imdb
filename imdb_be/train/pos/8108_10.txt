I have a "future developments" on D.V.D. and it is very clear compared to my VHS version. Sound fair, but it can be difficult to understand at times. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie so much that I was looking for a copy of the book and found it.It gave details about why certain things happened. The best things about the film, there are small things that I did not notice the first. Such as John Cabal playing with a toy airplane on Christmas trees party, as it was a dive bomber, with dateing sea power, calling the battleship «Dinosuar.» Ships sunk by air forces, undeclared enemy's sudden attack aircraft. Swept flying wing aircraft. Strong rolls for women through the whole movie. <br /> <br /> There are, to see the movie to enjoy them.
