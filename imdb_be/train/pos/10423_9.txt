So, Be My Love was Skyrocket Mario Lanza to fame and is still popular today. His voice was strong and steady, so powerful that MGM decided to use it in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso. After reading the book Kostelanitz, who wrote a biography of Lanza, he explains that the constant practice and vocal lessons become imaginary Caruso Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza has done an excellent job in this story, but the story is not quite true; accuse him of Hollywood! I used to practice singing their songs of years ago, and has become quite well-behaved until I lost my voice because of emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Achieving a high note in my love is not so simple; but beautiful!
