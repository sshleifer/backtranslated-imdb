The reviewer, who called this film the bust is clearly missed the point. It is obvious that he was not a young and innocent for a very long time, and he could understand what a tragedy it was that well-intentioned young characters really thought they could make a difference, putting up posters and holding a rave for world. If it were so easy. But cynics sit and scoff at people who are genuinely trying their best to make things better, because the situation is getting worse and worse every day. Well, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. <br /> <br /> central theme is that revenge breeds revenge more, which gives rise to even more bloodshed in the constantly expanding. Both sides will tell you stories about the atrocities committed by the other side, which in their opinion, justify their commission even more in retaliation. Where will it end? And, apparently, he missed the meaning of "bubbles" of the title, which was that the people who live in Tel Aviv, strangely cut off from the ugly reality of what is happening around them, which is partly why they seemed so naive ( he also seemed to think that Ashraf may slip through checkpoints without any problem, which tells me that he does not pay attention when Ashraf associated with delays and problems he encountered.) <br /> <br /> I found it very brave director, screenwriter, and how unfortunate lovers to refresh the story of Romeo and Juliet to modern-suffering land, and make both lovers man. Let's be honest: very few people will have a problem if one of them was a female (young love conquers all heart) - but if anxiety people with their sexuality is added the fact that incredibly, these same people would have been very much in their hate each other, the conclusion is inescapable.
