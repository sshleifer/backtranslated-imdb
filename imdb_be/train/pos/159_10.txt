It was just another great film festival in Berlin. But in contrast to the "Yes", Sally Potter, I've seen a few days before, where after leaving the theater, I felt a strong desire to wanting to cover the whole world and was just happy to be alive at this time, just the opposite has happened: there it was something that pulled me out, and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe. It was as if, suddenly, there was nothing left, all hope, all future was taken from a dead spot. <br /> <br /> Nina's life looked bleak and closed, but then, one day there is something luminosity which opens the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of their dreams. There was no one on her side, but then she finds a companion, just out of nothing, someone who was able to share the most hidden sense of their lives. This man was not Tony, hobo girl who seems to have no roots, as well as herself. <br /> <br /> But the film's title is "Ghosts", and the ghosts come and go as they wish, there is no way to keep them ?? Ghosts are also a hidden fantasy of people, strange ideas that occupy the mind and only perceive themselves, hiding from everyone else. Francoise, a French woman is a victim of such ghosts. She once lost her baby daughter in Berlin, which, apparently, was robbed of it in the supermarket, in just one moment of inattention. Now time has passed, and Françoise returned to Berlin, still looking for the missing child. <br /> <br /> Nina may be that the child, in the end she got the same scar on her ankle in a heart-shaped birthmark between his shoulder blades, which seems to prove her true identity. <br /> <br /> And Nina accepts this idea, as it not only in desperate need of a companion, it also tends to his mother. But in the end it is empty-handed, Tony disappeared with a man, and her mother appears to be a sick woman. "Dreams die," he concludes the husband of Francoise, and the statement could not be more disappointing. Nina just «niña», the girl without a name, there is no hope for any divine fulfillment. There's no Marie in this world, to accompany our lonely life. Therefore, in the end, we see Nina all alone, intending to go on the road, which was opened in front of her, in a future that seems bleak and uncertain.
