Well, if you're open enough to like Barber Shop, then you will enjoy this Canadian film. <br /> <br /> If your mind is in the closed-minded as Fort Knox, you will give him the current score, he has :. 2,5 <br /> <br /> This is a film for everyone who was ready to watch movies from abroad, their racial characteristics. It attracts, it is a fact of life, in two or three times you lose the connection between the scenes, but a lot of times, especially towards the end, you will find that you tear or two in your eyes, and it's simply because so often reflects what life can be. <br /> <br /> I like and recommend it to all the open framework of the traditional American film.
