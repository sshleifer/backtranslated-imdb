I first saw this movie when I was a little kid, and fell in love with it immediately. Sets of breath and takes some of the script damn right hilarious: "You are the children of thousands of fleasÂ» <br /> <br /> He's always on TV late at night or very early in the morning I woke up. around 3:00 in the morning one time, and this is only the beginning. TV Companys have to show a little more respect and put it in prime time on Sunday, so that everyone can get a chance to see this wonderful work. <br /> <br /> 10/10
