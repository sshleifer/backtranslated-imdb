I am glad that people (as of this date), who loved this film now goes forward. I do not understand people who do not like this film - it seems that they expected serious treatment C'mon, how the heck, you can take the room killer snowman seriously (?!?!?!)? The filmmakers knew it was a silly premise, and they did not try to deny it. Directly facing the delivery of scenes actually makes its FUNNY! Yes, there are times when the budget shows a low (as, for example, the explosion scene), but I think the road view would have taken pleasure from the film! So if you want to B-movies, and goofy premise treatment to you, then you, of course, as "Jack Frost."
