This is essentially a variation on the House of Wax, both at the site and the type of role played by the star of both films, Vincent Price.In both pictures he plays a talented artist who goes tipping over the edge into madness when his creation that usurped other less talented and less scrupulous people .In this film, he plays an illusion designer on stage magicians, is seeking to establish a career in the performing only to be disappointed with himself, if another illusionist Big Rinaldo (John Emery) insists that honor his contract and give him a pen s selection of any illusions he designs.Price already badly located Rinaldi, his ex-wife is now the mistress with Rinaldi. He deploys his talents as a magician and as a brilliant mimic, to avenge himself on Rinaldi and others, disrupt his plans for recognition as an artist and designer. <br /> <br /> The price is pretty much the whole show here, and gives well-judged star turn as the resentful man who was seriously gets the audience sympathy.The rest of the actors are competent if colorless and weight of the whole enterprise falls on the price, It bears the burden easily. <br /> <br /> good solid B Movie melodrama, the crime film, not a picture of horror and fun provided that you do not expect .Shot masterpiece in black and white is low on blood and is best viewed as a melodrama and enjoy for the presence of its star gives a special performance
