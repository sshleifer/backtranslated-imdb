We did not come across in the film Brother-sister relationship in Indian cinema, or any other language or medium. This relationship has several aspects, not exploited in the movies or novels. Typically, the nurse is depicted as a pile-on that can be used to redeem in the menopause. The film treats the subject in a totally different light. <br /> <br /> It is inspired by the novel of George Eliot's "The Mill on the FlossÂ». Brother is very prosaic, all is well, the blue-eyed boy, who is a common good and a favorite son of his mother. Sister, romantic, wild and unruly unwritten rules of society. Despite this, the love of a brother-sister is the winner. <br /> <br /> This film is about the love of two brothers and sisters who were separated in childhood and the revival of the same feelings when they met years later, it is also a quest conquered brothers reunited with his sister, who had chosen to be wild to challenge the world. <br /> <br /> Although the film and the novel are set about 3 centuries from each other in two distant countries, yet the feeling is the same, and is still true.
