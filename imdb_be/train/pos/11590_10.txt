Oh, the sixties. There were some interesting films. I was still a movie goer then. Now I like movie rentals and vacation in my home and not go to the theater. I also saw this short film "Legend of the boy and the eagle." I was looking for this film for many years. It was truly inspiring. Surprisingly, I was finally able to gather more information from your website. Thank you ........ I was surprised to find that this short film was a revelation for the Disney picture. I do not remember the Disney movie. I do not even remember that it was the opening film for Disney. I would really like they show it on TV ever. I wonder if Disey eligible for this film? Is it available on DVD? This is a must see for all ages !!!
