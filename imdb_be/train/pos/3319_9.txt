How long Red Sox fan, I just had to go see the movie. It was great! While it may never be enough live footage with the Red Sox in 2004 miracle season, there were some great pictures of my favorite players Red Sox. Although the film is, of course, chick flick, he has plenty of baseball footage from a surprising return in 2004 Red Sox, to make it one of my top 10 movies of all time. I especially liked the supporters of Red Sox, who were part of the family of baseball, Ben. The scene where Ben meets his friends on the day of the project, to determine who gets a place in some games paddle! I must see if you are looking for a useful movie to watch with your husband, date or significant other ... especially if you're a baseball fan ... and even more, especially if you're Red Sox fan !!!
