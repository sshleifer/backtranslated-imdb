"When I sit down, I'll never get back," is that the mother (one name) said to his son when he tells her to relax a bit (she was just widowed). It means that the resting place is the fact that a woman's age and in her situation should do: rest in peace, to neglect them. But it is not in the "resting" mood yet. She also has a daughter who blames her for every calamity in his life ... Suddenly comes the revelation: the sex and passion in the form of muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her (Daniel Craig, the new James Bond) if she "thought no one will ever touch it again. " This is a story that makes you think about many things, especially about the fact that this 60-something woman should do with his life, when his husband dies. It does not seem that we have advanced, what is it about these aspects. I mean, no one is surprised when Sean Connery has a novel to the movies with Catherine Zeta-Jones ... but what would you think, if it were otherwise? An old woman, a young guy ... Nah, you're not ready for this, are you? <br /> <br /> The film has intimist pitch over its entire length, at 2 or 3 sequences in which, in addition, that tons breaks and arrives some obvious and complains dialogs. Those vulgaris affects the way a son and daughter learn her mother's novel (rather absurd -you'll know what I mean, when you look at this-) are the only elements of discord in "Mother". <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
