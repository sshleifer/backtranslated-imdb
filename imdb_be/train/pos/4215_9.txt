In this remarkable Twentieth Century Fox film noir, metropolis is a maze of despair in which the predators and scavengers survive, living at the expense of each other. Thoughtful Cityscapes bottom of the frail humanity in the harsh expressionist symbolism. <br /> <br /> The prostitute had her purse snatched on the subway. It contains microfilm, and a Communist spy will stop at nothing to restore it. Two parallel investigations unfold in both spies and police to track down valuable information. <br /> <br /> antihero pickpocket Skip McCoy plays with contemptuous assurances Widmark. He knows the police, to be his moral and intellectual equality subordinates, so he scoffs: "Go on," he says Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn) high, "Throw me to drum up a charge in, you've done it before ..". In this ruthless world, the police just another gang on the streets. Just as Hooker candy bribes Lightning Louie, to get a lead, so the police are busy paying an informer for information. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that when Widmark made this film, he was already in the early middle age, 39-year-old star, is coming to the end of his contract with Fox |, plays an upstart Skip McCoy with irreverent brash teenager. Today, it can not be acceptable for a romantic lead pierce his love interest to pass out, then revive her, spilling beer in her face, but the mores of the time, this meant strength -. And candy, after all, is the fallen woman <br /> <br /> Jean Peters radiant like candy. Here, right in the middle of its five-year surge of Fame B-movie, it is a beautiful and fascinating whore with a heart of gold. She is a victim story, a martyr for their beauty as well as everything else. It means that good, but constantly manipulated by cynical men -. Joy, jump, and the cops <br /> <br /> The real star of the film in New York. Haunting urban panoramas and snidering metro station offers suggestions claustrophobic city as a living, evil force. Like maggots in rotten cheese, the human figure, rushing through the nooks and crannies of the city. Elevators, turnstiles subway, sidewalks - even a dumb waiter serves as a channel for the flow of corrupt humanity. People cling to any niche that allows itself to security: MoD has its grubby rented room, Skip his dark hut on the Hudson River. As the characters move and interact, they are framed architecture bridge or lattice beams or divided suspension hoist gear. face of the city is constantly being imposed. Angles and crossbar wharf timbers are an echo of the street plan of the track, and filing cabinets in squadroom mimic Manhattan. If the output of the metro interrupting Joey, it's as if the city of steel tendons are ensnaring him. <br /> <br /> The unexpected part of the film was shot in extreme close-up. Character drives the story, as expected, and the close-up is used to increase the character. If Skip Kendo polls ~ d, close-up captures the sexual energy between them, refuting hostile words Skip. Beauty Jean Peters painted in light, in a delightful soft focus close-up. The apparatus is also used to step up the voltage. opening sequence, snatch the purse, contains no dialogue: the drama completely relies on the close-up to its powerful effect <br /> <br /> bloodhound, bloodhounds and on Snoop, settle film .. MOU (Thelma Ritter), makes his living as a informant, and its place in the hierarchy accepted even its victims. If Skip says, "it needs to eat," he repeats a recurring refrain. As well as "direct" New Yorkers hawking lamb chops or timber, Hell traffics in product information. <br /> <br /> And yet, even snitches surpass Joe and his Communist friends. Joey Moe feet on the bed symbolize the offenses he basic moral code. Joey outside the womb. MOU will not trade with Joey, even to save his life: "... Even in our crummy business, you need to draw the line somewhere." <br /> <br /> «Pick-Up» was made in the depths of the Cold War. Richard Nixon had just been chosen as the Republican vice presidential candidate, made his name with his amazing Alghero Giessen expose - a fictitious communist microfilm and all. McCarthy show trials were a daily reality. We see that the police in the film smash "the traitor who gave Stalin the atomic bomb." <br /> <br /> New York can be seen as a gigantic vessel in which to read the human offal, whiskey and murder. Containers form the leitmotif throughout the film. Nov. performs its trademark box links and kendo purse microfilm container is a plot of engine. Skip keeps his only possessions in the underwater crates, that symbolizes its secretive street wisdom. Graves of paupers, moving down the Hudson on a barge containers are just another cargo shifted around merciless metropolis. <br /> <br /> The film is a masterpiece of composition. Candy above hiding Go on a rickety ladder cabin, meaning it moral. If the weapon is on the table, the extreme perspective makes it look bigger than candy - violence starts to dwarf compassion. Lovers of the shadow eclipsed hook loader, reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute, but depend on the whims of a sinister city. Enyard Communist shadow on the wall, or a disembodied cloud of cigarette smoke. He is like a lonely stray cat among the debris - predatory ghost night. camera photos from under the cab hoods, at newsstands and through the bars of hospital beds is constantly reinforce in us the realization that we are all trapped in the city. We mulch civilization.
