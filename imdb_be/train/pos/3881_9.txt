This film took me with an incredible opening sequence, which deceived me in a complete reversal prospects, so I was hooked by the time the name came on. The theme of this film is that everyone acts, trying to reinvent itself, but in a complex way, as a person or suspect, but in how we all try to do everything banal life that we find ourselves in a bit more interesting . Scene chick warehouses are spectacular. At some point, Joerg (having poultry) attends a seminar laughing, where he is the worst student. His discomfort it allows us to see the depth of his desire to change themselves. The film made me think about the hidden secrets that lie beneath the surface of the most used of the people I see every day. There's not much story here. Guessing old secret is fairly easy, but the charm is to try to guess what all the other characters are doing when they understand it. This film came to me in the same way as was done in the side, even though the characters could not be more dissimilar.
