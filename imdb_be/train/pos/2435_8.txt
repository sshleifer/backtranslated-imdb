I never thought that old cartoon will bring tears to my eyes! When I first bought Casper & Friends: frightening about Africa, I so much wanted to see the very first cartoon Casper entitled Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I see the next cartoon, where a well-Boos To-Night (1948), he was forced to break me! I could not believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing foxes kill Casper! I've never seen anything like that in other Casper cartoons! This is the saddest of all! It was so frustrating, I just could not watch it again. It's just like seeing Lassie die at the end of the film. I know that it's a classic, but it's too much for us to handle the old cartoon lovers like me! If I wanted to see something old and classic, I prefer to watch something funny and happy! But when I think about it Casper cartoon, I think of my cats!
