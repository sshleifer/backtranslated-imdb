Once you pass the name of the movie, "Packer" is a great film, perhaps one of the best John Waters. An excellent cast, led by the strong performances of Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, to make the story very funny and very real. There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children, but they are there for a purpose. Unfortunately, this movie was not mass-produced, and most of the population is deprived of the opportunity to view it. If opportunity knocks, and then go see this movie.
