I was not alive in the 60s, so I can not guarantee that this film was a very accurate representation of the time, but it is certainly moving and fulfilling experience. There are some fine performances, first on Josh Hamilton (with Honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who play brothers separated by the war. Bill Smitrovich, the character actor who has long been ignored by many, gives a heart filled with performance, their strict father, who is forced to question their own beliefs and values, as one of his sons makes him proud by going to Vietnam, but returns empty inside and the second is just the opposite. In general, it is a powerful and moving film, which I hope everyone gets a chance to experience.
