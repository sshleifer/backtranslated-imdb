It is noteworthy that for the "Young Mr. Lincoln" with the support of the players Ford dropped less known, other than the star actors. This not only enhances the focus of his film on the central character of Lincoln, but it also gives the audience a refreshing view of Lincoln as a man of his time and place, the person involved, as each of us inexorably on, and the mood of his time, and looking for a way to them solutions. It's not so much words and actions Fonda Lincoln, but also in the people, the reaction of fellow players that Ford tells the story of the formation of the young Lincoln's outlook, a sense of place in the society and the political system, as well as how people respond to the words and deeds Mr. Lincoln and trust the person they thought they deserved their respect and Heeding <br /> <br /> Give it a try this :. instead focus on Henry Fonda, the next time you read Â«Young Mr. Lincoln" move the focus of the secondary characters - I hope you will be richly rewarded with a deeper appreciation of both Lincoln and Ford. I would suspect that Ford speaking through supporting character's reaction to Lincoln Funds may be appealed to David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif in "Doctor Zhivago," in which it supports the characters reaction to Zhivago that actually talks about the living .
