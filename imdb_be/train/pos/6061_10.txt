I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice and to say something about the documentary. Music, cinematography and sound is very great, as you would expect from Imax production. Even if he is removed to the huge theaters Imax, it looks and sounds great on my home system. In fact, it would make the perfect DVD for demo system. <br /> <br /> The subject is also so fascinating. It is about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I've been a fan of Mario, because he's the best race car drive in history, since he is the only person to win the CART championship, F1 Championship, The Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script follows the path of the two cars is very important and father son. The first car is in the henhouse, and is the first roadster that Mario never drove, and we are going to restore to shiny perfection. Another car new racing car, Michael, and we are going to cut it from the mold after the racing season. Imax provides just the right magic to make the construction of the vehicle entertainment and fun. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who was the owner of Michael Amoretti team while this film tells the film was made. His anecdotes and jokes, drawn from many years as owner and driver, provide a lot of products. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the racing scene. Add the volume here! There is something about going along more than 200 miles per hour and the score, which completely draws you to the screen for an experience you will not forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The final magical element of humanity Andretti family. This god of the racing world, Mario Andretti, a loving father, who proudly followed the career of his son. They work together so well that every father and son to see it. You can say that they are close relatives. I wish we could all have that experience.
