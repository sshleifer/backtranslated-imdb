At first you think, another Disney film, it can be good, but it's the film of children. But if you look at it, you can not help but enjoy it. All ages will love this film. I first saw this film when I was 10, and now 8 years later, I still love it! Danny Glover is excellent and can not play the role better. Christopher Lloyd cheerful and perfect for this role. Donets is so believable as Mel Clark. You can not help but enjoy this film! I give it a 10/10!
