Day-Lewis does an excellent job of playing Christy Brown, an artist who grew up with cerebral palsy, but managed to have a productive life, to successfully cope with his handicap and become a respected artist and writer. <br /> <br /> The film, however, is very difficult to review - or even look. Fortunately, I was able to catch the subtitles in every word, which would be impossible if I saw a movie at the cinema. While I respect him as a courageous piece of work dealing with a heavy object, I can not say that it is a kind of film that I would like to see more than once. <br /> <br /> However, there have been on my mind tells device flashback framing the present, in which we see Christy honored for his achievements, before we see a retrospective of his youth and of his struggle to communicate with those around him, which, of course, I gave him a loving care. <, Br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis, of course, great as a caring man who falls in love with the therapist (Fiona Shaw), a lot of fear of his mother, that if love is not reciprocal his heart will be broken. There's a painfully long scene in the restaurant, where he confesses his love for her before the others, and then proceeds to rage after drinking too much. <br /> <br /> BRENDA Fricker does a brilliant job as a mother, take care of him, his father and his brood of brothers and sisters who are struggling to keep a roof over his head, while Day-Lewis is starting to have success with his work. It complements the work of Day-Lewis as a touching mother and shares many poignant moments with him. <br /> <br /> A lot of detailed story about a family that stayed together in the most unusual circumstances, with attention to detail in each frame period of the film. Both Fricker and Day-Lewis won an Oscar, but HUGH OKonor and RAY McAnally also excellent. OKonor is Christy as a boy and McAnally father who spends too much time at the local pub, but loves the boy <br /> <br /> To sum up: the music. Elmer Bernstein is added plus factor. Well worth it, but definitely not a movie for everyone.
