I saw this movie on Thursday night after a really sad day. I did not have any expectations, the ones I had were quite negative. Being the only movie I've ever watched Jimmy is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah (?) ... do not ask why! But seriously..this film is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with the characters Fallon. Why can not I meet a cute botany like this. :) Movies like that fine. Simple, sweet and appropriate. Sunday to Thursday. I'm not even a sports fan, but it's something about American movies with baseball that fascinates me. Perhaps the fact that we do not have this kind of sport here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment ever.) Haha
