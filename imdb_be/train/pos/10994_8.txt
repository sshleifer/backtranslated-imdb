This is my first comment! This is a fantastic film! I watched it all on luck one night on TV. In the first 5 minutes, I thought it was a B movie, but then I realized that it was an amazing product. <br /> <br /> I have suggested to some friends to see the film, only to tell me that it was a bad B movie. How wrong. Superficial criticism. <br /> <br /> I think that film is almost a work of genius! The famous director has done an excellent job here, and it's a shame to say that he was out of the game all this time.
