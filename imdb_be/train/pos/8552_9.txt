This is definitely one of my favorite spin-off of the American pie is mainly because most of the other main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems unrealistic in nature. <br /> <br /> For example, AP: The Naked Mile. You are a teenage boy surrounded by naked college chicks, and has one, in particular, on the heels, to deliver him from his virginity "problems", and it ends up stopping in the middle of the act and rides the horse back to sleep with his girlfriend, who keep in mind, I gave him a "guilt free pass" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of all of this, but let's be realistic; most people who watch these films are not particularly looking for romance. <br /> <br /> While the latest installment in the end, seems to understand who the audience and the good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses, and as always, Mr. Levenstein attached to its "all-natural" brow humor to the equation and scored with this new film.
