As of this writing, John Carpenter's "Halloween" is approaching its 30th anniversary. Since then, it has spawned seven sequels, a remake, a whole mess of simulations and each year around Halloween, when they make a list of "Top 10 most scary movies," it's always there. It is quite strange for a film that was made on a budget of about $ 300,000 and featured almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent. I could go on and on, but the big question here: As the film holds today? And all I can say is that it is fabulous! <br /> <br /> Pros: Simple, but scary opening credits sequence that really sets the mood. Unforgettable and goosebump induced by director / co-author John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Big cinema. Stellar directing Carpenter, who holds a high intrigue, gets great shots, and try not to show too much of his villain. Good performances by the then mostly unknown cast. A good sense of humor. Michael Myers is one terrible, evil guy. Many terrible moments that will stay with you. The pace is slow, but steady and never drags. Unlike most other horror films, this one is more about the uncertainty and fear than blood and a large number of victims <br /> <br /> Cons :. Probably not as bad as it was then. Many of the inconsistencies really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: I would like to start this section by saying that it is not my favorite film in the series. I know that it is not public opinion, but it's really how I feel. Despite the fact that it is really important film, which keeps reaching new generations of movie lovers. And only because he has been redesigned for the new generation does not mean that it will be forgotten. . In any case, not as <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
