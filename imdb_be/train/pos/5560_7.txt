SPOILERS <br /> <br /> My friend said the next film was the best Cheech and Chong movie and went out of his way to get me to take it and blues BROTHERS. The next film is no plot, do not walk, in fact, has nothing that defines the film ... but this is ridiculous. And for what it's worth, Cheech and Chong show some heart. <br /> <br /> Well, in this small point I put in the plot, but in the fact that four-fifths of the film, nothing happens that, as a rule, begin the story. I'll just say that cousin Chicha Â«s shows up. <br /> <br /> There was no other funny moments when Chong did Chichi drink urine twice? How about a rooster? It was the first appearance of the film Pee-Wee Herman? You have to watch the movie for yourself to enjoy it. I do not think that the next film is strong enough balls to do this strange, but the film has heart, and hey, my friend, let me take it, so he gets a 7.
