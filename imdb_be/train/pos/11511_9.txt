Weak scripts at times? Op! Funny special effects at times? Op! Delicious guilty pleasure most of the time? Op! Read more about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Op! I've always loved science fiction as a child, but found that most of the / The Mummy / things horror Dracula / of Frankenstein, as soon as shit. Abbott and Costello took to give me a new perspective on the classic Universal monsters, and it took Carl Kolchak, to win me over to the "dark side" of entertainment. Duke was Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood was Dirty Harry, Garner was Maverick and Rockford were Sellki Magnum and Darren McGavin was Carl Kolchak. Mixed in with all the weak script, cheesy special effects, this baroque group supporting characters and actors and guest stars, was Darren McGavin, Carl Kolchak. He had a wry sense of humor, despite the danger, was an idealist in his quest for truth, and a realist when it came to making a mandatory incompetence and possible cover up by government officials. In addition, in contrast to the 98% of us, Kolchak was ready to push the neck and do what had to be done, even if it meant his death, the end of his journalistic career, or imprisonment. For all its shortcomings, including no taste in clothes, Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and wit, who drove a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (which was an old used car at the time) on his way to save the day for mankind. As good as any other fictional character Carl Kolchak was everyman hero brought to life every week for one season, thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that he has passed, and it shows on the DVD, I hope he's having so much fun watching me watching him have fun playing Kolchak The Night Stalker again and again!
