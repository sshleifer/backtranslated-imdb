For dining mobile suits that can annihilate an entire army - Check! Weapons that are unlikely to be sent and even destroy all - Check! Mobile suits based on angels - Check <br /> <br /> OK - his series Gundam. This one, Gundam Wing, has a good character development, the real difficulty, interesting ideas and some pretty eye candy. <br /> <br /> With the characters originally weak Relena Dorlan (Peacecraft later, and then back to Dorlan) becomes stronger and more independent (though still completely befuddle Heero them, a series of the protagonist). Heero above, initially cold, hard butcherer, is becoming more and more people at the same time remaining in the symbol. And seeing that lost Millardo Peacecraft (whose nõmm de guerre is Zechs Marquise) float between OZ, freelancing, and a team of White Fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own works. <br /> <br /> complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - shows how the real world. However, in 49 half-hour episodes, it gets a little responsibility that this complexity is not used the full potential <br /> <br /> ideas through a series of -. The need to fight the desire for peace, and so on - those that resonate even today. In retrospect, the series was ahead of its time that the "war on terror" and all. But his study of these ideas, monologues, especially those of Treize Kushrenada, it's incredibly dramatic parts, forming some of the best written form in the series. <br /> <br /> But sometimes it's good to write and sometimes very poor, which greatly makes it lose some of its edge. <br /> <br /> terms of eye candy as it has in bucketloads of, all of the mobile suits to the battleship Libra (no tampons you idiot!) is well designed and explodes into large balls of orange ( that is bad, because it's better animation would have been the best explosions). But who cares? Things explode, and that makes a difference. <br /> <br /> In short, though, the very complexity of the series means that if you miss a few episodes, you missed a lot. Poor writing can leave you cringing and sometimes animation makes you go «WTF?!?!» But it is in the classic style of animation, its scale, incredible spark dialogue, and his intelligence more permanent that one expects such Japenese animation.
