I enjoyed this film very much. Many Korean people will feel familiar with this film, because many of them have a teacher when they go to school. Cinema was average. The film would have been better if the angel or camera movement was more irregular. Editing, however, was very neat and unusual. <br /> <br /> The action was also very good. Kim Ha Neul is usually played innocent, weak girl in the Korean soap opaeras. But this time she plays a cute mischievous very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays a role very believable. <br /> <br /> What I like this movie the most, the characters are not very exaggerated emotions. There are a lot of Korean romance film, the characters cry a river in front of an audience, and I always thought it was very stale. There has not been such a shit in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very funny and well done.
