The best-selling book on honor killings in Jordan revoked his publishers after the surface of the claim that history was made; linked with other statements about the past of the author as a scammer-woman. A few years later, she pops up, admitting that it took a certain amount of dramatic license, but is ready to cooperate with the director to show the essence of her allegations. Below is a fascinating insight into the pathological personality, someone who is the behavior one would not make any sense unless what she says, does not it, but who seems to be unable to say anything, which is not surprising dramatic, but unproven at best, and the most frequently checking the lie. It is almost impossible to imagine that Ms. Khoury hoped for, being in this film: an excuse? a celebrity? - all it does is projected to achieve a certain image of himself as a deeply damaged man, and even that may not be accepted at face value. Director Anna Broynouski more and more appears on the camera as her film progresses, and more and more irritated to download; but she was finally rewarded with a beautiful, though scary and disturbing story to tell - and one of those movies that reminds us that it is thoroughly strange world we live in.
