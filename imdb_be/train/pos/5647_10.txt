I do not want to tire of repeating what has already been said, but it's one of the best series in the history! It was very embarrassing when it was canceled, and I hope that someone will have the good sense to pick it up and start the series again. The good news is that it is not on DVD !!!! I rushed down to the store and picked up a copy, and I am glad to say that this is as good as I remembered. Gary Cole surprisingly dark and creepy character, and all the actors were very good. It's a shame that the network is unable to continue. Sean Cassidy, it's a masterpiece. Anyone who loves this genre and who have not seen it, have to do it. You will not be disappointed. My daughter, who was too young to see it when it was on TV (she was 20), it becomes very interesting, and will soon be a fan. She believes that "very twisted" and enjoy the scenes she saw. I can not wait to see the episodes that have not been announced. <br /> <br /> This show rocks !!!!
