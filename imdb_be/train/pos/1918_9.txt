I'll be honest with Yall, I was a junior in high school when this sitcom first broadcast on ABC, I do not think I'd like it at all. But with John Ritter in it, I felt that he had little potential in it, and they were something else with it I liked it. The acting was great, a little creepy 2nd ranking comedic lines, John Ritter always brings his game when it comes to comedy. It was a great show to see, and I'll tell you why it's a great show. My father, who never watches TV shows at all, he was just watching movies, sports, law & order, in fact, he sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mother and I, and watched the show, I think, because John Ritter was in it. I honestly think that this show will continue to run when John Ritter Rest his soul, I wish he had not died.
