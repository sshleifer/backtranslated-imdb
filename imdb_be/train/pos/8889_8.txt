I have lived in those times, and I think that the program has caught the heart of the era. I think that this should be considered a issue of African American, but I think it covers a lot of the program. It was scary to sit and watch the riots on T V in the hope that they will not go as far as your family's home, and that he would not get burned. I thought that Jerry O'Connell has done a great job, which shows vet returning from the war. I went to school with children who have returned. Some of them have changed more than others, and some of them not so much. It bothers me when someone notices that the problem was not covered enough or not entertaining enough. Live through it, and then make comments. I thought the movie was great, and that's all it has done an excellent job. Thank you for the trip (sad and good) down memory lane.
