I do not like Chandni Bar by the same director. <br /> <br /> I did not watch his other films. They came and went. <br /> <br /> However, Page-3 nicely done. It seems real. As Satya with RGV made. <br /> <br /> Mental illness so-called high society is a summary of the film. At the height of the illness, it is difficult to lead a normal life, which is the main character, Konkana Sen, is doing. Serious film, not to be watched with children or who were waiting for their wives. Page-3 newspapers is a common place for activity reports, which takes place in the rich and elite who indulge in much more shit that reported. How is Page-3 is also a business perspective is shown in the film. of Event Management company paid to organize parties and make the rich, but not known to people, known for the night, clicking pictures with the celebrities invited to the party. <br /> <br /> Western culture has crept into high society Mumabi pretty deep, bold film shows, there are no forbidden techniques. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar begins a new journey from here.
