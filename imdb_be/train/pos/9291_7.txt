An interesting look at the opening of Japan to the West. John Wayne arrives in accordance with the agreements as a result of gunboat Perry as the first American consul to Japan. He is not welcome. Wayne eventually won after a meeting with the Shogun bring cholera epidemic entered the American ship under control. There stands a colorful procession to the capital, bearing gifts for the Shogun, while those bottles Old flypaper. The meeting with the Shogun, the debate among Japanese aristocrats and murder, during an archery exhibition represent an interesting perspective on the politics of the period. Overall, pretty good movie, and to how often you can see Duke lose a fight with a guy half his size.
