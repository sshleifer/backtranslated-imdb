Sight is a film that has been recommended to me years ago, my father, and I have seen it many times since. It is always possible to please me, at the same time effectively creepy as well. Retrospective scene that really did it for me. father of Christina Raines to run all fours, with two terrible women always manage to send shivers down my spine. is your typical good versus evil, but at least he manages to be interesting. The ending, I think one of the best horror stories. She has a lot of turmoil and uncertainty, seeing Burgess Meredith to do their job as Chazen, have me on the edge of my seat. The sight has the perfect build-up of tension. We are never quite comfortable when Allison on the screen. We know that something terrible is always waiting for her, and that made things more tense. This film is often neglected among horror fans, but I personally believe that this is one of the best of his there, and it's certainly enough for all horror fans, to be satisfied. <br /> <br /> performance. Christina Raines has wooden moments, but come, but in a big way, for the most part. It is beautiful to look at, and her chemistry with Saranadon felt natural. Chris Sarandon as big as one, Michael. He had an instant presence on the screen, and I could not help but love him. Martin Balsam, Jose Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger are all memorable role, or a small cameo. Burgess Meredith is terrific as Chazen. He looks like an ordinary old man, but what we find is absolutely terrible. Eli Wallach and Christopher Wlaken well as clumsy detectives. Beverly D'Angelo has one Chilling scene that I will not spoil. <br /> <br /> The bottom line. Sight is an effective horror film that horror fans, unfortunately, tend to be neglected. This will give you the thrills and scares you should be happy. Well worth a look. <br /> <br /> 7/10
