I do not Completist John Cleese (although I thought that «Fawlty Towers was brilliant), but I'm a fan, and when I saw this meeting, abandoned on a shelf at my local Blockbuster, I decided to give it a try. what I got was a wonderful surprise, and one of the funniest 50 minutes viewing experience I've ever had. The writing is a typical English "goon show" schtick. in fact, as an audio parody, it would not be out of place on the album «Firesign Theater". But the execution and timing on the spot, and it elevates the "country" in the form of a jaw dropping performance that can create lifelong British comedy fanatics. <br /> <br /> Britain has a gift for combining widely satirical pamphlets with closely observed "ticks" and the nature of time, and the creators are using both to good effect here Cleese image of "Holmes", it seems to be largely due to the Arkin and seller "inspector Clouseau" ;. However, Cleese has a knack for physical comedy, he more than holds his own. but here's an unexpected pleasure Arthur Lowe, who plays the "Watson" as a genius, but irresistibly idiot not to understand with such a wonderful time and delivery, it becomes the best aspect of the film. I had never heard of before Lowe (his background seems to vaudeville and musical theater), but he justifies his entire career with this performance, as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Some people might not care for "The Strange Case of ...", especially if the UK is not a whim of their "tea tea". But I am very glad that I got to see it before it disappeared from view.
