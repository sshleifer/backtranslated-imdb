"Kolchak: the Night Stalker" is an extremely entertaining show, in which the energetic, sarcastic, forty-something reporter repeatedly engaged in mortal combat with the supernatural (and sometimes extraterrestrial) forces. Based on a very popular pair of TV movies that feature the character of Kolchak, the series died a quick death in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but it nevertheless retains a strong cult today. But will the average viewer of modern be able to dig Kolchak and his weekly encounter with the undead? <br /> <br /> This is a really difficult question to answer honestly. Detractors of this series tend to argue that it is formulaic and hopelessly outdated. On the other hand, proponents argue that it is reasonable written, well acted, and sometimes really scary. And me? I have a foot in both camps. I thoroughly enjoyed watching all 20 episodes on DVD Kolchak lately, but I can clearly see that the series has serious drawbacks. <br /> <br /> I will consider Kolchak as a "formula" fiction first. Now, I think we can all agree that most TV shows have the formula - just about every episode of Columbo takes place along the same lines, for example. Repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself; In fact, critics have long recognized that viewers often use, and actively seek to recur entertainment. However, the problem with Kolchak that its formula is simply too rigid. - it is too repetitive, even the most generous standards <br /> <br /> In almost every episode, Kolchak investigates the murder, and discovers that it has been committed by one form or another monster. He tries to publish the story of the monster said, but his editor Vincenzo blocking him, always on the basis that Kolchak did not have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces at work. And, unfortunately, Kolchak also hinder police. So, in the end, Kolchak is doing some independent research on the monster, is figuring out how to kill him ... and then kill him. Without ceremony, or reward, or write a great story about this. <br /> <br /> You can see where this is all so strict formula can get tedious, right? I am particularly puzzled Vincenzo - when Kolchak always raved about the monsters, and Vincenzo never believe it ... Well, then, why not fire Vincenzo Kolchak, or make it? This is what any normal host will do. But a series of such realism shy and prefers to keep Vincenzo and Kolchak comic antagonists. As a result, many of these scenes with an incredibly deep - although they are also quite funny, <br /> <br /> The best episodes Kolchak managed to jump over the limits of this formula, but as a rule, because they contain. What an unexpected turn. These selected episodes rather well, I think that they are largely immune to the typical criticisms of the series. Some of my favorites include: <br /> <br /> The horror Heights - an episode that is typical for grimy, inventive and socially aware. Dialog Kolchak has unusually sharp edges and cynical. Although she sticks closely to the formula of Kolchak, the script (written by veteran Hammer Studios Jimmy Sangster) surprisingly competent, and he delves deep into the background of the monster <br /> <br /> The Devil's Platform. - a possible inspiration for «Omen» movies, this episode stands out for me because the thief - a very young Tom Skerritt - tempts Kolchak satanic contract full of goodies (and, thus, reveals a lot about the nature of the reporter.) <Br /> <br /> Firefall - this episode seems to have a bad reputation among the fans, but I liked him because he has a big red herring, and really awful, almost impossible to stop the apparent monster <br /> <br /> While I . ve identified these three episodes for praise, I would say that most of the stories entertaining at least. For my money, there are only two full turkey in 20-episode run: Primal Scream, which is about the monkey-men spread to Chicago, and Sentry, which includes a blunt form of make-up beings in the history of filmed entertainment (and this estimate is based on the life of Dr. Who and Godzilla fan!) <br /> <br /> ultimately, that's a good series. A bit repetitive, a little cheesy, perhaps, but there are elements of greatness. Even the weaker episodes, excellent work by Darren McGavin as caustic, tired, endlessly funny Kolchak really shines. He carries a number of efforts, so that, for example, Sarah Michelle Gellar has never succeeded in "Buffy." McGavin was a great character actor, and this series is worth watching it alone.
