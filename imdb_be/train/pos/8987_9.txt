I recently rented this document, remembering the rumors about it from IMDb.com and future intrigued premises. I knew very little about any of these groups, but I remember hearing "Not If You Were The Last Junkie on Earth" at the Dandy Warhols centuries ago and enjoy it That being said, it is my view of the document:. <Br / > <br /> One thing that I found incredible about this film there is no need to have any prior knowledge of any of these groups. the director (Ondi Timoner) wasted no time in engaging the audience and introducing them to the people in this movie. I quickly became the grooves of life and Anton and Courtney, as well as their respective bands Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think that's part of what makes this document so well, and that makes Ondi Timoner a master documentarian. <br /> <br /> I loved, too, as has been said, "history" of these groups. Most from the fact that you see the band on tour. Both teams begin to play a small place and struggling to make it in the recording industry. throughout the film, each group tends to remain unique and uncontrolled rate. However, that is what makes these two groups are similar, and thus, the brilliant prospect of the two pen strip can go in so many different directions. <br /> <br /> I mostly recommend it for those who love the film as a whole, you do not need to have a special love for documentaries, or any of the bands. Music score helps, but the music has the upper hand in the relationship of love / hate relationship between The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
