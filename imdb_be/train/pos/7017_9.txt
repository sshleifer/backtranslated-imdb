You spend most of this two-hour movie is interesting, "the story regarding the main character?» <br /> <br /> Will Smith as low key "Ben Thomas" will keep you guessing. The last 20-25 minutes, when you find out, and that's a shocker .... but did you know that something dramatic was about to open. By this time, Smith plays a mysterious, almost annoying people. You know that there is a compelling reason to do so, but it is never explained, once again, to keep us guessing until the end. <br /> <br /> All of this, including the newly / again, but a touching romance with Rosario Dawkins ( "Emily Posa») may make some viewers disappointed or desire to stop this film ..... but not because the final segment of the long puts all the pieces of this puzzle together. <br /> <br /> This is a two hour movie, rather than the typical action-packed macho Will Smith movie. In fact, the most shocking aspect can see shows, Smith sad face of all this history. It almost did not even like him in a number of frames. He looks like he's lost and hurt. Smith does a great job, which shows a man carrying around a lot of sadness. <br /> <br /> Like a good film will often make this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits.
