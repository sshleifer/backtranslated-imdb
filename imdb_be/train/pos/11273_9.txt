A year after the loss of the smart Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan) like Tarzan rival hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) returns to the jungle to have another bash to win the heart of beauty in brunettes. Mixing business with pleasure, he also plans to grab yourself some ivory from elephant cemetery, which lies outside the slope Mutia, lek. <br /> <br /> Tarzan accompanied by his mucus, philandering boyfriend Martin Arlington and a group of consumable media, Harry, finally arriving at their destination (with narrowly escaped death at the hands of the natives and wild rock-throwing monkeys) only, to find that Jane continues her enthusiasm musclebound yodeler, and even worse, that Tarzan refuses to let the hunter take any ivory from the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Nasty Arlington decides to resolve the issues of ambushes and shooting Tarzan, and then tells Jane Holt that Tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile. Of course, Tarzan was not dead ?? Only wounded; after being nursed back to health, Cheetah (!), he swings back into action just in time to save Jane from the tribe of evil savages Food Lion attacked the expedition Holt. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and His Mate, the second film star Weismuller as a human jungle a few words, often referred to by supporters as the best of the series; although I prefer a bit of the original, I can definitely understand the popularity of the film: it is damn sexy and there are some great action sequences! Undeniable chemistry between Weismuller and O'Sullivan fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scene, and with the two stars, bears eensy-weensy clothes around, there are eye candy galore for viewers of both sexes enjoy (despite advertised O'Sullivan underwater nude scene actually performed body double, an excellent lass still shows a lot of skin, even threatening to do "Sharon Stone" at one point, her loincloth flaps on one side!). <br /> <br /> the most exciting moments of the film come in a beautiful underwater struggle between Tarzan and the crocodile, and exciting Finale, where Jane attacks by lions and natives, but to save her boyfriend, his monkey friends and loads of elephants in full on mode lion crushing (again, violence strange reverse long though as far as I'm concerned, there's nothing as shocking as vicious pygmies and gorillas pit from the first film). Cheetah also has its fair share of risk, evading rhinos, crocodiles and big cats, riding on the back of Tarzan as he crosses the river, and even hopping on to ride an ostrich. <br /> <br /> Like its predecessor, Tarzan and His Mate does suffer a bit from some of the bad effects and unconvincing props ?? bizarre back projection, a few monkeys ridiculous costumes, more Indian elephants under the guise of their African cousins, and poorly disguised swing trapeze ?? but they should not spoil the fun of the very interesting film. In any case, they make it even more fun! <br /> <br /> 8.5 10 rounded to 9 IMDb.
