When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed on the screen. His greatness was my attention to the point that I focused all my attention on it for its entire duration. I would recommend to see him not only to fans of anime, but for those who love the great period films (or who like really strange things). art style is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbolism of it is breathtaking. I've heard complaints about the strange insertion of the English text in the movie, but I think the way it's done is in addition to a strange style of the film. Themselves to carry the description of Â«Hello Kitty on acid" does not do justice to this film absolutely epic proportions. I would like to find more work, who did it, and see them.
