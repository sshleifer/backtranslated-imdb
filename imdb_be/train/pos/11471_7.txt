I'm a big movie fan Verite and saw this movie, because I heard it was interesting. I can honestly say that it was very interesting. The two leading actors are amazing, the film is never boring, and the concept behind it (though, obviously inspired by the Columbine killings and home movies killers) really interesting. There are some drawbacks, such as the last 20 minutes, which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so, and the end does not really make any sense. Shaky camera can sometimes be a distraction, but in cinema Verite, is given. But I still think the film is very well made, and directed by Ben Coccio deserves credit.
