Have you heard the story of reluctant heroes who were hired by the king to kill the dragon? Oh, you have? Whether it is set in the world composed entirely of small islands, floating above the clouds, and even heroes have to make dangerous jumps from one island to another on their way? Or the flow of water up and the remains of the large cities were flying on the horizon? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> I came to this film by chance, and I am very glad that I did! This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Just like in the movies Pixar's, it is a piece of computer animation art, which can only be possible in the modern world. Animators put thought into almost everything that appears on the screen, and this attention to detail is striking (the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground of green smoke belching while the characters walk enthusiastically in the background is one of my favorites). Monsters are also fully implemented and perfectly observed in action. <br /> <br /> While the story may not be quite unique, the film has enough charm to make sure that you keep playing. Our protagonists are cute and interesting, providing an audience for them is almost impossible desire to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon that would otherwise devour everything in its path. Of course, the most Hector character fall in love with. Little blue creature with crazy smile and tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and English, Hector provides relief in the way of comedy Jar Jar Binks could only dream of. <br /> <br /> In general, I would recommend watching the dragon hunters, when you get the chance. See his incredible animation, breathtaking battle scenes and a glimpse into a world that is unlike anything you've seen on a movie screen or television. At least, this is an interesting way to spend an hour and a half - it does not matter if you are nine or twenty-nine (which, in fact, I)!
