The Color Purple for the Suppression of life and love, which helps those people impacted by the struggle for life. Each character was an element of purple in them. The film touches love, lost, hope, hatred and triumph. whether Celie survived hell and lose their sister, and Shug comes into her life, to show your love again, Albert is not being a man who recovers it correctly in relation to Celie, Shug avoided her father recognized him and in the end, and Sofia her stubbornness good and bad, and even the net they had a void and privation through the film, but was overcome in the end, and this is a sign of a good film. Good job to all the cast and crew.
