Some war movies succeed where others do not, and as can be seen from different angles. Humanistic angle, one where you can feel the raw emotions (fear of being under attack, a partnership among the soldiers in the ordeal faced by the people within them, when in combat, etc ..) are always movies I consider convincing. Films like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are only two examples of films that you feel a connection with the film's characters. <br /> <br /> This film is a success at this level. This indicates "royally honored" and that the honor of doing the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing, they were honored and recognized in this way, completely incompatible with Western thought, but it is, in the end, the true story of honor. Unforgettable film. Based on a true story.
