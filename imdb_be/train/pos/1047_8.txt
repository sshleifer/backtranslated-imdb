This may (or may not) find it interesting that the only reason why I really checked out the movie in the first place because I wanted to see human speech, which beat Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca, he (10/10 role for Best Actor Oscar. (I still would have given Oscar Bogie, but Paul Lucas did a great job and deserves the nomination, at least.) Well, I'm glad that I think to check this film, because I enjoyed it very much. the film preached a little, but I do not only do not mind, I enjoyed the speech and it was never boring with them. <br /> <br /> Acting was great in this movie. I especially liked Paul Lukas., Lucile Watson (rightfully nominated for an Oscar), Bette Davis (wrongfully is not assigned), George Kuluris and, oddly enough, Eric Roberts, who plays middle child, I really enjoyed his character: a strange boy, who speaks as a philosopher, he just cracks me even a symbol name (Bodo) funny <br /> <br /> endin g, in which the character Lucas was forced to do that... he thought it wrong, even if he does it for the right reasons, worked as well for me. I agree, why he felt for what he did, and I understood why he could not explain. Post this film makes a good and noble, the scenery (ie the house) is beautiful, and the effect is excellent. See this film if you ever get the chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
