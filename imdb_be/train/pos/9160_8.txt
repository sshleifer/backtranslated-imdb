All comments praising or cursing the work Dalton, I thought he was excellent. He has not played in Rochester, rather like a spoiled rich boy, but fraudulent, strong man. I liked this version, although shot in the video aspect is sometimes distracting, and scenes with Jane and St. John had never gelled. I give it an 8.
