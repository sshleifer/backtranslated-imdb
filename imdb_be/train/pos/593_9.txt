This game show lasted only one season, but has been intriguing the audience, because it requires the visual ability and a steady hand. One wrong move could disqualify the contestant to win the prize, despite the fact that it was clear that the Athlete knew the correct answer. It was always interesting, as a member started drawing, I wonder if they will complete the picture, or be buzzed out; allowing the other party to easily win the competition. It was a light-hearted show, but it was clear that the participants are often times confused by stupid mistakes made inadvertently. Rarely seen, the game show did not survive past one season. Only a seasoned game show junkie will remember this show, as it was very unpopular, although the game shows have been making a big comeback on the TV screen after the scandals of the 1950 th game shows. But it was a unique concept for a game show, and one that has never been seen again.
