I'm not a big fan of kitsch and camp "so bad it's good" type of view, however, I really like this movie for its fun factor and -. Believe it or not -. This innovation <br /> <br /> In general, things It has a ring of John Waters and boundless enthusiasm, but with some great actors and considered direction does much of the slapstick and styalised movements. Billy Zane is moving with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for the text of the lesson book in how to use motion) and framed by some unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> you may not like this movie, you may e do not like, but if you get a chance to see it, to find the time, because chances are you will finish the movie with the embarrassment of a smile on his face and a new perspective on the sense of humor of some big stars. Highly recommended.
