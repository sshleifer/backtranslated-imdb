During 1933, this film was a lot of cuts taken from him, because he was very on top of the content of the story and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) will do anything to get more wealth and power. Lily's father forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14, and she grew up in a steel mill in the city with very poor people, and her father led the Speakeasy, which brought to his house all types of male characters who have had their eyes on Lily , as the story progresses, Lily meets a man after man, and eventually finds a guy who has all the playboy president of the bank's good to see a very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr.), who was only 25 when this picture was made, and Jimmy did not even get to be the first PS to Lily, even for lunch. Very young George Brent, (Coutland Trenholm) stars with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave excellent performances. This is an excellent film from 1933, which was made by Zanuck and was closed in wine for many years, and only recently has shown on the silver screen. This film is fairly mild compared to what we see on the screens of Hollywood today, but in 1933 he was very naughty look, this type of film. enjoy
