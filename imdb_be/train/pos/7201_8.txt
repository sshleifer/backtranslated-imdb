Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep your head above water, after run out of ideas. I can not say much about this movie without giving away the story. I can say that was not enough, as it seems, as you look at the picture. Everyone has their own agenda. A nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good performances all.
