One of my favorite shows in the 80s. After the first season, he started to go downhill when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott cast. Deborah Pratt was excellent and it was fun to watch her and the character Ernest Borgnine go at it with each other. The last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites in the second season. Unfortunately, in those days, blacks did not last long on the television show. Some of the episodes of the second season, which is good, but the third season it was more about human nature than Airwolf and he was not shown until near the end of the show. When he went to the US, it was disgusting !!!
