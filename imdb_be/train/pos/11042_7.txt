In prison, four prisoners occupy a cell: Carrera (Gerald Laroche), who used his company to commit fraud, and gave it to his wife; resistance Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protégé, delayed Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who ate his six months sister; and intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrera finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the cell wall. They understand that this book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century, and black magic. They decide to read and use its contents to escape from prison, when they find the truth about the fate of Danvers. «Maléfique» is an original, intriguing and claustrophobic French low-budget horror film. History is almost in the same place, it does not have any cliches and does not catch the viewer's attention to the last scene. I'm a big fan of French cinema, as a rule, songs, drama and police stories, but I have noticed that in recent years I have seen some good French horror films, such as «Un Jeu d» Enfants "," Belphegor "and" Dead End " . . My vote is seven <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Small Sinais do" ( "Signs of Evil")
