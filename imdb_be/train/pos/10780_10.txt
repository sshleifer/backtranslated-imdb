Far my most favorite cartoons second Spielberg did after Animaniacs. Even if the ratings were low, so that, I still enjoyed it and loved it, was so funny, and I loved the actor, wow Jess Harnell and Tress MacNeille were there and it was just fantastic, all the acting was brilliant, especially the legendary Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this cartoon again, it was so strange, and jokes were brilliant. Also, I remember a happy moment Brain cameo in it, you hear his voice, and he played an instrumental theme PATb that was just fantastic, I love it in those cartoons where cameos pop. I want this cartoon Animaniacs and came back, I loved them
