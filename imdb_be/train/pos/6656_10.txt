This film just awesome.It was a very sensitive issue, and the film was superb.This film did not create any controversy in India (as far as I know), and his publicity also held low.Initially I thought that this film would be a waste of time as most Indian directors and producers, which are used to change the theme, even if it is very sensitive and adds romance to the original story and spoil the whole thing ... most Indian viewers would agree on this subject, if they remember Ashoka, Mangal Pande , LOC, etc .. <br / > <br /> There have been so many films in India, which would have been phased or mega-hits as part of a love story will be added too. <br /> <br /> But its treatment is very similar to the film Pinjar (must watch too). <br /> <br /> If it matters, I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (director) for making such a great movie ..
