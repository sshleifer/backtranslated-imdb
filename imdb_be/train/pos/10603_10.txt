I'm tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughter is constantly undergoing watch Nickelodeon, Disney and so on. All this seems to be the same old tired cartoons warm up again and again. When my daughter could not go to the fair in the afternoon, because one of them was sick, I would like to just kick back and relax for a while. I clicked the TV and looking for something else, I clicked channels. My finger stopped surfing the channel at that moment, when I heard the voice of Harvey. I love every single solitary thing this man did, and when I saw what he was doing voiceover work for a little duck ... well, I could not change the channel! My daughter was instantly mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show together, the more I loved him with the message that is currently drawing. This is not necessarily a supporter of "gay rights", and for those who have ever been ostracized as a child for nothing. I had friends that were collected for this or that thing .... too fat, too skinny, too feminine, being a bully, not being smart enough, just having one parent .... you name it! Children tend to be very, very hard for each other, so I was glad to see an entertaining cartoon, which actually gave LIFE message to his audience. My girls are already taking other as they are, and do not pick up on the other for being different. My oldest daughter is really worth for his friends when they teased (one happens to have a mother and a little girl was teased quite often - it warms my heart when Cassie was behind it). <, Br /> <br /> So, those of you who are judging this show, because you feel that this act of the "gay rights" or forced to "take certain views," you clearly and completely missed the point of this little shrill cartoon. <br /> <br /> And if you need to explain to you .... Well, you need more help than any television show ever could offer.
