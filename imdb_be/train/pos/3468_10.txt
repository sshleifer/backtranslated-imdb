I absolutely loved this film! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. Nevertheless, watching "Two of Us" brought me back to the happy time when he was still alive, and there is hope and opportunity. I think that the author has done an amazing job, that shows what "could be." Aidan Quinn It was beautiful, like Paul, and met with the head of a call on I was struck by his accent and mannerisms Jared Harris also very talented and very believable, like John My favorite part was the scene in the park and the scene on the roof -... who was so sharp. the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction, both of which I feel is the purpose of worthy, given the circumstances.
