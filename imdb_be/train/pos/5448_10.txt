This film is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flynn well as Bunny Packard. Zane Busby, Dolores is a comic genius. The rest of the cast is amazing and the film is really very funny. Certain satire of horror movies, with a funny twist. If you like fun, comedy filled evening, and then to go and remove this classic. You'll laugh all the way to the end!
