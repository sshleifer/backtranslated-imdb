it resembles the work of Stephen King and memorable childhood, filled with horror stories of how IT - as the opposite. There's not a terror in the child, that any of the friends - who are still on friendly terms 20 years before the line - remember, or seem to suffer from. K lines are described as friendly crowding may occasionally described as "carp" one or more of them, but simpler. There are no Tosca * * invested in the film and as participants later in life describe relationships - all we see young people who have grown to be basically the same person. More mature, but basically all the same people, the same power structures. <br /> <br /> In general, surprise! Not only for the fact that people actually can grow relatively general social conventions - but that friendship can actually last. In this respect, this film a tiny gem - one assumes it was the intention of the movie: portrait of unforced emotions connect people. That, when viewed in opposition to films coming years by drawing the dark side of childhood - a strict ban bowling for the plant is that it is easy to come to mind, but since the mid 80'ies, along with a growing love of children and childhood (in the 1000s, accompanied by advertising videos, animation and some aimed directly at children), several films and documentaries have had success with painting the dark side of adulthood - abuse, loneliness, desire to succeed - resulting in adults with dark and distorted minds <br. /> <br /> And here comes a film that says you can have a happy childhood, look'a'here <br /> <br /> Thank you for it !. Or counterweight illusion ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
