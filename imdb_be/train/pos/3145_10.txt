This 70th show is the best TV show ever, period. It's up there with Andy Griffen show, Saturday Night Live, and The Simpsons in my book. It continued 70s Show for 8 seasons, all of which are centered around a group of teenagers / young adults who are engaged in the relationship, separated from their parents, and their common future. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Eric and Dona, two teenagers, who live next door to each other. They live next door to each other for most of their lives, and are just beginning to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season. A large number of the show revolves around how their relationship work. <br /> <br /> The other two characters, Red and Kitty, Eric's parents. Red was in the service, so that it actually pushes Eric around. Kitty is just the opposite. Despite the fact that she drinks heavily, it belongs to Eric and his friends with great care. Bob, a neighbor, apparently Dad Donna. Bob chuckles around with several women during a rough story shows. Bob also annoying red in its entirety. <br /> <br /> remaining character, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie, are members of the Erika. They also play an important role in the history of the show. <br /> <br /> Well, the first season of the big. This is when the characters begin to experience new things for each other. The first season is an original, fun, and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second season is good, although it is not as good as the first. This is the main extension of the first. Eric and Donna together and everything works great. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. He came back and took the first season of feeling and humor. I also think that the nature of the chemistry has improved a bunch, doing show all that more interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not near as good. Eric and Donna Arne together in this slightly less enjoyable doing the show. It's still funny, though I did not enjoy it as much as the previous seasons. <br /> <br /> The fifth season of the last season I enjoyed all the way through. This gang of senior year, so that really helps with the story. The fifth season was also the best final of all seasons. <br /> <br /> The sixth season is good for the most part. It's very funny, but it does not reflect the feeling that other seasons do. The gang from high school, so I think that he did not get a teenager to feel that previous seasons did. I also did not like the last three or four episodes, given that they were the main drama feel to them. <br /> <br /> The seventh season captures the same sense that the fifth season was in the way, though useless "t make it all the way. I enjoyed the seventh season, as I did all the others, and the ending is great. <br /> <br /> Last season flat out sucked. Eric was not in it, which destroyed it. Kelso was not in it for the most part anything that did not help. I hated the eighth season until the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good, and the right end of the series. <br /> <br /> In general, if you love comedies, give it a try 70s Show. They stopped making new episodes, but still on TV a bunch. I also recommend buying seasons 1-7. It's up to you if you want to buy the 8 th season.
