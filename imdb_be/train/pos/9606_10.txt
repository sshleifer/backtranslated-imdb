It was the best movie I have ever seen about bulimia. He hit the exact spot that bulimia is actually about how and it's not always about how empty and diet. He showed how people with bulimia tend to think of such things as their outlook on life, friends and themselves. The best line and the part that really shows that the problem with bulimia, when the beta say, "This is not about you!" This line really showed a lot of character and others with the same problem. He showed that people with bulimia do not have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else. He should do with them, and them only. This shows that it is time to talk about the person with the problem, instead of all the attention on himself. He showed that the beta need to call attention to the moment, and she needed her mother's attention while the most.
