Has anyone been able to buy this film? My uncle, "The Cage" was Real (no Reel) Pilot, which has seen throwing their wings in the air, then grabbed them with his fist, he was awarded his pilot wings. <br /> <br /> It is only on screen for a few seconds, but my family wanted to have the film. He was killed in an air battle over Italy, he was only 24 at the time. We know the studio that made it? <br /> <br /> Or has anyone seen him in a video store like Blockbuster? I wish they would have made the entire catalogs of these old movies available, as it is so cheap to make a DVD these days. <br /> <br /> Please contact me at nfny40@yahoo.com, if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you.
