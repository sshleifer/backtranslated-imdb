Cult film for every true Russian intellectual. All brilliant, particularly active: this is beyond praise. The film, like the book, full of symbols: my favorite one is the most prominent symbol of Razrukha (colloquial Russian word "ruin" often means a period of chaos lifestyle after the Civil War of 1918-20) - wide-opened door in the dirty wall brick Pisco snow and wind hell hole the door behind him. <br /> <br /> now the film is released on DVD with a fully restored picture and 5.1 sound, there is a well translated English subtitles, too, though some obscene words Sharikova were replaced by softer versions in translation. I do not know that the DVD is available abroad, but if you find it to grasp it immediately, it really deserves to see <br /> <br /> And finally, the fact :. About 50% of Russians today, mostly young people, can be identified as Sharikovs largely. This is a post-Soviet effect: the Soviet people were completely unprepared for the information attack Western civilization, TV producers and filmmakers have made the entertainment industry and the country's media are aggressive, callous and thoughtless, so he incited the darkest instincts of every Russian. Even among internet users every third one uses foul language in the forums and chat rooms, because it is surprisingly common in colloquial language.
