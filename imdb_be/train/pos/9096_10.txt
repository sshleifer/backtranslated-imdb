Lovely! I have seen Domestic Import in Philadelphia in October with my children. We are all so pleased with what we saw it a second time with my parents. I have not heard them laugh like that in recent years! It was the first time I remember a movie that my parents and my children can enjoy. It's very cute, and we can not wait to get out on DVD. They should make more movies like Domestic Import. It is refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy (and feel free). I have not seen the movie is cute as My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as a mother. She was also in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman in it too, and it fun. I remember him WKRP.
