I have a lot of time for all Colombo movies, but this one in particular was very well written, and the decision in the end is very effective. However, my main memory of this is the opening scene in the middle of the film, between Columbia and a murderer (I apologize if I do not remember every detail of this exactly). It is the most vivid image of the Columbia, I saw: a view from the inside of the cabinet of darkness, where the victim was killed, and the room for which was lit by daylight. Columbo sitting in high-backed chairs, facing the door (and us), contemplating the wardrobe, and almost in silhouette at the expense of the light contrast. There's no sound. The camera moves slowly out of the room and toward him. He was deep in meditation, gently puffing on cigars, curls of smoke from cigars circled slowly upward as he thinks. Then a dialogue begins. Superb.
