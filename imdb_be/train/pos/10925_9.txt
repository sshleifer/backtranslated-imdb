I really like this movie. I can see on a regular basis and not tire of it. I believe that this is one of my criteria for a great movie. <br /> <br /> The history is very interesting. He introduces us to 6 characters; each of them has a unique style of kung fu, which is a very sensitive and very deadly. Each of these characters enrolled in the same master, but their faces are kept secret from each other. The dying master sends 6-poison his last student to try and make the correct wrongs that he suspects that some of his students made. <br /> <br /> As the last student to find other poisons? As he will know which one is bad? How these questions are answered part of what makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> We can also see a food fight with each other in any combination. It is interesting to see how their styles match against each other. <br /> <br /> If you want to see if you like kung fu movies, this is a good movie to begin with. It does not get any better than this.
