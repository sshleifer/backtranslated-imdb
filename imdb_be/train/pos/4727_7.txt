I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this movie. Witty letters (some "inside" jokes that I received, and the other I did not - maybe because of the actors who speak to each other), a great cast (in particular, John Cassini), great cameos and interesting unique directorial. I take him to see Jeffrey obliging (very disappointed, he was there such a short time, blink and you'll miss it!), But you have seen that movie a surprisingly interesting. I actually watch it again before I send back to Netflix. I think that the actors and want-to-be actors will fully enjoy this film. The ending is somewhat expected, but wished they would have done something different (and more positive). It is a pity that the film was not better received, as in the "festival" of the market, with the exception of. I believe it is for those who love the acting biz.
