I went through the list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that the film hit Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for best film in 1969. After actually seeing it, but I'm not surprised anymore. It was way ahead of its time in its terms of style, cinematography, as well as the use of flashbacks to help develop the character. <br /> <br /> Joe Buck's most amazing to me is the depth of the character of Joe Buck in a short film. I think Voight took innocence and perversity, once provoked. The two scenes that were really caught me after he gets a blowjob in the theater and, if an elderly person achieves it. I think when he looks in the mirror, he is trying to see if this really is it that has done- or going DO- something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think it was a brilliant decision Hoffman to accept this role, otherwise it can be a type after you graduate. In any case, it is considered an all-time high for a reason.
