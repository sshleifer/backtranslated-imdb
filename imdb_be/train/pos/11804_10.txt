It puts the film as a joke. My friends and I were laughing so much fun to it, I went and found a used copy, and bought it for himself. Now, when all my friends are looking for the funniest movie I give them Sasquatch Hunters. It has to be said, though there is a rule that has been done, that made the film that much better. None of the conversation is not permitted while the film is about as long as the words are not repeated in the singing Sasquatch. I loved the credit at the end of the film as well. "Thank you for the jeep, Tom!" Who is Tom, I say thank you, because without your jeep film could not have been made. In short a great movie, if you are looking for something to laugh at. If you want a good movie, maybe look for something else, but if you do not mind a good laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit to take a copy.
