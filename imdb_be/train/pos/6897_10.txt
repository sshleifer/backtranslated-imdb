It was released in France on DVD a few years ago - I want it to be reprinted, with English subtitles. Do not confuse this with a remake with Penelope Cruz, who gets bad reviews. Gerard Philippe is a farmer, told by a fortune teller that he marries the daughter of the king. He goes into the army and sent to war. His love, however, Gina Lollobrigida in the beginning of the film for her. I will not spoil the ending. Gerard Philip died a few years later at a young age, large losses in moviedom.
