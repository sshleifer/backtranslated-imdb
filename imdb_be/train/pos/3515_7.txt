Pretty good picture of the person being in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the killer wanted to hit a lady, why not just from her, and let the police are trying to figure out whodunnit? The inclusion of all these characters in the story is dangerous, not to mention all the mouths you have to worry about to be closed. Why depressed lady to go to the bar where she could barely sit in a chair or to say a word? Do cops really that there is wise cracking, popping gum, grinning monkeys that fit the suspect in such a lively manner? This is likely to play well before the wheel was invented, but it is so corny and unbelievable today. Catch a break manic drum Elisha Cook; he is obsessed with knocking never matches an entry. His frantic facial expressions compensated exception serviceability synchronization stick.
