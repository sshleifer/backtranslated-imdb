Norman, is that you? It was (all it third hand, so take it with a grain of salt), adapted to the African-American family with a Jewish one, when she made the transition from stage and screen. In addition, it was one of those films originally starred in the video, so that the prints from the theater can not be great. Nevertheless, the performance of Redd Foxx and others were very good. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to tell you all that the film is a period piece: it reflects the relationship in the mid 70s to the beginning to find out about you have a gay son or daughter in the family . For this reason alone, it is quite interesting- if not a little "Hollywood". You do not believe me? Check the line of curtains, etc. Very stereotypical. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the film really shines in several areas. There is a side of the splitting of the scene when Redd Foxx tries to find his wife, who went with his brother (!) In Ensenada in abbreviated to Pinto. Telephone conversation across the border a truly memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the film when Wayland Flowers and Madame made him / them gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. As far as I know, this is the only time when the procedure has been removed. And it's a little cleaned up and much shorter version, I said. However, this vintage madam, and it should not be missed. People are still stealing lines from Wayland; This man was truly gifted. Enjoy the movie!
