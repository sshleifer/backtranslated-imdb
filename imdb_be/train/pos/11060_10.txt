This film is excellent. Compilation, management, operating all fantastic. Very witty and clever script. The quality of performance of actors, Eli Sheedy is strong and dynamic and magical quirky. Really original and heart warmingly unpredicatable. Scene alive with fresh energy and truly talented production.
