It is almost a typical Lynch. However, what makes this film a bit unusual for Lynch is the fact that it looks very raw, almost amateurish. But I believe that Lynch is doing it on purpose to give a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments <br /> <br /> However, many of Lynch typical motifs present, such as :. Floating camera work; pursue music; long (agonizing) suspends; hanging curtains; dim lights grows darker when slow (almost invisible) rates; extreme close-up; female threads are in trouble; over-bearing, incompassionate, everyone who knew the characters facing off with characters that are not aware of it, temporarily ignoring, in the dark, and so on ... <br /> <br /> The performances large and short as believed provoking. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything to interpretation. Many questions remain unanswered, and it ignites the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant effort by Lynch. I just hope he makes some shorts, more along the lines of its Sony Playstation 2 commercials. They were inspired.
