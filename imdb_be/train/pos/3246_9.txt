I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not help laughing. Everything about this film seemed to call, plot, characters, settings. As for the film concerns I would not call it a great film, but for what it should be, it's just fantastic. He gets it mean diameter. The cast can be just as good as any ever put together in a comedy. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neill funny. For this purpose, who have not seen it, I'll give you a quick overview: Four criminals were found in a small town in Montana, after receiving a letter from his friend's bank robbery. However, if one is arrested by two police who went from New Jersey for them, they are trying to figure out what was happening and all hell breaks loose. The film is really big bank caper comedy and kind of like a bad version of Oceans Eleven staffed, with only four criminals who can not stand each other, and in Montana, not Las Vegas. In general, if to laugh, I would highly recommend you see this movie.
