I watched this movie with my child's eyes, and I was not disappointed. The story is well known, some abandoned orphan should be brought to his parents, an incredible trio (mamooth - Sabertooth Tiger and lazy animal) ... And I do not want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut. This one really made me laugh a lot throughout the film <br /> <br /> In short :. It works, it's funny, and it's "must see" with their children (they love it).
