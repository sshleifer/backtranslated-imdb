Richard Attenborough is the director, whose name is synonymous with Oscar "Gandhi" award, as early as 83. I do not know of any other work it so I recently came across Â«Cry Freedom", was released in 1987. While that may not have been as popular as it is Gandhi, it's just as gripping, if not more, and it was released when South Africa still do not get rid of the shackles of apartheid. While the majority of films on social issues came after the event occurred, I think, that was released in time. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real characters and events. The book on which the film was based, was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who used to work not in South Africa before the end of the seventies. He traces the origins Woods friendship with the charismatic black leader Steve Biko, who magnificently portrayed by Denzel Washington. I can not imagine a better choice for this role. Washington exudes a natural charm and screen presence where necessary character Biko. <br /> <br /> While initially, Woods was against what he felt was black racism disseminated Biko, after a meeting with the man, he could not get involved in his struggle and ideas. The connection between them becomes stronger, and Woods and his family understand and become more sensitive to the plight of the people of Biko is. <br /> <br /> However, ultimately, tragedy, and Woods must now focus on the escape from South Africa, with his book, so he can post it and let the outside world know what is happening. The second half of the film the fascinating story of his escape from South Africa, with his family, and will keep you on tenterhooks. <br /> <br /> There are some charmingly humorous dialogues too. The scene between Biko and a lawyer in the court room is an example <br /> <br /> Lawyer :. Are you in favor of violence? Biko: I stand for a confrontation. Lawyer: Well, is not this violence, Mr Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. You and I have an opposition now, but I do not see any violence. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments that lead you to the horror that pervaded the country to a sense prevailed. The scene in which the army opened fire on students protest is gut wrenching and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> It is definitely a must see. I would suggest you not familiar with the work of Attenborough, requires no time for that. There are movies that make a lot of money. And there are movies that make life. I would prefer the latter any day.
