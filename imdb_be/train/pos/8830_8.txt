This masterpiece frames in B / W 35mm. The film makes you see the amazing way to start the day at 7:35 am in the bar and how many things can happen there in 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> A brief enough, gets you into the complex history, using very few elements, and a step to step makes you realize that something is not quite right. It expresses a lot, makes your adrenalin high level with fine details and incredibly obvious to everyone, and not just critics, experts <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds :. European short, black and white, and a low budget. Do not let that scare you. It is really worth seeing anyone, not just experts in this genre. <br /> <br /> Or, not exactly much more to say, since the film only lasts 8 minutes (exactly), and I do not want to spoil it. But I just watched it online, and I could not understand why no one had a few minutes to leave a comment about it. <br /> <br /> In fact, worth watching. 10/10.
