I always wanted to David Duchovney go into the movie business, and, finally, he did, and it made me proud. This film lived up to what I had hoped for. Duchovney very well played his character, being able to stay in line with something new, instead of playing molder agent we used to. Therefore, I give him extra credit for his role, but also because I could not see who else is playing the special character. David was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. A brilliant performance that you do not get tired throughout the film, because he will never be able to surprise you. He has weaknesses and strengths, which makes the story all the more believable. I also really liked the story, he added to the history of a good cause, and was very memorable quotes, which I still use for the entire time. This film was also wounderfull account. I recommend it for anyone who loves drama, and no blood objection.
