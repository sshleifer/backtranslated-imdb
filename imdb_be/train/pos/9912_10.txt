Absolutely wonderful drama Ros and highly professional ... I highly recommend this film. Her performance, in my opinion, was the Oscar stuff! The only real sad fact is that Universal did not see that this movie was always available in any video format, whether tape or DVD. They ignore the very good film. But Universal has a little attention to your library on DVD, which is boring. If you get a chance to see it somewhere (do not know why he rarely even work on a cable), see it! I will not go down in history, because I think that most people would prefer to have an opinion about the movie, and too many "reviewers" for hours writing about the history that is available anywhere. <br /> <br /> 10!
