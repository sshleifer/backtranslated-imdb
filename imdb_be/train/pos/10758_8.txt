9/11 is a classic example of a movie Verite, a kind of realistic documentary, in this case New York fire fighters as they struggle against one of the most extraordinary events in world history. These are all small, inconspicuous, hand-held camcorder, often betrayed the poor quality of most of the filming (and director, Naudet often hand in wiping the screen). <br /> <br /> In this movie you to see most of the fire - Tony Benatatos, rookie (or «probie», in New York City firefighter slang), Fire Chief Joseph Pfeifer (who believes that he lost his brother later) and several others. There is a studio interview with a majority of people across the film, just to emphasize the personal, reflexive nature of events. The growth is quite dramatic and well done, particularly the adoption of failure Fire in the ceremony with a few useful whistle-pans and a kind of dialectic of editing rather limited filmwork (as well as a few good men Rob Reiner). Tony looks with pride <br /> <br /> The point of view and the camera angle, usually from among firefighters, it is interesting, and there are some lovely footage from inside the foyer WTC1 while Pfeiffer and his team are planning what to do on. - Verite is a classic movie. There is also a weird, haunting sound of accidental human body, which is broken against the portico outside. It is unfortunate that all Fire Chief Pfeiffer realizes more and more that his job is a desperate and probably hopeless - and that's before WTC2 destroyed. You must give Naudet of knowledge that should be removed and at what point. <br /> <br /> Sound of nearby WTC2 destroyed so terribly boring, coasters and scary that you understand what the test is for the firefighters. From the lobby, it looks, feels and sounds like the end of the world, and the poor firemen look so completely confused and frightened. You hear a great roar, shaking the whirlpool - both giant, monolithic beast slowly fall to the ground after being so mortally wounded - neighboring tower collapsed even the fire brigade, which remains in WTC1 do not pay attention to this event. Where is the connection <br /> <br /> This film captivates even amateurish story and should have been avoided - Kiev, as "it really was a day like no other," or often banal utterances Naudet as "you can see the fear in the eyes of all and "I knew that Tony was uncontrolled"! The film is really only one long video diary. There are no photos of the building above, which went some of the firefighters. Imagine this film mixed with CCTV footage from some of the rooms above or some of the news of the day. The effect would be greater. You could even combine the story with this mayor Giuliani and possibly famous Cornishman Rick Riscorla, who literally had many floors up action hero. <br /> <br /> I do not see a lot of propaganda element in this film, as some observers believe. This film Triumph of the Will, by Riefenstahl. After a while the fire draping an American flag on a number of preserved buildings overlooking that became Ground Zero. So <br /> <br /> There are also some questionable moments filming; for example, who holds the camera, when two brothers Naudet reunited back to the fire station? Is this set? <br /> <br /> There is a lovely decoration, very beautiful in the traditon of French director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima My Love), with two stripes of light reflected in the water, the shimmy.
