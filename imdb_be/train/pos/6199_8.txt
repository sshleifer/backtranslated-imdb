As someone who watched and followed Hartley public work for a few years, I think that much of what was once fiction is told through real stories built in the obscure philosophical intellectual game. <br /> <br /> While entertaining, Fay Grim is another step in Henry Fool line of thinking, where the film reflects the quality of the object within the movie. Henry Fool memories object ... The Fay Grim, the object is encrypted memories - which are themselves stolen, counterfeit and trans-mutated into something so incomprehensible that he could not actually make any sense - that is, the process of writing the script and filmmaking in the modern era - where most of the blockbuster little more than a mess of the past. That is, in the philosophical sense, that Fay Grim is all about. The object may be a tragedy, a shock is now a clich√© and boring (as it was in the first scenes in the publishing office). <br /> <br /> At the same time, many of the film's best points are lost if you do not understand the nature and significance of Henry wanted memories. Henry disguised devil, Simon's first visit as a modern Faust, etc. Without an understanding of the nature of the tragic Henry has a lot of quality Fay Grim in the story and the stories are lost. <br /> <br /> And it is not enough "detail" manifested through verbal retrospection - knowing the story of Henry Fool can not be compared with the "sense" the heroes of quality as one made in Henry Fool, and so I think that for someone, who walk in this film cold for about 10 minutes. on "so that" the answers to highly constructed dialogue, and then it all <br /> <br /> However, Henry Fool was also my least favorite Hartley film, until I realized that it was bad - rotten and infected - precisely because Henry Fool confessions were bad ... not just a lustful or dirty, but steadily broken. Henry can not even actually a villain - and this is perhaps the tragic flaw that makes it the most attractive ... like Gollum in the Tolkien works, Henry plaintively <br /> <br /> It does not come across in Fay. make-up, although the dialogue Henry's fine. That comes in the fact that the entire film is built as encryption - the formation of a kind of another site around what ends up being yet another bad story to add confessions Henry. This is an interesting twist, but one that can not really be digested without watching the first film. Perhaps more revealing Henry sooner would be better than the publisher described the storyline of the first film - although the story is not quite what the first movie was about. - if possible, one is not casual observers <br /> <br /> Part of encryption? It's hard to tell ... a little disappointed in the sexual tricks, though. Cheese.
