Ultra-bleak crime drama from SOA-Soi Cheang, director of «Home Sweet Home». Tone, it reminded me of Billy Tan «Run and Kill", although it is not as polished as it is. Nevertheless, it is an attractive, spoiled a little chaos of the Cambodian singles, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill the lawyer. Fleeing the scene, he kills a policeman partner Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, in the midst of the struggle with his dying father, so Sam starts insane, obsessive hunt for Pang resulting in close to a dozen corpses and the relentless violence. There must be something in the air lately, because I've never seen so many people fighting the flesh from one another, as I have recently. It is a grim, unpleasant things, so I was so indifferent to her, and I welcome his pessimistic vibe. This visually striking and sound design is unique. Radical, all spiral down until each character finds him- or herself in the world of cries of pain. Podagovor involving Pang attachment to the sexually abused girl adds depth stories and generates an unexpected fourth act, which boasts a great act of grotesque surgery.
