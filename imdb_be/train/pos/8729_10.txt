A Bug's Life is a very good animation. This film is for young children, but it's also a great movie for people my age. The story about the ant named Flick. He brought ruin on his colony, when he destroyed the food, which were for the higher horsepower. He gets kicked out and he needs to find more bugs to fix the mess. This film is a classic because it's a good film, and this film is Pixar. The animation is brilliant, especially for the end of the 90s. History is good, but a bit more detail would be enough. Voice acting is good, like most animated films. Music pleasant to listen to. Nothing special, but it's not nominated for one of music categories. In general, the film beat me in awe. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this film 10/10.
