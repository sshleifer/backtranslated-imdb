Allow yourself to be transported to the other, an old-school kind of stories. Scoop the classic Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> last muse Allen, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared in Match Point last year, as well as Elena), marvelously able to muffle her hot sex kitten appeal and turn in the usual form, with the type of student using nerdish glasses and clothing, but still not able to make the audience believe how lordly character Hugh Jackman may be so fighting it, given the background of the Royal (do not worry, Sun spoilers here). There are no great changes for Johansson's character here, as she is constantly playing the same character in all, despite the scenario of other words. You'll even forgive her apparent lack of logic of the character, continuing to deal with the suspected serial killer, simply because it is His Royal Hotness Jackman, which is refreshing to see the SANS NRB Wolverine. <br /> <br /> If anything, consistency is the fact that 70-year-old Allen all. He continues to tell their stories on film in the same way he always has; as if he had never been subjected to modern filmmaking, which is probably what makes it quiet, simple movies attractive. They never seem to be directed to a specific market; as though Allen makes films in his taste alone, whether or not the public likes.
