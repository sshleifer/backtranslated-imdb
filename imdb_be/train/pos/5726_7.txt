«The Grudge» is a remake of Shimizu own series of popular Japanese horror films. Shimizu knows that he is not engaged in anything new, so he does what any reasonable person would have done in his place: he forgets logic and concentrates giving viewers a fun trip. It uses well-known clichés associated with ghosts, but Shimizu plays with these elements in shape. Non-linear narrative is not just a gimmick, but a fun way to introduce the sequence from different angles. In the end, all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror movie to scare the audience (as well as a comedy should make people laugh), this film succeeded with flying colors. I watched it at the cinema with the audience, and it was interesting to see the audience go wild over this. It probably does not play as well in the living room.
