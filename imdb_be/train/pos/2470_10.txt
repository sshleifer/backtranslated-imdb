After the initial shock of the realization of filling Mr. swearing to shoot it, I literally trembled with excitement to have this epic only in front of me. I was not disappointed. Shakespeare is so true and yet so accessible. He blew my mind. I always like to see, or rather hear, Bran, and it made me think ... it's a film dubbed in other countries? That would be like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa.
