This is a film that can make you want to see it again. Especially because I like the way it ended. I did not see how it ends, but if the laws are not blown away the first time, one suspects that it will be again. <br /> <br /> The history of seizure and could be more psychological, but I understand the story needed to capture the audience and the action was necessary to do so. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that Michael Jr. can be so, perhaps, unwavering, his younger brother and mother, like blown away. But I can appreciate the play scene could not take our attention there, because it was a great story. <br /> <br /> Some complained Hanks as a gangster. I believe that it is not justified. When his character was harder, he would not have cared, when his son pulled the trigger or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this. Although he was released in 2002, I just saw him yesterday for the first time on DVD.
