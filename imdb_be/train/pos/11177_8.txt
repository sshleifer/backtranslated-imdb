***** SPOILERS ***** here, <br /> <br /> What really scares you? Killer shark, or maybe ghosts try to return a message? Maybe chainsaw has a psychopath? <br /> <br /> can be. But these fears are not even compare with the horror that people do not dare to talk about or even think - and this is the death of his own child. "Pet Sematary" knocks the base, primal fear of adults, and then takes it in place, most of them could not explore. <br /> <br /> I have read comments about this film, which include poor action, the nature of making stupid decisions, etc. I do not agree. The current is really the first year for a film like this. Maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the frustration as a result of such a scenario. But the events of the film is not only logical, that they can be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario is possible. This is a real horror of "Pet Sematary": it is not that pets and people come back from the dead as the evil murderers who are hunting with a knife and a scalpel, is that anyone who has lost a child can become so desperate to commit crimes that Louis Creed does. Despite the warning, or even prehistory. <br /> <br /> The film takes those who want to go with him to the depths of the human heart desperate. Tread the heart tries to compensate for failing to protect. And the results are terrible. In fact, if the film is immersed in the chopper territory towards the end, it's almost disappointing, although I believe that it is quite logical, how it got there. <br /> <br /> I'm a real fan of horror, and I would argue that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made. If you do not think so, to see him again after you have kids.
