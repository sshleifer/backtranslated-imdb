Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing film starring Frank Sinatra and generation of Kelly and Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> The film won the Oscar for by George E. Stoll, and he was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly and Best Cinematography, as well as a nomination for Best Son "I fall in love too easily" in Sinatra's performance. <br /> <br /> It was a cute story about Kelly helps his friend Sinatra get a girl and fall in love with her himself. Excellent Grayson (Toast of New Orleans) dazzled us with their singing, and we had a lot of good songs and dances Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the skill of pianist-conductor Jose Icherbi. <br /> <br /> Hollywood classic music era gone by.
