The closest I ever came to see it was a video shown at Philip Gerard exhibition in Paris about two years ago. I had no interest in the remake and has just caught up with the original a little more than half a century after it was done, I can only conclude that the inept guard was deliberate, aimed at long outdated goals. Hollywood made realistic sword fights, since the 30s, when the greatest of them all, Basil Rathbone, crossed foils with Errol Flynn and the others, so equipment was available and so that there is only a satire. After a while you did not notice, and revel in the Henri Jeanson dialogue reminiscent of The Prisoner of Zenda, both versions. Gerard Philippe, of course, was the presence to bring the role as Gina Lollobrigida and probably a little bit better than Martine Carol, the other obvious candidate at that time. Imprint I saw was something very bad, and at one point broke down completely, so maybe, DVD version will enhance it.
