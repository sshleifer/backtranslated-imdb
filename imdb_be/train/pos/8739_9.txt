It's a funny movie. It has all the usual components Disney (music, a large selection of characters, plot, appeal), interwoven with beautiful animations and excellent voice talent lesser-known actors as they say, «Antz» and «Egypt Price." <, Br /> <br /> characters work very well, and has a strong appeal, and humor is aimed at a broad level that overcomes the barriers between generations. The film is also presented in an excellent format cinemascope, which adds to the movie experience. <br /> <br /> Call me crazy, but I've seen the film three times, and I intend on taking a camping moat to see him this weekend, many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and were not disappointed. I am working in a multiplex, and I can honestly say that no one came out of this film without a sense of satisfaction. <br /> <br /> See, and not delay, because it's animated, you are sure to enjoy this film, and make sure you stay for the credits in the bloopers and out-takes at the end are the funny part of the movie which packed laughs throughout.
