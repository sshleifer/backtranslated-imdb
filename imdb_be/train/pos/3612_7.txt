Michelle Rodriguez well-built high school student who discovers that she has a powerful shot and starts to amateur training in the gym in Brooklyn. Santiago Douglas is a beautiful young man, a little older than her, who also trained there. They meet after school, so to speak, and feel attracted to each other. No sex. Santiago was instructed to keep it for his next fight. <br /> <br /> Both are participants in the "gender-blind" sports program, which does not make any distinction between men and women, a mistaken attempt to level the athletic playing field. <br /> <br /> conservative radio commentator recently announced - and I swear I'm not making this up - "Let's face it, a black president." I am here to do the same astute observation - "Men and women are different." Now, in 99 cases out of 100, it is not necessary to make any difference in physical performance. But in the top one percent - training athletes whose skills were honed to a fine edge - men tend to have an advantage. Of these, they can run faster narrow hips. And they have greater muscle mass and strength of the upper torso. These differences in physique allow women to give birth and raise children and for men to catch and kill them for food. This sexual duality is the result of a completely normal process of natural selection. Without this there can be no people at all. And that, folks, is why they have a men's events and events at the Olympic Games women. I'm talking to you as your anthropologist. It will be ten cents prefer PayPal. <br /> <br /> That's why I called this gender-blind program mistaken. As a talented boxer Rodriguez is, as it is close to the zenith of the game, it will eventually lose to the man. <br /> <br /> This is where the complication arises in this film. Rodrigues finally matched her boyfriend, Douglas. Neither wants to lose any anger at the other, not to mention the right-circularly, but as an honor on the map, and the honor, as a personal and gender related. Douglas refuses to deal with a woman in the ring. And Rodriguez offended by what she sees as his condescending attitude. It ends happily. <br /> <br /> I really was not expecting much from the film. I thought it would be a rip off with Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby", until I discovered that it was released years earlier. And I've never heard of, the director or any of the performers. This kind of uncertainty is usually a screw is bad - because mourners television, etc. <br /> <br /> But I was surprised at how accurately it together .. Complete lack of pathos left me with my mouth open. So did the minimal use of boxing cliches - a frayed rope, the blood, cutting the swollen eyes, downed faces after the fight, fat and sweaty spectator shouting, "Kill him!" The slow movement of the landing on the glove nose, sweat spray with crumple head, heroic music signaling the long-awaited apotheosis winner. Nothing like this here - well, almost none. The whole story can be considered unchanged. Tough kid finds a way into the ring, etc. <br /> <br /> The feeling you are left with is that it is probably in large part, these amateur competitions are like. Unlike the ones we see on TV and in conventional films. A lot of the ringing of the ring, for example, instead of dancing and observant referee shouted: "Stop!" And "Box"! Contestants wear a hat. Gym filled not crowd cheering spectators, but only a handful of people who have a special interest in what is going on. It is a clean film, despite the rather gloomy situation and the dynamics of the unfortunate family. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez can look pretty average than its muscle mass, and her eye that glows under a lowered brow, but once you get used to the idea that this is a girl who can beat you at any time cellulosic she wants, and as soon as you hear the female contours of her supersegmentals, it is not bad. (The scene in which she fights her father to the floor to overdo it.) It was a little difficult to understand restraint Douglas, when Rodriguez was crawling all over him in bed. Director Karyn Kusama, carefully chose her talent. <br /> <br /> Shows what you can do with some talent, imagination and a bit of money. There should be more movies like this. Take one of these multi-billion dollar blockbuster full of dinosaurs and spaceships and generosity spread around a bit.
