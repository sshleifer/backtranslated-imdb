I enjoyed this film. I did not see Andy Griffith age and felt that he fit the role perfectly. I linked it with comedy, but I'm glad to see that it is universal. <br /> <br /> I was not concerned that Dottie in "anxiety disorder" can not be verbatim from a psychiatric textbook. There are one billion all-phobias and neuroses, and they can take on a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. It is clearly noticeable from the extra-sensory powers, as it was interpreted by the Indians, but not any of the Anglo-Saxons. Not surprisingly, that this character is vulnerable, and nominally eccentric. <br /> <br /> Though it takes light "family film" is actually more complicated than it seems. In addition, Hiram twist at the end was a pleasant surprise for me and tied all the previous action together in a bundle. It's interesting to contemplate the possibility of such a spiritual guide.
