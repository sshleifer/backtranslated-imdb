This was the beginning of it all! Of course, it's not at its best friends, but it was the pilot of the show, let's not forget this is not bad. We met with the band and the Central Perk, where our story begins. Even from this first episode, we get a sign relations Rachel Ross, which will come in the next ten years, when Ross says "I just want to be married again," and Rachel storms in wedding dress in the sun ... probably intentionally, in while the authors were going for a relationship Monica Joey, but fit perfectly now, when looking back. Something else .. in this episode Rachel is introduced in Chandler, as if the two had never met before, but in later episodes, the so-called "retrospective" it is contrary to how the two met on three previous occasions. However, the deal is a great start to a great show. This episode can not be ordinary friends, as we are used to them, with the actors a little inexperienced, but in the next few episodes, we see why the show came to be what it was! Continue to watch the first season of a blast !!
