Starlift is a pleasant and interesting throwback to the all star musical paintings, each studio has Quenching during the Second World War. If you have stars such as Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, and Randolph Scott, etc., in the film, and with the likes of Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Julia Stein and Sammy Cahn, which provide the music, it's easy to take the film. And the story is not even on the road. <br /> <br /> What is the plot includes two Air Force enlisted man, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerty, trying to meet with Warner Brothers Starlet Janice Rule, using as a trick of the fact that both of Youngstown, Ohio, and Hagerthy father was a dentist Rule, as well as half of the city. The scheme works very well as Louella Parsons quickly put them as an item in his column. So, Lowell in the film as well. She must have liked the Warner Brothers and Jack Warner served by its more than other studio bosses because she also used the studio to publish its Hollywood Hotel radio so a day. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the story also touched upon the efforts of real life, Ruth Roman also plays himself, to get his studio and others to do the show on the air force bases for military and women who come to Korea. Some of the names I've mentioned and others to sing and perform in the show at the US Air Force Travis, which was filmed a lot of this film. <br /> <br /> A number of specialty has been removed for talent Phil Harris, who sing / ballad tells Look Out Stranger, I helped Texas Ranger and helped Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. So, Cooper looked like he was with a big old sometimes joking his way. <br /> <br /> It's the oldest clich√© when he says that they do not make them like this anymore, but they really are not because you do not have a studio system that has all the talent in the contract. That's one thing about the old studio system of death we mourn.
