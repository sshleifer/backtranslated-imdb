It was very thoughtful film, particularly for 1973. At that time it was actually a huge box office success. After the 1970s, seemed to have forgotten, but its central message was too important to disappear completely.It was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time ... no one has ever heard of the "greenhouse effect'before 1985 year, and the controversial issue of euthanasia is rarely brought up. <br /> <br /> set and special effects may look a little dated, but a lot of money for a Sci Fi movie was a gamble in this period. If you look closely, you'll see everything as a rule, it makes sense. This is a message movie, not drugged by supporters of Star Wars, who can not sit for a minute stimulation of thought, if it does not contain a million dollars in the amount of the explosion. <br /> <br /> This is also Hestons last good movie, the end of his famous dystopian Sci Fi trilogy. After that it was all bloated epic disasters and big budget crowd pleasing trash. This may not be the most fun two o'clock movie ever made, and the end can be awful and depressing, but it's hard to find a producer with more guts, who will decide the topic like this.
