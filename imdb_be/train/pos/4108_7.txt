Kurosawa, fresh color, losing sight of his usual theme of truth and the perception of reality and chooses to take the sad slums of Tokyo. Kurosawa reaches a style that was, in my opinion, it antithesis-, which is to say, I feel as if Kurosawa wanted to make a picture of Ozu. Poorly paced, poorly conceived, this film is a rare filmmaker torn in this beautiful body of work. While Ikiru, being mundane and depressing, is still interesting and a good walk, and while stray dogs reflected the slums and social Japan poverty, without being too hard or boring to do des ka den has all the gloom that could to wait with its content, with none of the redeeming qualities of previous Kurosawa films. <br /> <br /> Note that this is not a film that should be judged by Kurosawa.
