Super comedy series from the 1990s (two series were made in total), suffered in the ratings of Great Britain due to poor planning. If you are against the established comedies as "minder", even the best new comedy are going to fight to be noticed. <br /> <br /> Luckily, I found a series of episodes one and listened to him avidly. I talked about it with friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to have seen something else. Very, very difficult. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I loved both series and never forgotten. <br /> <br /> Then I looked it up online and found that the ultra-fan trying to get both series issued "on its own". <br /> <br /> Well, both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1.
