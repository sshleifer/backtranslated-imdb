I thought that the film was actually very good. I enjoyed the acting and he was moving along well. The director seemed to really understand the story he was trying to say. I have to see a big budget one out today, obviously, they had a lot more money to throw at him, but it was very watchable. If you see the movie as it is for a small budget, you have to take that into account if you are reading this. There were some things that could have been a better, but most of them are budget related. The action was pretty good F / X and tricks were well done. Honors pairs was the guy who played Asst camera. and the boy who played the baby. This kind of films preserved LA is working and it's one that turned out OK.
