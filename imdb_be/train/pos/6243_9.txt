a film about the cruelty of this world. I found it liberating, since only the truth can be. It also contains some pretty funny bits. Some of the acting is extraordinary cm Maria Hofstätter, for example. The director tried to portray life as realistically as possible success. Coherent, the sex scenes are obvious and no more false than the angry movie. Although I barely understood the proposal, I found the vision of the film in the original language with subtitles is much more useful, because with dubbing half a lot of work actors lost. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter particularly difficult to reproduce using Dubber. <br /> <br /> My favorite film
