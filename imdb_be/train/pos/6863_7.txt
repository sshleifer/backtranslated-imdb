The big unknown film with stunning slow camera work, adding to the stage makes it a pleasure to watch and enjoy. Director, writer Brian De Palma makes a super-Hitchcock imitation (often referred to as "robbery") with this film, and 2.35: 1 Widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work (and a few scenes with people hiding in each side that lost on a formatted tapes for television). <br /> <br /> The downside of the film, at least for anyone who has some moral standard, is a common sleaziness all the characters, including a police officer played by pre NYPD Dennis Franz (who is my hair!). <br /> <br /> The first scene is still shocking to a fairly long scene in the shower, Angie Dickinson, that is quite obvious, even 25 years after its release. In the film there are several sex scenes in it, like Dickinson (if it's really her in close-ups) and Nancy Allen is not shy about showing his body. <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes and there is no bad language to Franz is not included in the film after the murder. The first 36 minutes are the studs and even if it's obvious who the killer is, it's still a very good tension and fun to watch all the way through, especially for men ogling naked women.
