Thus, the story has to be rock solid with a good feature of suspended reality in order to make it work. For example, Pierce Brosnan, the answer to the Irish 007 is now cast in the form of chain smoking, sex-addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and having a life crisis. He meets a businessman fighting, Greg Kinnear, and after a rocky start, he learns that he needs one. But Greg happily married Hope Davis and Brosnan sees it as the main things that he does not love, home and life. Add character actor Philip Baker Hall as HIT-man management, and we are off to the races. Brosnan surprisingly dull and damp, as an anti-hero and Kinnear well as his colleagues, very man businessman. Hope Davis adds a spark as a very ordinary wife Kinnear, who fascinated by this rogue state that drifts into their lives. The ending is beautiful and with some surprise to him. You should leave the theater feeling, at least in part good--, if you are able to suspend be stunned by killing people.
