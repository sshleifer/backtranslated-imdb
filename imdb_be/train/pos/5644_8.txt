When the United States entered the First World War, the government has forced Hollywood to shoot down propaganda films. LITTLE American, probably the best of the lot, because the star Mary Pickford <br /> <br /> Pickford plays a young woman torn between two men :. Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but her decision is delayed because of the war, as well as men to enlist. <br /> <br /> When the ship sails on Pickford sunk by the Germans (Lusitania thinks) because he carries ammunition Pickford has a big stage, as it stands on the boat and yell in German commanders. Later, of course, it works both Holt and Hatton, it passes as a prisoner in the castle. <br /> <br /> Director DeMille delivers a really great scene in this film, as Pickford Holt roams the bombed village. They are ruined church, of which only one wall remains standing. Against the wall is very large crucifix. How to stand by and watch the wall collapses, but the figure of Jesus remains hanging in the air. It is a very surreal moment in the film, which is otherwise very simple and non-pretentious. <br /> <br /> Pickford, as always, a pleasure to watch. It has always been a very natural actress who escaped the hands waving theatrics are many other actors of the day is used. It is also very, very nice. Holt very well here in the leading role of the people. Hutton OK. The cast list of names in the "extra" part of Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colin Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neal and Edythe Chapman. <br /> <br /> Or is not a great movie, but it is interesting to see American propaganda at work.
