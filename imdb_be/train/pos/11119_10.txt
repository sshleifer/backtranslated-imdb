There are so many reasons why I value so highly Soprano, one of his greatest triumphs to be cast and character of the building. Each character is revealed more and more of each series. In addition, each series has a variety of "small-time characters," as well as major. A good example of the character (who was only three episodes), you can get a feel for this David gamblers brilliantly played by Robert Patrick. Every little detail makes a perfect TV series. The show revolves around the mob boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who is trying to balance his life of crime with his role as a father of two children. The show is not afraid to be bold and strong with dialogue and images, and this is what makes it so believable. While Tony is working things out capo Paulie (Ceric) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant), his nephew Christopher (Imperioli) looks for promotion. Each episode also features another family, Tony, in a sense, which includes his children and his wife Carmel Soprano (Edie Falco). On top of these problems it is his Uncle Junior Soprano (Kyanez) tries to get what he can out of the business, Tony, despite being under house arrest. All actions are powerful and complex characters, but the two that stand out most of them; James Gandolfini, who "is" Tony Soprano. Also Imperioli, who plays Christopher, providing a younger (20-30) generation of a crime. If David Chase Sun has created this masterpiece of modern TV drama of this caliber can not exist, for example, The Wire and Dexter. Thus, Soprano, certainly, Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction TV
