Directed by Sidney Lumet did some masterpieces, like the network, the dog in the afternoon or Serpico.But, he did not have too much luck in his last works.Gloria (1999) was miserable and Find Me Guilty was interesting, but not experiment. Now, Lumet brings his best film in the last decade and, in my opinion, a real masterpiece: Before the devil knows you're Dead.I thinks that this film as degeneration for Lumet.This film has a remarkable history which, deep, has many layers.Also, I think the film's ending speech perfect.The brilliant.Philip Seymour Hoffman leads, as usual, in a magnificent performance, and it is without a doubt one of the best actors of our days.Ethan Hawke is also a great actor but he underestimated my point view.His performance is great.The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially lead and Albert Finney), but these two actors bring monumental performances which unfortunately ignored miserable Oscars.The film has a good level of intensity in the part of TSNAs SAB in performance and in particular thanks to a brilliant screenplay.Before Devil knows you're dead a real masterpiece with excellent leadership, great script and a great performances.We need more movies like this.
