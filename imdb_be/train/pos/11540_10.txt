This is Neil Simon piece of work, which has received a lot of praise! "Odd Couple" is a one of a kind gem that lingers inside. You got Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); hypochondriac, fussy neat-freak, and a big thorn in his roommate Oscar Madison (Matthau); a total slob. These people have great jobs, though. Felix news writer, sports writer and Oscar. Both of these people are divorced, the wife of Felix is ​​within easy reach, while Oscar is on the other side of the US (West Coast). Well, what can you say? The two men, who live in the same roof together without moving each other crazy, impossible and improbable. That's a lot of laughter and lots of fun. I liked the part where, when these two British neighbors, who speak both gentlemen, and after Oscar Felix kicked, he gets lucky and live with them when he refused to dine with them the night before. It is about time that Felix needed to light. I think all the neat freaks neat to light. They may be nurturing, but they need to be patient as well. Very funny movie, and Nuevo classic. Neil Simon «The Odd Couple» should see a classic film. 5 STARS!
