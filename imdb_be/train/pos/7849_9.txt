This brief is a confusion. I have no words here, because it's almost indescribable, technically exceptional after more than 90 years (the visuals are excellent and sometimes weird), it is not what you see, if you like things that are ordinary or Â«normal 'because most of the course, too. It is an odd one, gang. Well worth checking out, but if things like Ren and Stimpy make your head hurt, you can skip it. Recommended.
