This film chronicles the life and times of William Castle. He made a series of low-budget horror films in the 1950s-1960s, he sold out of tricks. In "13 Ghosts" you need the audience to see a ghost (they were in color, the film was in b and c). «The tingler" was theater seats, equipped with a buzzer that shook the audience, when the monster escapes in the cinema. «Marabre» issued by a life insurance policy for all members if they were scared to death! The films themselves were pretty bad, but the tricks were people rushing to see them. In this unit, there is an interview with the directors inspired castle, the actors in his films and his daughter. He also receives in his home life and the kind of man he was (apparently, he was a great guy). Documentary affectionate, very funny and absolutely riveting. This is a very short (90 minutes), and there is never a dull moment. A must see for fans of the castle and the fans of horror films. My one complaint - there was very little sequence, shown with his paintings. That aside, it's just wonderful.
