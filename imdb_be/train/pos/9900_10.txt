it films such as to make it what you want, so you never have to nerd growing up in school. If you liked this film, then I would suggest you see Valentine. I just found out today that the guy who played Marty (Simon) has killed a little after the film was released, which is a shame, because he did a good job. I wonder if it's because of the role he played in the film. It starts when Carol tricks him to go to the toilet girls act like they were going to do it. If he cheated on in the soul of popular carols friends made their way to the bathroom and get everything ready, camera, electric poles. If you open the curtain Marty example naked, he realized that he had been deceived. He tries to cover up the shower, but the children open it, take Marty and starts doling out to him while the camera is rolling. They picked him up, his head dipped in Toliet while he was washing, and they electricuted it (a little). When children are in prison, given the coach, 2 boys give Marty joint that will force him to quit. Skip to break one of the windows in the gym using a brick to the teacher, to justify it. While Marty vomits in the bathroom Skip sneaks into the science lab and mix some stuff that looks like cocaine, but not sure what it was. Laboratory explodes disfiguring him badly. After 5 years, the children who tormented him in the same day received an invitation to a school reunion 5 years in an old school that was burned on the same day it exploded. One after another, people are dying off. I do not understand how a girl who drowned actually drowned. she could get back after Marty left. She almost got out the first time.
