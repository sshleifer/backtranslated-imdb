I did not have many expectations going into the film, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is outstanding in a completely different role. He threw out a spot for Armani suits ridiculously kind and pays off, showing that he is a great actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear play each other more, and make for one of the best buddy pairing for a long time. Humor is dark, performances by Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis big, mix that with a touching element to the story of the friendship, and you have a great film. This is probably one of the best buddy comedy for a long time. This is a film that certainly shows that we can expect a lot of that in the post-Bond career Brosnan era.
