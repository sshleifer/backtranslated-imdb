"House of Games" is a perfectly constructed film, and one of the few films that I've seen that he disclosed to me the screen in disbelief, how cleverly and unexpectedly ends. I first saw it on video a few years ago after reading a review by Roger Ebert, who declared it the best film of 1987, I had doubts, mainly because it's not quite as well known as other films from this year. Boy, I was a surprise. It was one of the most intelligent, the most well-written films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is quite a piece of work, not only in terms of plot (which turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have understood everything), but also in terms of character development. On my second viewing, I began to realize that Mamet's script is a success not only as a clever suspense movie, but every plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The climax of the film is particularly effective, because it is absolutely unavoidable. It happens, of course, from what we know about the characters, and therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending. Presentation Lindsay Crouse Joe Mantegna and add enormously to the film. I can not imagine any other actor except Mantegna plays the role of Mike, and Kraus plays the role with just the right amount of restriction to offer depressed criminal thinking. Their work, plus an unusual scenario Mamet, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s. It really is a must-see.
