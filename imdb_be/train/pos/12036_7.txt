Why am I so sure that there really is another film version of this novel there somewhere? I saw the film again this year, as I find the teaching of the novel and the changes in the film annoying - there is no appearance of a little boy in the novel and the ending was changed. They kill him off in the movie, but the fact is that he has to developments in the Marsh House up for years, but does remarry and ultimately put the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is a much more sympathetic character in the novel, the scene in the movie where Kipps ignites office clearly abnormal, and the continuous development of the toy soldier, to show the presence of a child is really terrible, but it is meaningless - Kipps is haunted by a woman seeking revenge rather than the child. I'm sure I've seen a movie that better and closer to the novel really terrible. Did I just imagine it?
