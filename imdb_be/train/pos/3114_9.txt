They'll keep it pretty short, as something for you to not spoil. This movie is awesome. From start to finish, it is filled with real thrills. Fight scenes are fantastic, exciting chase scenes, and it is moving at such a pace that it really only felt slowly until the end, when all to explain, but it's only because of all that preceded it. Damon shines and really turned out to be a very tough actor, daring you not to believe him in this role. He has this role. A welcome addition to the series in David Straithrain (hope I spelled that close to the right), as the battered CIA agent to kill Bourne. It is non-stop and really leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way. Some things near the end only smidgeon inappropriate, thus negating a 10 rating. Finale remains open to continue, and I certainly hope that they consider to do more of them, for no one was bad. Great movie as a whole and fantastic ending an amazing trilogy. <br /> <br /> P.S. Shaky cam does not hurt any of the action, but I still think that we could do without it. The good news is that you only notice when people are talking and not so much action.
