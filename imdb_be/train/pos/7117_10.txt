This film is a fantastic film. All of this in my opinion, was at the highest level of action to directing. I know that Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s, but most of his other films on video, if not a DVD. In that case, why is not one? Each recorded his BMT to me, but to have it on DVD would be great. For special functions, they could say a few maritime historian to speak about the battle, and if the wife or son of Mr. Schmid is still alive, they may be interviewed as well. Anyway, this is a great movie and I highly recommend it.If it has ever put out, hopefully it will not be colored. Coloring it would, in my opinion just spoil the whole effect of the film. Battle scene was quite real as in 1945, the film will go. Mr. Garfield has done an excellent job drawing Mr. Schmid. Some actors may have been inclined to replay part of the disability Mr.Schmid, but I feel that he got it just right. I sincerely hope that they will come out with this film on DVD, ever, as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other Marines who have sacrificed so much for us in World War II.
