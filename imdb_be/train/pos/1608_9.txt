Seeing the "mad" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensational funny this film was when it first appeared. Who knew that Cher can act? Who have never heard Olympia Dukakis? Nicolas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was Zhuison director. <br /> <br /> The only truly flat note in this beautiful work "When the Moon Hits Your Eye as a Big Pizza Pie, it's Amore," a song that is sung too many times in movies (once it's too much), and He went on to have a long life after death in popular music. <br /> <br /> Cher - forgive me - sensational as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to get married and do not have to be in love with the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) binding, suggesting s its offering little finger ring as a replacement for an engagement ring, and then directed to Sicily to be with his dying mother. He charges Loretta seeing that his brother estranged, by Ronny, attends the wedding. Loretta confronts Ronnie and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, her father (Vincent Gardenia) changes her mother (Olympia Dukakis) who discovers Loretta accidentally when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> All the work in the end, as it inevitably does in films of this genre. At the same time, all of the actors live up fine, and the audience loves himself. In a way, «Moonstruck» how Hollywood used to be the best: reckless fun, without social significance whatsoever. If they had only lost "It Amore» along the way, it would be ideal.
