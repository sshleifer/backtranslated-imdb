My watch came too late, but I'm glad I watched it and continue along ... that makes me praise the creators of Flick for such a clean and basic treatment of the idea of ​​romanticism ... and very little separating it from the idea of ​​the relationship! How much has been written about the film already, it would be just the way to allocate some parts of the film, which I personally loved. <br /> <br /> I think that the point where Jesse and Celine to make fake phone calls to their respective members have been very clever way to tell each other what they meant to each other across the street, not even passing 24 hours .. . the curiosity of two people who are believed to made another surefire hit on the other hand was very smartly engaged ... <br /> <br /> on the front section, which makes the romantic history of working on pure speech is not an easy job to accomplish. . <br /> <br /> I believe that such a taste in romantic flicks, the characters are not clearly developed us even in the mind of the writer and director. The fact that the actors reveal what gets them .. right or wrong, even the idea of ​​the standard-bearers would be hard to justify ... to become a character actor gives life must go beyond statements and stories ... here as actors do only the right to work! Kudos .. !!! and before sunset is another feather, which makes this even more beautiful!
