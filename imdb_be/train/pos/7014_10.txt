Wow ... I do not know what to say. I just watched Seven Pounds. No one can make me cry, like Will Smith. The man is very in tune with a huge range of human emotions. This film was skillfully and beautifully done. It is rare to find such a strong humanity in Hollywood today. I would compare it to "pay it forward" and "collapse" as far as representation of both light and darkness so crude. Definitely stick with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about. I have a deep love and passion for films like this. Typically, more than one of the "bad ending", but rather a seeker of truth, which encompasses emotion, raw life and something more than the surface, which exists in abundance all around. So I do not mind a little pain in the end. It is a fact of life, which is not always a happy ending. Sometimes it's just not a happy ending do you think it should be. Many people were able to live a happy life, but the love and the life of one was lost. If you are someone who is looking a little deeper than the rest of you will love this movie!
