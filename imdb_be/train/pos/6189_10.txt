Who would have imagined - Hal Hartley creates a cinematic investigation for Syriana, while maintaining its signature special style. The merger is very interesting. <br /> <br /> After not seen the movie Hal Hartley about ten years, I approached it with some caution. His brilliant performances nineties impressed critics and audiences with her unique style and dialogue. early films directed by signs of colorful characters and offered close observation of life - often in the area of ​​Long Island, New York, or in the New York -., which were unusual and insightful <br /> <br /> My initial caution stems from the description this film as "a spy thriller." To my pleasant surprise, Hartley was able to net his well researched style and focus to produce a very original drama of international intrigue. It works in more than one can imagine. Hartley film retains focus dialogue and characters that are his trademark, along with a special cinematic style. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is very useful, given the current situation in the world and the state of war, cherish the dark elements on all sides. Hartley brought all his skills to something new - a political film, worthy of mention in the same breath as Syriana. Indeed, it comes into its own. The cast does an excellent job of interpreting visions and Hartley style. Supporters of Parker Posey will see it in full bloom here, still with us and the more ripe and lush than before.
