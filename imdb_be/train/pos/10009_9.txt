When I first read Armistead Maupins story I got in the human drama is reflected Gabriel anybody and those he cares about and love. That being said, we have already produced the film version of the wonderful history and is expected to see past the glitter of Hollywood ... <br /> <br /> The writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner would be able to do! <br /> <br /> With just the right amount of restrictions Robin Williams captures the delicate nature of Gabriel and allows us to see him struggle with issues of trust, both in his life, the staff (the Jess) and the world around him (Donna). <br /> <br /> As we get to know the players in this drama, we must remember that nothing is as it seems, and that the smallest event can change our lives irreversibly. Please consider a book written by a young man turns into a life-changing event that helps Gabriel to find the strength in himself to go on and move forward. <br /> <br /> It's bad enough that most people will avoid this film, I'm just saying that, because the average American probably thinks "Robin Williams in a serious role? It did not work before! "PLEASE GIVE A CHANCE this film! Robin Williams comes to the darkness, we all need to find and go in yourself, to become better. As his film Photo by hour, he stepped up as an actor and made another quality works of art. <br /> <br /> Oh, and before I forget, I believe Kannaval as Jess steals every scene he is. He is the 1940 leading man looks and screen presence. It is the opinion of cuts he could carry his own movie right now !! <br /> <br /> S ~
