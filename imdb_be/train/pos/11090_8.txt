Successful homemade married businessman Harry Mitchell (great steel execution Roy Scheider) is an adulteress affair with a stripper sweet'n'sexy young Cini (beautiful Kelly Preston). Harry blackmailed trio foam low life hoods - sleazy porn theater Raimy manager (brilliantly slimy John Glover), caring strip co-owner of Leo (well played by Robert Trebor) and mad pimp Bobby Shy (and fear of intensive Clarence Williams III) - who is filming his affair with Cheney. When Harry refuses to pay, hoods kill Cheney and make it look like Harry did. This, in turn, ignites a dangerous battle of wits and wills between Harry and caps. Director Frankenheimer, taking a hard scenario based on a gritty crime thriller novel by Elmore Leonard, skilfully maintains a constant instantaneous pace, gives a lot of exciting voltage, and efficiently create compelling seedy'n'sordid atmosphere. The conductors are all uniformly excellent, with a prominent maintaining momentum Ann-Margret as bitter neglected wife Barbara Harry, vanity, heartburn jaded prostitute Doreen and Lonny Chapman, as a loyal business partner Harry Jim O'Boyle. Tight'n'twisty plot keeps the audience in suspense throughout. Godless secular dialogue, glossy cinematography Yost Vaca, in the mix by Harry Chang, sharply immoral tons and exciting conclusion, still on the money as well. As an added bonus, as vanity and Preston to take their clothes off. Very strong and hearty few that are well worth checking out.
