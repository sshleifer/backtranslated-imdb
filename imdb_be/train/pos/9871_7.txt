Return to the Lost World was filmed back to back with the version of The Lost World 1992. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, the same five people, headed back to the Challenger Plateau, where the group began drilling for oil, which threatens destroy the earth. Gomez has something to do with it. They manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau remains, much to the delight of local residents. <br /> <br /> As in The Lost World, the few dinosaurs that we see are made of rubber, and they include T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Ryhs-Davis and David Warner reprise their roles as the Challenger and Summer and three other party is also back. <br /> <br /> Despite reading a few bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs, I enjoyed Return to <br /> <br /> Evaluation: The Lost World. 3 stars out of 5.
