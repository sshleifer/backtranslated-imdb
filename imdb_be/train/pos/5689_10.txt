Firstly, this is an overview of the set of two CDs that came with the «Wonderland» DVD rental. <br /> <br /> The two films are included in the rent, "Wonderland" and the documentary Johnny Wadd, completely destroy the myth created by "Boogie Nights." This myth is that the characters are involved in the trade of adult movies were significantly more than the slimy dregs that would do anything for money, basically denying that they are nothing but abominations egocentric whore. It is remarkably similar to what the book "Wiseguy" and the movie "Goodfellas" made "The Godfather" of the bike and a big part of the rest of the gangster romanticism knowledge. <br /> <br /> So that's what irritates me the most time watching these films, and is likely to tire of all who saw and loved "Boogie Nights," as stupid and gullible supposedly educated and experienced people can be. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights", without a doubt, John Holmes, which, unlike the "Dirk Diggler" was not redemptive quality. Holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused anyone close to him, was completely absorbed by his desire for self-satisfaction, and was, no doubt, is a key member of brutal murders on Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981, the film exposes the big lie, "Night boogie "was, and reinforces the description of Linda Lovelace of ill and helpless business, which is known as adult movie entertainment. This should come in handy view, both functions on a DVD "Wonderland", for those who had any positive thoughts about the stories in the film "Boogie Nights."
