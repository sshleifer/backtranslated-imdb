It will not be likely to be recognized as the best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and plot holes. However, we are talking about the film, where the hit-man and white bread salesman become friends so a few whims should not be too much of a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, went a wooden James Bond (a role he wasted). If he can maintain this kind of money, I hope he continues to do comedy. Greg Kinnear as well as the straight man Brosnan. I have read some negative comments here about Hope Davis, but I thought it was very good as a mouse housewife with the dark side buried deep inside. There are many good giggle as Brosnan sleazes his way through a few scenes where I almost died of laughter. My father (consultant) almost lost it when Julian describes himself as a "mediator". Just as the «Grosse Pointe Blank», another hit people comedy, humor can be very dark. If you and get ready to enjoy.
