As the anti-football people, I have (on the surface) reluctantly took the younger brother to see this film, but I secretly hoped it might be, East is East II. Trailer looked fun, so I thought I'd give it a go. <br /> <br /> It took about ten minutes, but after that I was glued to the screen, and it had nothing to do with the neck brace due to sitting too close to the front of a crowded audience. Action was fresh and bright, the characters participate, and the jokes are really funny. The whole hall was laughing out loud every minute or so. Football fan or No football fan, sport has become is irrelevant to the basic principles of love, friendship, family, independence and competition. Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have a formula for the best British comedies I've seen in a long time, I dare say .... better than East is East. <br /> <br /> This film lynx and beautiful in an excellent pace, never dwelling on anything longer than necessary, and not leaving anything unfinished, keeping the audience entertained and mentally engaged. Although this is not typical, twisting and turning of the film, there are some nice surprises in the way and things do not always happen as one would expect. <br /> <br /> To say that the elements are predictable, but they were exploited satirically more than used as a script-fillers. I guess depending on the propensity for happy endings, you would be glad / let down by the final. Personally, if there is any other outcome, I would have written a strongly worded letter writers. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I would like to say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) put in the best performance, I never knew that such people existed, but its realism sometimes bizarre concepts convinced me that they might do! The prize for the most unconvincing (the main characters) is, unfortunately, Keira Knightley (Jules), but do not get me wrong, she even offered great performance, it's just that someone has to be the last one of the best and it is a pity. Kier, this time you have it <br /> <br /> Tip: do not leave before the credits. Once the lights came back, I realized, to my horror, that perhaps I would not have watched this movie, after all. My dear friends, but forgot Ice Junkie melted in an annoying blue juice. Oh, what I say, it was absolutely a diamond, and I can not recommend it enough. I will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to your collection of 3 videos. I am a student. I just throw out if it's really worth it.
