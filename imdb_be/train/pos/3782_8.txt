When I was a kid, I totally loved Bill and Ted movies. The other night, Bogus Journey was and as it has been at least 5 years since the last time I saw him, I decided to get better. And I loved it all over again! This film is still funny after all these years. "Incredible Adventures" is better, but it's just stones. Of course, some of the performances a little bad, but hey, this whole movie cheese in a cool way. In addition, it shows a steep impersonation death sometime in the movie! Conclusion: On the whole, not a fictitious movie dude! Excellent Way! STATION !!!
