If you see this film, you begin to realize that such a dramatic late Dudley Moore underutilized assets. There must be a dozen films, as in our archive. <br /> <br /> It has been a first-class talent, before he went to Hollywood, and as a comedian and musician. But mostly he remembered his pair with Peter Cook, on TV and in one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of these was "blinded". <br /> <br /> He always tend to overshadow Cook, jealousy and meanness rift partnership and allowed Moore to realize their true potential in America. "Arthur" result. <br /> <br /> This is a really great movie. clownish comedy Moore as a drunkard is not in doubt. The scenario is perfect for his style with a lot of fun, almost surreal conversational digressions. There is something so British about it, I'm actually surprised that he found such an appeal to American tastes. Tommy Cooper, anarchic comic after the same manner as usually done preform. It almost childlike vulnerability Moore so attractive. <br /> <br /> Lisa Minelli and John Guilgud tend to play a direct role against him, but still has some great jokes. John Guilgud, in particular, supplying it with the sarcastic and caustic authority, which is a treasure to watch. He invariably steals every scene in which he pointed out and thoroughly deserved his Oscar. . Correct me if I'm wrong, but he never played any other comic roles <br /> <br /> There is a follow-up film called «Arthur 2 - On The Rocks». He never reached the same lofty levels of fun, this is one reaches, but it's still pretty good, even so. Guilgud only gets a cameo at the beginning and in the form of a ghost. It is darker. And there are some interesting introspection. It is disappointing when you see «Arthur» first. <br /> <br /> Hollywood, seemed to be losing interest in the cozy Dudley after these two trips. Eventually he returned to England, depressed and apparently dies. <br /> <br /> But the "Arthur" is an example of what could be. We can only imagine the other great movies he had to do. <br /> <br /> you just, unfortunately, missed, Dudley.
