<br /> <br /> Artisticly shot, the actors portray their role is. You get a real sense of watching Lucienne rises from poverty to the most beautiful girls around. Enjoy a sense of tragedy to tragedy again. In general, I've seen this movie at least 10 times. One can very well say that the Prix De Beute Â»(Beauty Award, Miss Europe) is the main favorite in my collection of silent films. Louise Brooks clarity is perfect and I would recommend this film to anyone who appreciates the beauty of the art, combined with a tragic story.
