Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors that I liked. I love just about each of the shorts, which they did. I love all six Stooges (Curl, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts fun, as well as the star of many other great actors and actresses, which many of them many of the shorts! On my view Three Stooges some of the greatest actors of all time, and the team is constantly funny comedy! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite shorts Stooges with Shemp is nothing but Husbands Beware! All included in this short, Christine McIntyre are excellent, but Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Sanders, Lou Leonard, Maxine Gates, and Emil Sitko. Green and McIntyre provide excellent performances here! There are so many funny parts here. This is a very funny short. There is another similar Three Stooges short, like this one called Brideless Groom, and I recommend both!
