Quote I used for my resume occurs about halfway through the good land, as the captain of the Chinese Revolutionary Army (Philip Ahn in performance) apologized to the crowd for not having time to shoot looters MORE among them, his unit has just been called back to the front line. Of course, the next looter shot on the manifest and the film's protagonist, a former kitchen slave O-Lan (for which image Luise Rainer, is now 99-year-old, won his second consecutive Best Actress Oscar). <br /> <br /> The next scene finds O-Lan dutifully supplying her bag stolen property under her grateful husband, a farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni), setting in motion that the classical dichotomy of male upward financial mobility is the direct feedback of its moral decline. <br /> <br /> For the film, which deals with the subject, including slavery, false accusations of misogyny, famine, invasion of the house, eats pet, mental retardation, infanticide, operated by a refugee, riots, civil war, massive street summary punishment death, bigamy, beat a child, adultery, incest, and epidemic diseases of biblical proportions insects GOOD EARTH amazing heart warming movie. <br /> <br /> May parting thought as another classic quote from the most O-Lan (while putting valuable bone soup, her son just admitted stealing from the old woman back into the pot after her husband Van Loon angrily at the ground floor on the other side of the hut), "meat."
