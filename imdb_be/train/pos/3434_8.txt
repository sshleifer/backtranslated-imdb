If the Australian Post Office was never a need for a promotional film set, it .tak is one of those films that the heart is in the right place, and you can watch over and over again. Miranda's performance touches, as it shows the aspect of Australia's unimaginable by many Europeans, that it can be cold, wet and dark, as well as elsewhere, and just like anywhere else, it's important to the people who surround you . The characters in the film are warm and welcoming and make the prospect of a career move into "a dead letter" office thought that would be considered. Miranda went on to do more films, but I hope she always keeps in mind for this?.
