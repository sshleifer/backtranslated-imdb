Yesterday I went to the one in the movie, because here in Mexico, most of the films from other countries, is part of the so-called "Mosquito Alternatives" (alternative camera). But after I saw this film, I realized that not all foreign films alternative. Afortunately, is a good example. But I have to say that I enjoyed this film .. so that in the end I was happy .. this film a little spoon of hope in these days. And the main lesson for me .. is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. This is a good option to see a good film in Spanish ... and I have to mention good music .. especially the main song of the film .. Cosas que que Hosni La Vida Valga la Pena .... Great song! !!
