There is something special in the Austrian film not only Seidl and Szpilman and other directors as well. It is a piercing sense of reality, which never leaves the viewer throughout the film. Hundstage is no exception. This effect is achieved not only painted the stories, but also acting. In Hundstage I never felt that these actors play, but instead of real people. Thus, the visceral feeling of the audience ... almost as if a grumpy pensioner or a lone lady in the film lives below you in your unit. <br /> <br /> Anyone who lives in Vienna, is undoubtedly painful to recognize the people in the film with their meckern / sudern (complain), their hidden sexual desires and prolo macho guys. This is reinforced by the Viennese dialect, which, according to many, especially done for complaining as a way of life. Special parochialism and arrogance is typical of Vienna is also very good at drawing. <br /> <br /> Vienna suburbs have a vivid presence in the film with stupor and sleepiness, where nothing happens. In addition, they have been transformed into holiday materialism with shopping malls and large department stores. Inbetween are people's homes, where they indulge in what they believe is a pleasure giving activity, trying to stay in contact with their human selves, but in vain. Examples of sexual game old woman with men that borders on rape, the prolo Man lose their nerves and hitting his girlfriend and a young woman hitchhiking and annoying her driver. <br /> <br /> In the film, there is no soundtrack, she concentrates on the normality / abnormality of only the image. Another characteristic of Seidl (and other Austrian directors) is its display of exciting sexual images. They include taking off the old woman for her husband, the sex scenes in the bath, lady sex play with two men in her apartment, etc. <br /> <br /> In Hundstage Seild depicted the lives of people who could eventually be as much as the crown, as they may be citizens of Paris, New York or Madrid. The audience should not despise or feel sorry for the crown in the film, as they can themselves become victims of the same human alienation and estrangement, albeit in different circumstances. In the end, I think the film Seidl is warning us about the terrible state of human relations so rigidly expressed in Hundstage. And if the viewer does not succumb to the causes of this evil transformation, Seidl has reached its goal.
