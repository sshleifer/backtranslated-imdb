In this part of the series, Edmund Blackadder stuck in the Regency period in the UK (for a later part of the rule of George III). At this time, of BlackAdder prospects are far poorer - because instead of royalty, he is the servant very, very thick of George IV (the cost of the regent). In contrast to the historical accounts of George IV of, this one is about as bright as a tomato, and as a result, are able to take advantage of Blackadder and his scheme to his heart's content. The only significant difference in style between this one and the earlier that the series ends on a very, very, very different music - you just have to see it to believe it. In addition, all the usual elements of the story have a happy and show. The only reservation I have (as always) is that this show is not suitable for children because of his raw language and adult situations.
