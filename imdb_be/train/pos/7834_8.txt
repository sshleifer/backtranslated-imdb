See also my comment about Die Nibelungen Part 1 :. Siegfried <br /> <br /> The second part of the enormous production of the Nibelungen saga continues Ufa studios in a stylized, Symphony and emotionally suspended his predecessor. However, while the first part was indifferent way the individual acts of heroism, the second part is the chaotic way of bloodletting on a grand scale. <br /> <br /> As with the first part, directed by Fritz Lang supports continuous dynamic rhythm, with the action tempo and the complexity of the shot composition rise and fall smoothly as the tone of each scene demands. These photos should look only to the note a perfect score of Gottfried Happertsa, which, fortunately, is on the Kino DVD. Now, with the emphasis on mass actions, Lang presented great challenges in the formulation. The action sequences in his early signs are often poorly constructed, but now he's just making them a part of the rhythmic flow, the level of activity of the orchestra swells up on the screen. <br /> <br /> But just as a part of one of us witnessed the adventures of Siegfried, as if nothing had happened and without emotion, part two presents the war as a devastating tragedy. In both pictures is the intentional lack of emotional connection with the characters. That's why Lang basically holds the camera beyond, never allowing us to feel as if we were there (and this is very important because with audience participation, as a rule, the difference operation Langa). This also explains why the speech is unnatural theater, with actors wandered around like lunatics constipation. <br /> <br /> However, Kriemhild revenge in this constantly deal with emotions, and it is in fact deeply humanistic. One point of naturalism when Attila holds a newborn son for the first time, and Lang actually emphasizes the tenderness of the scene, making it with a wild, mad riding Huns. The fact that Lange never manipulates us into taking sides, and in this respect, this version has more in common with the original saga than a Wagner opera. The highest culling is the opposite of an incendiary battle scenes. Why, then, Hitler and co. Get as watery eyes on him, the fact that unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films? As relentless racial ideology of the Nazis forced them to automatically view the Nibelungs as the good guys, even if they kill babies and bring their own relatives. For Hitler, their fall will always be a nationalist tragedy, not one person. <br /> <br /> But for us, not the Nazi spectators, making this a nice picture of a beautiful sense of beauty and musical rhythm. If you see the fully developed picture Lang silent, it makes you realize how much he was wasted in Hollywood. Rather than ride his low-budget schlock they had to put it to work on some of the sword and sandal epics, the picture that should not be believable and should not move us emotionally, which is the poetic, operatic tone that sweeps us along .
