A brilliant film about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy's such a great actor. It was almost a shame to see him in the same scene with Campbell, who looks the part of a neurotic sex object, but does not have the chops to work with him at the script calls. But he's such a good actor, he played down to its level, to do the work scene. I very much welcome the cast Tracey Ullman as started wife. Who knew? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves his character does look taller (and even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knows what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Mace portrayal of a single situation in which his character is unable to be careful not nothing but a complete mastery.
