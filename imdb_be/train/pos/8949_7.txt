Dizziness co-stars Stewart (in his last turn as a romantic lead) and Novak pick it up, the other "Christmas movie," Stewart movie to above-average entertainment. The chemistry between the two stars makes for a pretty moving experience and further opening can be learned from the film, when witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for the private pain that makes it difficult relationship of many people. In general, a good diversion from the legendary star, 7/10.
