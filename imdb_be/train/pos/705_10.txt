I stumbled upon Nightmare insomnia, while looking for extraordinary independent films, and I'm glad to say it did not disappoint. It's a crazy half-hour ride was interesting to me, all the way to the end, and the end was excellent - one of those moments that Nooooo really stay with you. I showed it to a number of people, and everyone seems to agree hands down. Ghostie little girl is very talented, and I think her performance stole the show. She crawled hell out of me, I can tell you that much. Nanavati has done a great job putting together this short. All parts just fell into place, and you can tell that she is a great writer on what she has done with this scenario. SO well written. This is undoubtedly the most powerful part of the film. The guide was great, and the action was nice, but the most important factor here is the strength of the script. Nice work with this girl, I can not wait to see more!
