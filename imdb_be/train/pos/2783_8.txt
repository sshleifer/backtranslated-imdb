Not one of your harder hitting stories, and this is the real strength of this film. There are at least two ratios, in which less confident writers added some all-too-predictable romantic tension. They not only spare the audience, but throw in a few surprises at the same time. There are several Disney-ish moments, especially toward the end, but they managed. In general, it is worth a rental, and it was good, relaxed fun. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you get the DVD, watch the segment, where the director teaches how to make Allu Gobi. We followed its direction, and it was brilliant! Next time we'll do it the day before, we plan to eat it, because it's one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the refrigerator to spice out!
