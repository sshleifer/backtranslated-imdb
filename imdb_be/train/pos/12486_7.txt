Well, this movie is heavy indeed. To be straight with you, this film does not contain many riveting stories, Nora do it and "want" to know how it will end ... but I'll tell you something right now ... I have never been so tight and jumped in my life! This movie sure does deliver jumps and thrills! That this film is not put to be fair, I have to look at almost midnight, so I was kind of sleepy anyway, so maybe that explains why I was nervous ... or maybe it's because in this aspect! It's basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event. They decided to move away and rent a cabin in the mountains looking for the thing ... it looks peaceful and quiet, yet they do not have the first visitors (I think this is the sister of the protagonist, and she brings with her husband) ... at night, husband hears a noise ... check it, and then, when things start to go very wrong indeed ... they do not stay on the second day and tell a couple they should leave as soon as possible, as something not so cut a long story ... .. . in the end, they learn what has happened in this house in the past few years, and decide that you need to take care of. <br /> <br /> This is not a Hollywood blockbuster, Nora he has a big budget, but please do not let this put you off. It's awful, tense and very, very nervous! Just give it a try :)
