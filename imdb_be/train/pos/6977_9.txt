Im really fond of Caprica, because it really is a good prequel series to Battlestar Galactica. It really makes a slow start tempo, but, of course, to pick up soon after new episodes continue to air. <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot about future episodes and guest stars in the first season. <br /> <br /> This drama Sci Fi necessarily please us fans who love the combination of the two genres. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz does a terrific job, and Polly Walker like Clarice Willow !! <br /> <br /> as a whole should be checked !! <br /> <br /> Catch Caprica on Fridays at 9 pm / 8pm to central Syfy
