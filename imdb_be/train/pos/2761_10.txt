I first saw this film on my way home from Paris to Newark on board Air France in August 1996, the film itself, I think it is quite a masterpiece. This kind of film that people should do. I still think that Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around. This French film, he plays a divorced father and businessman, who has not lost his zest for life until it through Down Syndrome person living in an institution with other patients of Down syndrome. Actors, including the actor who actually has Down syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and ours, changed forever with a person with Down syndrome. He understands that life is not just work, not to play, but also for life and love, and this is what life should be all. The ending seems silly, but, although I still think that this is one of my favorite movies. That's enough to bring tears to the eyes.
