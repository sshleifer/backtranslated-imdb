The performance of each actor and actress (in the film) NATURAL well as an action movie should be; and directing skill brilliantly handled on every detail that I never tired of seeing it again and again. Nevertheless, I am very surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and the director, Attenborough loans that confuses me: they are proud not to make a statement that they did such a beautiful, long-lasting film for the audience? I hope that I would like to get answers to some of my puzzle from any one (possibly one of the "experienced" staff (inside) of the film.
