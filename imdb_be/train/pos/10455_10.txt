This should be one of the most sincere and touching boy meets girl movies ever. While "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Say Anything" deliver pleasing images, these films strips down and useless podagovory Hollywood divergence. This film focuses solely on the view of a beautiful romance with excommunication. You never doubt for a moment that the film will lead to a romantic pairing of these two men. You almost immediately feel the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it's just pure joy to look to find them. This film is basically all dialogi-. But every conversation between them is also very intriguing. What makes this pairing is as romantic as it is real. As in all of this conversation, and often have no real effect on anything critical, you can feel the nuances of how these two are more than love and trust each other. It is they, as you dreamed that you meet that special someone. And what makes it so precisely that it is not too fantastic to be believed. This may be what would happen if you were confident enough to strike up a conversation with the person you have noticed somewhere random. And that puts the icing on this film a great background from Vienna, where the film takes place. This only adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana, which suggests the film. And no matter how many times I watch this movie, I do not think I'll ever get tired of it.
