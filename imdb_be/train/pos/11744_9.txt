"Mr. Harvey lights a candle" anchor brilliant performance by Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> While we can predict that his titular moody, tightly teacher will have some kind of a break down or catharsis, based on some deep secret from his past, his emotions presented wonderfully. Spall range of emotions conveyed quite touching and more than he usually gets depicted as part of the repertoire of Mike Leigh. <br /> <br /> while the expected trip sad school bus used only for comic purposes, ie, FIR, as "The Simpsons" is the central position of a visit to Salisbury Cathedral in the script meridian Brook is well maintained and structured for dramatic purposes, and almost formally divided into acts. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to the British city range of racially and religiously different children (including uniforms I could not say that it is a "private" or "public" school), so how are they going ?? rap black children, the serious South Asians and Muslims, and white bullies average girl ?? but transported quite naturally, as well as individually. Young actors, some of which I learned from British television, such as «Shameless», were violent, representing the usual range of junior high social pressures. Celia Imrie put more heat into the supervisor role than Martinets she usually has to play. <br /> <br /> A break in the journey leads to transformed the crisis for some while others are fun to not paying attention. We believe that, as a teacher, portrayed Ben miles «Coupling», that we stuffed didactic lesson of religious tolerance, but it is much more faith in people and God, revealed why the BBC in England at Easter and BBC America We showed it to the US for Christmas. <br /> <br /> Nathalie Press, who was also so good in "Summer of Love" plays a key role in the redemption of Mr. Harvey, that could be played for the preaching of the movie-of-the-week, but touch, they turn to each other most unexpected way (unfortunately, I have seen their intense stage interrupted by commercials). <br /> <br /> While it's a bit heavy-handed several times pointedly calling this trip "pilgrimage," the silent film was the best evocation of "good will toward men" than I've seen in most holiday-TV movies.
