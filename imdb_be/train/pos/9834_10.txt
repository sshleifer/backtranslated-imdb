Yes, of course, it's cheesy, it's not a zombie, but it's not so bad. It has a ring of Beatrice, a huge bonus, and it's interesting. I had the good fortune to meet FULCI later in his career, and he remained philosophical experience, as he was never fully satisfied. It is well worth looking for, especially for fans of the genre and Fulci. This is a film that is too often dismissed out of hand.
