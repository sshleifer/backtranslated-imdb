Firstly, I'm not some sort of Justin Timberlake Fangirl obsessed with making it look good, in fact I am not even a big fan of Justin, but I like this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm working on a video store, and when I saw this film with a great cast that I've never even heard of, I had to see what it was. I have not found a valid Justin, what's bad, it was clearly the worst of the group, but it is quite a large group, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott to be two names that do not even make the first list of credits. The story is basic, journalists identify corrupt cops, but I found it to be well done. symbol L L Cool J was clearly against it, but I honestly did not know what he will do in the end. Morgan Freeman, as always, the wise teacher figure, he does so well, and just as I like Kevin Spacey, it was kind of just there. His character was not a whole lot of substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can not do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I thought that Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as the death of the police. Really true and accurate in nature, it is dotted with me a couple of times. <br /> <br /> I'm really expecting much to be honest cheesiness. Terrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, things like that, but it was surprisingly well done, and I have not found any of this. Each survey had a point, it was not formulaic, pretty tough actually. <br /> <br /> In general, an amazing cast, a decent plot that kept me interested and just enough action to make the jump me. I do not know why he has not appeared in cinemas, it was better than some garbage I've ever seen on the big screen. I'd say it's worth a look.
