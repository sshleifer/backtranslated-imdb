Oh, my God! Buttgereit masterpiece is one of the best films I've ever seen. Closer to Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard's films, this one is really worrying, but not nasty like Nekromantiks. All the little stories have a deep philosophical interest, and creative direction completely, despite the lack of money (see "bridge" sketch). Very highly recommended!
