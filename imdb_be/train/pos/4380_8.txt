This is very good, undervalued Action / Drama / History and a little film. <br /> <br /> The main story concerns borrowing Rob Roy at 1,000 pounds, it is stolen, and the problems that it causes his family and indirectly the members of the clan. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is awesome villain and character in the story. Brutally cold, and when you look at his face, he seems to be able to turn his eyes and looks quite bad. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is great too, but I think that the authors used the word "honor" one too many times. <br /> <br /> rest of the cast is strong, and the whole film is very well acted and shot. <br /> <br /> action exciting and sword game is very realistic, but not too bloody. The story is good, and you really want to win Rob. <br /> <br /> All total just shy of a classic.
