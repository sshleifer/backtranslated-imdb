This film is basically a documentary chronologically ordered series of events that took place from 10 April 2002 to 14 April 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. <br /> <br /> real pathos of the film and one feels the pain, sorrow and joy of people who lived through it has not turned out the coup of President Hugo Chavez. <br /> <br /> Odin comes from watching this film that Chavez is indeed a great historical person, the person of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela alone brought the people to overthrow the 3-day old military junta installed and restore the democratic institutions of Venezuela government. <br /> <br /> As you can see from the shot of the film, George W. Bush, with the support and instigation of the Venezuelan coup. The fact that the media aided and abetted George Bush is not surprising. <br /> <br /> What is surprising how few people have seen the film, and how little people understand the total corruption of America Media. <br /> <br /> It took only 20 years, Ronald Reagan Fairness Doctrine liquidation in 1986, to turn America into a blind and rudderless state. <br /> <br /> May, Hugo Chavez opened the eyes of patriotic Americans to the truth and beauty of the true American vision.
