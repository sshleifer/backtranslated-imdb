Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, although it later recalls in turn Rainman, is a kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. In the image of the symbol of New York, only the image Daniel Day Lewis, Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and a day does not give his character an emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. <br /> <br /> This is typical of the way Hoffman acting, actor, we tend to identify most of Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of cinema in the game from the people around him, so that he raises his performances significantly above the normal level. <br /> <br /> The tank Vojta so naive that he would sail from the film as a whole, except that Ratso pulls it down - pulling it down, but also to teach him a lot about how to survive and, more it is important, how to live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy movie about escape, which turns into a film about finding yourself. I think that, as a rough movie like this, it has a very beautiful message, that no matter how much a loser you might be (RATS clearly defines the "loser"), if you can find a way to be true to yourself, you in possession of the secrets of life, and you might even be able to share this understanding with someone else. <br /> <br /> I can not help but compare the Midnight Cowboy with Klute, a few years later, I think it's more like a movie about finding oneself, which turns into a film about the escape.
