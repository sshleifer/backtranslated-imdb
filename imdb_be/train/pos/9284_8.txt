The film is described as a comedy, but it's not a comedy at all. As with any film Panahi, it was very realistic drama that shows a common thread of social injustice and hypocrisy. But it was very funny; much easier than the director's dark and serious Circle (my favorite Iranian film). Agility girls and banter between them and the soldiers were, and quite plausibly (as if it were a documentary) and totally fun. <br /> <br /> match the actual filming and the effects were amazing. He added a lot of realism as Kenny Australia, of course, a very different film. <br /> <br /> performance from all non-professional actors ?? Soldiers and girls ?? It was very reliable. It was very touching to see the passion, frustration and excitement of these girls. Anyone in this country who think that Muslim girls to wear the veil any different from their own daughters should go see this movie ?? it will be a real discovery. <br /> <br /> For me, the soldiers represented the current paradigm. They started with a stock standard official policy response to all the girls. In the course of the film, they have found it harder and harder to maintain this position. If that seems to be that all of Tehran erupts in wild celebration, everyone is caught in it, and the absurdity of the current policy is obvious to everyone. <br /> <br /> It was a very touching and unexpected ending, and gave the film a very good mixture of emotions, frivolity, drama and social commentary. Although this adult movie, I think that older children thinking about seven years would really appreciate this film (by that time, as they can read subtitles). <br /> <br /> It is noteworthy that the repressive country like Iran is capable of producing films of this quality from the likes of Panahi and Kiarostami. Perhaps there restrictions forced the director is extremely resourceful. Australian (and other) filmmakers could take a leaf out of their book.
