Those who have never seen anything like the action scenes in the Matrix never seen this movie. The fight scenes were choreographed action scenes psychopath Yuen Woo Ping, who also did the fighting in the matrix. And the battle scene Somethin. <br /> <br /> Lee plays a super-soldier, who did not feel any pain, who now lives life as a pacifist librarian (I got me). If other evil super soldiers begin to kill the local drug lords, to take over the drug trade, Li combined with his cop friend to help stop them. <br /> <br /> There are some completely crazy things that happen in this film (one Badguy gets his hand cut off with a pane of glass, and almost does not notice). The fighting scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches; the body count of the way there. Or rarely been better, and he surrounded himself with beautiful women flock Kostars (Yip kicks serious ass some, as a fellow super soldiers). Anthony Wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord (whether there are surprises, he makes a cameo appearance in every film HK). It is unfortunate that they do not make fighters like this in the United States; I should not have to sit through all these terrible working dubbing room to see what effect that I crave so much. Recommended.
