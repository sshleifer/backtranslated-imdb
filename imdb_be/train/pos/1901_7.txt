It's hard to put your finger on it. In principle, I think it is a comedy about the idle rich drunk who falls in love with (relatively) poor girl he wants to marry the risk of being thrown back his family. <br /> <br /> It has funny moments, romantic moments and touching moments. Dudley Moore funny and somehow makes it a self-centered character endearing, Liza Minnelli is a convincing foil as a malignant contrast he draws, but John Gielgud steals the show as the wonderfully sarcastic butler Arthur. <br /> <br /> It is trite but a lot of fun with a memorable soundtrack, and ran for almost 3 months in our local wreck.
