I recognize that some jaded about the film genre a little child softening the hearts of his / her reluctant guardian. I've seen enough of them ?? Baby Boom, Nick, my boy, mostly Martha, and to some extent, Whale Rider ?? wait to get bored by the formula. What caught her attention was the King of Masks gloom setting: a small-town China in the 1930s. Extreme poverty is the norm, and the girls were considered so useless for poor parents, they killed them at birth or gave them away to anyone on the black market. If Wan discovers that his acquired grandson, whom he nicknamed "Dog" is a granddaughter, first, he throws it, despite the fact that she gave much hope, as the street-performing heir. Even after he reluctantly accepts her back, he was not too upset when she was kidnapped. The film is then rough, showing the length to which the young street smart girl was going to survive in this society. <br /> <br /> The two lead performances plausible and alluring in their social context. In Western society, one would have expected at least a hint of resentment from Van at not having achieved a significant success. Van so carefully takes his station as a famous artist with a lower status of society, though, that I did, too. While the dog demonstrates the level of precocity and tricks that would have suspected a modern suburban baby, it is quite plausible in the context of the child is always in survival mode in a society that treats the poor girl, like garbage. And to learn that her seven previous owners physically and mentally abused her, her fierce passion for Van makes sense. <br /> <br /> look at small town life in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two lead actors, surprising plot twists, and, of course, contribute to the resolution of touching a very watchable film.
