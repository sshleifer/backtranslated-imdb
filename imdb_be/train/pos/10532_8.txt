Make the world go away. Get it off my shoulder. Say what you used to say, and make the world go away. <br /> <br /> Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in a deplorable state, one for embezzlement, and another for kissing a child. Neither was to blame, but faced with the charges and their house is going to be demolished, they were in, well, nothing. The whole world, except for the house was gone. <br /> <br /> It's a bit strange, but funny, too. Just what would you do if you were alone in the world? Two friends just to enjoy each other's company, and to do what they want. But that gets old fast, as it seems. <br /> <br /> Then they begin to improve their life hating memories away. Sound effects at the same time were great. <br /> <br /> Speech really got weird at the end. This film was a product of a lot of imagination, and written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, with two stars. It simply must be seen.
