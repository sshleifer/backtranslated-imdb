The first time I saw this episode was like a shock for me, it was actually the first time I saw "24". The speed thing happens enough, and it's so strange, exciting, and even more interesting, it's almost as if you are reading a book; once you start it, it's very difficult to stop. From the moment Richard Walsh spoke privately Jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside the CTU, I was 6:40 hours, which is 10 episodes !!! (Sounds ridiculous and absurd, but I'm the kind of guy who, if he is interested, he just can not stop) This series is one of the best of its kind. And it's built in such a way to have a few different stories that are connected with each other. Recommended in all respects!
