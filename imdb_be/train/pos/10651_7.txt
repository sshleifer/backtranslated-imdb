Some movies simply should not be altered. This is one of them. This in itself is not a bad film. But it can not capture the taste and Terror 1963 movie of the same name. Liam Neeson was very rich, he is always there, and most of the cast holds, except for Owen Wilson, who just did not feel right to bring the character of Luke. But the main mistake in this version is that it has strayed too far from the story by Shirley Jackson in his attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of early film to compromise for attractive visual effects. Again I will say, that in itself is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the misunderstandings of terror in the old version so much more.
