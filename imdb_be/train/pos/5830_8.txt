Boys working outside the recording studio, when they hear the "voice of an angel." That would be Miss Van Doren, listening and going by the name of Miss Andrews, because her father did not approve of her being "a radio singer." Nevertheless, it is hoped that some big-wig, Mrs. Bixby, her dad one will hire her, and then he will have to give its consent. <br /> <br /> It takes but a few minutes the boys run rampant in the studio and causing havoc with other musicians, to kill them after they destroy the recording session. Finally everything calms down. "Uh, we have shied away from them," Mo said. "Yes, we are gone, too," replies curled. <br /> <br /> The children then fool around in the studio, put on the record Ms. Van Doren and curled dresses in women's clothes and pretends that he sings. Mrs. Bixby walks, printed and hires «Seniorita Cucacha» on the spot! For an additional $ 500, she asked me to come and sing on their secular party that night. The rest, as they say, is history as Curly pretending opera singer with some amusing results. Oh, by the way, he is accompanied by a "senior Mucho» and «Senior Gusto.» <br /> <br /> What is happening in the party simply that the truth wins, but not before a few slapstick antics take place. The overall, a very good episode. I enjoyed it, but would not have praised him as nothing special.
