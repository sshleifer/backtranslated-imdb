Saw it today, my 8-year-old. I thought it was cute. I agree with another poster that it was not anything like the book that I remember, but we still enjoyed it. All children are pretty good and generally quite interesting. Billy's a new kid who takes bold schoolyard bully to eat 10 worms per day. If he loses, he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his trousers. The beginning of the film is set to show that Billy has a very weak stomach, and vomits almost everything. Hilarity comes with a bunch of different ways to cook worms. Good communication about standing bully and, of course, with a juicy happy ending.
