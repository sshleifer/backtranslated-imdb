I looked nya-aired episodes online, and I was so sad that the show will not be back. It was the best throw mature, talented actors and the strange chemistry. It seemed that all the actors are personal friends in real life. Toward the end of the show was an attractive, sexy and very watchable. Of course, some of the plot lines are not realistic, so that ... all the characters are cute, and you root for them. The show reminded me of a cross between two other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity." Big kudos to all the actors. Note the ABC Execs: Nielsen ratings reports do not show you real results. Show the audience mainly to save it. I was very disappointed with the major networks for pouring us a reality show or a teen-oriented show. Why get a mature, thoughtful, well-worked material, we have to go on HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for the delivery of the remaining episodes on the internet. New media stream will gain more and more popularity among viewers.
