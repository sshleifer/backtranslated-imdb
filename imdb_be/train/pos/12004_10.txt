This film is a real and historical film. This is very useful for those who study the LDS Church, because it is 100% true. This is a great movie and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is a very informative, interesting and motivational. There are some who believe that this is not the actual, but it is. <br /> <br /> This is the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Prophet, Joseph Smith, who restored it. He has such an event in his life, as the illness that he had when he was a young boy, his courtship of Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife gives birth, and so on. But most importantly, that the testimony of the restored church.
