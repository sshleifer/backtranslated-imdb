I really liked this movie. I am a father and daughter for 17 years, which is reasonable, athletic and talented. I want my girl to apply themselves so well to solve crimes and to help others! So for me, maybe it's PG level Fantasyland. I read a lot of Nancy Drew books as a teenager, long, long ago. Of course, this character could play Emma Roberts, but not like the Nancy Drew I remember from the books. This is due to the script, not the action. <br /> <br /> Emma is an adorable teen playing confident, hardworking and proud character with good manners and good taste. She was not caught up in the competitive luxury around her. There are some flaws in the plot, away from the sun reminiscent of Nancy Drew books and trying to figure out what decade we're in. (For example, the fact that the CAR, in the end?) <br /> <br /> I read a review before the IMDb movie watching, as I researched Rachael Leigh Cook from other films. This is not one of her best roles, but I will continue to look for more of his films. Rachael was too old to play in this initiative, but it does an excellent job as an adult orphan central mystery. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed in the other reviews written here. Some are waiting for the perfect connection with books, some of them expect a more robust situation or adult thriller. I got what I expected! Good fun well focused on young teenage girls and their parents, who want good children to high standards of behavior and achievement. This teenager PG film, James Bond! What would you like to role model for your teen daughter?
