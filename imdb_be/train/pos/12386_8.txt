"" The Guardian, "" one of the best horror films have already been made in the film industry! I think it is very scary, like very few movies actually. Alison Parker model with some known. It belongs to a lawyer named Michael Lerman, and has as a best friend, another model called Jennifer. Everything was fine in her life, until she decides to live alone for some time, and rents and beautiful old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is its neighbors, which is very, very strange. Alison suddenly begins to have health problems and fainting with frequency; She also remembers some painful facts of her past that makes her nightmares or illusions. But everything has a cause, and it has to do with the new house, she lives ... <br /> <br /> I personally believe, "" The Guardian, "" very awful film, and together with the «» The Exorcist "» they It is one of the worst movies I have watched. When we discover that Allison house is occupied only the pope and myself in May froze the blood! It is also terrible to see, that it should become blind at the end of the film to be a new guard to keep the monsters from our world.
