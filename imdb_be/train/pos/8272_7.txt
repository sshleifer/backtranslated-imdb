Family (mother, Patricia Clarkson, the father of Jake Weber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) to go for a family get together in some remote house in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit a deer during the reign there. This angers some of the locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things are slowly (very slowly) wrong <br /> <br /> I was expecting the worst when I started watching it .. mostly agree that, at this site, with are extremely negative. Well ... I do not agree. Firstly, it's not a horror movie. Horror does not even begin until the closing 30 minutes. It plays more like a family drama with horror elements added at this level, it's pretty darn good <br /> <br /> First of all - the bad stuff: .. The pace is too slow; Jake Weber terrible actor; WAY too many false dream sequence deterred; Wendigo little appears in the film, and a clear picture, we get out at the end of a fun Wendigo <br /> <br /> good stuff :. Pretty good drama script; Clarkson beautiful as her mother; some great direction with terrible sound effects are a bit scary; pretty obvious hot sex sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is actually necessary for the integrity of the story!); . Very good acting Sullivan (! Only 10 at the time) and Speredakos and totally unexpected tragic denouement <br /> <br /> I think that many people are frustrated with this film, because it is being pushed as a horror film - which is not the case . Thus, if you can ignore it, I think you might like it. I give it a 7.
