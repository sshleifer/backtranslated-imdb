This is one of the funniest series ever! I laughed until my sides split and rolled on the floor. If someone released in America. Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please. <br /> <br /> I know what is available in the UK, but it is an area 2 and PAL, except! Let's give this series a shake of her. America needs to know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved the brisk, silly role of Tracy Bennett in this. Of course, I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracy was the treasure <br /> <br /> The release of this show in America! or Show again on PBS stations. I need to laugh and laugh again! Please caresses me, please! Please! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
