At first, I bough this film on VHS, which I had to buy it on DVD, this is my favorite movies of all time. I have read this book, but I do think the film is much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley was a great chose. It was wonderful! <br /> <br /> It's 10/10 film !!! <br /> <br />
