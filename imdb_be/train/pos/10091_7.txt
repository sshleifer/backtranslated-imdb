I watched "Elephant Walk" for the first time in 30 years, and was struck by how similar storyline in a much superior "Rebecca." As already said, you have a sweet young thing wiped her feet on the stage magic and thoughtful landlord, only to find her marriage threatens imminent memory larger than life more deeply erroneous relative. Do you have a strict and disapproving servant crisis, which will either tie the couple together or tear them apart irreparably, the apogee of the fiery destruction of the lavish estate. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "Elephant Walk", also required some of its eerie atmosphere of the jungle "letters" love triangle Bette Davis set on a rubber plantation in Singapore instead Lanka tea plantation. <br /> <br /> Maltin gives «Elephant Walk» only two stars and IMDb readers do not much kinder, but I liked it, despite the predictability. Elizabeth Taylor has never looked prettier, and Peter Finch does a credible job as a basically good person is not able to get rid of the influence of his domineering father. Dana Andrews - a favorite in the "Laura" and "The best year of our lives" - in vain, as the frustrated suitor of Elizabeth. The real star of the bungalow, one of the most beautiful interior sets in the history of cinema.
