How to talk radio, the booth is actually a kind of predictable (TALK RADIO, because we know the truth about what happened to be going, because let's face OF-IT- genre and basic installation). This is not necessarily a bad thing in this case. This means that, in fact, that the filmmakers did not punk, in the end, they may already have, say, an American version of this story. Booth moves inexorably to its (lost) conclusions, but so beautifully made at each level that you can enjoy your trip, as would be familiar to cruise on well-traveled section (very scenic) way. It reminds me of a terrible short story by Harlan Ellison, FLOP sweat. Claustrophobia, sometimes almost palpable. It is worth a good long look.
