Booth puts a whole new twist on your typical movie J-horror. This film puts you in the shoes of the hero of the story. The director wants to see what the protagonist sees and thinks. <br /> <br /> Stories about the perception of those who work, live and love our hero, and he sees people who surround him in the outdated radio DJ booth. The story peels back the layers of the protagonist, like an onion in flash-backs, as the film goes on, and we learned from him that things are not always as it seems. The film was largely held in the studio of a small, old-fashioned radio with a very bad story where the protagonist was forced to broadcast his talk show, in connection with the radio station is in the process of re-positioning. It is with this limited space, that this film is a success and makes you feel very claustrophobic and paranoid. During our hero can not identify the strange events in the old studios have been caused by a ghost or some conspiracy of his staff, or it was all in his head. What I like about this movie is that the filmmakers make you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as the hero did. This film is very clever, to perform a fairly short 76 minutes movie.
