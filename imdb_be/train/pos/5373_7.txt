Maybe not the absolute greatest element in the Hammer House of Horror series, but it is definitely wins the award for the most imaginative title of the episode! "The House That Bled to Death" ?? I could scream all day that title never get tired of it! And it's a nice title, this short film are also benefice with solidly written script and some really stressful time. This may require additional inspection before fully understand the original final turn, but it's certainly an original idea for the short-circuit of horror. The story begins with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle-class home. Sadistic husband kills his wife and a few years later "curse" the house is sold again. A young couple and their daughter cherubic move and begin to restore it, but mysterious events occur and affect especially the young Sophie. Her favorite cat kills even her birthday gets ruined when one of the pipes in the house suddenly sprinkles the blood of all the guests (especially frightening sequences, this one!). Are the ghosts of the old house? Or maybe the neighbors decently useful cause the horror? Answers to these questions are contained in the original and rather unpredictable climax, and there is even a room of the shock at the end. Tensions artfully constructed and cover the house is filled with terrible landscape, like a couple of rusty machete used by the husband to kill his wife. Little warning though, the sequence of the cat is difficult to see, if you are an animal lover. Finally, another winner for the TV series of short runs Hammer!
