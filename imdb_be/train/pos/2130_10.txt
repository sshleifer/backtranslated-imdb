A great movie, filled with great understated performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue. What really distinguishes this film, however, is that the deaf sorrow everywhere. History underline things, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, fear of job loss, alone in the world, where it has had disastrous consequences. Most of all it was set in a world that no longer exists, having been torn in the beginning of the Second World War. In fact, the film is almost a comedy at all, if we compare the percentage of serious scenes with comic scenes. But it's funny - to listen to harsh dismissal, Margaret Sullivan, Jimmy Stewart and watch his expression of repentance, he replies that her comments were an excellent combination "of poetry and meanness." It's funny, pointed, and sad at the same time. A great achievement and one of the ten largest screen comedies ever made.
