"Before the devil knows you're dead," it is one of the best films I've seen in <br /> <br /> long time. Acting with <br /> <br /> outstanding ensemble cast is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman investing in excellent performance and electrifies every time he is on the screen. Ethan Hawke corresponding scene by scene, and Albert Finney just chews the screen. Marisa Tomei, however, <br /> <br /> criminal underloaded, but looks amazing for its 42 years. The script is excellent, non-linear storyline, but easy enough to follow. Sidney Lumet, although not known for its blockbuster, turned out a gem with this!
