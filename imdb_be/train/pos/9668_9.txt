This short film, several characters, theatrical.And until he says something about Ireland that you will not find elsewhere.This film IS Ireland. In general, this grubiness, this sadness, this is one delusion.The Boys, master Doyle, SP O'Donell, Cannon, daughter of a senator arc in Gard primarily Madge.I knows them.I'm in the pub with them or on his knees to pray with them. They are our sad story, and they are our present.
