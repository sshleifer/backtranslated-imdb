Anyone who says that Pokémon is stupid can die. This film is beautiful. I even shead tears when Celebei died. I do not cry a lot! This film is a moving animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In the fourth installment of Pokémon, Ash and friends must stop the poor from making a breakthrough Celebei ultimate evil weapon with its dark orb. While Sam and Celebei travel back in time and constantly hunted game hunters. Like part of a double fight and Sam has APRICORN pokeball (if you play the Pokémon Gold, Silver, or Crystal, you know what it is). <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed having Miramax, instead responsible for Warner Brothers. Entering a mini-movie, at the end was a great idea. Pokemon in this film come to life more than ever.
