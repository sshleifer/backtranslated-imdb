I saw it as a naive young punk when it was first released. If I cried like a baby as I left the theater, trying not to allow anyone to see. So when I saw it again now in '07, I knew what to expect and sobs were prepared and primed as they approach the right time. Fortunately, this time I was home. <br /> <br /> What I remembered from my youth viewing- or may not have noticed because it was the technical brilliance of this movie. Using flashbacks that tell so many stories without dialogue. The camera work, which seemed to put the viewer, along with the characters in the scene. Think about opening when Joe crossed the street to the diner, the camera pans over the woman and child sitting on a bench in the foreground, the surrounding street scene. <br /> <br /> The story itself, and the characters - shabby, sad and brutally real. It is very touching to be drawn so close to the human drama, such as it is with people, most of us, most likely, will not accept. Again, Joe and Ratso could be any of us. Must be '70, when I saw him. I remember that when leaving the theater I was prompted to find a group of friends. All these years later, I'm glad I'm not alone today. This is one hell of a great movie.
