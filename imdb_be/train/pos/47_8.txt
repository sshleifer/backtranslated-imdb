It breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be. it is very underrated. people forget that the movie is really about, now they only think about Bum Bum films, which can be quite fun to watch with popcorn and friends as transformers, films that are targeted, hyper-mega-high budget, 300 million or even higher, only on special effects and silent films without a plot. Its the kind of film that I, in spite of the majority. Of course, it's fun to look much done CGI scripts, but we did not get anything substantial from such films. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that the performance was excellent. Especially Busy Philipps, along with Erik Christensen and Victor Garber (which I respect) made this film worth an Oscar. Emotional speech Busy Philipps was amazing, it's such a shame, we will not see Oscar in hand, she deserves it.
