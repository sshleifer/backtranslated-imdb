Great pirate fun! It has all the good ingredients to keep your attention - an absorbing tale of intrigue, fiery lady pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara), which attracted the irresistible Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn), who on his own secret mission. They make a lovely romantic couple on screen - sigh <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn average, bad pirate weaving his criminal web of divide and conquer. I noticed that a very familiar face Netvika plays a supporting role Mrs McGregor, a young quarterback princess Patma (Alice Kelley). <br /> <br /> There's a beautifully shot scenery coastlines, the courts, and the bay, too many action ball clashes, naval battles, daring jumps Errol Flynn (Robin Hood on board!). With fiery red I myself once heard in an interview with Maureen O'Hara, that it boasted a large team whip, and can surpass Flynn balls in those days, but there would be no need to put it to the test here. <br /> <br /> A very enjoyable film.
