When I learned of the death of Sir Alec Guinness, it was the first of many of his films I was thinking of re-vision. What a wonderful wonderful comment film provides even after all these years. And Guinness helps weave a charm in each frame. His eyes and face, as light as the white suit he wears. Both he and the film should be considered during the life of pets.
