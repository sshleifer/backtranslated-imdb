This amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the life of courageous women in Cameroon in court sistema-- Policewomen, lawyers and judges. Despite the huge difficulties-- lack of funds, the desperate poverty of people, multiple languages ​​and multiple legal precedents, depending on the region and the religious / ethnic origin plaintiffs and defendants-- these brave, strong women making a difference. <br /> <br /> This is a rare thing-- really inspiring film that restores a little faith in humanity. Despite the atrocities that we see in the movie, justice really gets served by these hot, hard-working women. <br /> <br /> I just hope this film gets a wide release in the US. The more people who see this film, the better.
