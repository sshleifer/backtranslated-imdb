Thomas Ince has always been able to bring the simple homespun stories to life with fullness and flair. "Italian" is such a film. Tough action, especially George Beba, the father of the child is silent actor George Beba, Jr., and beautiful sets convey a realistic sense of the early position of immigrants in New York. They give this film the authenticity of the 1915, which is unusual in the peculiarities of this crop. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the modern day and a man (George Beba in modern dress) read the story of an Italian immigrant, and then we go down in history with George playing the immigrant. He raises enough money to bring his bride from Italy to America, marries her, and has a son with her. But times are hard and the family struggles to survive. I wondered why the mother does not breastfeed her baby, and to avoid complications with the dirty formula, but oh well, even in the beginning of the dream factory was pushing politically correct behavior for women in 1915! <br /> <br /> the best scene in the film when Beban have a chance to avenge the crime boss, who suddenly put him in prison, and in the last minute he decided against his planned course of action. Very neat. I loved the curtain effect, it was great. Wonderful use of lighting in this film. <br /> <br /> I give "The Italian" 8 out of 10.
