A critical and financial failure if the first release, critics have turned around and said that this film with director Eason better. A La Ronde, as the feeling of the film is rapidly developing as the guys from detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) persue, get in and out of love with some of the most unusual and beautiful women seen in the film (Audrey Hepburn, Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Most of the script was by-libbed or rewritten in the shooting day, which gives the film a fresh look. An Gazzara as the principal investigator persuing Audrey Hepburn after falling singer Colin Camp and seeing the driver's cab side Patti Hansen. John Ritter ineptly worth Dorothy Stratten and immediately falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has a few girls chasing it (including Joyce Heyzer and Elizabeth Pe√±a). This film has excellent performance in supurb actors. Standouts are the Audrey Hepburn (she has no lines in the first half of the film). Ben Gazzara never been better (and inspiring choice for a romantic lead) and Colleen Camp is one of her best roles as manic country singer Christy Miller. It is a delight to watch as she shoots her in the line of a rat-tat-Tate delivery. It is highly recommended! ********* stars!
