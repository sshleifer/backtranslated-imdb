Remember Bakshi? The guy who was an animator on Terrytoons, and then Paramount Cartoon Studios, after that, he was director of Fritz Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic? Well, it Coonskin. And it's actually very good. Racist, but it's good. The film takes place in Harlem Nights (No, the spirit is the working title.), But with a twist, which is a lampoon of the Disney film, Song. <br /> <br /> This is the South of Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordon) rush to help his friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but stopped at the checkpoint and the wind in the crossfire with the police. While waiting for them, Randy reluctantly listens to a small runaway dads (Scatman Crothers), as he begins to tell the story of Randy "three guys, I know how you and your friends." History Papp told in animation on the background of live action photography background and frames. <br /> <br /> Brer Rabbit (voice of Thomas), Brother Bear (White voice), and Preacher Fox (voice Gordone) decides to leave the bag and its southern setting after bank mortgages his house and sells it to the person who makes it a brothel. Arrival in Harlem, Rabbit, Bear and Fox believe that this is not all it's made out to be. They face swindlers named Simple Savior fake revolutionary leader, who claims to be a "cousin" Black Jesus, and that he gives to his followers, "the power to kill the whites." The flashy stage in his "church", the Savior playing as a character brutalized black oppression ?? portrayals John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon before asking their faithful to "donations." <br /> <br /> Rabbit first goes against Madigan, an evil racist and homophobic white police officer and a man bag mafia, which shows his contempt for the Afra-Americans in a variety of forms, including the refusal to bathe in front of the intended meeting with them (he believes that they are not worth it). If Madigan knows that the Rabbit takes its payment, he and his cohorts, Ruby and Bobby, which led to a night club called «Cottontail». <br /> <br /> Black stripper distracts him, and with LSD sugar cubes dipped into your drink. Madigan, while under the influence of his drink spiked, and then maneuver into a sexual relationship with a stereotypically effeminate gay man, and then pushed into a garment that women were representative of racist archetypes, dressed in something racist, and, finally, let the back of the club, where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby's dead. <br /> <br /> Then, recovering from delirium while intoxicated, fired a gun around randomly, and shot by police after shooting one with him. <br /> <br /> Rabbit, Bear, Fox, and the opponent boxer peak of the boxing scene as it explodes. The history of live-action ends Randy and dads escape during the shooting in a variety of white cops, but managing to make it out alive. <br /> <br /> This movie was controversial at the time of release, and was re-edited several times the director called, street fight, which is obvious as Street Fight is a 2005 documentary film about racism in the streets. In fact, this film is one and the same thing as a documentary. <br /> <br /> This has Bryanston Pictures, the distributor of the film and the original Tobe Hopper classic, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to go out of business. Because Paramount wants to produce and distribute the film, but due to racism, Bryanston set up production in Bakshi. <br /> <br /> Despite the controversy, it was worth the entertainment. Animation was strange at the time, the story makes sense, and it's really funny, too <br /> <br /> The verdict :. 9/10
