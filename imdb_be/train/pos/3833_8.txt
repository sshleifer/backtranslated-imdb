I can not believe that others have taken a serious view of it all. God, it was a lot of fun for the introduction of Hop-a-long Cassidy. It was a great tribute to the western TV series years ago. It should not be a big movie experience, with the exception of what has been. So, if there were no big special effects bonanza. It was fun, tongue in cheek look at the old Western. Man, relax and enjoy.
