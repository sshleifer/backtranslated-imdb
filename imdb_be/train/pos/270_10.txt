I must say, for Seventeen and Missing much better than I expected. Perception I got from the preview, it would be simply banal, but I was pleasantly surprised by this impressive mystery. <br /> <br /> Dedee Pfeiffer is Emily's mother, who insists her daughter, Lori (Tegan Moss), did not attend the so-called prom one weeknight, but Laurie ignores the wishes of his mother and takes off to party in anyway. If Lori does not come home, Emily knows that something is wrong, and she begins to have visions of his daughter and the events that led to its extinction. <br /> <br /> Seventeen & no better than in many other TV movies this type, because it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer reason to see this movie, and most of them comes off as believable. It LMN original movie premiere last night. 10/10
