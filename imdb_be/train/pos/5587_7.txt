First, let's get a "buzz" with way.Hedy Lamarr was considered one of the most beautiful women and the cinema was an ideal way for many to see its beauty on screen.Here we Hedi as a young fresh -faced 20 years, speaking in his native Austrian .I recently purchased the 1990 version of this obscene 1932/3 classic.Yes we see a close-up of short Hedite naked from the waist up, but at least she was filming in swimming and a quick horse nude scene, the director uses Mahato coating industries, reflected in puddles, medium and long shots to show her the way, in this sign tai stage; so no idea there any lascivious close the window or clinches.Her friend Pierre Nai keeps his clothes on all times.Yes, quite bold for its time, but as it looks now innocous 2003 through the eyes. <br /> <br /> Like other scientists reviews stated, this film should look at imagary, expressionist and allegorical statement he makes with the image of drops of water that forms on the surface of the water ripples womb, agricultural machinery, scenery, etc. sweet string sound work for the majority of the length of the "Extase" and the film "feel" the transition between silent and sound in his direction and concept.The script is very minimalist and economical history of being mainly transmitted through the person and bodily gestures, a few words of German, spoken by actors with English subtitles beneath.Even these few words, it seems almost superflous generally lyrical vein that runs through the film. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this is the story of a young girl on the CN marries a much older man (for some reason we have never said and that Eve sees it anyway? Money?), which is then captured in unconsumated and who does not He loves marriage.She then returned to his father, leaving her husband and her father to lie to his son in law.After ride on his horse Eva decides to take a dip in the fan and loads her clothes on her horse saddle.However her horse she gets romantic notions and jumps, to greet him stablemate.Hedy rushes from the lake naked, and tries to recover her set, but the engineer on work sees and gets the horse and then looks around his owner.And so novel born.Her husband sees that his opponent must win Eve, then he decides to shoot but I thought it was quite illogical, and its main weakness taking into account its previous relationship without love with Eve. <br /> <br /> Despite the name of the 1990 re-release on VHS, sound to be 70 years old, is a bit bland and the background wheezing, according to the films of his age.After a period of mourning, our handsome guy, obviously, and in love with Eva, he is her mother as a child, so we have to assume that they live happily after.Just imagary let wash over you and disappoint your mind in the movie style, even in the late 1930s vintage.This lyrical part which can be enyoyed for its own sake, not just for its eye catching title.I gave 7/10.
