Terry Gilliam gives a stunning film that I thoroughly enjoyed. Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the appearance of a small Christover Plummer makes the film is absolutely brilliant! This is the only film I saw Terry Gilliam, and Twelve Monkeys is definitely in my top 10. I think that this is one of the four best films of Bruce Willis; Brad Pitt and better. Brad Pitt delivers excellent performance. Perhaps one of the ten best performance of the actor, that I have ever seen. He played a role (Geoffrey) is very convincing. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also very convincing. And Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt acted extremely well. With a brilliant story to support the great performances; and to support this, an excellent director Terry Gilliam.
