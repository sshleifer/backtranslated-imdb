"Masks" is a moving film that works on many levels. In the simplest case, this obsession with the story of street artist who bond with a small child, trying to convey his art (masks) to the next generation. Although, sometimes the story makes the old man in the job, he is so well processed (written which acted, directed, excellent production values), it is easy to go beyond their plight. And if you hang with him, the film is ultimately a very sweet and uplifting. Kudos all around. This is a great film for children as well as adults. The trick is how to get the Americans who can not, as a foreign language films to see it!
