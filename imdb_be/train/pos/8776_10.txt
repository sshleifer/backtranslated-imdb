Just to mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the assessments that make it among the greatest outings Errol Flynn in his career large picnics. I think this role is played by boxer Jim Corbett is more like his real personality than the thugs he printed material like. Flynn seemed a creature from his memories and was one guy, whose real life was more interesting than his screen life. Extra thing I would note is seen large installation, transitions, and still puts that punctuate the film. Although the director was Raoul Walsh often collaborated with Flinnomom with filmmaker Sid Hickox, the installation have been drawn up and coming rising editor named Don Siegel. I never know what to Sigel went so far back, but he's listed in the credits directly. It will go to a great career as director of Action itself.
