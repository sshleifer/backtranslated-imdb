The opening night Vanties woman found dead on a catwalk above the stage. As shown by the police continues to try to piece together who killed who and why before the final curtain. <br /> <br /> I have always heard that it was a great classical comedy secret, so I was excited to find a copy. Unfortunately, no one told me about the musical numbers that go on and on and on. Although these figures are, of course, the kind that Hollywood did in their glory days, they are intrusive because they pretty much stop the movie dead, despite attempts to weave the action around them. It would not be so bad if the music was halfway decent, but it is not. There is only one good song. Worst of it, as if the studio knew they had a song, cocktails for two, and we have to endure four versions of this duo, a large number of products, but in the final vanity and in the background as incidental music. I do not think Spike Jones and his City Slickers ever played that much. The rest of the movie is pretty good with Victor McLaglen good sparring with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton very funny scene of him as an actor in love with wardrobe mistress. <br /> <br /> No matter, on average, I recommend that if you think you can get through the musical numbers, are ready to scan through them. Its funny movies like they do not make anymore.
