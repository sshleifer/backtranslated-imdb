As I said, with a lot of comments IMDb, some observers seem to require that every movie they see smug intellectual areas that are hanging in there own dexterity. I'm not one of these people. When I look at the gunman, I want to see explosions, gunshots and heroism. When I watch a comedy, I want to laugh the tears in my eyes. You get the idea. So watch a horror movie, I first of all want to be scared. Discontent is a very scary movie, a round is well satisfied "jump" stage, and this awful building. I was a fan of horror films for many years, and I'm talking about artists such as Dario Argento, and not some horror directors treadmill teenagers churned up these days. If you want to be scared to watch this movie. Way worse than the original Japanese "Ring" (which I also think it's a great movie).
