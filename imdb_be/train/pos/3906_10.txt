This should be funny stand comedy I have ever seen. Eddie Izzard is a genius, he takes to the British, the Americans and everything in between. His style is quite natural and quite cheerful. I doubt that someone could have sat through it and not laugh their a ** off. Watch, enjoy, this is ridiculous.
