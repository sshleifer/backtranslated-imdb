I see a series of back-to-back as quickly as possible. I'm trying to watch all the Star Trek stuff. This 3 month and now I'm on the TNG Season 3 and I have gone through DS9 in its entirety. Star Trek is the greatest television event ever achieve. <br /> <br /> Â«Shades of Gray" is the first recap episode of TNG series. Just I watched the show, these videos were fresh in my mind, but I noticed that a couple of them re-shot because the film looks better. Season 1 has always seemed real dark and ugly with me - and the actors look stupid, they do not fit into their own skin <br /> <br /> show mostly only to the greatest hits of the happiest. and sad moments in life Riker at the enterprise up until this point. Data and Riker scene in holo-deck classic moment of a new friendship. Another one of my favorite when the second officer on the ship Klingon power problem Riker as the first officer Riker and beat the living crap out of the Klingons. Then Admiral begins his A $$, but good. The whole episode is a reminder of the bracket that a lot of crazy, big things have happened in just two seasons with more than 5 to go and a few movies! At this point in the series, they really start to develop feelings that bind Riker like Diana Troy Imzadi. At this point, they have mentioned the fact, but they still do not use it. Let the record show that ST Wiki - Memory Alpha claims that Imzadi means "first" and indicates that she had an intimate relationship with Riker, and still close to the deep emotional. This episode is further proof that there will be intense romantic interest in each other for a long time <br /> <br /> Here's an article :. Http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi At this point in the series, the annual output is up to speed and Star Trek TNG settles in the sci-fi monster was destined to become. Watching it again as an adult, I see now, that provides great actors Star Trek universe. They really need to make a new ST exposed after all the current show. DS9 movie would be nice too.
