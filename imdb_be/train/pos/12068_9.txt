If you have any appreciation for the character and dialogue, as well as any sense of American cultural history, you will find a lot of very absorbent material in this film. It probably was originally to play and that is why it is a dialogue heavy, but I can not emphasize how those icons that we are only a shallow understanding of the made in a really complicated and strange character. <br /> <br /> This film better than any college course to tell you how to create a character-driven story. <br /> <br />
