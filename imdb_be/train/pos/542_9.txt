When I first learned that Brian Krause was going to be in this film, I wanted to watch. It took me several weeks to realize that I have seen the original of this and loved it. So I had even more reason to watch. Well, I looked. It was actually better than most of the sequels to films for television. I hate what's happening to the character of Brian (you can find for themselves), and I did not like most of the characters, one by Brian on. But the film need cheese and annoying characters and abrupt to make the Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine again. In the end, I was rooting for Stanley and his own happy ending. If you liked the original hut on the lake, or if you like horror movies without blood, I suggest you watch this.
