Some action was a little suspect. I remember that asswipe Alexander Walker (Evening Standard critic, never mind that he was already dead) launched into a talk about the movie, saying that it was a disgrace drawing NI Protestants killers. Currently, for all NI Protestants, this film was loosely based on the Shankill butchers (who were loyalists), and who roamed in Belfast in 1970. Believe me, they did not call for a pittance butchers. my main moan about this movie is it shows no ray of light and hope, it's not all doom and gloom, I mean really little girl in the end have to die. Maybe this sounds corny, but it could be taken the tact that not all Prods and tiags bad or completely good.
