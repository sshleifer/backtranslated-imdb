Overall, this movie was excellent for its time, and it will be interesting for many more generations. Although the plot is not 100% accurate to the book most things right. The film really miss far ahead and not miss some important details. I found the book, and is ready and regretted immediately that they made a movie (because I did not know about the film yet), but later I found the film in the transaction bin at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what I I expected. Overall I give this film 7 out of 10 for his good parts (relative accuracy and a general feeling of decisions) and for its bad parts (a great time jumping and a small but significant inaccuracies).
