It's an amazing movie about the archaeologist studying the culture of the ancient Indians HoHoKam. She takes (really fake looking) mummy from the burial caves and brings it home to study it. Well, pretty soon she starts behaving strangely and say this mummy. And soon after that her son is possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even the strange events occur, as a spirit, is trying to destroy a family woman. It's actually very sad, as a whole, and it will make you fall asleep the first few times you try to look at. But if you keep at it, you can just make it to the end. <br /> <br /> ahaha! What is the secret of the mummy? Is the spirit of the mummy is angry that he has been removed out of the cave? You may not be able to figure out that the spirit of motivation, but if you like the machinations of a ghost in the low-budget (and 70 hairstyles!) It will be comforting to have a certain appeal. <br /> <br /> as I described the story much more clearly than mixed, boring way the film is the story of. Can a boring film really exciting? Well ... somehow this one achieves this. Maybe it's a good movie on the heart, but it is made in a rather uncomfortable. I do not know. The fact that I know that I liked it quite a bit, in spite of his stupidity. <br /> <br /> The advocates of "Spider BabyÂ» will be interested to know that a few musical cues from the film used in this case, (including an instrumental version of the theme song). <br /> <br /> Thanks to a frightening and quite well done sequence, indicating obsessed with boulders and rocks, and ride by itself and eventually attacking some people in the camper. Other scenes in the movie is just a ghost or brisk; but this one scene is really very scary. <br /> <br /> Watch it! It's amazing and it's well worth your time. You might even be one on your shelf.
