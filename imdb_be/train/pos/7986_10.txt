This is a great, silent film. This is definitely the best I've seen, which reflects the current reality in Latin America ... kidnapping, corruption, ruthless and greedy police and heartless chaos against innocent victims. Denzel Washington gives a most moving performance of his career, in my opinion. Dakota Fanning strange young actress. Relations between Washington and Fanning beautifully written and portrayed, I believed every minute. The cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke great, as always. Walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor. I would love to see more of both of them. The present location is excellent. The camera work is interesting and different. There are many famous Latin actors in the cast, which makes it all the more interesting for people who are familiar with Latin American cinema. I highly recommend this film.
